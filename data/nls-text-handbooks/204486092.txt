Introduction
BRITAIN: AN official handbook, 1964, is the fifteenth in the
series prepared and extensively revised each year by the Reference Division
of the Central Office of Information with the co-operation of other Govern¬
ment departments and of many national organisations.
The handbook, which is the mainstay of the reference facilities provided
by the British Information Services in many countries, was at first only
available overseas in a limited free edition. In 1954 ^ was placed on sale
throughout the world and it has since become widely known as an established
work of reference.
This 1964 edition, which covers events up to September 1963, gives, like
its predecessors, a factual account of the administration and the national
economy of the United Kingdom. It describes the activities of many of the
national institutions, both official and unofficial, and shows the part played
by the Government in the life of the community.
The handbook does not claim to be comprehensive, nor does it attempt
to cover Britain’s participation in Commonwealth or world affairs. The
factual and statistical information it contains is compiled from official and
other authoritative sources, and, while most sections of the book relate to the
United Kingdom as a whole, facts and figures for England, Wales, Scotland,
and Northern Ireland are also given separately when relevant.
Readers who require more detailed information should consult the Annual
Abstract of Statistics and the Monthly Digest of Statistics, issued by the Central
Statistical Office, and also other Government publications and standard
works of reference, some of which are listed in the bibliography at the end
of the handbook. Readers are asked to note that the Central Office of
Information reference documents listed in the bibliography as free and
marked with an asterisk are available free of charge only at British Information
Offices overseas; they can, however, be obtained in the United Kingdom
from the Reference Division. Central Office of Information, on payment of
a small charge.

THE LAND AND THE
PEOPLE
THE PHYSICAL BACKGROUND
The British Isles form a group lying off the north-west coast of Europe with
a total area of about 121,600 square miles. The largest islands are Great
Britain proper (comprising the mainlands of England, Wales and Scotland)
and Ireland (comprising Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic). Off the
southern coast of England is the Isle of Wight and off the extreme south-west
are the Isles of Scilly; off North Wales is Anglesey. Western Scotland is
fringed by numerous islands and to the far north are the important groups
of the Orkneys and Shetlands. All these form administrative counties or parts
of counties of the mainland, but the Isle of Man in the Irish Sea and the
Channel Islands between Great Britain and France have a large measure of
administrative autonomy and are not part of England, Wales, Scotland or
Northern Ireland.
England (excluding the county of Monmouth on the Welsh border) has a
total area (including inland water) of 50,327 square miles and is divided into
40 geographical or 49 administrative counties; Wales (including Monmouth¬
shire), with a total area of 8,017 square miles, has 13 counties; Scotland,
including its 186 inhabited islands, has a total area of 30,411 square miles
and is divided into 33 counties; and Northern Ireland, consisting of six
counties, has a total area of 5,459 square miles. Together, these countries
constitute the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, with
a total area of 94,214 square miles. The total land area of the United Kingdom
(excluding inland water) is 93,018 square miles: England, 50,051; Wales and
Monmouthshire, 7,966; Scotland, 29,795; and Northern Ireland, 5,206 square
miles.
Care must be taken when studying British statistics to note whether they
refer to England as defined above, to England and Wales (considered together
for many administrative and other purposes), to Great Britain, which com¬
prises England, Wales and Scotland, or to the United Kingdom as a whole.
The position is further complicated by the fact that the county of Monmouth
is sometimes included with England. United Kingdom statistics and other
data sometimes include the Isle of Man, 227 square miles, and the Channel
Islands, 75 square miles, which are strictly not part of the United Kingdom
but are dependencies of the Crown. Since southern Ireland became indepen¬
dent, official statistics do not normally refer to the British Isles as a whole.
The latitude cf 50° North cuts across the southernmost part of the British
mainland (the Lizard Peninsula) and latitude 6o° North passes through the
Shetland Islands. The northernmost point of the Scottish mainland, Dunnet
Head, near John o’ Groats, is in latitude 58° 40'. The prime meridian of o°
passes through the old Observatory of Greenwich (London), while the
easternmost point of England is nearly i° 45' East and the westernmost
point of Ireland is approximately io° 30' West. It is just under 600 miles
in a straight line from the south coast of Britain to the extreme north and

rather over 300 miles across in the widest part. Owing to the numerous bays
and inlets no point in the British Isles is as much as 75 mdes from tidal water.
The seas surrounding the British Isles are everywhere shallow—usually less
than 50 fathoms (300 feet)—because the islands lie on the continental shelf.
To the north-west along the edge of the shelf the sea floor plunges abruptly
from 600 feet to 3,000 feet. These shallow waters are important because they
provide excellent fishing grounds as well as breeding grounds for the fish.
The North Atlantic Current, the drift of warm water which reaches the
islands from across the Atlantic, spreads out over the shelf and its ameliorating
effect on the air is thus magnified. The effect of tidal movement is also
increased by the shallowness of the water.
Despite their small area, the British Isles contain rocks of all the main
geological periods. In Great Britain the newer rocks, which are less resistant
to weather and have thus been worn down to form low land, lie to the south
and east, and the island can therefore be divided roughly into two main
regions, Lowland Britain and Highland Britain.
In Lowland Britain the newer and softer rocks of southern and eastern
England have been eroded into a rich plain, more often rolling than flat and
rising to chalk and limestone hills, but hardly ever reaching a thousand feet
above sea level. The boundaries of this region run roughly from the mouth
of the Tyne in the north-east of England to the mouth of the Exe in the
south-west.
Highland Britain comprises the whole of Scotland (including the hills and
moors of southern Scotland as well as the mountains of the Scottish Highlands,
which extend from the Forth-Clyde valley to the extreme north-west), the
Lake District in north-west England, the broad central upland known as the
Pennines, almost the whole of Wales, and the south-western peninsula of
England coinciding approximately with the counties of Devon and Cornwall.
Highland Britain contains all the mountainous parts1 of Great Britain and
extensive uplands lying above one thousand feet. This high ground, however,
is not continuous but is interspersed with valleys and plains. Geologically
the mountains and hills consist mainly of outcrops of very old rocks (archaean
and palaeozoic), while the top strata in the valleys and plains are mainly more
recent (carboniferous age) and similar to those in the northern and western
parts of Lowland Britain.
These carboniferous strata are rich in minerals and include the coal
measures which have been the foundation of Britain s industrial expansion.
The outcrops and shallow seams of coal which have now largely been exhausted
were found on the edge of the plains and up the valleys leading to the high
land. Most of the present deep coal workings underlie the fertile lowlands.
Towards the end of Britain’s long geological history, when the ancestors
of present-day man had already settled in the country, came the great Ice
Age, and at one period or another during this time the whole of Britain north
of a line joining the river Thames and the Bristol Channel was covered by
ice caps and ice sheets. The ice naturally accumulated on the higher ground
and swept from the mountains of Scotland, northern England and Wales
any loose rock or soil which had previously been formed, so that, when the
ice eventually disappeared, the hills stood out as barren rocky areas, while a
thick mantle of glacial debris—boulders, boulder-clay, sands and gravels

lay distributed widely over the lower ground. The ice had blocked up previous
drainage channels and left large lakes, which have since gradually dried up,
leaving deposits of sand, silt and mud, often affording soils of great fertility.
In Ireland, where the solid rocks are covered deeply by the debris left by
the ice sheets, the great central plain has large boggy areas, due to interruption
of the previous natural drainage. The mountains and hill masses of Ireland
are irregularly placed around central lowlands; in the higher parts the
moorland vegetation resembles that of the higher parts of Highland Britain.
Britain’s complex geology is one of the main reasons for its rich variety
of scenery and the stimulating contrasts found within short distances,
particularly on the coasts. The ancient rocks of Highland Britain often reach
the coast in towering cliffs; elsewhere the sea may penetrate in deep lochs, as
along much of the west coast of Scotland. Bold outstanding headlands are
notable features in other parts of the varied coastline: the granite cliffs of
Land’s End; the limestone masses and slates of the Pembrokeshire coast in
South Wales; the red sandstone of St. Bees Head on the Cumberland coast;
and the vertically jointed lavas of Skye and the island of Staffa in the Inner
Hebrides. Even around Lowland Britain there are striking contrasts. In some
parts the soft, white limestone—the chalk—forms the world-famous white
cliffs of Dover or the Needles off the Isle of Wight; while other parts of the
south and south-east coastline have beaches of sand or shingle. The eastern
coast of England between the Humber and the Thames estuary is for the
most part low-lying, and for hundreds of years some stretches of it have been
protected against the sea by embankments. These have occasionally been
breached, as in the flood disaster of January 1953, which was caused by the
abnormal concurrence of violent gales and exceptionally high tides.
The marked tidal movement around the British Isles sweeps away much
of the sand and mud brought down by the rivers and makes the estuaries
of the short British rivers1 valuable as natural harbours.
Britain has a generally mild and temperate climate. It lies in middle latitudes
to the north-west of the great continental land mass of Eurasia, but the
prevailing winds are south-westerly and the weather from day to day is
controlled mainly by a succession of depressions from the Atlantic which,
moving in a generally easterly or north-easterly direction, pass over or near
the British Isles. The climate is subject to frequent changes but to few
extremes of temperature. Although it is largely determined by that of the
eastern Atlantic, occasionally during the winter months easterly winds may
bring a cold, dry, continental type of weather which, once established, may
persist for many days or even weeks. During the summer months the Azores
high pressure system usually extends its influence north-eastwards towards
north-west Europe, and the depressions take a more northerly course, often
passing entirely to the north of the British Isles.
Winds. In Britain, south-westerly winds are the most frequent, and those
from an easterly quarter the least; such winds occur about one-third as often
as south-westerly ones although easterly winds are appreciably more frequent
in the spring than at any other time of the year. In hilly country, wind direction
may differ markedly from the general direction owing to local topography.
Winds are generally stronger in the north than in the south of the British
Isles, stronger on the coasts than inland, and stronger in the west than in the
1 The longest rivers in England—the Severn and the Thames—are only 210 and
200 miles long respectively.

east. The strongest winds usually occur in the winter; the average speed at
Lerwick, Shetland Islands, varies from about 22 m.p.h. in January to about
14 m.p.h. in August, while at Kew Observatory, on the western outskirts of
London, the average speed varies from about 10 m.p.h. in January to about
7 m.p.h. in August. The stormiest region of the British Isles is along the
north-west coast, with over 30 gales a year; south-east England and the east
Midlands are the least stormy, with gales occurring on about 2 days a year
inland and on some 15 to 20 days on the Channel coast.
Temperature. Near sea level the mean annual temperature ranges from
470 F. (8° C.) in the Hebrides to 520 F. (ii° C.) in the extreme south-west
of England; it is slightly lower in the eastern part of the country in the same
latitude. The mean monthly temperature in the extreme north, at Lerwick
(Shetlands), ranges from 390 F. (40 C.) during the winter (December, January
and February) to 530 F. (120 C.) during the summer (June, July and August):
the corresponding figures for Jersey (Channel Islands), in the extreme south,
are 430 F. (6° C.) and 63° F. (170 C.). The average range of temperature
between winter and summer varies from 150 F. to 230 F. (7°-i20C.), being
greatest inland in the eastern part of the country. During a normal summer,
the temperature occasionally rises above 8o° F. (270 C.) in the south, but
temperatures of 90° F. (32° C.) and above are infrequent. Extreme minimum
temperatures depend to a large extent on local conditions, but 20° F. ( — 70 C.)
may occur on a still, clear winter’s night, io° F. (—12° C.) is rare, and
o° F. ( —180 C.) or below has been recorded only during exceptionally severe
winter periods.
Rainfall. The British Isles as a whole have an annual rainfall of over
40 inches, while England alone has about 34 inches. The geographical
distribution of annual rainfall is largely governed by topography and exposure
to the Atlantic, the mountainous areas of the west and north having far more
rain than the plains of the south and east. Between 150 and 200 inches of
rain fall on the summits of Snowdon and Ben Nevis during the average year,
whereas some places in the south-east of England record less than 20 inches.
Rain is fairly well distributed throughout the year, but, on the average,
March to June are the driest months and October to January the wettest,
the former period of four months having about 60 per cent of the rainfall of
the latter. A period of as long as three weeks without rain is exceptional,
and is usually confined to limited areas. In successive years, however,
remarkably contrasting weather conditions are sometimes experienced.
Sunshine. The distribution of sunshine over the British Isles shows a
general decrease from south to north, a decrease from the coast inland, and
a decrease with altitude. During May, June and July—the months of longest
daylight—the mean daily duration of sunshine varies from five and a half
hours in western Scotland to seven and a half hours in the extreme south-east
of England; during the months of shortest daylight—November, December
and January—sunshine is at a minimum, with an average of half an hour a
day in some parts of the Highlands of Scotland and in the Peak District
(Derbyshire) and two hours a day on the south coast of England.
Visibility. In fine, still weather there is often some haze in Britain and
mist and fog are not uncommon, particularly from October to January. In
London and some of the other main centres of population and industry
there are occasional ‘smogs’—chemically polluted fogs which are very
dense and acrid and constitute a considerable health risk to the elderly and
infirm.

Soil and
Vegetation
Fauna
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Many parts of the surface of Highland Britain have only thin, poor soils,
with the result that large stretches of moorland are found over the Highlands
of Scotland, the Pennines, the Lake District, the mountains of Wales and in
parts of north-east and south-west England. In most areas the farmer has
cultivated only the valley lands and the plains where soils are deeper and
richer; villages and towns are often separated by uplands with few if any
habitations.
With the exception of a few patches of poor soil or rocky land, almost the
whole of Lowland Britain has been cultivated, and farmland covers the area
except where there are urban and industrial settlements. Elaborate land
drainage systems have been developed through the centuries to bring under
cultivation the fertile soil of the low-lying fenland of Lincolnshire and similar
areas in East Anglia.
With its mild climate and varied soils, Britain has a diverse pattern of
natural vegetation. When the islands were first settled, oak forest probably
covered the greater part of the lowland, giving place to extensive marshlands,
forests of Scots pine on higher or sandy ground and perhaps some open
moorland. In the course of the centuries the forest area was progressively
diminished and, in spite of planting by estate owners in the eighteenth and
nineteenth centuries and the establishment of large forests by the Forestry
Commission in the past forty years, woodlands now occupy only about
7 per cent of the surface of the country. The greatest density of woodland
occurs in the north and east of Scotland, in some parts of south-east England
and in Monmouthshire on the Welsh border. Midland Britain appears to be
well wooded because of the numerous hedgerows and isolated trees. The
most common trees are oak, beech, ash and elm and, in Scotland, pine and
birch.
There are various types of wild vegetation, including the natural flora of
woods, fens and marshes, foreshores and cliffs, chalk downs and the higher
slopes of mountains; the most widespread is that of the hilly moorland country,
which consists mainly of heather, grasses, gorse and bracken, with cotton
grass in the wetter parts. Most of Britain, however, is agricultural land, of
which about a third is arable and the rest pasture and meadow, a varied
semi-natural vegetation composed of indigenous grasses and flowering plants.
Farming land is divided into fields by hedges or stone walls and, especially
in the mixed farms which cover most of the country, presents a pattern of
contrasting colour. The cool temperate climate of Britain and the even
distribution of rainfall ensure a long growing season; streams rarely dry up,
grassland is green throughout the year and full of wild flowers from spring
to autumn; in most years there is scarcely a month in which some flowers
may not be found in hedgerows and sheltered woodland glades.
The fauna of the British Isles is, in general, similar to that of north-western
Europe, though there are fewer species. Some of the larger mammals,
including the wolf, the bear, the boar and the reindeer, have become extinct,
but red deer, protected for sporting reasons, flourish in the Scottish High¬
lands and on Exmoor in the counties of Devon and Somerset, roe deer are
found in Scotland and in the wooded areas of southern England, and fallow
deer (which are probably not indigenous) have been introduced into parks
and are wild in some districts. The badger, a nocturnal animal, is rarely seen;
there are foxes in most rural areas, and otters are found along many rivers
and streams. Both common and grey seals may be seen on various parts of
the coast, though not usually in the same localities. Smaller mammals include
THE LAND AND THE PEOPLE
7
mice, rats, voles, shrews, hedgehogs, moles, squirrels (the imported grey
more numerous than the native red), hares, rabbits (a serious farming pest
before their decimation by myxomatosis in the years 1954 and 1955), weasels
and stoats.
There are about 430 species of birds, including many song-birds. About
230 species are resident and the rest are regular visitors to Britain. The
chaffinch and the blackbird are probably the most numerous and are widely
and evenly distributed, but sparrows usually predominate near houses, and
huge flocks of starlings, which gather at certain seasons, sometimes congregate
in London and other large towns. These and some other species of small
birds have been on the increase for several decades owing to their success in
adapting themselves to a man-made environment, while small birds in
general have benefited by more considerate treatment from the public. The
number of large birds, on the other hand, has tended to decline, except for
game birds which are specially preserved, such as pheasants and partridges,
and the red grouse which is found in moorland areas.
Many species of gulls and other sea-birds nest round the coast and gulls
often fly far inland in search of food or shelter in rough weather. The drainage
and reclamation of marsh lands have diminished the natural habitat of duck,
geese and other aquatic birds. Such birds, however, now frequent reservoirs,
gravel pits and sewage farms in addition to the nature reserves and bird
sanctuaries which have recently been established on an increasing scale.
Nearly all British wild birds are protected; the principal exceptions are those
considered injurious to agriculture and birds shot for sport in the open season.
Reptiles and amphibians are few. The former are represented by three
species of snakes, of which only the adder is venomous, and three species of
lizards, including the snake-like slow-worm. The amphibians are represented
by three species of newts and five species of frogs and toads. Of these, only
one species of newt and the common viviparous lizard are indigenous; the
other species of reptiles and amphibians that are now firmly established came
to Britain from Europe. There are no snakes in Ireland.
River and lake fish include salmon, trout, sea-trout, perch, roach, dace,
grayling and pike.
There are more than 21,000 different kinds of insects, most of them small,
in the British Isles. Among the largest are the rare swallowtail butterfly
(3 to 4 inches) and the stag beetle (2! inches). The insect fauna in Britain is
less varied than that of continental Europe and lacks a number of common
European species. With modern methods of pest control, extensive insect
damage to crops or timber and serious outbreaks of diseases commonly spread
by insect vectors are exceptional in Britain.
THE DEMOGRAPHIC BACKGROUND
The people who now inhabit the British Isles are descended mainly from
the people who inhabited them nearly nine centuries ago. The last of a long
succession of invaders and colonisers from Scandinavia and the continent of
Europe were the Normans, a branch of the Norsemen or Scandinavian
Vikings who, after settling in northern France, intermarrying with the French,
and assimilating the French language and customs, crossed to England and
conquered it in 1066.
It is neither possible nor suitable to attempt in this chapter to estimate the
relative importance of various early peoples—pre-Celts, Celts, Romans,
Anglo-Saxons and the Norsemen, including the Danes—in the ancestry of the

present English, Scots, Welsh and Irish. It is significant, however, that over
most of England and the Lowlands of Scotland the language which soon
came to predominate was English, mainly a marriage of Anglo-Saxon and
Norman-French, while the use of Celtic languages persisted in Wales,
Cornwall, the Isle of Man, the Highlands of Scotland and in Ireland (see p. 20).
The available records do not permit of any precise estimates of the size of
population or of the extent or direction of population movement until the
beginning of the nineteenth century. It is believed, however, that at the end
of the eleventh century the population of Great Britain was about two million,
while at the end of the seventeenth century a reasonable contemporary
estimate put the population of England and Wales at 5J million and that of
Scotland at about one million. The main factor in this gradual growth of
population was a slow natural increase, the rate of which was retarded in
Britain, as in all countries before the development of medical science, by
high death rates and, in particular, by very high infant and maternal mortality.
Immigration from the continent of Europe was an influence at certain
times, for example, that of Flemish weavers in the fourteenth and fifteenth
centuries.
From the beginning of the nineteenth century, information about the
British people—their number, sex, age, geographical distribution, births,
deaths, marriages, occupations, language and family structure is relatively
plentiful and reliable. Most of it is derived from two main sources: the regular
flow of vital statistics, i.e. statistical information based on statutory registration
of births, marriages and deaths, and the periodic census of population which
gives a national snapshot at a particular moment of time.
The compilation of complete records of births, marriages and deaths is
carried out by registrars of births and deaths, some of whom also act as
registrars of marriages. In England and Wales there are about five hundred
superintendent registrars in charge of registration districts and about twelve
hundred registrars in charge of sub-districts. Registrars and superintendent
registrars are appointed by the county, county borough and metropolitan
borough councils but they act under the instruction of the Registrar General
for England and Wales, who is in charge of a central Government department,
the General Register Office, concerned with regulating the registration of
births, deaths and marriages, with planning and carrying out population
censuses, and with the compilation and analysis of population and vital
statistics. There are corresponding authorities1 and similar arrangements
(differing only in detail) in Scotland, Northern Ireland, the Channel Islands
and the Isle of Man.
Censuses of the people of Great Britain have been taken regularly every
ten years since 1801, except that there was no census in 1941 because of the
war. In 1951 and 1961 censuses covering the whole of the British Isles were
taken by the appropriate authorities in England and Wales, Scotland,
Northern Ireland, the islands of the British seas and the Irish Republic.
All the reports based on the 1951 censuses have now been published. The
preliminary reports—straightforward counts of males and females by area—
of the 1961 censuses were published in 1961 and the final local reports
began to appear towards the end of 1962.
1 The various authorities are: the General Register Office, Somerset House, London;
the General Registry Office, Edinburgh; the General Register Division of the Ministry of
Finance of the Government of Northern Ireland; the Governments of Jersey, of
Guernsey and its associated islands, and of the Isle of Man.

Population
The short demographic account of the United Kingdom given in this
chapter is based mainly on census reports and on the regular returns of births,
marriages and deaths, though some use has been made of other special
investigations, including the Reports of the Royal Commission on Population.1
The enumerated population of the United Kingdom at the censuses taken
on 23rd April, 1961, was 52,675,556, excluding persons in the Isle of Man
and the Channel Islands, which are not strictly parts of the United Kingdom.
The population had increased by nearly 2|- million since about
6| million since 1931, by about 8^ million since 1921 and by about 451 million
—or about sevenfold—since 1700. The main causes of this increase were a
progressive reduction in death rates and a continuance of high birth rates

into the beginning of the twentieth century. Between the 1961 Census and
June 1962 the population increased faster than at any time in the past 40 years
owing to natural increase and exceptionally high net gain from migration.
In June 1962 it was approximately 53,301,000. On the basis of present trends
it is now expected to go on growing, probably by slightly under 1 per cent
a year.

March 1949.

Birth and Death
Rates
Mortality
Causes
The population density of the United Kingdom is one of the highest in
the world. It was approximately 564 persons per square mile at the time of
the 1961 censuses.
For most of the nineteenth century the annual birth rate was about 35 per
thousand of the population, and the annual death rate was just over 20 per
thousand. Both birth and death rates fell over the last 30 years of the century,
but the natural increase of the population changed but little. It rose from
12 per thousand in 1851 to 15 per thousand in 1881, and fell to 11 per thousand
in 1901.
These fertile years, with their comparatively high death rates in all age
groups, produced a population of low average age. At each successive census
the population of any age group exceeded the corresponding figure at the
preceding census, while the short expectation of life further reduced the ratio
of older to younger persons. When, therefore, death rates in all age groups
fell by an average of about 33 per cent, as they did between 1880 and 1910,
the results were a very low general death rate, which helped to maintain the
population increase in spite of a fall in the birth rate, and a gradual increase
in the average age of the population.
After the first world war the birth rate fell to less than half the nineteenth
century rate. Even so, the population continued to increase slowly, though
its average age rose more rapidly (see diagram on p. 9).
Owing to the changing age composition, the general death rate has remained
nearly stationary at around 12 per thousand of the population though death
rates have continued to fall heavily in every age group, particularly among
pre-school children, school children, and adults in their thirties and forties,
with a consequent lengthening of the expectation of life from about 50 years
at birth in 1900 to 1910 to over 70 years at birth in 1958 to i960. Since 1933 the
steady fall in the number of births has ceased. During the second world war the
birth rate began to rise and reached a temporary post-war peak of 20-7 per
thousand population in 1947. It then receded again to slightly above the pre¬
war level in the early 1950s, but since 1955 it has risen slowly and was 18-3 per
thousand in 1962.
The causes of the decline in mortality include better nutrition, rising standards
of living, the advance of medical science, the growth of medical facilities,
improved health measures, better working conditions, education in personal
hygiene, public and private schemes to make the health services generally

available, and the smaller size of the family, which has reduced the strain
on mothers and enabled them to take greater care of their children.
Mortality from acute infectious diseases and from tuberculosis, and infant
and maternal mortality have declined very sharply. Mortality from the main
acute infectious diseases of childhood is less than a two-hundredth and
mortality from tuberculosis is about one-fortieth of the rate prevailing in the
mid-nineteenth century. Infant mortality (i.e. deaths of infants under one year
old per thousand live births) has fallen by about 85 per cent since 1900.
Maternal mortality is now only about one-tenth of the 1934 rate. The
EXPECTATION OF LIFE AT BIRTH YEARS
reported mortality from many of the chronic diseases of middle and old age,
such as cancer of the lung and coronary thrombosis, has risen during the
twentieth century, and this rise, though exaggerated by the improvement in
diagnosis, is at least partly real. Medicine has not yet discovered effective
measures to combat some of these diseases, and improvement in positive
health does not always bring increased immunity or resistance to them.
Over the past thirty years the proportion of the whole population who are
married has risen from 43 to 51 per cent, while the proportion of single
persons in the population over 15 years of age has fallen from nearly a third
to under a quarter. This change has been due mainly to an increase in marriage
rates among men and women in their late teens and early twenties. In 1962
some sixty per cent of the young women aged 20 to 24 were married; in 1931
only twenty-five per cent were married. Earlier marriage has led to a large
increase in the number of children born to women under 30 years of age and
in recent years has contributed to a substantial acceleration of the total flow
of births into the population.
The fall in birth rates in the latter part of the nineteenth and the early part
of the twentieth centuries was due mainly to a decline in the size of the family
(i.e. the number of children born per married couple) caused by the spread
of deliberate family limitation. Couples married a hundred years ago produced
on the average rather more than six liveborn children. The decline seems to
have set in with those married in the 1860s, and continued steady until, with
the couples married in the late 1920s, the average family size had been reduced
to between 2-2 and 2-1. The decline then stopped, and the figure remained
stable in spite of the disturbance of the war years; the latest data suggest a
definite increase.
Age
Distribution
Sex Ratio
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
The generation of girls born about 1840, and married mostly between 20
and 30 years later, had about 40 per cent more children than were needed to
replace the original generation, while those born at the beginning of the present
century had only about 70 per cent of the number of children needed for
replacement. Since then the figure has been rising again and seems likely to
exceed full replacement with the generation born during the second world
war. The rise has been due mainly to the increased proportion of children
surviving to adult life and of women getting married; but there has also been
some increase in family size and fertility statistics suggest that this increase
is continuing.
The first effect of the fall in the birth rate was to reduce the number of
children, and therefore the ratio of dependent population to working popula¬
tion. This ratio was at a minimum in the 1930s. After 1936 the number of
children leaving school for work fell sharply owing to the drop in the birth
rate after 1921, while the population aged over 40 continued to increase and
the population aged over 64, born during an era of high fertility and repre¬
senting successive generations of steeply rising numbers, increased very
rapidly. The higher birth rates after 1942 have arrested the compensating
fall in the number of dependent children and have further reduced the ratio
of working to dependent population.
At mid-1962 the age distribution of the United Kingdom was estimated
as follows:
Under 15 23-1 per cent
151064 .. .. .. 65-1 per cent
65 and over .. .. n-8 per cent
An unusually large proportion of the population of the United Kingdom
(about 13 per cent) is now between 45 and 55 years of age. Assuming a
continued fall in death rates and an aggregate net gain from migration of
340,000 people from the usual age groups, it can be estimated that between
1962 and 1977:
(1) the number of young people aged 15 to 29 will increase by over
14 per cent to about 12-3 million;
(2) the population of working age will increase slowly;
(3) the number of old people (over 65) will increase by more than 12 per cent
to about 8 million.
Total births of boys naturally exceed those of girls by about 6 per cent, but
stillbirth rates and mortality rates at almost all ages are higher for males, so
that in nearly all countries—and in Britain since records began—women
preponderate among the elderly and outnumber men in the total population.
Until recently indeed women outnumbered men in the United Kingdom in
every age group from adolescents onwards. Actually, however, the reduction
in stillbirths and infant mortality has made the influence of these factors on
sex ratio relatively unimportant so that the age at which women begin to
outnumber men has been advanced and is now about 30. On the other hand,
the lengthening of the expectation of life, which has been rather more marked
for women than for men, has increased the preponderance of women among
the elderly—there are now some five women over seventy years old to every
three men—and made it a weightier factor in the sex ratio of the whole popu¬
lation. This increase in the number of elderly women, however, does not quite
counterbalance the increase in the number of boys and young men so that the
ratio of females to males has fallen from 108 : 100 in 1951 to 107 : 100 in 1961.

Migration
From the beginning of the nineteenth century until the 1930s the balance
of migration was markedly outward. Between 1815 and 1930 well over
20 million people left Britain for destinations outside Europe, mainly in the
Commonwealth and the United States. Many emigrants later returned and
large numbers of Europeans, mainly Russians, Poles, Germans and Hungarians,
entered the British Isles. Nevertheless, the net loss by migration from the
present area of the United Kingdom amounted to some four million between
1871 and 1931. Since then the balance of migration of Britain as a whole
has been inward, though Scotland and Northern Ireland have throughout
continued to have a net outward movement of population to countries
overseas as well as to England and Wales. The main net inflow to Britain
as a whole was in the years 1931 to 1940, when emigration was very low,
many former emigrants returned and there was extensive immigration from
Europe, including about a quarter of a million refugees seeking sanctuary
in Britain. There was also considerable net immigration from the Irish
Republic. After the 1939-45 war emigration to Commonwealth countries rose,
but for the whole intercensal period 1931 to 1951 there was a net gain by
migration of about half a million for the United Kingdom as a whole. In the
intercensal period 1951 to 1961 the net balance of migration was again inward,
but by a smaller margin (97,000), though the gross migration flows were
higher than before. Emigration to the Commonwealth increased and total
emigration was probably over 200,000 in the two peak years of 1952 and 1957.
Immigration, however, was also increasing—from the Commonwealth, from
the Irish Republic and from the continent of Europe; and from 1958 onwards
the balance of migration was again markedly inwards. The major factor in
this change was the increase in immigrants from overseas Commonwealth
countries into the United Kingdom (very largely into England and Wales).
Over the two years i960 and 1961 there was a net intake of 194,000 of these
into the population, including a net inward movement of 116,000 British
West Indians. In these circumstances, the Government decided that it was
necessary to take powers to control immigration from the Commonwealth
and, in principle, the Irish Republic. The Commonwealth Immigrants Act,
1962 (see p. 16), empowered the Government to restrict the number of
persons from the Commonwealth and Irish Republic who may immigrate
into the United Kingdom without assured prospects of employment or
adequate means of self-support, and to deport unsuitable immigrants.
At the 1951 census some 1-7 million persons in the United Kingdom were
reported as having been born outside it. About a fifth of them had been born
in other independent Commonwealth countries or in United Kingdom
dependencies, about a third in the 26 counties of southern Ireland (now the
Irish Republic), and nearly half in foreign countries, notably Poland, Germany,
Russia and the United States. The number born in the overseas Common¬
wealth and in the Irish Republic had increased by about one-third and two-
thirds, respectively, since 1931, and the number born in foreign countries
had approximately doubled. In view of the high levels of immigration, it is
probable that the number of persons living in the United Kingdom, but
born elsewhere, has increased further since 1951. An important factor in
recent years has been immigration from the West Indies and the Indian sub¬
continent. Immigrants from those countries at present living in Britain are
estimated to number about half a million.
Nationality
Less than one per cent of persons were of alien nationality at the time of
the 1951 census; the remainder were either citizens of the United Kingdom
!6 BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
and Colonies or of other Commonwealth countries or were British protected
persons or citizens of the Irish Republic.
Under the British Nationality Act, 1948, with insignificant exceptions,
persons who are born, or whose fathers were born, in the United Kingdom
or in a territory which was a colony of the United Kingdom on 1st January,
1949, or at the date of birth if later, or in a United Kingdom registered ship
or aircraft, are citizens of the United Kingdom and Colonies. Citizenship
may also be acquired: by descent (subject to certain requirements) from a
paternal grandfather born in the United Kingdom or Colonies or from a
more remote paternal ancestor in the male line; by registration, for citizens
of Commonwealth member countries or of the Irish Republic, for minor
children and for women married to citizens of the United Kingdom and
Colonies; in consequence of an adoption order; and by naturalisation. The
requirements for the grant of a certificate of naturalisation include five years’
residence in the United Kingdom or Colonies or five years Crown service,
good character, a sufficient knowledge of English and the intention to reside
in the United Kingdom or a colony or to remain in Crown service.
A citizen of the United Kingdom and Colonies does not forfeit his citizen¬
ship by acquiring or possessing the nationality or citizenship of another
country; nor does a woman who is a citizen of the United Kingdom and
Colonies lose her citizenship by marriage to an alien. Indeed, a citizen cannot
be deprived of his citizenship against his will except in very exceptional
circumstances (for example, if he has obtained naturalisation or registration
as a citizen by fraud). Any man or woman who is a citizen is, however, at
liberty to renounce citizenship if he or she possesses or acquires the nationality
or citizenship of another country.
Citizens of the other independent Commonwealth countries are, in United
Kingdom law, British subjects or Commonwealth citizens. Until the passing
of the Commonwealth Immigrants Act, 1962, they were free to enter and
remain in the United Kingdom without restrictions of any kind. Similar
treatment has been extended to citizens of the Irish Republic who, in the
United Kingdom, are not aliens.1
Regional The distribution of the population of the British Isles by country and major
Distribution administrative region as enumerated at the 1961 census and at certain previous
and Trends censuses back to 1901 is shown in Tables 1 and 2.
The populations of England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland and
of each of the principal regions of England were in every case greater in 1961
than in 1951 and in 1951 than in 1931, whereas in the period 1921-31 the
populations of Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland had declined. Between
1931 and 1951, the greatest increases were in the eastern, southern, midland
and south-western regions of England, and in Northern Ireland. The smallest
increase was in Wales. Since 1951 the main increases have been in the eastern,
southern and north midland regions of England.
The population of the United Kingdom taken as a whole is predominantly
urban and suburban. During the nineteenth century, when the labour
demands of newly developing industry drew great numbers from the country-
1 Special transitional arrangements apply to citizens of South Africa, which ceased to be
a member of the Commonwealth in May 1961. Under the South Africa Act, 1962,
South Africans, unless they are also citizens of the United Kingdom or some other
Commonwealth country, became aliens, but South African citizens who fulfil certain
defined qualifications showing close connections with the United Kingdom or a colony
by descent, residence or employment can become United Kingdom citizens by registra¬
tion if they apply before the end of 1965.

Urban Dispersal
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
side to the towns, the urban element continuously and rapidly outgrew the
rural element. At the end of the nineteenth century, 75 per cent of the
British population was living within the boundaries of urban administrative
areas and the large conurbation1 was already the dominant type of British
community. By 1911 the economic and social limits of these conurbations
extended far beyond the administrative boundaries of the cities which formed
their core, owing to the building of outer suburbs which linked up neighbour¬
ing towns. Since 1921 nearly 40 per cent of the population has lived in the
seven great conurbations whose centres are the cities of London, Manchester
(South-east Lancashire), Birmingham and Wolverhampton (West Midlands),
Glasgow (Central Clydeside), Leeds and Bradford (West Yorkshire),
Liverpool (Merseyside), and Newcastle upon Tyne (see Table 2).
The second world war halted suburban building and for a time reduced the
population of conurbations and large cities, but by the end of the war many
people had returned to the neighbourhood of their pre-war homes. At the
1951 census many large cities and towns had larger populations than in i939>
but the population of others was smaller. Table 2 shows the distribution
of the population by urban and rural districts and the populations of
the standard administrative regions, of the seven major conurbations and the
17 largest cities, some of which are the principal cities included in the
conurbations. It should be borne in mind, however, that the statistics of
cities, relating to administrative areas, do not necessarily include all the
continuously built-up area of the city; in the case of large towns, development
commonly extends without a break across administrative boundaries and is
likely to cover considerable areas which are administratively rural. The
statistics for conurbations, which consist of continuously built up and
economically inter-dependent areas and include developing suburbs of large
cities, are in some cases more illuminating, though, even within conurbations,
as in urban areas generally, there are large parks, commons and other expanses
of open country.
The greatest concentration of population in Britain is in the London area.
Greater London is variously defined but it certainly covers an area much
larger than the County of London (population about 3 million). The con¬
tinuously built-up area extends into the counties of Middlesex, Hertfordshire,
Surrey, Essex and Kent, and the area socially and economically dependent
on the capital is still wider. As in other urban concentrations, there is a long-
established tendency for decreases in the number of people who actually
have their homes in the inner parts of the area—especially the centre itself
—to be balanced by increases of population in and beyond the outer suburban
fringes. The war accelerated the pre-war fall of population in the inner areas
and retarded the rapid pre-war expansion of some of the outer areas. Between
1939 and 1951 the County of London lost about two-thirds of a million
people and the population of the official conurbation, which roughly corre¬
sponds to the continuously built-up area, fell by some 380,000 to 8,350,000
in I951- . .. J . , ,
Since 1951 there has been a further dispersal, facilitated in part by the
improvement in public transport and the spread of car ownership. The
population of the inner areas has continued to fall, the population of the
conurbation outside London County has remained almost static, while a

broad belt of almost continuous population increase now completely encircles
the official conurbation, includes and passes beyond all London new towns
and extends along every major rail and road route from London. The con¬
temporary London region can be defined as a roughly circular area with a
radius of 40 to 50 miles from central London and a population in 1961 of
some 12,000,000 (an increase of half a million since 1951). The redistribution
within this region has resulted both from voluntary or private moves and
from planned transfers of population and probably from differences in natural
increase. The increased population of the outer areas includes both com¬
muters, who have moved their homes but continue to travel to work in inner
London, and inhabitants of new towns and expanded existing towns, who
have changed both their home and their workplace.
The characteristic of urban dispersal, which has reached its largest scale
in the London area, has been a feature of post-war change also in many
provincial cities and towns. It has been most marked where the local economy
has been prosperous, population increase rapid, and land for development
in short supply. Outward movement and fringe development for one or more
of these reasons has been noticeably large in outer areas of the West Midlands
and Merseyside conurbations and on the edges of Bristol, Derby, Leicester,
Norwich, Oxford, Portsmouth and Sheffield, while the populations of the
centres of conurbations and large cities have continued to fall.

« The boundaries of some of the administrative areas have been altered from time to
time. The population figures given relate in general to the areas as these were defined
in the year noted at the head of each column. The figures for conurbations, however,
relate in general as nearly as possible to areas as constituted in 1961.
4 Area at the date of the 1961 census of population.
c 1926 and 1937 census figures.
Apart from the feature of urban dispersal, the past decade has seen widely
different rates of population growth in various parts of the country. The
general picture is that many places in the Midlands and south-east England,
some south coast retirement areas and some economically prosperous parts
of the north and west have experienced increase above the national rate;
they include in particular the London, Birmingham and Southampton-
Portsmouth areas, Coventry, Oxford, Gloucester-Cheltenham, Bournemouth,
Middlesbrough, Doncaster and York. There was comparatively little increase
or no change in the South-east Lancashire, West Yorkshire, and Tyneside
conurbations. In England and Wales few places had any decrease of popula¬
tion ; it was generally small in amount and affected mainly some old industrial
areas in Lancashire and south Wales and a number of seaside towns. Rural
districts, in total, had a high rate of increase, but this was due largely to
expansion on town peripheries. Some remote rural areas, particularly the
Highlands and Islands of Scotland and parts of central Wales and the
Pennines, suffered a considerable decline in population.
Language
In England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland, English is the language
predominantly spoken. In Wales, however, Welsh, a form of British Celtic,

is the first language of the majority of the population in most of the western
counties and was spoken by 26 per cent of the population at the time of the
1961 census. In Scotland, in 1961 some 77,000 persons, mainly in Ross and
Cromarty, Inverness, Argyll, and Lanark, spoke the Scottish form of Gaelic,1
while a few families in Northern Ireland spoke the Irish form of Gaelic.
The Manx and Cornish varieties of Celtic are no longer effectively living
languages, although, in the Isle of Man, Manx is spoken by a few people,
and is used in addition to English for certain official pronouncements.
English is spoken throughout the Channel Islands, but a Norman-French
patois is still also spoken there by some people. French is still the official
language of Jersey, used for ceremonial and official procedure; both French
and English are used in the courts. In Guernsey, however, English is now
used for almost all official proceedings.
A general summary of trends in social organisation, similar in scope to the
foregoing summary of population trends, is not practicable. It may be useful,
however, to review some of the evidence relating to the structure of British
households and the extent and use of leisure in Britain in order to provide
a background to the information given in later chapters on such matters as
town planning, housing, and transport.
In Great Britain, as in other countries, most people live as members of
private households (usually families). Less than 5 per cent of the population
was enumerated by the censuses of 1911, 1921, 1931 and 1951 in institutions
such as hotels, schools, and hospitals.
In 1911 there were about nine million private households2 in Great Britain.
By 1951, according to the censuses of England and Wales and of Scotland,
there were about 14! million households, an increase of about 60 per cent.
This expansion was much more rapid than the 19 per cent increase in the
total population during the same period because falling birth rates and a
lengthened expectation of life meant more but smaller families. The average
size of households in Great Britain fell from 4-5 persons in 1911 to 3-2 in
1951. In England and Wales the number of persons living in households of
one or two persons almost trebled between 1911 and 1951. At the end of this
period such households constituted about 40 per cent of private households
and comprised about 20 per cent of the population in private households. In
43 per cent of families of two persons, the head of the household was 60 years
of age or over.
Of the 14^ million private households in Great Britain in 1951, n| million
were estimated, according to the 1951 census one per cent sample tables
(based on an analysis of a representative one per cent sample of census
returns in Great Britain), to be of the simplest type, comprising married
couples or widowed persons with their children, if any, or persons living
alone. More specifically, they comprised 3-2 million married couples with
no children, 900,000 widowed or divorced persons living alone, 6-9 million
married couples, widowed or divorced persons with children of any age and
600,000 single persons living alone. Some three-quarters of the single persons
living alone and almost all widowed and divorced persons living alone were
over 40 years old, and about two-thirds of all persons living alone were 60 years
of age or over.

in the counties of Ross and Cromarty, Inverness and Argyll.

BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Altogether over 8 million households (57 per cent of all households) were
estimated in the 1951 census sample tables to be without children under 16,
while another 3-1 million contained only one child.
In the years since 1951 considerable changes in the numbers, size and
composition of households have taken place. According to the preliminary
results of the 1961 census of England and Wales, the intercensal increase in
the number of households was about 12 per cent, compared with a 5 per cent
increase in population and about 20 per cent in number of dwellings. This
further decrease in the average size of households is consistent with the increase
in the number of elderly people who tend to live alone or in pairs and with the
splitting of some households. Owing to the more rapid increase in the number
of dwellings there were, however, fewer shared dwellings. Indeed the total
number of dwellings, including vacant dwellings, fell short of the number of
households by less than 0-4 per cent.
The small average size of households does not imply that wider family and
kinship ties are without strength and social significance. Indeed, a study,
published in 1957,1 stressed the importance of the mutual help of relatives
and neighbours in the long-established and balanced communities living in
the more crowded parts of east London. The survey, which also covered a
suburban area of Greater London, noted the dangers of weakening such ties
when households are moved out to more congenial suburban surroundings.
The great majority of British males over 15 years of age are in full-time
gainful employment, and the majority of females are either housewives or in
full-time gainful employment. In many cases housewives also undertake
part-time or even full-time employment. Nearly a third of married women
have a paid job, and over half the women working for pay are married.
Agreed hours of full-time work for the majority of occupations are usually
from 40 to 44 hours a week. Actual weekly hours worked by men average
a little longer owing to overtime working, and actual hours worked by women
and girls average a little less. In addition, the journey to and from work is
often long. The 1951 census showed that three-quarters of the million
persons working in central London lived outside it and that many travelled
in from th fringes of Greater London and some from farther away. A
sample survey of travel in Greater London, made in 1954, showed that
89 per cent of workers in Greater London made regular journeys to work
and that 56 per cent used public transport. The average time taken by such
persons was 39 minutes each way, though for workers in central London it
was 47 minutes each way. Both the number of persons travelling daily to
work in central London and the average length of such journeys are tending
to increase. In 1961 it was estimated that over 1-3 million people journeyed
into central London between seven and ten o’clock on a weekday morning,
most of them (about 1-2 million) by public transport.
There is also often a long journey for housewives to the main shopping
centre in both urban and rural areas. In most areas there are, of course, a
few shops much closer at hand.
Probably less than five per cent of housewives employ any regular paid
help and almost certainly less than one per cent have a resident servant.
The statistical evidence on this matter is rather fragmentary, but suggests
a continuing reduction in the number of households with paid help, and
confirms what can in any case be readily deduced from everyday experience,

that housewives have less leisure and considerably fewer periods of continuous
leisure of over one hour than other persons in Britain, in spite of the growth
of the habit of eating some meals away from home1 and the spread of labour-
saving devices. Three households in every four now have a vacuum cleaner,
two in five a washing machine and nearly one in three a refrigerator.
Compared with earlier generations, however, most people today have
considerably more leisure. In many industries and services, hours of work
are usually arranged to give a five-day week, and most employees are entitled
to two weeks’ continuous holiday a year in addition to the statutory public
holidays. Moreover, owing to rising real incomes and the increasing mechan¬
isation of heavy work, more people have the money and energy to spend
their leisure in a variety of activities: on a weekday evening roughly an
eighth of the adult population are engaged in leisure activities outside their
homes. Over half the population take at least a week’s holiday away from
home every year, mostly in July and August. Traditionally most families have
spent their holiday by the sea in Britain, lodging at a seaside boarding house
or hotel, or staying with relatives or friends. Latterly, other forms of holiday,
still usually at or near the seaside, have been gaining in popularity, including
holiday camps, caravanning and touring in a car or coach. A relatively small
but rapidly increasing number of holidaymakers go abroad—over four million
in 1962, including travellers to the Channel Islands and to the Irish Republic.
In the same year about 1,955,500 overseas tourists visited Britain.
Many people are interested in playing or going to watch outdoor sports.
Sporting interests are becoming increasingly varied (see Chapter 19) but
Association football is, both as a spectacle and as a game for boys and young
men, still the most popular. Much of the gambling with small stakes, which
is practised at least occasionally by three adults out of four, is on the results
of sporting events.
The total money staked by the public on organised betting and gambling
(private wagers and games of chance cannot be counted) was estimated in
1961 at between £750 million and £1,000 million and appeared to have
increased by about 50 per cent since 1957; at least in part the apparent
increase was because the legalisation of betting shops under the Betting and
Gaming Act, i960, brought into the open betting which had been illicit.
About half the money staked is on horse racing. Betting on football matches,
both at fixed odds and through the football pools (see Chapter 19) is wide¬
spread, but usually at smaller stakes. A recent gambling craze is for Bingo,
a form of Lotto, which is being played in converted cinemas and in club
rooms and village halls.
The spread of television has added a vast new audience of indoor spectators
to the crowds who go to watch sporting events and great national occasions.
By mid-1963 about 80 per cent of the families in Britain (and a somewhat
higher proportion of the large families) had a television set; viewers are fairly
evenly distributed among all sections of the population, irrespective of
income or occupation. The number of television receiving licences doubled
between 1955 and 1959 to over nine million. Since 1959 the increase has been
slower, the total number in June 1963 being about 12,570,000.
Rising standards of living and, in particular, the widely distributed owner¬
ship of television sets and motor vehicles, have affected leisure habits in

many ways and have provided new and varied opportunities for recreation
and entertainment.
There were over ten million motor vehicles licensed in the summer of
1963, of which about 6^ million were cars and 1-6 million were motor
cycles (including motor scooters). Many cars and some motor cycles are used
partly, if not primarily, for business purposes. During the summer, however,
roads to the sea and the country and to sporting events are usually thronged
(and sometimes jammed) with cars, especially on fine Saturdays and Sundays.
The spread of car ownership, making many people more independent of
public transport, is leading to a new and more scattered distribution of houses,
and is changing the siting requirements of factories, shops and offices, as
well as the whole pattern of leisure activities.
During the past twenty years the real incomes of manual workers, and
particularly of unskilled workers and young workers under eighteen years of
age, have risen rapidly both in absolute terms and in relation to the incomes
of non-manual workers. At the same time opportunities for education and
promotion, already considerable, have widened. An investigation of occupa¬
tional and social mobility made fourteen years ago found that, if occupations
were classified by social status into seven groups, only one man in three had
the same social status as his father. More than half the people in the two
top groups (‘professional and administrative’ and ‘managerial and executive’)
were the sons of men who had held less important positions, while only a
quarter of the sons of unskilled workers were themselves in occupations in
that category. A recent (1958-59) survey of the way of life of 600 hourly¬
rated men in five manufacturing firms in England found that a quarter of
the sons over eighteen years of age of men in the sample were in professional
or managerial occupations or training for them. In consequence, social
distinctions based on occupation have become less clear cut, and differences
in the ways of life of manual and non-manual workers are much less pro¬
nounced. Many manual workers’ families have acquired habits and tastes
which were formerly regarded as ‘middle-class’, though educational and
cultural levels vary widely.
Such social changes often call for difficult adjustments. Many families of
unskilled and semi-skilled workers, for example, suddenly find themselves
with more money to spend when their children leave school for work at
fifteen years of age; while the families of most non-manual and many skilled
manual workers forgo the extra income in order to continue their children’s
education. The increased earnings of young workers, however, have influenced
the status and outlook of adolescents generally. ‘Teenage’ society with
sufficient coherence, independence and spending power to establish its own
customs, tastes and fashions is a feature of present-day Britain; and as in
many other countries, the activities of groups of teenagers without adequate
parental control attract more attention than formerly and are sometimes a
serious social problem in certain areas.
One of the chief long-term effects of television, according to an investigation
into its influence on children, is to widen tastes and stimulate new interests.
For this reason, as well as because of its direct competition, it can be regarded
as the main cause of the fall in attendances at cinemas, formerly the chief
entertainment of large sections of the community. Cinema attendances
(some 8 million a week) are at less than a third of the rate of ten years
ago, but the cinema remains the most popular form of indoor entertain¬
ment outside the home, particularly for young men and women and older
Clubs

children. About two-thirds of the unmarried aged 15 to 24 go at least once
a week.
Attendances at theatres are much smaller. There are probably only some
400 theatres compared with some 2,300 cinemas. Nevertheless, there is an
enthusiastic and growing public not only for plays but for ballet, opera and
concerts.
Dancing is popular, especially with those under twenty-five years of age; it
is thought that about five million people go dancing every week and television
audiences for ballroom dancing competitions are rated at nearly five million
households. There are estimated to be some 3,000 to 4,000 regular dance
halls, including public dance halls and halls operated by the major dance
schools, which are open at least three times a week, and about 4,000 other
schools of ballroom dancing. Public dances are also often held in other halls,
while many of the clubs and societies which abound in Britain hold dances
from time to time in their own or hired premises. In addition, Scottish and
English traditional dances have their own following while, since the war,
there has been a very large increase in attendance at ballet and other stage
dancing classes (mainly by young girls).
In addition to the perennially popular sports and pastimes, there are a
number which attain a transitory popularity and it is not possible to tell how
permanent any new trend will prove. A sport new to Britain and gaining
popularity is ten-pin bowling, which has been developed in America from
the traditional English game of skittles.
Clubs and societies, which may be primarily social or devoted to some
particular purpose, range from small informal groups to great national and
international organisations with branches throughout the country. Organisa¬
tions of national importance in social life and in the promotion of social
gatherings include, in addition to those connected with religious denomina¬
tions, the Working Men’s Clubs and Institutes, the Townswomen’s Guilds
and the Women’s Institutes. There are some 3,600 clubs, with over two
million members (mainly but not entirely men), affiliated to the Working
Men’s Club and Institute Union. These clubs are primarily social and
recreational, though they also arrange lectures and classes. Nearly 2,400
Townswomen’s Guilds with a total membership of about 200,000, are
affiliated to the National Union of Townswomen’s Guilds. The guilds are
both educational and social in purpose, and they co-operate in many public
welfare activities. The declared objective of the National Federation of
Women’s Institutes is to improve rural life and amenities; the institutes make
an important contribution to rural life by providing meeting places for
countrywomen and by organising social gatherings. There are in villages
throughout England and Wales some 8,600 institutes with nearly half a
million members, while in Scotland and Northern Ireland there are Women’s
Rural Institutes with similar aims and interests.
In spite of the growth of social clubs, one traditional social rendezvous,
the inn or ‘pub’ (public house) has maintained and even increased its popu¬
larity both in towns and in villages, although there has been a marked decrease
in drunkenness and in consumption of alcohol per head since the nineteenth
century; the recent rise in drunkenness among adolescents, though serious,
is on a relatively small scale. Pubs now have a very wide circle of casual
customers (both men and women) as well as many ‘regulars’ who meet for
a drink and a chat, and perhaps to play some traditional public house game
or to watch television. To attract this new and wider public many pubs have
26
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
greatly improved their appearance and amenities, while competitors for this
public are restaurants and milk bars as well as the coffee bars which in the
last ten years have become popular with young people, largely because
of the atmosphere and decor. On the other hand, many people, especially
the married and the elderly, spend much of their leisure at home—reading,
listening to the radio, record-player or tape recorder, viewing television,
entertaining their friends,1 looking after pets2 * 4 and pursuing hobbies. Hobbies
are, of course, innumerable in their variety, but many are practical and
contribute to the improvement of the home. About four out of five families
do most of their own decorating, while the sales of hand-tools and the rapidly
increasing sales of small power-tools and powered garden implements testify
to the extent and range of home carpentry and joinery and to the interest
and initiative that maintain Britain’s homes and gardens. In spite of the high
proportion of the population living in urban areas, at least every other family
in Britain has some garden, and the standard of both town and country
gardens is high. Some 4,000 local horticultural societies are affiliated to the
National Allotment and Gardens Society and there are a large number of
unafhliated societies; altogether there are probably some 19 million spare¬
time gardeners. The numerous flower and vegetable shows held in town and
country are very popular, and there is a large attendance at those held in
London, particularly at the annual Chelsea Flower Show.
A number of people, young and old, find their main free-time interest in
some form of sustained group activity connected, for example, with the
churches, trade unionism, politics, social welfare and reform, in study or
other self-improvement, or with cultural pursuits, especially amateur
dramatics and music-making (see the Arts section of Chapter 9). People with
such interests are still in a minority but they are increasing rapidly in
numbers and constitute an important and characteristic feature of British
life and, indeed, an essential ingredient in the working of British democracy.
1 Indications of the rise in the scale and standard of home entertaining are provided by
the increasing sales of table wines (double those of the 1930s) and of expensive foods,
and by the frequent newspaper and periodical features and broadcast programmes
devoted to cooking recipes.
2 A sample survey in 1959 suggested that about a quarter of all homes had a caged bird,
slightly over a fifth a cat, and slightly under a fifth a dog; there are probably some
4 million dogs in Britain, over 6 million cats and 8 or 9 million pet birds (mainly
budgerigars).

GOVERNMENT
GENERAL SURVEY
The United Kingdom is a monarchical State, whose origins and traditions
are to be found in the history of each of its four component parts: England,
Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland. England was unified under a Saxon
king in the ninth century; Wales became part of that kingdom and Ireland
was joined with it under the same king before the end of the thirteenth
century; and the English and Scottish thrones were dynastically united in
the person of James I and VI in 1603. In 1707 the Treaty for the Union of
England and Scotland provided that the two countries ‘should be forever
united into one kingdom’, and one Parliament (the Parliament of Great
Britain) became the supreme authority in both countries. In 1801 the Act
for the Union of Great Britain and Ireland, 1800, which joined the Irish
Parliament to the Parliament of Great Britain, established the United
Kingdom. In 1922 the 26 counties of Southern Ireland (now the Irish
Republic) became a completely independent country, outside the United
Kingdom. Meantime, the Government of Ireland Act, 1920, had enacted a
constitution for Northern Ireland which perpetuated Northern Ireland
representation in the United Kingdom Parliament as the supreme authority
and, at the same time, provided that country with its own legislature and
executive, to deal with domestic affairs.
The United Kingdom is a unitary, not a federal, State but methods of
government are flexible and, to some extent, adapted to the needs of the
constituent countries. Thus there is some measure of devolution in the
administration of Welsh affairs under a Cabinet Minister (who is Minister
for Welsh Affairs), assisted by a Minister of State, and advised by a Council
for Wales as broadly representative as possible of all the main aspects of
Welsh life and thought. England and Wales on the one hand, and Scotland
on the other, continue as before the Union to have different systems of law,
a different judiciary, different educational systems, different systems of local
government, national churches on a different footing, and, for most domestic
matters, different Government departments. The main Scottish departments
are grouped under the direction of the Secretary of State for Scotland, who
is a member of the United Kingdom Cabinet. In Northern Ireland the law
is derived from and similar to the law of England but the judiciary is separate;
the Northern Ireland Government departments are responsible to the
Northern Ireland Parliament. The Channel Islands and the Isle of Man
(which are Crown dependencies, not part of the United Kingdom) have their
own legislative assemblies and systems of local administration and of law,
and their own courts. At the same time, they have a special relationship with
the United Kingdom because of their proximity to the mainland and the
antiquity of their connection with the Crown. They are treated as part of
the mainland for purposes of trade and postal communication and are
‘territories for whose international relations Her Majesty’s Government is
responsible’. They are also formally subject to the United Kingdom
Parliament.
28
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
The United Kingdom Parliament has the ultimate responsibility for the
good government of a number of overseas dependencies within the Common¬
wealth, all of which are administered by territorial governments and are at
various stages of development towards full self-government. The United
Kingdom is also one of the independent member nations of the Common¬
wealth,1 which all acknowledge the Queen as the symbol of their free association
and, as such, the head of the Commonwealth; most of these independent
countries owe allegiance to the Crown.
The United Kingdom constitution is formed partly by statute, partly by
common law and partly by precepts and practices, known as conventions,
which are not part of the law of the land since violation of them would not
lead to proceedings in a court of law, but which are nevertheless indispensable
to the machinery of government. The rules of the constitution have never
been codified; principles and practice are both alterable, and the rules of the
constitution can be adapted to changing conditions at any time by the passing
of an Act of Parliament, or by the general acceptance of a new convention,
without serious disturbance to existing organs and forms.
The organs of government in the United Kingdom constitution are readily
distinguishable although their functions often intermingle and overlap. They
are:
(1) the legislature, which consists of the Queen in Parliament, and is the
supreme authority in the realm;
(2) the executive, which consists of: [a) the Cabinet and other Ministers
of the Crown, who are responsible for initiating and directing national
policy; {b) Government departments, most of them under the control
of ministers and all staffed by civil servants, which are responsible for
administration at the national level; (c) local authorities, which administer
and manage many services at the local level; and (d) statutory boards,
which are severally responsible for the operation of particular nation¬
alised industries or public services, and which are subject to ministerial
control in varying degrees; and
(3) the judiciary, which determines common law and interprets statutes,
and is independent of both the legislature and the executive.
The following pages describe these three organs of government in some
detail in order to show how the constitution of the United Kingdom works.
THE MONARCHY
The monarchy is the most ancient secular institution in the United Kingdom.
Its continuity has been broken only once in over a thousand years; and in
spite of interruptions in the direct line of succession, the hereditary principle
upon which it was founded has never been abandoned. Queen Elizabeth II
is a descendant of the Saxon king, Egbert, who united all England in the
year 829, and of Malcolm II, whose reign in Scotland (1005-34) was corre¬
spondingly important in that part of the realm.
According to the Royal Titles Act, 1953, the royal title in the United
Kingdom is: ‘Elizabeth the Second, by the Grace of God of the United
Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and of Her other Realms
and Territories Queen, Head of the Commonwealth, Defender of the Faith’.
1 The other members (August, 1963) are: Canada, Australia, New Zealand, India,
Pakistan, Ceylon, Ghana, the Federation of Malaya, the Federation of Nigeria, Cyprus,
Sierra Leone, Tanganyika, Jamaica, Trinidad, Uganda.

BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Succession
Accession
Coronation
The form of the royal title is varied for the other member nations of the
Commonwealth which owe allegiance to the Crown, to suit the particular
circumstances of each.
The seat of the monarchy is in the United Kingdom, the Queen being
represented by a Governor in Northern Ireland. For the performance of
royal functions in the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man the Queen is
represented by a Lieutenant-Governor. In the other member nations of the
Commonwealth which owe allegiance to the Crown the Queen’s representative
is the Governor-General, who is appointed by the Crown on the advice of
the ministers of the country concerned and is wholly independent of the
United Kingdom Government. In the United Kingdom dependencies the
Queen is usually represented by Governors (but in some cases by High
Commissioners, Administrators or Residents), who are appointed by the
Crown, have varying executive and legislative powers, and are responsible
to the United Kingdom Government for the good government of the countries
concerned.
The title to the Crown derives from the Act of Settlement, 1701, which
provided that ‘the Crown . . . shall remain and continue to the said most
excellent Princess Sophia1 and the heirs of her body being Protestants’.
Subsequent Succession to the Crown Acts have confirmed this declaration;
and although succession is not bound to continue in its present fine, it cannot
now be altered (under a provision of the Statute of Westminster, 1931)
except by common consent of the member nations of the Commonwealth
which owe allegiance to the Crown.
The inheritance of the Crown is governed by rules of descent, which
provide that the sons of the Sovereign are in Order of Succession to the
Throne according to their seniority or, if there are no sons, the daughters
in order of their seniority. When a daughter succeeds, she becomes Queen-
Regnant and the powers of the Crown are vested in her as fully and effectively
as though she were a king. By convention, the consort of a king takes the
rank and style of her husband; but the converse does not apply and the
constitution has never attached any special rank or privileges to the husband
of the Queen-Regnant.
There is no interregnum between the death of one Sovereign and the accession
of another. Immediately on the death of his or her predecessor the new
Sovereign is proclaimed at an Accession Council to which all members of
the Privy Council are summoned. The Lords Spiritual and Temporal, the
Lord Mayor, aldermen and other leading citizens of the City of London,
and the High Commissioners in London of the member nations of the
Commonwealth are also invited to attend.
The coronation of the Sovereign follows the accession after an interval
which may last for a year or more. The ceremony has remained much the
same in substance for nearly a thousand years although the details have
frequently been modified to bring it into conformity with the customs of
the time. The service used at the coronation of Queen Elizabeth II in 1953
was derived from that used at the coronation of King Edgar at Bath in the
year 973.

GOVERNMENT 31
The coronation service is held at Westminster Abbey in the presence of
representatives of the Lords, the Commons and all the great public interests
in the United Kingdom, of the Prime Ministers and leading members of the
other Commonwealth countries and of representatives of foreign States.
The Queen is the personification of the State. In law, she is the head of the
executive, an integral part of the legislature, the head of the judiciary in
England and Wales, Northern Ireland, and Scotland, the commander-in-chief
of all the armed forces of the Crown and the temporal head of the established
Church of England. In practice, as a result of a long evolutionary process
during which the absolute power of the monarchy has beeen progressively
reduced, the Queen acts only on the advice of her ministers which she cannot
constitutionally ignore. She reigns, but she does not rule. The United
Kingdom is governed by Her Majesty’s Government in the name of the Queen.
Within this framework, and in spite of the fact that the trend of legislation
during the past hundred years has been to assign powers directly to ministers
without any necessity for royal intervention, there are still important acts
of government which require the participation of the Queen.
The Queen summons, prorogues and dissolves Parliament; as a general rule
she opens the new session with a speech from the throne (although this may
be read by the Lord Chancellor if the Queen is unable to be present); and
she must give Royal Assent before a Bill which has passed all its stages in
both Houses of Parliament becomes a legal enactment. The Queen is ‘the
fountain of justice’, and as such, can remit all or part of the penalties imposed
on people convicted of crime. As ‘the fountain of honour’, the Queen confers
peerages, baronetcies, knighthoods and other honours,1 and makes appoint¬
ment to all important State offices, including those of judges, officers in the
armed forces, governors, and diplomats, and to all leading positions in the
established Church of England. The Queen’s consent and approval are
required before a minister can take up office or a Cabinet be formed. In the
realm of international affairs, by virtue of her pre-eminence as head of the
State, the Queen has the power to conclude treaties, to cede or accept territory,
to declare war and to make peace.
These and similar acts of government involve the use of the royal preroga¬
tive2 which has been defined as ‘the residue of discretionary authority legally
left in the hands of the Crown’. Ministerial responsibility for the exercise
of this authority is shown in the three constitutional ways in which the royal
will can be expressed: by Order in Council made ‘by and with the advice
of the Privy Council’; by Order, Commission or Warrant signed personally
by the Queen and generally bearing the signature of one or more responsible
ministers; or by Proclamation, Writs, Letters Patent, or other documents
under the Great Seal affixed by the Lord Chancellor in obedience to a Royal
Warrant countersigned by a minister.
Ministerial responsibility for the exercise of powers by the Crown does not
detract from the importance of the participation of the Sovereign in the
1 Most honours are conferred by the Sovereign on the advice of the Prime Minister; a
few, i.e. the Order of Merit, the Order of Companions of Honour, the Royal Victorian
Order, the Most Noble Order of the Garter, and the Most Noble and Most Ancient
Order of the Thistle, are in the Sovereign’s personal gift.
2 Other powers of the Crown relate to the creation of corporations by Royal Charter;
the construction and supervision of harbours; the guardianship of infants; the admin¬
istration of charities; coinage; the grant of franchises, e.g., markets, ferries and fisheries;
the right to treasure trove; and the right of printing or licensing others to print the
Bible, the Book of Common Prayer and State papers.
32
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
smooth working of government; for although the Queen has no personal
authority and must show complete impartiality in every field, she must be
informed and consulted on every aspect of the national life. The Queen
holds meetings of the Privy Council, gives audiences to her ministers and
other holders of office at home and overseas, receives accounts of Cabinet
decisions, reads dispatches and signs innumerable State papers.
Such is the significance attached to these royal functions that provision has
been made by Acts of Parliament for a Regent to be appointed to fulfil them
if the Sovereign is totally incapacitated, or is under the age of eighteen on
accession to the throne. The latest of these Acts—the Regency Act, 1953—
laid down that the first potential Regent should be the Duke of Edinburgh
and thereafter those in succession to the throne who are of age. In the event
of the Sovereign’s partial incapacity or absence abroad, provision is made
for the appointment of Counsellors of State (generally speaking, the wife
or husband of the Sovereign, and the four adult persons next in succession
to the Crown1) to whom the Sovereign may delegate by Letters Patent
certain royal functions. But Counsellors of State may not, for instance,
dissolve Parliament (except on the express instructions of the Sovereign),
nor create peers.
Ceremonial and Ceremonial has always been associated with the kings and queens of the
Royal Visits British Isles and, in spite of the changes that have taken place with the altered
outlook of both the Sovereign and the people, certain customs and usages
are the same today as they were many centuries ago. Royal marriages, the
birth of royal children and royal funerals are marked by ancient ceremonial,
although to a lesser degree than in former days; and the birthday of the
Sovereign, formerly the occasion of many royal and public functions, is
today officially celebrated early in June by Trooping the Colour on the Horse
Guards Parade. State banquets take place when a foreign monarch or head
of State visits the United Kingdom; investitures are held at Buckingham
Palace; and royal processions grace such social occasions as the Ascot Race
Meeting, known as Royal Ascot, and add significance to the opening of
Parliament, when the Queen drives in state from Buckingham Palace.
The Sovereign is the leader of society by order of general precedence dating
from the fourteenth century and sustained until the present day by royal
ordinances, established custom and the public will. The Queen and other
members of the royal family visit many parts of the United Kingdom every
year, and their presence at the inauguration of scientific, artistic, industrial,
and charitable works of national importance ensures nation-wide interest and
support. They also pay State visits to foreign Governments and undertake
lengthy tours in other countries of the Commonwealth.
PARLIAMENT
The supreme legislative authority in the United Kingdom is the Queen in
Parliament, that is to say, the Queen and the two Houses of Parliament—
the House of Lords and the elected House of Commons.
The three elements of Parliament are outwardly separate: they are con¬
stituted on different principles; they do different work in different places and
they meet together only on occasions of symbolic significance such as the
1 The Regency Act, 1953, provided that Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother should be
added to the persons to whom royal functions may be delegated as Counsellors of State.
GOVERNMENT

coronation, or the opening of Parliament by the Queen in person, when the
Commons are summoned by the Queen to the House of Lords. As a law¬
making organ of State, however, Parliament is a corporate body and cannot
legislate without the concurrence of all its parts (except in the case of Bills
passed under the Parliament Acts, 1911 and 1949).
The Parliament at Westminster is representative of all the countries of the
United Kingdom. It can legislate for the United Kingdom as a whole, or
any of the constituent countries separately, or for any combination of them.
It can also legislate for the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man, but in these
islands and in Northern Ireland it is not the only legislature, for the Northern
Ireland Parliament has power to legislate for Northern Ireland on most
domestic subjects (see p. 43), and the ancient legislatures of the two Channel
Island Bailiwicks (the States of Jersey and the States of Guernsey) and of the
Isle of Man (the Tynwald Court) legislate on domestic matters.1 Nevertheless,
the Parliament at Westminster retains supreme authority, and within practical
limits there is nothing that it cannot legally do.
By the passing of the Parliament Act, 1911, the life of a United Kingdom
Parliament was fixed at five years (although it is usually dissolved and a general
election held before the expiry of the legal term); and since one Parliament
cannot bind its successor (for otherwise the succeeding Parliament would not
be sovereign or supreme), each assembly has a period of time of up to five
years during which it may legislate exactly as it chooses. During its life, it
can make or unmake any law; it can destroy by statute the most firmly
established convention or turn a convention into binding law; it can legalise
past illegalities and thus reverse the decisions of the courts; and it even has
power to prolong its own life by legislative means beyond the normal period
of five years without consulting the electorate.
In law, therefore, the supremacy of Parliament is absolute. In practice,
Parliament does not exercise its supremacy in this way. Its members bear
in mind the common law which has grown up in Britain throughout the
centuries and they act as far as possible in accordance with precedent and
tradition. Moreover, although the validity of an Act of Parliament that has
been duly passed, legally promulgated and published by the proper authority
cannot be disputed in the law courts, no Parliament would be likely to pass an
Act which it knew would receive no public support. The system of party
government in Britain ensures that Parliament legislates with its responsibility
to the electorate in mind.
The Meeting of A Parliament, in the sense of a parliamentary period, begins and ends with
Parliament a proclamation made by the Sovereign on the advice of the Privy Council.
Such a proclamation on the one hand dissolves an existing Parliament and,
on the other, orders the issue of writs for the election of a new one and
appoints the day and place of its meeting.
The resignation of a government usually entails the dissolution of Parlia¬
ment. Formerly the death of a Sovereign also involved dissolution, but since
1867 the duration of Parliament has been independent of the demise of the
Crown; both Houses stand adjourned on such an occasion only until their
members have taken the oath of allegiance to the new Sovereign, which they do
immediately after the Accession Council has made the order for proclamation.
1 The legislatures of the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man consist of the Queen, the
Privy Council and the local assemblies. It is the duty of the Home Secretary, as the
member of the Privy Council primarily concerned with island affairs, to scrutinise each
legislative measure before it is submitted to the Queen in Council.
34
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
The House of
Lords
The time between the meeting of a Parliament and its prorogation or
dissolution is called a session. Parliament is usually prorogued by a com¬
mission under the Great Seal (see p. 31), which appoints the day and place
of its meeting in a new session. The date so appointed may be brought
forward or deferred by a subsequent proclamation. The effect of a prorogation
is at once to terminate all business (with certain minor exceptions) until
Parliament is summoned again. A Bill not completed in one session must
be reintroduced in the next, unless it is to be abandoned.
During a session either House may adjourn itself on its own motion to
such date as it pleases. An adjournment does not affect uncompleted business.
A reassembly of the House can be accelerated either by proclamation or by
virtue of powers specially conferred by each House on its Speaker.
The average number of sitting days for the House of Commons is about
160, divided by custom into the following periods: one from November until
Christmas lasting 30-40 sitting days, one from January to Easter of 40-50
sitting days, one from Easter until Whitsun of about 30 sitting days, and one
from Whitsun until the end of July lasting about 40 sitting days. Nowadays,
the session is sometimes concluded with a short period of up to 10 sitting
days in October, after the long summer recess. The House of Lords sits, on
average, for about no days.
The House of Lords consists of the Lords Temporal and the Lords Spiritual.
The Lords Temporal may be sub-divided into (i) all hereditary peers and
peeresses of England, Scotland, Great Britain and the United Kingdom who
have not disclaimed their peerages under the Peerage Act, 1963, (ii) all life
peers created by the Crown under the Life Peerages Act, 1958, and (iii) Lords
of Appeal in Ordinary who are appointed under the terms of the Appellate
Jurisdiction Act, 1876, to assist the House in the performance of its judicial
duties and who remain members of the House after their retirement from
office. The Lords Spiritual are the Archbishops of Canterbury and York,
the Bishops of London, Durham and Winchester, and the 21 most senior
other diocesan bishops of the Church of England, according to seniority of
appointment.
Temporal peerages (both hereditary and life) are conferred by the Sovereign
on the advice of the Prime Minister. Hereditary peerages carry with them a
right to a seat in the House of Lords, provided the holder is 21 years of age
or over. Under the Peerage Act, 1963, however, a person who succeeds to a
peerage, or a person who had succeeded to a peerage before the law was
changed, may disclaim that peerage for his or her lifetime. Persons who
disclaim their peerages lose their right to sit in the House of Lords, but they
are able to vote at parliamentary elections and are eligible for election to the
House of Commons.
Not all holders of temporal peerages with a right to sit in the House of
Lords attend the sittings of that House. Those who do not wish to attend may
apply for leave of absence, either for the duration of a particular Parliament
or for a shorter period.
Members in constant attendance at the House of Lords include elder states¬
men and others who have spent their lives in public service. They receive no
salary for their parliamentary work, but they are entitled to travelling expenses
from their homes to the Palace of Westminster (provided they attend at
least one-third of the number of sittings), and (with the exception of the
Lord Chancellor, the Lord Chairman of Committees and any member in
receipt of a salary as the holder of a ministerial office) they may claim payment

for expenses incurred for the purpose of attendance at the House (except for
judicial sittings) within a maximum of three guineas a day.
The House of Lords is presided over by the Lord Chancellor, who sits
on the woolsack and is ex officio Speaker of the House. The Crown, by
commission under the Great Seal, appoints several members of the House
to act as deputy speakers in the absence of the Lord Chancellor. The first
of the deputy speakers is the Lord Chairman of Committees, who is appointed
each session and takes the chair in all committees, unless the House other¬
wise directs. The permanent officers include the Clerk of the Parliaments,
who is charged with keeping the records of proceedings and judgments and
who pronounces the words of the Royal Assent to Bills; the Gentleman
Usher of the Black Rod, who enforces the orders of the House; and the
Serjeant-at-Arms, who attends the Lord Chancellor.
The House of Commons is a representative assembly elected by almost
universal adult suffrage and consists of men and women from all sections of
the community. There are at present 630 seats in the House of Commons
(511 for England, 36 for Wales, 71 for Scotland, 12 for Northern Ireland).
Members of the House of Commons receive a salary for their parliamentary
work and hold their seats during the life of a Parliament. They are elected
either at a general election, which takes place after a Parliament has been
dissolved and a new one summoned by the Sovereign, or at a by-election,
which is held when a vacancy occurs in the House as a result of the death of
a member, or of his acceptance of office under the Crown,1 or as a result of his
elevation to the House of Lords.
The chief officer of the House of Commons is the Speaker, who is elected
by the members as president of the House immediately after a new Parliament
is formed. Other parliamentary officers of the House are the Chairman of
Ways and Means, and the Deputy Chairman, both of whom may act as
Deputy Speaker; these officers are elected by the House. Non-parliamentary
or permanent officers of the House, i.e. those who are not members of
Parliament, include the Clerk of the House of Commons, who is charged
with such matters as keeping the records, endorsing Bills and signing orders;
the Serjeant-at-Arms, who attends the Speaker in the House; and the
Chaplain to the Speaker.
For electoral purposes the United Kingdom is divided into constituencies,
each of which returns one member to the House of Commons. Permanent
Boundary Commissions for England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland
keep constituencies constantly under review, submit periodic reports, and
may, at any time, recommend changes in the boundaries of any particular
constituency or constituencies if, for instance, movement of the population
has made this necessary. Changes in the boundaries of constituencies which
came into effect for the 1955 general election increased the number of seats
in the House of Commons from 625 to the present figure of 630.
The law relating to parliamentary elections is contained principally in the
Representation of the People Act, 1949, which repealed and re-enacted in a
single statute previous legislation relating to the franchise, the conduct of
elections and corrupt and illegal electoral practices. Under the provisions of
this Act, election to the House of Commons is decided by secret ballot in

which British subjects (except members of the House of Lords) and citizens
of the Irish Republic are entitled to vote (voting is not compulsory), provided
that they are 21 years old or over, and are not subject to any legal incapacity
to vote. Those eligible to vote in any constituency are those who are recorded
on the register1 of electors for the constituency as resident in that constituency
on a date fixed by statute. Electors normally vote in person at polling stations
especially established for the purpose, although members of the armed forces,
Crown servants of the United Kingdom employed overseas, and wives of such
persons, if resident overseas with their husbands, may vote by proxy. Voting
by post, or in certain cases by proxy, may also be allowed if the voter cannot
attend in person for such reasons as physical incapacity or the nature of his
work. Any person, male or female, who is a British subject of 21 years of age or
over and is not otherwise disqualified, may be elected to the House of Com¬
mons. Categories of persons disqualified for election include members of the
House of Lords, clergy of the Church of England, the Church of Scotland,
the Church of Ireland and the Roman Catholic Church, undischarged
bankrupts, and those expressly precluded under the House of Commons
Disqualification Act, 1957 (for instance, holders of judicial offices, civil
servants, members of the regular armed forces and the police forces, members
of the legislature of any country or territory outside the Commonwealth,
and holders of other public offices listed in the Act).
Each House of Parliament enjoys certain privileges and immunities designed
to protect the House from unnecessary obstruction in carrying out its duties.
These privileges apply collectively to each House and individually to each
member.
In the House of Commons, the Speaker formally claims from the Crown
for the Commons ‘their ancient and undoubted rights and privileges’ at the
beginning of each Parliament. These include freedom from arrest in civil
proceedings for a period from forty days before to forty days after a session
of Parliament; freedom of speech in debate; and the right of access to the
Crown, which is a collective privilege of the House. Further privileges
include the right of the House to control its own proceedings (so that it is
able, for example, to exclude strangers if it so wishes); the right to pronounce
upon legal disqualifications for membership and to declare a seat vacant on
such grounds; and the right to penalise those who commit a breach of its
privileges.
The privileges of the House of Lords are: freedom from civil arrest;
freedom of speech in debate; freedom of access to the Sovereign for each
peer individually; and the right to commit for contempt. These privileges
are not formally claimed by the Speaker as in the House of Commons; they
exist independently without grant.
The party system has existed in one form or another since the seventeenth
century, and has now become an essential element in the working of the
constitution.
The present system is based upon the existence of organised political
parties, each laying rival policies before the electorate. Whenever there is a
general election or a by-election, the parties may put up candidates for

election; any other citizen who wishes may also stand.1 * * The electorate then
indicates, by its choice of candidate at the poll on election day, which of the
opposing policies it would like to see put into effect.
The party which wins the majority of seats (although not necessarily the
majority of votes) at a general election, or which is able to command a majority
of supporters in the House of Commons, forms the Government. By tradition,
the leader of the majority party is appointed as Prime Minister by the Sovereign,
usually on the advice of the retiring Prime Minister; and its most outstanding
members in the House of Lords and the House of Commons receive minis¬
terial appointments on the advice of the Prime Minister. The largest minority
party becomes the official Opposition with its own leader and its own council
of discussion or ‘shadow7 Cabinet’; while the members of any other parties
or any Independents who have been elected may support the Government
or the Opposition according to their party’s or their own view of the policy
being debated at any given time.
In the general election held in October 1959, 787 per cent of the electorate
voted, compared with 83-6 per cent in 195°, 81-9 per cent in 1951 and
76-8 per cent in 1955. The number of votes cast for the principal parties is
shown in Table 3.

The distribution of seats in the House of Commons resulting from the

The effectiveness of the party system in Parliament rests to a considerable
extent upon the fact that Government and Opposition alike are carried on
by agreement: that is to say, the minority agrees that the majority must
govern and therefore accepts its decisions; and the majority agrees that the
minority should criticise and therefore sets time aside for that criticism to
be heard. The detailed arrangements of Government business are settled,
under the Prime Minister and the Leader of the House (wffio may be the
Prime Minister or some other minister), by the Government Chief Whip in
consultation with the Opposition Chief Whip. The Chief Whips together
form the ‘usual channels’ often referred to in the House of Commons when
the question of the possibility of finding time for debating some particular
issue is being discussed. The direction of the business of the House is primarily

the responsibility of the Leader of the House, and it is his duty to provide all
reasonable facilities for the House to debate matters about which it is con¬

Outside Parliament, party control is exercised by the national and local
organisations. Inside Parliament, it is exercised by the Whips (the Chief
Whips and their assistants, chosen within the party or by the Prime Minister
for the Government party), whose duties include maintaining the voting
strength of their parties by ensuring the attendance of members at important
debates. The Opposition Whips have no official position, but the Government
Chief Whip in the House of Commons is the Parliamentary Secretary to
the Treasury and of the other Government Whips, five hold titular posts as
Junior Lords of the Treasury, three are officers of the Royal Household and
a number are unpaid. There are also Government and Opposition Whips
in the House of Lords. The former, who hold offices in the Royal Household,
sometimes act as spokesmen for the Government in debates.

“ A majority of ioo over all other parties. This was the first time since the establish¬
ment of the modern party system in Britain in the nineteenth century that a party had
increased its parliamentary strength in four successive general elections and the first
time that a party had retained office after being in power for the duration of two full
Parliaments.
The main functions of Parliament are (i) to make laws regulating the life
of the community, (2) to take formal action, cast in legislative form, to make
available finance for the needs of the community and to appropriate the
funds necessary for the services of the State, and (3) to criticise and control
the Government. By custom, Parliament is also consulted before the ratifica¬
tion of certain international treaties and agreements (in spite of the fact that
the making of treaties is a royal prerogative exercised on the advice of the
Government and, in theory, is not subject to parliamentary approval).
Both Houses of Parliament have their own standing orders, but procedure
is based on custom and precedent (much of which dates back to the beginning
of the sixteenth century and even earlier) rather than on the written orders,
which merely supplement the practice in each House. The system of debate
is much the same in the two Houses: for instance, every matter is determined
upon questions put from the chair or woolsack and resolved in the affirmative
or negative, as the case may be; members speak from wherever they have been
sitting and not from a rostrum; and members do not read their speeches.
The main difference is that in the House of Commons the Speaker has a
far greater measure of control.
In the House of Lords the office of Speaker carries with it no inherent
authority to check or curtail debate, such matters being decided by the
general sense of the House. In the Commons, on the contrary, the Speaker
GOVERNMENT
39
Legislation
has full authority to give effect, promptly and decisively, to the rules and
orders of the House. He must carefully guard against abuse of procedure
or any infringement of minority rights, and it is his duty to allow or disallow
any closure motion (i.e. a motion to curtail or end discussion so that the
matter may be put to the vote). He has certain powers to check irrelevance
and repetition in debate, and to save the time of the House in various other
respects. In cases of grave disorder, he has power to adjourn the House or
suspend the sitting on his own initiative.
Voting in the House of Commons is carried out under the direction of the
Speaker, and it is his duty to pronounce the final result. If an equal number
of votes is cast, the Speaker must give the decisive vote; he does this (if
possible) in such a way as to avoid change and leave the question to be debated
on another occasion. The procedure on voting in the House of Lords is
similar to that in the House of Commons, but the Speaker or chairman has
no casting vote. With the exception of questions relating-to Bills and delegated
legislation, the House of Lords is governed by the principle that unless there
is a majority in favour, the question is decided in the negative. When the
House is sitting judicially (see pp. 87 and 90) the question is put in such a
way that, if the votes were equal, there would be no interference with the
order under appeal.
As a rule, all proceedings of either House are public (the right to debate
in secret is exercised only rarely), and a full record is published daily in the
official reports, Parliamentary Debates {Hansard).
Legislation can be initiated from either side of either House; but no Bill
involving taxation or the spending of public money can proceed very far
unless the Government agrees to introduce a ‘financial resolution’ to cover it.
This has the effect of giving the Government exclusive rights over a wide
field of legislation, and as a result most Public Bills are presented by the
Government. However, private members (i.e. members of the House who
are neither office holders in the Government nor Opposition leaders) can
introduce Public Bills on their own initiative, and such Bills can be debated
on certain days expressly set aside for the purpose in each session.1 Peers
can introduce Public Bills in the House of Lords at any time during a session
without notice. In addition, persons and bodies outside Parliament can
promote Private Bills relating solely to matters of individual, corporate or
local interest.
Bills may originate in either House, unless they deal with finance or
representation when they are always introduced in the Commons. As a rule,
however, Bills likely to raise political controversy go through the Commons
before the Lords, while those of an intricate but uncontroversial nature are
frequently introduced and fully debated in the Lords before being sent to
the Commons.
The process of passing a Public Bill is basically the same in the House of
Lords as in the House of Commons. The Bill receives a formal First Reading
on introduction; it is then printed; and after a period of time (which varies
between one day and several weeks depending on the nature of the Bill) it
may be given a Second Reading after the result of a debate on its general
merits or principles. In the Commons, it is then referred for detailed
1 Private members also have the right of moving for leave to introduce Bills after
question time (see p. 42) on certain days under the ‘Ten Minute Rule’, i.e. the Standing
Order which allows a brief speech proposing and another opposing the introduction of
the Bill before the House decides whether or not to grant leave.
4o
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
examination either to a standing committee or, if the House so decides, to
the whole House sitting in committee; and, in the Lords, to a committee of
the whole House. When the committee stage is finished, the Bill is reported
to the House, and a further stage takes place during which the committee’s
amendments may be altered, additional amendments may be suggested and
incorporated, and, if necessary, the Bill may be recommitted to committee.
Finally, it is submitted for a Third Reading and, if passed, is sent on from
the Commons to the Lords or from the Lords to the Commons (depending
on its place of origin), where it enters on the same course again. Any amend¬
ments which the second House makes to the Bill must be agreed to by the
first House, or a compromise reached, before the Bill becomes law.
In practice, the Lords pass without amendment all financial Bills, such as
the Finance Bill, which authorises annual taxation and amends existing
taxation, and the Appropriation Bill, which authorises expenditure on the
Supply Services from the Consolidated Fund.1 As a general rule, these Bills
are introduced upon resolutions in a committee of the whole House of
Commons and they may be initiated only by a Minister of the Crown.
When Bills have passed through their various parliamentary stages, they are
sent to the Sovereign for Royal Assent, now usually given by commission.
The Sovereign’s power to refuse assent has not been exercised since the early
eighteenth century.
The majority of Bills introduced in the House of Lords pass through the
Commons without difficulty because of their non-controversial nature; they
are then returned to the Lords to be brought forward for Royal Assent.
However, should any Lords Bill be unacceptable to the Commons, it would
never reach the Statute Book, for no debating time would be allotted to it—
at any rate until a new government came into power, when it might be
revived. The Lords, on the other hand, are unlikely to be able to prevent a
Bill insisted upon by the Commons from finally becoming law. In the normal
course of events, they either accept a Bill from the Commons and return it
unchanged; or they revise and improve it by amendments and return it for
the consideration of members of the other House, who frequently agree to
the amendments made. The Lords cannot require the Commons to agree to
amendments; nor can they delay a Bill indefinitely. They have no powers in
respect of Money Bills; and since the passing of the Parliament Act, 1949,
any other Public Bill which has been passed by the House of Commons in
two successive sessions may be presented for Royal Assent without the consent
of the Lords, provided that a year has elapsed between the date of the Second
Reading of the Bill in the Commons and the date on which it is finally passed
in that House. These limitations to the powers of the Lords are based on the
belief that the chief value of the Upper House, which is a non-elected
assembly, lies in bringing the wide experience of its members into the legis¬
lative process, not in thwarting the elected House. In other words, proceedings
in the House of Lords give time for further reflection, and often elicit new
points of view.
In substance, a Private Bill goes through the same procedure as a Public
Bill but most of the work is done in committee, where the promoters must
prove the need for the powers or privileges that they seek and where any
objections raised by opposing interests may be heard.
1 It is provided in the Parliament Act, 1911, that all Money Bills sent to the House of
Lords one month before the end of the session shall receive the Royal Assent notwith¬
standing, if they are not passed by the Lords without amendment within the month.
GOVERNMENT
41
Parliamentary
Committees
Delegated
Legislation
A committee of the whole House (see p. 40) is presided over by a
chairman instead of the Speaker. Its function is to consider Bills in detail,
clause by clause, after their Second Reading. The Committees of Supply and
of Ways and Means are committees of the whole House of Commons; they
discharge the financial duties of the House concerning the grant of public
money and the levying of taxation.
There are two other main kinds of parliamentary committee, both of
which exist to relieve their parent House of some of its more specialised
and complex work. They are:
(1) Standing Committees, which are appointed by the House of Commons
as necessary, for the consideration of Public Bills and, in the case of
the Scottish and Welsh Grand Committees, other business committed
to them. With the exception of the Scottish Standing and Grand
Committees1 (which deal with Public Bills and other matters relating
to Scotland), and the Welsh Grand Committee2 (which considers the
annual report for Wales and certain selected subjects for debate), each
standing committee consists of from twenty to fifty members nominated
by the Committee of Selection (a body normally consisting of eleven
members drawn from the main parties in the House at the beginning
of each session); in all cases the parties are represented in proportion
to their numbers in the House. The procedure of a standing committee
is generally similar to that of a committee of the whole House.
(2) Select Committees, which are appointed to inquire into and report to
the House on special matters. Select Committees may be appointed
by either House when the occasion for such an appointment occurs,
or they may be re-appointed every session to review particular matters.
The latter type of committee is known as a ‘sessional’ committee and
includes the Estimates, Public Accounts, and Standing Orders Com¬
mittees. There are also select committees to deal with Private Bills,
and joint select committees of both Houses of Parliament which may
be appointed at the instance of either House.
In addition there are the parliamentary party committees: the Conservative
and Unionist Members Committee, popularly known as the 1922 Committee,
which consists of the back bench (non-ministerial) membership of the party;
and the Parliamentary Labour Party, which is a corporate body comprising
all members of the party in either House.
Delegated legislation, which is legislation not by the direct functioning of
Parliament but by powers conferred on the executive by Act of Parliament (or,
more rarely, by royal prerogative), has been part of the parliamentary system
for at least six hundred years. Parliament, however, made but sparing use
of its power to delegate legislation (except during a period of social, political
and economic change in the second half of the fifteenth and most of the
sixteenth centuries) until the end of the nineteenth century, when a changing
conception of the part that should be played by the State in the life of the
community made inroads upon parliamentary time and thus caused the
system to be adopted on a more extensive scale. With the ever-increasing
1 The Scottish Standing Committee consists of thirty members nominated from
Scottish constituencies with up to twenty other nominated members; in its plenary
form, as the Scottish Grand Committee, it comprises all the members for the Scottish
constituencies and not more than fifteen others.
2 The Welsh Grand Committee consists of 36 members for constituencies in Wales and
Monmouthshire, with up to 25 other nominated members selected in order to make the
balance of parties in the committee approximate to that in the whole House.
42
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Parliamentary
Control
scope of Government activity during the past sixty years, pressure on
parliamentary time has become even more acute; as a result, the system of
delegated legislation created under statutory powers has become generally
accepted.
The system of delegated legislation empowers ministers and other author¬
ities to regulate administrative details after a Bill has become an Act. Its
advantages are said1 to be: (i) that it shortens and clarifies Bills before
Parliament, thus enabling Parliament to deal with a greater volume of business
and to give fuller attention to matters of policy and principle which are its
primary concern; (2) that it encourages flexibility, in that administrative
details can be worked out as and when the necessity arises ‘with greater care
and minuteness, and with better adaptation to local and other special circum¬
stances than they possibly can be during the passage of a Bill through
Parliament’; (3) that it is invaluable in an emergency, for it is ‘the means by
which the legislature can dispense with its own deliberative procedure and
arm the executive with power to take immediate action’; and (4) that it
provides a speedy, convenient and accurate means of giving effect to the
policy of Parliament.
In order to minimise the risk—inherent in the system—that delegated
legislative powers might supersede or weaken parliamentary government,
such powers are normally delegated to the Queen in Council or to authorities
directly responsible to Parliament, i.e. to ministers of the Crown, to Govern¬
ment departments for which ministers are responsible, or to organisations
whose legislation is subject to confirmation or approval by ministers who
thereby become responsible to Parliament for it. Moreover the Act which
delegates legislative power generally defines the precise limits of this power
and, in the more important cases, gives Parliament the right to confirm or
annul the statutory instruments2 by which delegated legislation is enacted.
Certain Acts also require direct consultation, before such legislation is made,
with organisations which will be affected by delegated legislation.
The House of Commons is aided in its supervision of delegated legislation
by the Select Committee on Statutory Instruments, which is set up each
session to report on the unusual or unexpected use of statutory powers. The
Special Orders Committee of the House of Lords examines and reports on
all Statutory Instruments requiring affirmative resolution.
Parliament’s function of controlling the Government in power is exercised
in the final analysis by the ability of the House of Commons to force the
Government to resign either by passing a resolution of ‘no confidence’ or
by rejecting a proposal which the Government considers so vital to its policy
that it has made it a ‘matter of confidence’. Such direct control of the Govern¬
ment, however, has not formed a normal part of British political life for
many years; but parliamentary procedure offers a number of opportunities for
a searching examination of Government policy by both the Opposition and
the Government’s own back-benchers. These include:
(1) Question Time, which is a daily hour of parliamentary time during
which ministers, in rotation, answer questions put to them on matters

2 Statutory instruments are made in accordance with the provisions of the Statutory
Instruments Act, 1946, which repealed and replaced the Rules Publication Act, 1893.
Instruments of delegated legislation made under the Act of 1893 were known as
‘statutory rules and orders’ (‘S.R. & O.’).

for which they are responsible. So much parliamentary time is devoted
to scheduled public business that questions are valued as the best
means of eliciting hitherto unpublished information about the Govern¬
ment’s intentions; they are also an effective way of airing, and possibly
securing some redress of, grievances brought to the notice of members
by their constituents.
(2) The right of members to use motions for the adjournment of the
House to initiate discussions on constituency cases or matters of public
concern. There is a half-hour adjournment period at the end of public
business every sitting day; on a day when public business ends before
the scheduled time the time saved may be used for adjournment
debates; and immediately before adjournment for the recess there is
a whole day spent discussing topics selected either by the Opposition
or by private members. Moreover, if a member wishes to discuss a
definite matter of ‘urgent public importance’ he may, at the end of
Question Time, ask leave to move the adjournment of the House; if
the Speaker accepts the motion as being within the terms of the
Standing Order and if, the matter being referred to the House, 40 or
more members rise to support the motion, the matter is debated later
the same day.
(3) The practice whereby the consideration of the Estimates, in Committee
of Supply, has ceased to be a consideration of the financial requirements
of the Government and has become an occasion for the examination,
initiated by the Opposition, of some aspect of the Government’s
administrative policy which has been included in the Estimates.
The means by which Parliament, and more particularly the House of
Commons, exercises responsibility in the management of the revenues of the
State and payments for the public service are described in Chapter 14, Finance.
The public’s interest in the work of Parliament is shown by the queues
which form outside the Houses of Parliament for admission to the public
galleries, by the growth in the circulation of the daily official report {Hansard)
which at present is between three and four times the pre-war figure, and by
the large audiences which listen to the regular broadcast programmes about
parliamentary proceedings.
The major news agencies, national newspapers and broadcasting agencies
have special parliamentary correspondents to report on parliamentary
activities. The Hansard Society for Parliamentary Government, an unofficial
non-party educational society which was founded in I944> continues to
promote interest in parliamentary affairs.
The Parliament of Northern Ireland consists of the Sovereign, a Senate and
a House of Commons. The Sovereign is represented in Northern Ireland by
a Governor, who summons, prorogues and dissolves Parliament in Her
Majesty’s name; the Senate is composed of two ex officio senators (the Lord
Mayor of Belfast and the Mayor of Londonderry) together with 24 senators
who hold office for an eight-year term, 12 being elected by the House of
Commons every four years under a system of proportional representation; and
the House of Commons consists of 52 members, elected by a system of
parliamentary franchise similar to that which operates in Great Britain.
The House continues in existence for a period of five years unless it is
dissolved earlier.

Procedure and
Functions
The Northern Ireland Parliament has power to make laws for the peace,
order and good government of Northern Ireland in relation to all matters
except those especially reserved to the Parliament of the United Kingdom,
i.e.: the Crown or succession to the Crown; foreign relations; defence; the
postal services; the Supreme Court; customs and excise; income and profits
taxes; coinage; standards of weights and measures; trade marks; submarine
cables; wireless telegraphy; aerial navigation; and lighthouses, buoys and
beacons. Under the constitutional practices which have developed since
the passing of the Government of Ireland Act, 1920, the United Kingdom
Parliament does not legislate on matters within the powers of the Northern
Ireland Parliament unless the Government of Northern Ireland requests that
this should be done. But, because certain matters have been reserved to the
United Kingdom Parliament, provision was made in the Government of
Ireland Act, 1920, for the continued representation of the Northern Ireland
constituencies in the House of Commons of the United Kingdom; in
accordance with this provision, 12 members are returned to Westminster.
THE PRIVY COUNCIL
Until the eighteenth century, the Sovereign in Council, or Privy Council,
was the chief source of executive power in the State. As the system of Cabinet
government developed, however, the Privy Council declined in importance;
many of its powers were transferred to the Cabinet, and much of its work
was handed over to newly created Government departments. The present-day
Privy Council exists mainly to give effect to policy decisions made elsewhere.
Apart from Cabinet Ministers, who must be Privy Counsellors and are
sworn of the Council on first assuming office, membership of the Privy
Council (which is retained for life) is accorded by the Sovereign on the
recommendation of the Prime Minister as an honour to persons who have
reached eminence in some branch of public affairs in any country of the
Commonwealth. There are usually about 300 Privy Counsellors.
The Privy Council is convened by the Clerk of the Council and is usually
presided over by the Sovereign. Three Privy Counsellors form a quorum,
but, as a rule, not fewer than four are summoned to attend. The whole Privy
Council is called together only on the death of the Sovereign or when the
Sovereign announces his or her intention to marry.
The Privy Council is responsible for the submission for the Sovereign’s
approval of Orders in Council, of which there are two kinds, differing
fundamentally in constitutional principle: those made by virtue of the royal
prerogative, for example, those embodying royal instructions to colonial
Governors; and those which are authorised by Act of Parliament and are a
form of delegated legislation. Members of the Privy Council attending
meetings at which Orders in Council are made do not thereby become
personally responsible for the policy upon which the orders are based; this
rests with the ministers in whose departments the draft orders were framed,
whether they are present at the meeting or not. Certain Orders in Council
must be published in the London Gazette, which is an official periodical
published by the authority of the Government.
The Privy Council also advises the Crown on the issue of royal proclama¬
tions, some of the most important of which relate to prerogative acts (such
as summoning or dissolving Parliament) of the same validity as Acts of
Parliament.

45
Committees of
the Privy
Council
Judicial Committee
Composition
There are a number of Privy Council committees whose meetings differ from
those of the Privy Council itself in that the Sovereign cannot constitutionally
be present. These committees, which have advisory functions, may be
prerogative, such as the committee which deals with legislative matters
submitted by the legislatures of the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man,
and the committees for medical research, scientific and industrial research,
agricultural research, overseas research, and nature conservation; or they may
be provided for by statute as are those for the universities of Oxford and
Cambridge and the Scottish universities, and that which deals with applica¬
tions for the grant of charters to municipal corporations.
The administrative work of the Privy Council committees is carried out
in the Privy Council Office under the control of the Lord President of the
Council (see p. 46).
The Judicial Committee of the Privy Council is the final court of appeal from
the courts of the United Kingdom dependencies and certain member States
of the Commonwealth, deriving its appellate jurisdiction in respect of such
appeals from the principle of English common law which recognises ‘the
right of all the King’s subjects to appeal for redress to the Sovereign in
Council’ if they believe that the courts of law have failed to do them justice.
The Judicial Committee is also the final court of appeal from the ecclesiastical
courts of England, from the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man, and from
prize courts1 in the United Kingdom and dependencies.
Appeals come to the Judicial Committee either where a right of appeal
has been specially created, for example, by statute, Order in Council or
Letters Patent, or by special leave of the Sovereign in Council on the advice
of the Judicial Committee. They are heard by a board of the committee,
whose members are generally selected from the Lord Chancellor, ex-Lord
Chancellors and Lords of Appeal in Ordinary, although other members of
the Privy Council who have held high judicial office (including Chief Justices
and certain other judges from other Commonwealth countries who have been
sworn of the Privy Council) may also be asked to sit when business is heavy.
The Judicial Committee does not deliver judgment; it advises the Sovereign,
who acts on its report and approves an Order in Council to give effect thereto.
HER MAJESTY’S GOVERNMENT
Her Majesty’s Government is the body of ministers charged for the time
being with the administration of national affairs.
The composition of the Government is subject to variation from time to
time, both in the number of ministers and in the titles of some offices. The
usual ministerial offices may be classified under the following heads:
1. The Prime Minister, who is the recognised head of the Government
but has no department.
2. Non-Departmental Ministers, who include the First Secretary of State
and the holders of various traditional offices—the Lord President of
the Council, the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster,2 the Lord
1 Prize courts deal with matters concerning property captured in time of war which, by
grace of the Crown, falls to the forces which assist in the capture.
2 The Duchy of Lancaster is an inheritance which, since 1399, has always been enjoyed
by the reigning Sovereign; it is kept quite apart from his or her other possessions and
is separately administered by the Chancellor.
46
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Privy Seal, the Paymaster General (whose office is at present combined
with that of Chief Secretary to the Treasury) and a Minister without
Portfolio. These ministers have few or no departmental duties and are
thus available to perform any special duties which the Prime Minister
may wish to entrust to them. In the present Government the First
Secretary of State, who ranks next to the Prime Minister, is responsible
for the Central African Office (see p. 54); the Lord President of the
Council has the general duty of promoting scientific and technological
development as Minister for Science and he also has responsibilities as
regards Government aid to sport and certain regional unemployment
problems; the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster is Leader of the
House of Commons; the Lord Privy Seal handles Foreign Office
business in the House of Commons, the Secretary of State for Foreign
Affairs being a member of the House of Lords; the Paymaster General
and Chief Secretary to the Treasury, under the general direction of
the Chancellor of the Exchequer, deals with the whole range of public
expenditure; and the Minister without Portfolio co-ordinates the
Government information services at home.
3. Departmental Ministers, some of whom are known as Secretaries of
State. There are at present six Secretaries of State—for the Home
Department, Foreign Affairs, Scotland, Commonwealth Relations and
Colonies, War, and Air.1 A few of the older posts have special titles:
the Chancellor of the Exchequer (who is responsible for the Treasury
and for a number of other departments); the President of the Board of
Trade; the First Lord of the Admiralty1; and the Postmaster General.
4. The Lord Chancellor and the Law Officers. The Lord Chancellor has
departmental functions; he is also in a somewhat special position as a
Minister of the Crown who is also head of the judiciary in England and
Wales. The four Law Officers of the Crown are: for England and Wales,
the Attorney General and the Solicitor General; for Scotland, the
Lord Advocate and the Solicitor General for Scotland.
5. Ministers of State, who are additional ministers in Government depart¬
ments where the work is particularly heavy and complex, or when it
involves frequent travelling overseas. There are now two Ministers of
State in the Foreign Office, one each in the Home, Commonwealth
Relations and Colonial Offices, and two at the Board of Trade. In addi¬
tion, the Secretary of State for Scotland is assisted by a Minister of
State, and there is a Minister of State for Welsh Affairs.
6. Junior Ministers, who generally have the title of Parliamentary Secretary
or, where the senior minister is a Secretary of State, Parliamentary
Under-Secretary of State. The primary function of most junior
ministers is to relieve their senior ministers of some of their burden by
taking part in parliamentary debates and answering parliamentary
questions, and by assisting in their departmental duties. The
Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasury and the Junior Lords of the
Treasury are in a different category as Government Whips.
The Prime Minister is appointed by the Crown, and all other ministers
are appointed by the Crown on the recommendation of the Prime Minister.
The majority of ministers are members of the House of Commons. There
are, however, always some ministers in the House of Lords, partly because

(This insert should be affixed to the margin of page 46)
Administrative Changes Introduced in October 1963 on the
Formation of Government by Lord Home
The following administrative changes were announced on 20th October
when Lord Home* formed his Government after the resignation of Mr.
Harold Macmillan on 18th October :
1. The post of First Secretary of State was abolished and responsibility
for Central African Affairs was given to the Secretary of State for
Commonwealth Relations and Secretary of State for the Colonies (a
single governmental post).
2. The responsibilities of the Lord President of the Council with regard
to regional unemployment problems were transferred to the newly
created Secretary of State for Industry, Trade and Regional Develop¬
ment, who also holds the post of President of the Board of Trade.
3. The duties of Leader of the House of Commons were transferred from
the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster to the Lord Privy Seal.
4. A second Minister without Portfolio was appointed and given the
duties of Leader of the House of Lords.
5. The duties of the Lord Privy Seal in regard to handling Foreign
Office business in the House of Commons were discontinued, the new
Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs being himself a member ol that
House.

GOVERNMENT
47
The Prime
Minister
The Cabinet
the House of Commons Disqualification Act, 1957, limits the number of
ministers who may sit and vote in the Commons while receiving salaries
from the Crown, and also because every Government must be assured of
spokesmen to expound and justify its intentions and its actions to the House
of Lords.
The head of the Government became known as the Prime Minister during
the eighteenth century. The unique position of authority enjoyed by the
holder of this office derives from his status as leader of the majority party
in Parliament and from his power to submit his own choice of ministers to
the Sovereign and to obtain their resignation or dismissal individually. In
modern times the Prime Minister always holds the office of First Lord of
the Treasury, and may also hold another portfolio. Since 1902 he has always
been a member of the House of Commons.
It is the duty of the Prime Minister to inform the Sovereign of the general
business of the Government; to preside over the Cabinet; and to exercise
a general supervision over departments, settling departmental differences
and approving important departmental decisions where reference to the
Cabinet is not required. The Prime Minister speaks for the Government in
the House of Commons on the most important topics and answers questions
on its general administration in that House.
The Prime Minister’s responsibilities include making recommendations
to the Sovereign for the appointment of Church of England archbishops,
bishops and certain other senior clergy and the incumbents of some 200
Crown livings, as well as for appointments to high judicial offices, such as
Lords of Appeal in Ordinary, Lord Chief Justice and Lord Justices of Appeal.
He also advises the Crown on appointments of Privy Counsellors, Lord
Lieutenants of counties1 and certain civil appointments, such as Lord High
Commissioner of the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland, Poet
Laureate, Constable of the Tower, and some university appointments which
are in the gift of the Crown. The Prime Minister makes similar recom¬
mendations for appointments to various public boards and institutions, such
as the National Assistance Board and the British Broadcasting Corporation,
as well as to various royal and statutory commissions. In addition, he makes
recommendations to the Sovereign for the award of many civil honours and
distinctions and of Civil List pensions. He selects the trustees of certain
national museums and institutions.
The Cabinet is composed of a number of ministers (usually about 20) who
are selected by the Prime Minister personally. Its origins can be traced back
to the informal conferences that the Sovereign held with his leading ministers,
independently of the Privy Council, during the seventeenth century. After
the Sovereign’s withdrawal from an active role in politics in the eighteenth
century, and the development of organised political parties stimulated by
successive extensions of the franchise from 1832 onwards, the Cabinet
assumed its modern form.
The functions of the Cabinet are2: the final determination of the policy
to be submitted to Parliament; the supreme control of the national executive
in accordance with the policy agreed by Parliament; and the continuous

co-ordination and delimitation of the authority of Government departments.
The exercise of these functions is vitally affected by the fact that the Cabinet
is a group of party representatives, depending for its existence upon the
support of a majority in the House of Commons.
The Cabinet meets in private and its proceedings are strictly confidential.
Its members are bound by their oath as Privy Counsellors not to disclose
information about its proceedings. The Official Secrets Acts forbid the
publication of Cabinet as well as of other State papers, and a resigning
minister desiring to make a statement involving disclosure of Cabinet dis¬
cussions must first obtain the permission of the Sovereign through the
Prime Minister. The theoretical reason for this secrecy is that a Cabinet
decision is advice to the Sovereign, whose consent is necessary before the
decision is made public. From a practical point of view, secrecy is essential
in the interests of unprejudiced discussion, which can take place only if there
is no risk of publicity for every statement made and every point conceded.
In normal times the Cabinet meets for a few hours once or twice a week
during parliamentary sittings, and rather less frequently when Parliament is
not sitting. Additional meetings may be called by the Prime Minister at any
time if a matter urgently requiring discussion should arise. During Cabinet
meetings decisions are reached on major issues of Government policy, and
the Cabinet settles any matters which cannot be disposed of at lower levels.
The Cabinet carries on much of its work by means of a committee system
which originated in the nineteenth century and has been developed to keep
pace with Government business during the past sixty years. The system
involves the reference of any issue either to a standing Cabinet committee
or to an ad hoc committee composed of the ministers primarily concerned,
which considers the matter in detail and either disposes of it or reports upon
it to the full Cabinet with recommendations for action. Ministers not in the
Cabinet are called to attend its meetings when matters affecting their depart¬
ments are under discussion; they may also be members of Cabinet committees.
Detailed accounts of Cabinet meetings are not prepared; only the substance
of documents submitted, together with a summary of the arguments and
the conclusions, are recorded; even these records have a strictly limited
circulation. Responsibility for the keeping of records lies with the Secretary
of the Cabinet.
Ministerial
Responsibility
Ministerial responsibility means both the collective responsibility which
ministers share for the policy and actions of the Government and the individual
responsibility of ministers to Parliament for the work of their departments.
The doctrine of collective responsibility, which was fully accepted by the
middle of the nineteenth century, imposes upon ministers the obligation to
act not as individuals but (in the interests of stability of government) as a
united group. It does not require every Cabinet minister to be present at
every Cabinet meeting; and the obligations of individual ministers may be
passive rather than active when the decision to be taken does not relate to
their spheres of administrative responsibility. At the same time, every
minister should be fully informed of the subject of discussion beforehand, so
that if he has any objections he may voice them at the meeting. He may not
repudiate, either in Parliament or in his constituency, policies which have
received Cabinet approval, nor may he adopt policies that have not been
agreed with the other departments concerned (including the Treasury). A
minister must also be prepared to vote with the Government on all issues,
GOVERNMENT
49
and where necessary to speak in support or defence of its policy; if he feels
himself unable to agree or to compromise with the view of the majority of
his colleagues in Parliament or elsewhere he must resign unless the Cabinet
has agreed otherwise. A minister who does not resign in these circumstances
cannot later reject criticism on the ground that he did not personally agree
with the policy adopted.
The doctrine of collective responsibility also means that the Cabinet is
bound to offer unanimous advice to the Sovereign, even when its members
do not hold identical views on a given subject.
The individual responsibility of a minister for the work of his department
means that, as political head of that department, he is answerable for all its
acts and omissions and must bear the consequences of any defect of admin¬
istration, any injustice to an individual or any aspect of policy which may be
criticised in Parliament, whether he is personally responsible or not. Since
the majority of ministers are members of the House of Commons, they are
available to answer questions and to defend themselves against criticism in
person. Departmental ministers who are in the House of Lords must be
represented in the Commons by someone qualified to speak on their behalf,
usually their Parliamentary or Under-Secretaries.
Departmental ministers are expected to take the final decision on all
matters relating to their spheres of administration, unless these are of such
political importance that Cabinet sanction is required. If any departmental
decision brings a minister under criticism in Parliament he may be upheld
by the Cabinet, which will then treat the matter as one of confidence in itself;
or he may be disowned, when he alone will be liable to lose office.
The responsibility of ministers for their departments is an effective way of
bringing government under public control, for the knowledge that any
departmental action may be reported to and examined in Parliament dis¬
courages the taking of arbitrary and ill-considered decisions.
GOVERNMENT DEPARTMENTS
Government departments are the main instruments for giving effect to the
Government’s policy when Parliament has passed the necessary legislation.
They may, and frequently do, work with and through local authorities,
statutory boards, and government-sponsored organisations operating under
varying degrees of Government control.
As a rule a change of Government does not immediately affect the number
or general functions of Government departments, although a radical change
in policy may be accompanied by some organisational change. The widening
scope of government activity in the past half-century has, however, led
gradually to the formation of many new departments. A few have existed
for over 200 years.
The work of some departments, for instance the Post Office and the Board
of Customs and Excise, covers the United Kingdom as a whole. Other
departments, for example the Ministry of Labour, cover Great Britain
(England and Wales, and Scotland, but not Northern Ireland); others, such
as the Ministry of Health, cover England and Wales only, and there are
similar but separate departments for Scotland and Northern Ireland. Some
departments, for instance the Ministry of Education, make special arrange¬
ments for Welsh affairs.
As a rule a department is headed by a minister. In the case of certain
departments in which questions of policy do not normally arise, the head is
5°
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
a permanent official, and a minister with other duties is responsible for them
to Parliament. For instance, Treasury ministers are responsible for a number
of departments, including H.M. Stationery Office, the Central Office of
Information, the Treasury Solicitor’s Department, the Department of the
Government Actuary, the Royal Mint, the National Debt Office, the Public
Works Loan Board, and the National Savings Committee. The staff of
departments are all members of the Civil Service, a body of Crown servants
recruited into the service as a career.
Departments differ in size and in the volume, type and complexity of their
work. Internal organisation varies from department to department since each
makes its own arrangements for discharging its duties, but certain features
are common to most departments: for example, the minister of a major
department is likely to have at the head of his officials a permanent secretary
(known as the Permanent Under-Secretary of State in those departments
where the minister is a Secretary of State), one or more deputy secretaries,
and a varying number of under-secretaries and assistant secretaries. In
addition, major departments usually have a principal finance officer and a
principal establishments and organisation officer. A number of departments
have their own organisation and methods (‘O and M’) branch, the members
of which act in an advisory capacity. Many departments also have their own
legal advisers or solicitors, and their own information division.
Some departments maintain a regional organisation, and some that have
direct contact with the public throughout the country also have local
offices. ,
Many Government departments are assisted by advisory bodies, which are
of three main kinds: consultative bodies, in which representatives of the
Government meet representatives of groups outside Government, expert
bodies which formulate recommendations for action in a particular field,
and bodies which have advisory status, but in practice decide matters for
themselves. The majority of these councils and committees (of which there
are several hundred) are permanent bodies attached to the main departments,
they are appointed by the relevant minister and their membership, apart
from civil servants, includes industrialists, trade unionists, university and
industrial scientists, local government officials and councillors, and experts
from many other walks of life.
In addition to these standing advisory bodies there are ad hoc committees
which the Government frequently sets up to examine and make recom¬
mendations on specific matters. For certain important inquiries a procedure
sometimes adopted is the appointment (by Royal Warrant) of a Royal Com¬
mission, whose members are selected on the grounds of their wide experience
and diverse knowledge of the subject under consideration. A Royal Com¬
mission examines written and oral evidence from Government departments
and other interested organisations and individuals, and on this evidence
submits a report. The Government may accept the Commission’s recom¬
mendations in whole or in part, or it may decide to take no further action or
to delay action until a later date. Public inquiries are also undertaken by
departmental committees, appointed by the head of the department concerned
with the subject of the terms of reference.
The following pages provide an outline of the principal functions of the
main Government departments. They are arranged in alphabetical order,
except for the Cabinet Office and the Treasury (which, in view of their
central position, are placed first) and the Scottish and Northern Ireland
departments (which are grouped at the end of the section). Further information

on the work undertaken by the various departments is given in later sections
of this handbook under the relevant subject headings.
The Cabinet Office, or Secretariat of the Cabinet, was instituted during the
first world war and has grown into an instrument of great importance in the
co-ordination of policy at the highest level. It exists primarily to assist ministers
in the exercise of their collective responsibility through the Cabinet and its
committees: its functions include the orderly arrangement of business, the
recording of meetings and drafting of reports; and it is responsible for the
security of all Cabinet documents. Attached to the Cabinet Office, and an
integral part of it, is the Central Statistical Office, which is charged with the
collection from departments of statistics relating to the national economy, their
analysis, and their preparation as an agreed body of statistics to assist the
Government in formulating its economic and financial policy.
Nominally the heads of the Treasury are the Lords Commissioners: the
First Lord of the Treasury (now always the Prime Minister), the Chancellor
of the Exchequer and five Junior Lords. In practice, the Lords Commissioners
never meet as a board and their responsibilities are carried by the Chancellor
of the Exchequer assisted by the Chief Secretary to the Treasury (a Cabinet
Minister) and two junior ministers, the Financial Secretary and the Economic
Secretary. There is also a Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasury, who is
the Chief Government Whip in the House of Commons.
The Treasury is responsible for the co-ordination of economic policy and
the control of public expenditure; it is also responsible for the efficient
management of the Civil Service, and is involved in the management of
other parts of the public service. Its financial and economic work is divided
into three functional groups dealing respectively with: financial and monetary
policy; public expenditure and resources; and co-ordination of economic
policy. The first of these groups covers overseas finance, home finance, aid
to territories overseas, and the inter-departmental co-ordination of external
economic policy; the second deals with public income and outlay in general
and with the main items of public expenditure; and the third is concerned
with the balance of the national economy as a whole and deals with short¬
term economic trends, long-term reviews of resources, problems of economic
growth, and incomes policy.
On the management side, the Treasury is organised in two functional
groups. The first group is responsible for developing management services
and supervising organisation and methods of work, and includes specialised
divisions concerned with recruiting, training, manning and grading in the
Civil Service; the second group comprises divisions concerned with pay and
conditions of public servants.
The Office of the Parliamentary Counsel is responsible for the drafting
of all Government Bills, except those Bills or provisions of Bills extending
exclusively to Scotland, which are handled by the Lord Advocate’s Depart¬
ment. The Office drafts all financial and other parliamentary motions and
amendments moved by the Government during the passage of Bills through
Parliament; it advises departments on questions of parliamentary procedure;
and it attends sittings of both Houses of Parliament, and of their committees.
In addition, the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel drafts delegated legis¬
lation when specially instructed, and advises the Government on legal,
parliamentary and constitutional questions falling within its special experi¬
ence.

BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
The Board of Admiralty1 consists of a number of Lords Commissioners
whose responsibilities are, briefly, to build, direct, maintain and administer
the Royal Navy within the framework of the Government’s naval defence
policy. The present Board comprises nine members (two ministerial, six naval
and one civil servant); the First Lord is the ministerial head of the depart¬
ment and the other members are responsible to him for specific duties. The
Board is served by three departmental groups: (i) the divisions of the naval
staff, responsible for advising on general and technical policy, strategy,
tactics, operational planning, the disposition of the Fleet, methods of naval
warfare, and material requirements; (2) the departments responsible for
advising on personnel and material policy, for providing the men (and their
training), for research and development projects, for providing the ships
(including their weapons and equipment) and supplies, for the general
organisation and administration of associated naval establishments at home
and abroad, and for stating (to the Ministry of Aviation) naval aircraft
requirements; and (3) the secretariat branches, which co-ordinate business,
provide advice on precedent and on general Government policy, supervise
the financial administration of the department, and receive, pay and account
for all money administered by the Department.
The Admiralty also administers the Royal Greenwich Observatory (now
at Herstmonceux) and the National Institute of Oceanography.
The Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food is responsible in England
and Wales for administering Government policy for agriculture, horticulture
and fishing. In the operational control of certain diseases of animals its
responsibilities extend to Scotland.
In England and Wales the Ministry also deals with certain questions
relating to the supply and manufacture of food, including its composition,

The Central African Office was set up in 1962 to take over the responsibilities
of the Commonwealth Relations Office for the Federation of Rhodesia and
Nyasaland and for the self-governing colony of Southern Rhodesia and those
of the Colonial Office for the protectorates of Northern Rhodesia and Nyasa¬
land. Responsibility for Central African Affairs is vested in the First Secretary
of State (see p. 46).
The Colonial Office is concerned with most of the dependent territories of
the United Kingdom. Each of these territories has its own administration
but the British Government has final responsibility for their good government
and for their relations with other countries. The staff of the Colonial Office
advise the Secretary of State for the Colonies on constitutional and other
developments in the territories, and organise the help they need. This includes
advice on economic and financial matters and defence; provision of financial
assistance under the Colonial Development and Welfare Acts and in other
ways; the administration of certain senior staff for the public services of the
dependent territories; and the fostering of understanding between the people
of Britain and the people of the dependent territories. In this work the Colonial
Office co-operates closely with other departments, particularly with the
Commonwealth Relations Office, the Foreign Office, and the Department of
Technical Co-operation.
The Commonwealth Relations Office links the British Government with the
Governments of the other member nations of the Commonwealth.
The duties of the Department are: to advise the Secretary of State for
Commonwealth Relations and the Colonies on policy affecting the other
members of the Commonwealth; to co-ordinate the work of the various
United Kingdom departments in so far as other Commonwealth countries
are concerned; to arrange consultation with other members of the Common¬
wealth on all matters of common concern; and to act as the main channel of
communication through which information is exchanged.
The Secretary of State also maintains relations with the Irish Republic
which, although no longer part of the Commonwealth, is not treated as a
foreign country.
The primary work of the Board of Customs and Excise is to collect and
administer the customs and excise duties imposed in the annual Finance Acts
or by other legislation, and to advise the Chancellor of the Exchequer on
any matters connected with them. The Board is also responsible for preventing
and detecting evasion of the revenue laws, including smuggling and illicit
distillation.
In addition to its revenue work, the Board undertakes a wide range of
non-revenue agency work for other departments, for instance, the enforcement
of prohibitions and restrictions on the importation and exportation of certain
classes of goods, exchange currency control, and the compilation of United
Kingdom overseas trade statistics from customs import and export documents.
The Ministry of Defence1 is responsible for the formulation of defence policy
and the allocation of defence expenditure; it is also responsible for the
execution of joint Service operations. It co-ordinates, through the Chiefs of

the supply, training and superannuation of teachers, the building of new
schools and other institutions, the school health service, the special educational
treatment of handicapped children, and the provision of school meals and
milk. In these spheres of activity the Ministry works in co-operation with
the local education authorities—the councils of the counties and of the county
boroughs—whose duty it is to secure adequate facilities for all forms of
education in their areas. On professional matters, contact with the local
education authorities is maintained through Her Majesty’s Inspectorate of
Schools, which is organised in regional divisions throughout England and
Wales for its work of inspection, liaison and advice. A separate Welsh
Department of the Ministry of Education deals with education in Wales.
As the department concerned with education generally, the Ministry is
responsible for policy regarding awards for university students; for the
administration of the Victoria and Albert Museum and the Science Museum,
London; and for the maintenance of educational relations with other countries

United Kingdom grant to the Commonwealth Institute,1 some of the governors
being appointed by the Minister of Education.
The Foreign Office is the headquarters of the Foreign Service. The minister
responsible to Parliament for the conduct of foreign affairs and for the
direction and operation of the Foreign Service is the Secretary of State for
Foreign Affairs.
The Foreign Office acts as a channel of communication between the United
Kingdom Government and the Governments of foreign States, either through
the representatives of foreign States in the United Kingdom or through Her
Majesty’s representatives abroad, for the discussion and negotiation of all
matters falling within the field of international relations, including the drawing
up of international treaties and agreements. It also provides the means by
which the United Kingdom Government is represented in the United
Nations and on other international bodies2 and is kept informed of develop-

Some Government departments are wholly dependent on the Treasury
Solicitor for their legal work; others have their own legal staffs for a proportion
of the work and draw on the Treasury Solicitor for special advice, and often,
for conveyancing; and others, whose administrative work is based on or deals

for the administration of funds provided by the United Kingdom Government
under the Colombo Plan, the Special Commonwealth Assistance Plan for
Africa (SCAAP) and other programmes of technical assistance. Its activities
include the recruitment of staff in response to requests from overseas Govern¬
ments and international organisations and meeting requests by overseas
Governments for assistance in the training of their nationals in the United
Kingdom. It administers the Overseas Service Aid Scheme, under which
Britain reimburses to certain Commonwealth independent and dependent
Governments part of the cost of employing experienced staff to help with
government until they can be replaced by local people.
The Department has a responsibility for the Directorates of Overseas
(Geodetic and Topographical) Surveys and Overseas Geological Surveys,
and the Anti-Locust Research Centre; it co-operates with other organisations
in the United Kingdom concerned with technical assistance.
The Board of Trade, under the President of the Board of Trade, has a general
responsibility in respect of the United Kingdom’s commerce, industry and
overseas trade, including commercial relations with other countries, import
and export trade, the protective tariff, industrial development and consumer
protection. It is also responsible for (i) the promotion of exports, (2) statistics
of trade and industry (both at home and abroad), including the censuses of
production and distribution, and (3) the administration of certain regulative
legislation, for example in relation to patents, registered designs, copyright,
trade marks, weights and measures, merchandise marks, companies, bank¬
ruptcy, insurance, distribution of industry, films, and enemy property.
In addition, the Board of Trade is the department generally responsible
for Government relations with all industries which are not specifically the
concern of other departments. In this connection, it provides both a channel
of communication with and a point of contact for these industries, and a
central place at which knowledge about them is accumulated, analysed, and
used as a basis for advising ministers and other departments. The main

industries which fall outside the scope of the Board of Trade’s specific
concern are food, agriculture and fisheries, building and quarrying, iron and
steel, shipbuilding, fuel and power, and transport.
The Ministry of Transport has powers and duties relating to inland transport,
shipping and shipbuilding.
As the department responsible for inland transport, the Ministry has
certain statutory duties relating to railways, roads, road transport and inland
waterways. The Minister of Transport appoints the members of the nation¬
alised transport boards (British Railways Board, London Transport Board,
British Transport Docks Board, British Waterways Board and Transport
Holding Company) and agrees the general lines on which their development
programmes are drawn up. He is the highway authority for trunk roads and
motorways in England and Wales, allocates the funds provided by Parliament
for road expenditure in England and Wales (including grants for classified
roads vested in local authorities) and has many powers and duties relating
to road traffic and safety.
On the shipping side, the Ministry is generally responsible for Government
policy towards the shipping industry and for promoting its prosperity in
the international field. The Ministry administers the provisions of the
Merchant Shipping Acts in regard to ships, their masters, officers and men;
safety of life at sea; navigation (including pilotage, lighthouses and other
aids to safety in navigation); and wreck and salvage. It is also responsible
for the provision and operation of troopships and for the Coastguard Service,
and is concerned with harbours, docks, piers and river conservancy.
The Ministry is further responsible for the ship and boat-building, ship
repairing and marine engineering industries. It advises the Government on
the state and prospects of those industries and seeks to help them within
the framework of Government policy.
The Secretary of State for War1 presides over the Army Council, which is
composed of military and civilian members and is responsible for the admin¬
istrative control of the Army. The functions of the War Office include the
planning of operations and training; the collection and sifting of military
information; the research, development and production of all arms and
equipment for the Army (except aircraft, guided and nuclear weapons and
electronic equipment for which the Ministry of Aviation is responsible); the
determination of financial and labour policy connected with the Army,
including appointments, promotions, postings and payment; and the super¬
vision of War Office civilian staffs both at home and abroad.
The War Office is also responsible for most of the Royal Ordnance factories
(which produce certain stores and equipment for all three Services and other
users, such as Government departments and some overseas countries) and
for the greater part of the disposal of surplus Service equipment.
The Secretary of State is responsible in Scotland for a wide range of functions
which in England and Wales are divided among a number of departmental
ministers. He is assisted at ministerial level by a Minister of State and three
Parliamentary Under-Secretaries of State. There are also two Scottish Law
Officers.
The Secretary of State’s functions are discharged by four main depart¬
ments of equal status (the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries for

a Secretary responsible to the Secretary of State.
The day-to-day administration of the departments is conducted in Edin¬
burgh, but each department has representatives in London for liaison and
parliamentary duties. The London office is generally known as the Scottish
Office, the term also used to describe all Scottish administration for which
the Secretary of State is responsible.
The Scottish Ministers are advised and assisted (particularly in relation
to questions with which more than one of the departments are concerned
or which fall outside the province of any of them) by the Permanent
Under-Secretary of State, Scottish Office, who is free from departmental
duties.
The Department has a general responsibility for, and in most cases admin¬
isters, Government measures for the promotion and development of farming
in Scotland. Its functions include: the administration of guaranteed prices
for the major farm products, fixed by the Government after consultation with
the industry; the provision of grants and subsidies and other services to
agriculture; duties in connection with the use and improvement of land and
the improvement of farm stock and crops; the application of measures for
controlling plant diseases and pests and for treating infestations in stored food;
the management of the agricultural properties owned by the Secretary of
State; the administration of grants towards the work of the eight research
institutes in Scotland and the educational and advisory services provided by
the three agricultural colleges; regulatory duties affecting animal health; the
promotion of measures for the safety, health and welfare of agricultural
workers; the regulation of agricultural wages; and the stimulation of rural
industries. In certain of these functions the Department is assisted by eleven
agricultural executive committees, constituted of members of the agricultural
industry and organised on an area basis.
The Department has responsibilities for the oversight and protection of
the Scottish inshore, deep sea and fresh-water fisheries. It also has functions
relating to harbours, to steamer services in the Highlands and Islands and to
general questions concerning Highland development.
The Scottish Development Department is concerned with a number of the
main services affecting the physical development of Scotland, such as town
and country planning (including new towns), housing, roads, water supplies
and sewerage, and the prevention of river and air pollution (most of which
are administered locally by town and county councils); and it administers
the Secretary of State’s functions in regard to the Electricity Boards in
Scotland. The Department is responsible for general policy in regard to local
government, including valuation and rating, and for the allocation of the
Exchequer general and equalisation grants. Its work also includes advising
the Secretary of State on Scottish economic development generally.
The Scottish Education Department is responsible for supervising the
administration of the Education (Scotland) Acts and for guiding the develop¬
ment of public education in Scotland in all its forms. The Department’s
functions include: the supervision of the training of teachers and the issue
of teachers’ certificates; the regulation of teachers’ salaries and the adminis¬
tration of the Teachers (Superannuation) (Scotland) Regulations; the control

and distribution of specific Exchequer grants in aid of educational expenditure;
the award of students’ allowances to those taking full-time courses at universi¬
ties and colleges of education; and the conducting of the annual examination
for the Scottish Certificate of Education. The Department also exercises
general supervision over the child care and adoption services, remand homes,
and approved schools; and it is concerned with the administration of the
Royal Scottish Museum.
The Scottish Home and Health Department is responsible for: (a) the
central administration of functions relating to law and order; and (b) the
health and welfare services in Scotland. Under (a) the Department is con¬
cerned with the police and probation services, criminal justice, legal aid and
the services needed by the courts, and is directly responsible for the adminis¬
tration of prisons and borstal institutions. It is also the central authority in
Scotland for the fire service, for civil defence, and for legislation concerning
shops, theatres, cinemas and licensed premises (which are directly maintained
by the Department in districts in which State management is in operation).
Under (b) the Department is responsible for the administration of the National
Health Service, comprising the hospital service, the general medical, dental
and ophthalmic services and the local authority health services. Its work in
connection with the associated welfare services includes the supervision of
local arrangements for the aged and handicapped, and medical and surgical
treatment for war pensioners.
In addition to the main departments, there are a number of other Scottish
departments, all of which work in varying degrees under the direction of the
Secretary of State. Such departments include the Scottish Information
Office, which undertakes information services on behalf of the Scottish
departments and, in some degree, for Great Britain departments in Scotland,
and acts as the agent in Scotland of the Central Office of Information; the
Department of the Registrar-General for Scotland (the General Registry
Office); the Scottish Record Office; and the Department of the Registers
of Scotland. There are also Scottish branches of the Great Britain and
United Kingdom departments under the direction of controllers, who are
responsible for ensuring that the execution in Scotland of the policy and
procedure of their departments is in accordance with Scottish conditions
and needs.
The Law Officers of the Crown for Scotland (the Lord Advocate and the
Solicitor General for Scotland) are the chief legal advisers to the Government
on Scottish questions and the principal representatives of the Crown for the
purposes of litigation in Scotland. The Lord Advocate is also closely concerned
with questions of legal policy and administration and is himself responsible
for the institution and direction of all prosecutions on indictment in Scotland,
and the control of summary prosecutions in the sheriff court.
In some of this work the Lord Advocate is assisted by the Lord Advocate s
Department, the members of which also act as departmental advisers on
Scottish questions to certain Government departments who have no Scottish
legal adviser of their own. The work relevant to prosecutions is centred in the
Crown Office in Edinburgh.
The Parliamentary Draftsmen for Scotland are incorporated in the Lord
Advocate’s Department and are responsible to the minister concerned and
to the Law Officers for the drafting of all Government Bills in so far as they

affect the law of Scotland. Their responsibilities in this connection are
similar to those of the Parliamentary Counsel to the Treasury.
Executive and administrative powers in connection with matters over which
the Northern Ireland Parliament has jurisdiction are vested in the Crown,
and exercised by the Governor, acting on the advice of the Northern Ireland
Cabinet, through a number of departments. Each of the seven ministries
(Agriculture, Commerce, Education, Finance, Health and Local Government,
Home Affairs, and Labour and National Insurance) is under the control of
a minister responsible to the Northern Ireland Parliament. In addition, there
are a National Assistance Board and an Exchequer and Audit Department
which, together with the Ministries of Home Affairs, Education, and Agri¬
culture have functions indicated by their titles. The other departments have
duties of a varied nature, which are summarised below.
The Ministry of The Ministry of Commerce is concerned with industrial information and
Commerce statistical services; the progress of industrial production and trade in
Northern Ireland; the development of existing enterprises and the attraction
of new ones; and the administration of schemes of financial assistance to
industry. The department also has responsibilities in relation to electricity
and gas undertakings; harbours; the tourist trade; the regulation and
inspection of mines and quarries; mineral development; scientific develop¬
ment; weights and measures; the registration of companies and friendly
societies; and the administration of the Assurance Companies Acts and the
Industrial Assurance Acts.
The Ministry of In addition to acting as Treasury to the Government of Northern Ireland,
Finance the Ministry of Finance is responsible for matters connected with recruit¬
ment and staffing of the Northern Ireland Civil Service; Government works
services, including agency services for certain departments of the United
Kingdom Government; the preservation of ancient monuments; valuation
and ordnance survey; the Public Record Office; the Registrar General’s
Office; the Land Registry and the Registry of Deeds.
Other functions of the Ministry include the issue of Ulster savings
securities; the collection of death duty, stamp duty and certain transferred
excise duties; work in connection with land purchase annuities; statute law
revision; certain duties in relation to charitable donations and bequests; the
control of borrowing; and the payment of university grants. The Office of the
Parliamentary Draftsmen, which prepares Bills for introduction into Parlia¬
ment, is attached to the Ministry.
The Ministry of The Ministry of Health and Local Government is responsible for the general
Health and supervision of the Health Service in Northern Ireland, which is broadly
Local similar to the National Health Service in Great Britain: the administration
Government of the various aspects of the service is in the hands of the Hospitals Authority,
the General Health Services Board, and the local health authorities. The
Ministry also exercises functions under the Housing Acts (Northern Ireland),
supervising the house-building programmes of, and distributing grants to,
local housing authorities and the Northern Ireland Housing Trust. It also
supervises various other functions of local authorities, including planning,
public health, welfare, water, and sewerage services (many of which attract
specific grants-in-aid) and it controls the issue of central financial aid to local
authorities.

The Ministry of Labour and National Insurance is responsible for the
administration of the Factories Acts and other legislation connected with
industrial health and welfare; for the promotion in industry of joint machinery
for negotiation and for assistance in the prevention and settlement of in¬
dustrial disputes; for the administration of the Wages Councils Act; for
the administration of local employment offices and training centres and the
machinery for dealing with employment questions of all kinds under the
Employment and Training Act, the Youth Employment Service Act, and
the Disabled Persons (Employment) Act; for the administration of the National
Insurance Acts and the National Insurance (Industrial Injuries) Acts, and
of the Family Allowances Acts; and for carrying out certain statutory
functions in connection with the National Assistance scheme in conjunction
with the National Assistance Board for Northern Ireland.
THE CIVIL SERVICE
A civil servant in Britain is a servant of the Crown (not being the holder of
a political or judicial office), who is employed in a civil capacity and whose
remuneration is found wholly and directly out of money voted by Parliament.
The number of civil servants under this definition is about a million, for it
includes several hundred thousand Government industrial employees in such
establishments as Royal Ordnance factories and Admiralty dockyards. The
term ‘Civil Service’ is, however, generally used only to cover ‘non-industrial’
members of the staffs of the various Government departments in the United
Kingdom or working overseas either in the Foreign Service or for other
Government departments such as the Commonwealth Relations Office. The
total number of non-industrial civil servants employed in all departments,
at home and overseas, is over 680,ooo1; one-third are women.
Although the civil servant is legally a servant of the Crown, in practice
he serves the minister in charge of the department in which he works by
advising on the formulation of policy and by carrying out policy decisions
once they have been taken. From time to time the minister changes but the
civil servant remains to serve his successor. In Britain changes of government
do not involve changes in departmental personnel, since it is considered that
continuity makes for administrative stability.
The Civil Service in its present form is a product of the past hundred years.
Before then, departments were free to choose their own staffs, qualifying
standards were unknown, there was no central supervision, and political
jobbery was rife. Measures of reform instigated during the nineteenth
century included the substitution of open competition for the practice of
obtaining civil service appointments by favour or purchase, and the establish¬
ment of an independent body, the Civil Service Commission, to organise
recruitment to the service. The great expansion in State activity which has
taken place during the last fifty years, and the consequent expansion in the
numbers of civil servants and the scope of their duties, have led to further
reorganisation: recruitment competitions have been adapted to a developing
educational system; co-ordination between the various departments has been
improved; and many commissions and committees of inquiry have been
appointed by the Government to make recommendations for increased
efficiency in the conduct of public business. Moreover, civil servants, though

they remain employees of their departments, have become members of an
integrated service with common conditions of employment and their traditions
and standards of conduct belong, not to individual departments, but to the
Civil Service as a whole.
Uniformity in the Civil Service derives mainly from the fact that the
Treasury exercises general control. One of the two Joint Permanent Secre¬
taries to the Treasury is the official head of the Home Civil Service and the
principal adviser of the Prime Minister on matters affecting the Civil Service
as a whole, and in particular on appointments to senior posts in the service.
The Treasury is responsible for the salaries and conditions of employment
of civil servants; it controls total number of staff and the creation of higher
posts, maintains a central organisation and methods division which serves
all departments which do not maintain an organisation and methods branch
of their own, and deals with general questions relating to training after entry
into the Civil Service. It is also concerned with the number of departments
and the distribution of functions.
Because modern government touches almost every aspect of life, the Civil
Service comprises officers with a wide variety of professional and technical
qualifications. Where officers of a particular type are required in more than
one department they are organised in general service or linked departmental
classes. This ensures similar grading and salary structures for the same type
of officer in each department. The main classes are:
1. The Administrative Class, which is responsible for advising ministers on
policy, for dealing with any difficulties which may arise in carrying out
existing policy and for forecasting the probable effects of new measures
and regulations. This relatively small class, which numbers about 2,550,
is recruited largely from the universities: non-graduates, however, form
at least one-third of the total.
2. The Executive Classes (General and Departmental, numbering some
73,000), which are responsible for the day-to-day conduct of Government
business, including, for instance, the higher work of accounts and
revenue collection, within the framework of established policy. Members
of these classes may, after entry, train for specialist work such as that of
auditor, actuary or statistician.
3. The Specialist Classes, which number about 120,000 in a variety of
different categories, carry out the wide range of specialised activities
which are now undertaken by the Government. The categories include
accountants, architects, doctors, engineers, lawyers, surveyors and
scientists in all branches of science. The professionally qualified staff
are assisted by a large number of technical and drawing office staffs.
4. The Clerical Class (the largest of the main classes, comprising about
126,000 officers), which undertakes all the usual clerical work involved
in running departmental business, for instance, the preparation of
accounts and the keeping of records, the handling of particular claims
in accordance with known rules, and the summarising and annotation
of documents for the assistance of senior officers.
5. The Ancillary Clerical Classes (with about 100,000 members), which
include clerical assistants, shorthand typists and typists, duplicator
operators and a rapidly increasing number of machine-operating grades.

6. Messengerial and Minor Classes (with some 34,000 members) which, in
addition to messengers, include paper keepers, office cleaners and
similar workers.
In addition there are departmental classes where employment is peculiar
to one department. The main example is the Post Office with its postmen
(112,000), telephone operators (56,000), postal and telegraph officers (22,000)
and a wide range of staff for the installation, maintenance and development
of the telephone, telegraph and wireless systems. Other examples are the
Factory Inspectorate of the Ministry of Labour and the Schools Inspectorate
of the Ministry of Education.
The Government of Northern Ireland has its own Civil Service which deals
with matters transferred to its jurisdiction under the Government of Ireland
Act, 1920. Subject to regional differences, the Northern Ireland Civil Service
is modelled on its counterpart in Great Britain, but recruitment to permanent
and pensionable posts is effected through the medium of a separate Civil
Service Commission. Interchange of staff between the two Civil Services
occurs to a minor extent only, and is a matter for departmental agreement
in individual cases.
Her Majesty’s Foreign Service is a separate self-contained service of the
Crown, which provides an interchangeable staff (numbering about 4,000, some
of whom are unestablished) for service both at home and at United Kingdom
diplomatic missions and consular posts in foreign countries.1
The classes of the Foreign Service have their own nomenclature: Branch A
corresponds roughly to the administrative class of the Home Civil Service;
Branch B to the executive and clerical classes; and Branch C to the typing
class. Branch D carries out security and guard duties at Foreign Service
posts abroad, and Branch T technical duties in the Foreign Office and at
Foreign Service posts abroad. There are no equivalents of Branches D and T
in the Home Civil Service. Members of Branches A and B may be employed
on any type of Foreign Service work—diplomatic, consular, commercial and
‘information’. In addition, various specialists and advisers who are seconded
from the armed forces and from home Government departments (for instance,
those concerned with financial, commercial or labour matters) are often
attached to overseas posts. At many posts abroad some of the staff are locally
engaged on a ‘temporary’ basis, i.e. they do not normally qualify for pensions.
Overseas governments fill vacancies in their public services by the appoint¬
ment of suitably qualified local candidates wherever possible; but because
not all vacancies can be filled in this way, the Department of Technical
Co-operation and the Crown Agents for Oversea Governments and Admin¬
istrations are asked to recruit other candidates, principally from the United
Kingdom.
The recruitment of all permanent civil servants in the Home Civil Service of
Great Britain and the Foreign Service is in the hands of the Civil Service
Commission which, in the selection of entrants, is independent of both
ministerial and parliamentary control; its members are appointed by the
1 United Kingdom diplomatic posts in other independent Commonwealth countries are
normally staffed from the Commonwealth Relations Office and (in respect of the Trade
Commissioners’ Offices associated with them) from the Board of Trade.

Crown on the advice of the Government. The normal method of entry is by
open competition, conducted in accordance with regulations approved by
the Treasury and consisting of written examinations or interviews, or both.
The main points of entry into the main classes of the Home Civil Service
are planned to correspond to definite levels in the British educational
system, and it is the Commission’s duty to study the requirements of the
Civil Service in the light of the education provided by the schools and
universities.
Temporary civil servants, who do not qualify for pensions but are eligible
for gratuities, are normally recruited by the department concerned. No
qualifying examinations are required for entrance on a temporary basis to
the general service.
Each of the larger Government departments has a training officer and a
number of instructors, who organise both general and technical courses,
ranging from courses of systematic instruction for recruits in all classes to
‘refresher’ courses covering technical subjects or broader subjects such as
management and supervision for more experienced staff.
Methods of training include discussion groups, case studies, instructional
films, and educational visits to enable civil servants to study the working of
appropriate outside bodies. Officers in the early years of their service may be
transferred from branch to branch and, more rarely, from department to
department, in order that they may gain as wide an experience as possible of
Civil Service activities, and there are openings for selected officers to travel
abroad or to study at universities and other educational establishments.
Special facilities are also available for officers who take up private studies,
the degree of assistance depending upon the vocational value of the
subject.
Training is co-ordinated by the Training and Education Division of the
Treasury, which also runs central courses for members of the administrative,
professional and scientific classes at different stages of their careers. In
addition, the division trains departmental instructors and other special
groups, for instance, superintendents of typists, audio-typists, and secretaries.
A period of probation (lasting from one to two years according to grade, with
extensions in certain instances) is the rule for all new entrants to the permanent
Civil Service. Promotions from grade to grade are made by departments;
those from class to class partly through centrally conducted competitions (open
only to serving members of specified Civil Service classes), and partly by
departments themselves. All promotions to the administrative class from
other classes require Treasury approval. Promotions to most of the highest
positions in the Civil Service, i.e. permanent secretary, deputy secretary,
principal establishments officer and principal finance officer, must be approved
by the Prime Minister; he is advised in these matters by the official head of
the Home Civil Service.
Machinery for negotiation on conditions of service affecting the Civil Service
as a whole is provided by the National Whitley Council,1 which is composed
jointly of official and staff representatives. Negotiating machinery for separate
1 Whitley Councils are representative bodies for negotiation and joint consultation
between managements and staffs; the councils are named after Mr. J. H. Whitley,
former Speaker of the House of Commons and chairman of a committee which investi¬
gated industrial unrest from 1916 to 1919.

sections of the service is provided through the various staff associations which
civil servants are encouraged to join (for instance, the Civil Service Clerical
Association, the Union of Post Office Workers, the Society of Civil Servants,
the Institution of Professional Civil Servants, and the Association of First
Division Civil Servants), and through departmental Whitley Councils (of
which there are about 70).
In general, the civil servant receives a salary which is intended to compare
fairly with that paid for similar work outside the service, and usually he
receives annual increments up to the maximum of the scale of the grade to
which he belongs. In addition, although a civil servant holds office at the
pleasure of the Crown and may therefore be dismissed at any time, in practice
he enjoys a considerable measure of security of tenure. Thus every permanent
civil servant may reasonably expect a full career in the public service, and a
pension on retirement—though this, again, is not a legal right.
Civil servants are generally ‘conditioned’ to a given number of hours of
attendance a week. Overtime is paid to members of most of the lower salary
groups if they work longer than their ‘conditioned’ hours. The standard
working week for office staffs is 42 hours in London and 44 hours in the
provinces. Annual leave varies according to grade up to a maximum of six
weeks, i.e. 30 working days, a year. Sick leave on full pay, less any national
insurance benefit received, may be granted to permanent civil servants for
up to six months in any twelve months, and on reduced pay up to a maximum
of one year’s sick leave in any four years.
Officially, the position and functions of a civil servant remain the same
whichever political party is in power; and it is his duty to serve the government
of the day irrespective of his own political opinion. The extent to which a
civil servant, as a private individual, is free to participate in political activities
varies according to grade. For this purpose civil servants are divided into
three groups: those who are completely free to engage in all kinds of national
and local political activities (although if they intend standing for Parliament,
they must resign their appointment before nomination day1); those who are
free, subject to the acceptance of the need for discretion and with the per¬
mission of the department, to take part in most activities except parliamentary
candidature; and those who are debarred from national political activities
though they may seek permission to take part in local government and
political activities in the local field. In the non-industrial Civil Service, the
completely free groups are the manipulative grades of the Post Office, and
the minor grades such as cleaners and messengers. The intermediate group
includes mainly clerical and typing grades, and the granting of permission
by the department depends, broadly, on the work that they do. The group
which is not allowed to take part in national political activities includes the
executive, the professional, the scientific and technical, and the administrative
grades. In general, because the reputation of the service must be closely
guarded, permission to take part in local political activities will be refused
to members of this group if the local activities are conducted on the same
party lines and through the same party organisations as national political
activities. Where permission is granted, it is subject to a code of discretion
and to the obligation to notify the department of election or co-option to a
local council.
1 Any civil servant not elected will be reinstated in his previous capacity on application
within a week of the declaration of an election result.

Government
Civil servants of every grade may, of course, exercise the right of all
citizens to register their private political opinions on appropriate occasions,
for instance, at general elections or at local authority elections.
The private political views of civil servants are not as a general rule a
matter of official concern, but there are duties in which secrecy is so vitally
important to State security that the Government does not feel itself justified
in employing any one to carry them out whose reliability is in doubt. For
this reason no one who is known to be a member of, or actively associated
or in sympathy with, the Communist Party or with Fascist organisations is
employed in connection with secret work. Otherwise, every civil servant may
engage in such private activities as he wishes, provided that these do not in
any way conflict with his official duties, nor with the provisions of the Official
Secrets Acts of 1911 and 1920 and the Prevention of Corruption Act of 1906.
A civil servant must not, however, use his official position to further his
private interest; and he is therefore subject to restrictions in matters of
commerce and business from which the ordinary citizen is free, for instance, he
may not hold private interests in public contracts; and he may not use official
information in writing, broadcasting or lecturing without the express approval
of his department. Above all, a civil servant is expected to conform to the high
standards of integrity which characterise the service to which he belongs.
LOCAL GOVERNMENT
Government on a local basis has been part of the administrative system of
the United Kingdom for many centuries. In its present shape it dates back
to the late nineteenth century, when the conception of a comprehensive
system of locally elected councils to manage various services provided for the
benefit of the community was first incorporated in statute law. The large
increase in population since that time, and the equally massive transformation
in the range, complexity and scale of local authority functions, have made
it necessary to review local government throughout England and \\ ales.
In Greater London the system is to be reorganised and proposals have been
made in other areas (see p. 80) for a new structure more closely related to
contemporary and possible future needs.
Local authorities are set up under the authority of Parliament, and their
powers and duties are defined by Acts of Parliament. Basically councils are
responsible to the law and to the local electors and not to the central Govern¬
ment. They determine their own budgets, and no minister of the Crown has
power to suspend or dismiss them, nor to inquire into the way in which they
organise their business. However, in respect of certain sen ices, Acts of
Parliament dealing with local government give ministers of the Crown
defined powers, some of which are designed to secure a measure of national
uniformity in the standard of service provided, or to safeguard public health,
while others are for the protection of the rights of individual citizens. For
some services the minister concerned has wide powers of supervision; for
some there are strictly limited powers; for others no provision at all is made
for ministerial supervision.
In addition to their statutory powers, ministers concerned with local
government give assistance to local authorities by the general issue of ad\ isory
circulars and by giving advice in individual cases.
The Ministry of Housing and Local Government is the main link between
local authorities and the central Government in England and Wales; in

Scotland the Scottish Development Department is responsible for general
policy in regard to local government; and in Northern Ireland the Ministry
of Health and Local Government.
The main pattern of local government organisation in England and Wales
and Northern Ireland is a division of the country into county boroughs and
administrative counties. The county boroughs (mostly with populations of
over 75,000) are separate from the counties and independent of them. The
administrative counties are sub-divided into smaller units. In the county of
London, the whole of which is a built-up area, these consist of metropolitan
boroughs and the City; in the remaining counties they consist of county
districts—non-county boroughs, urban districts and rural districts, the last-
named being further divided into parishes1 (except in Northern Ireland).
Scotland is divided into counties (including four counties of cities) which are
independently administered; large and small burghs, and districts. Each local
authority division is administered by its own elected council as follows:
in London, the County Council, the Corporation of the City of London
and 28 metropolitan borough councils;
elsewhere in England and Wales, 61 county councils, 83 county borough
councils, 317 non-county borough councils, 564 urban district councils,
474 rural district councils,2 about 7,500 parish councils and some 3,300
parish meetings (in parishes not large enough to have a parish council);
in Scotland, 33 county councils (two pairs being combined for certain
purposes), 198 town councils (including four for counties of cities) and
199 district councils (two counties not being divided into districts);
and
in Northern Ireland, two county borough councils, 6 county councils,
9 non-county borough councils, 25 urban district councils and 31 rural
district councils.
Local councils comprise a number of unpaid elected councillors (and, in some
cases, aldermen elected by the councillors), presided over by a chairman who
has varied ceremonial and civic duties to perform in addition to his work
on the council. In most boroughs of England and Wales and Northern
Ireland the chairman is the Mayor; in the City of London and certain
important boroughs, the Lord Mayor; in the Scottish counties, the Convener;
and in the burghs, the Provost or Lord Provost.
The normal term of office of a councillor elected to any form of local
government is three years; aldermen hold office for six years. In some local
authority areas the whole council retires every third year and another is
elected immediately; in other areas elections are held annually, when one-third
of the councillors retire. Procedure at local government elections is governed
by rules laid down by the Representation of the People Act, 1949.
Any person (including a member of the House of Lords) is entitled to
vote at a local government election provided that he or she is 21 years of age
or over on the qualifying date, is a British subject or a citizen of the Irish
Republic, is not subject to any legal incapacity and is registered as a local
government elector for the area for which the election is held. In Great

BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Britain a person qualifies for registration as a local government elector if,
on the qualifying date for the register (compiled annually), he or she is
resident in the council area or occupies therein, as owner or tenant, any
rateable land or premises of a yearly value of not less than £10. In Northern
Ireland, in order to qualify for registration as a local government elector, a
person must have been born in Northern Ireland or, alternatively, have
resided continuously in the United Kingdom for seven years immediately
prior to the qualifying date and must have either a resident occupier’s or a
general occupier’s qualification.
Voting takes place at polling stations arranged by the council concerned,
and under the supervision of a presiding officer appointed for the purpose.
The procedure for local government voting in Great Britain is similar to that
for parliamentary elections, although facilities for postal voting are more
restricted. Each elector has one vote for each seat contested in his electoral
area; he need not record all his votes, but must not give more than one vote
for each candidate.
Most candidates for election as councillor stand as representatives of one
of the national political parties; a few stand as members of an association
representing some local interest, or as independents. Each candidate must
be nominated by two electors, as proposer and seconder; and in England
and Wales (except in elections for metropolitan borough councils, rural
district councils and parish councils) eight other electors for the area must
assent to the nomination. In Scotland each county and district council
candidate requires two proposers and each town council candidate a proposer
and five assenters. Candidates must be of British nationality, over 21 years
of age, and must (1) be registered as local government electors in the register
of electors for the area for which they seek election, or (2) have resided
within that area during the whole of the twelve months preceding the election
(or within 3 miles in the case of parish councils), or (3) in England and Wales,
own freehold or leasehold land in the area. Candidates are also subject to a
number of statutory disqualifications designed to ensure that unsuitable
persons do not offer themselves for election.
Procedure at local government elections in Northern Ireland is governed by
electoral regulations made by the Ministry of Home Affairs for Northern
Ireland. These regulations are, in general, similar to those which apply in
Great Britain, though differing in certain particulars; for example, the town
clerk or the clerk to the council is the returning officer for all elections to the
authority; there is no postal voting and the only persons who may vote by
proxy are Service voters.
Just as Great Britain as a whole is divided into constituencies for the
purpose of parliamentary elections, so, for local council elections, most local
authority areas are divided into electoral districts. Administrative counties
are split up, in accordance with orders made by the Secretary of State for
the Home Department, the Minister of Housing and Local Government or
the Secretary of State for Scotland, into ‘electoral divisions’. Boroughs,
urban districts and rural districts in England and Wales, and burghs in
Scotland, are either divided into ‘wards’, or, if they are small, left as single
units. In rural districts the wards are based on parishes which, if large enough,
may be split into parish wards.
Outside London, county divisions each return one member. The LCC
electoral divisions (which cover the same areas as the London parliamentary
constituencies) return three members each; in other types of local authority
area each ward may return one or more members.

Functions and
Services
It is the primary duty of every local authority to provide and administer
such environmental and social services as Acts of Parliament require it to
provide and administer. It may provide additional services under the per¬
missive powers of a general Act or under powers granted to it by local or
Private Bill legislation.
The responsibilities of local authorities depend upon their type, as follows:
in England (outside the County of London) and Wales county borough
councils are all-purpose authorities, while both county councils and county
district councils have particular functions allotted to them,1 which they
exercise independently to a considerable extent, although there is a certain
degree of delegation from county councils to county district councils, especially
of duties connected with town and country planning and the education,
health and welfare services. Parish councils or parish meetings have a few
functions which they may exercise of right. In Scotland the town councils
of the counties of cities are all-purpose authorities; elsewhere, the county
councils, the town councils and the district councils all share in local govern¬
ment work. In Northern Ireland the position is broadly similar to that in
England and Wales, except that local authorities are not called upon to
provide or administer police, civil defence or (except in Belfast) fire services;
moreover county councils do not in general delegate any of their functions
to county district councils.
The broad principle underlying the distribution of powers and duties
between the London County Council (LCC) and the metropolitan borough
councils is that all those powers and duties which require uniformity of
action throughout the whole of London should be administered by the LCC,
while those that can be locally managed should be vested in the borough
councils. In the City of London (an area of approximately one square mile
in the centre of the metropolis) the City Corporation exercises the general
powers administered and duties performed by the metropolitan borough
councils, and also a number of functions which, in the rest of London, devolve
on the LCC. The City Corporation is not, however, an all-purpose authority,
since certain services in the City (for instance, education) are administered
by the LCC.
Local authority services may be classified under three heads: environ¬
mental, protective and personal. The environmental services are designed
to secure local good order, amenity and public health. They include the
inspection and abatement of nuisances, drainage, sewerage, street cleansing,
refuse collection and disposal, litter prevention, rodent control, the super¬
vision of water supplies, measures for ensuring food hygiene and for preventing
air pollution, and the provision of baths and washhouses. They also include
the services for bridge and highway construction and maintenance, for street
lighting, public safety on the roads, and the provision of recreation grounds,
parks and similar amenities. Town and country planning is the major
environmental service. The protective services are the fire service, the civil
defence service and the police service, while the personal services range from
health services, education and housing to the provision of public entertainment.
Local services concerned primarily with health and welfare cover the
provision of ante-natal, post-natal and child welfare clinics, and some resi¬
dential and day nurseries; the provision and supervision of midwifery services,
health visitors and home nursing facilities; measures for the prevention of
1 For instance, county councils are generally responsible for the police, fire and civil
defence services, while the district councils administer most of the environmental and
sanitary services.

illness and the aftercare of physically or mentally sick persons; the provision
of domestic help where necessary; the ambulance service; the provision of
facilities for vaccination and immunisation against certain infectious diseases;
and the services for the permanently disabled or handicapped, for the aged
and infirm and for children deprived of a normal home life. Education and
culture are promoted by the establishment and maintenance of various types
of schools; by the provision of adult education centres, and art and technical
colleges; by the award of grants and scholarships to students of all kinds;
and by the provision of libraries, art galleries and museums. Housing needs
are met, as far as possible, by building new houses (mainly to let), acquiring
old houses and converting them to provide additional accommodation,
planning for slum clearance, seeing that adequate standards are maintained
in both newly built and older houses, and generally ensuring that housing
conditions are satisfactory.
Some local authorities also engage in trading services, such as passenger
transport, water supply, and harbour, dock and pier services; they also have
power to initiate schemes to attract industrial development.
The above is only a brief outline of local authority services. Fuller informa¬
tion is given under the relevant subject headings in later chapters of this book.
Local authorities are free to a very considerable extent to make their own
internal arrangements and to choose the means and methods by which they
will discharge their responsibilities. Questions of policy and principle are
usually decided by the whole council, which appoints committees to carry
out the detailed administration of its various services. The more important
of the committees of the larger authorities divide their work among sub¬
committees, which stand to the parent committee in a relation similar to that
of the main committees to the whole council. The execution of the policy
decided upon by the council and the committees rests with salaried officers
and employees, whose number may vary from about half a dozen in a small
rural district to several thousands in the large counties and in the larger
county boroughs and burghs.
Apart from one or two minor provisions regarding the representation of
specialists on committees and the length of time certain members may hold
office, committees of councils are free from legal restrictions; even those
which are mandatory committees are constituted according to individual
requirements and not according to any set pattern laid down. For purposes
of classification, however, they may be divided into two kinds: ordinary
committees and joint committees. Ordinary committees may be further
divided into mandatory committees, the appointment of which is compulsory
under an Act of Parliament; other standing committees, which are appointed
in accordance with the standing orders of the council on a permanent basis
according to the extent of the council’s business; and special committees,
which a council may set up for a limited period to deal with a particular
problem that once solved is unlikely to recur.
Joint committees or joint boards consist of representatives of more than
one authority. They are usually established for services that can be more
effectively administered over a wider area than that controlled by a single
council, for instance, town and country planning, water supplies and the
police service.
Committees of a local authority may be advisory or executive; their powers
and duties are usually laid down in the appointing council’s standing orders
or, in the case of a county or large burgh in Scotland, in the council’s adminis-

trative scheme. A council is free to delegate all its powers to committees,
except its powers in connection with raising loans, levying rates, or making
financial demands on other authorities liable to contribute (raising precepts
in England and Wales and levying requisitions in Scotland) which are legal!}
reserved to the council as a whole.
The public and the press are admitted to all meetings of the council (and
of some committees) but may be excluded while a particular item is considered
if the council resolve that publicity for that matter would be prejudicial to
the public interest.
Generally speaking, councils are free to make such appointments as the}
deem necessary for carrying out their work, although certain posts (for
instance, the clerk, the treasurer, and the medical officer of health) are
compulsory in almost all councils. Choice of personnel is left to a great extent
to the individual council: in theory, the appointment of certain chief officers
is subject to some central control but, in practice, the nominee of the council
is nearly always accepted.
As a general rule, employees are of three kinds: heads of departments or
chief officers, whose duties are mainly of an administrative and managerial
kind; subordinate officers employed in a professional, clerical or technical
capacity; and manual workers who are employed to do the physical work for
which the council is responsible. Senior staff appointments are usually made
at the instance of the committee or committees particularly concerned;
most junior appointments are made by heads of departments, who are also
responsible for engaging manual workers. Appointments and engagements
are always made in conformity with the council’s set establishment and
committees are informed of any appointments which they have not made
themselves.
Rates of pay and conditions of service for local authority staff are within
the jurisdiction of the employing council (except for the rare case where the
proposed salary of an officer requires the approval of a Government depart¬
ment, as in the case of the clerk of a county council in England and Wales).
They are based on recommendations made by the Whitley Councils (see
note on p. 70), of which the largest, in England and Wales, are the National
Joint Council for Local Authorities’ Administrative, Professional, Technical
and Clerical Services and the National Joint Industrial Council for Local
Authorities’ Non-Trading Services (Manual Workers) and, in Scotland, the
Joint Negotiating Committee for Chief Officials of Local Authorities (Scot¬
land) and the Joint Industrial Councils for Local Authority Services. In
England and Wales conditions of service and salary scales for senior local
government officers are determined by separate joint committees. The local
government service in Northern Ireland has its separate joint negotiating
machinery at various levels.
All local government officers are expected to maintain a high standard of
conduct; as public servants they ‘must not only be honest in fact, but must
be beyond the reach of the suspicion of dishonesty’.
There are three sources of local authority income: Government grants
(about 42 per cent); local rates, paid by occupiers of land and buildings (about
38 per cent); and rents from municipal houses, dividends and interest (about
20 per cent). Capital expenditure is, for the greater part, financed by borrow¬
ing; about 12 per cent is financed by Government grants, proceeds from the
sale of land and buildings, and from revenue accumulations. Government

BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Grants
Rates
grants occasionally take the form of capital grants, paid on approval of claims
made by local authorities for specific services, principally roads, public
lighting and land drainage; more often, however, they are made on an annual
basis, either as specific grants, i.e. for a particular service, or as non-specific
grants. The latter, which include the general grant and the rate-deficiency
payment paid to the poorer local authorities to reduce inequalities in resources
(called equalisation grants in Scotland) account for about four-fifths of all
annual grants. Specific grants are paid only as ‘unit’ grants (a fixed annual
payment according to the number of units provided) for houses and as
‘percentage’ grants (a percentage of approved expenditure) for a small number
of services—mainly the police service and the construction and upkeep of
roads.
The largest single grant is the general grant, which is paid by the Minister
of Housing and Local Government to county and county borough councils
in England and Wales and by the Secretary of State for Scotland to county
and town councils in Scotland. This grant is apportioned among the author¬
ities according to a formula that takes into account the size of the population
in their areas and also such factors as the number of children of school age,
of young children and of old people and of exceptionally high or low
densities of population. The total amount of grant in any year is fixed in
advance, after consultation between the ministers and the local authority
associations.
In Northern Ireland there is a system of grants towards the cost of specific
services (for example, education, roads, housing, health and welfare, water
supplies and sewerage), supplemented by a general Exchequer contribution
which compensates for derating and takes account of the needs and resources
of individual authorities.
Rates are a form of local taxation paid by the occupiers of land and
buildings as contributions to the cost of local services. They are levied by a
poundage on the rateable value of property, which in England and Wales
is equivalent to the net annual value of the property, which in turn is based
on the rent which it might reasonably be expected to command if let from
year to year with the tenant bearing the rates and the cost of insurance and
repairs. Valuation for rating is undertaken by valuation officers of the Board
of Inland Revenue, who are independent of the local authorities. A valuation
officer (who may deal with several rating areas) prepares a new valuation list
every five years for each rating area; he also revises the current list by making
proposals for inserting new properties or altering the value of existing
properties. In the latest valuation lists (1963) rates for domestic property
are based, generally, on current rental values and industry and freight
transport are fully rated, except in Northern Ireland. Charities pay half the
full rate on property they occupy for charitable purposes but may be given
further relief by the rating authorities, who are empowered to reduce or
remit the rates for a wide range of non-profit-making bodies.
Appeals from valuation may be made to local valuation courts, each
consisting of three members of an independent local valuation panel, and
thereafter to the Lands Tribunal.
In Scotland valuation is on a basis similar to that in England and Wales;
but it is carried out by assessors appointed by the councils of counties and
counties of cities. Appeals lie to the valuation appeal committee of each
valuation area and thereafter to the Lands Valuation Appeal Court of the
Court of Session. A Scottish Valuation Advisory Council has been established

by the Secretary of State for Scotland. In Northern Ireland the valuation
authority is the Commissioner of Valuation, whose department is part of the
Ministry of Finance. Industry and freight transport in Northern Ireland are
rated at a quarter of their net annual value.
The responsibility for levying and collecting the rates in England and Wales
lies with the councils of county boroughs and county districts; in London,
with the City Corporation and the metropolitan borough councils. The total
rate poundage for each county district (in London each metropolitan borough
council and the City Corporation) consists mainly of a district rate and a
county rate, calculated in accordance with the respective requirements of the
two authorities, and the proceeds of the latter are passed on to the county
council. In rural districts the rate levied in each parish takes into account the
requirements arising from any expenses incurred by the parish council or
parish meeting. Rates in Scotland are levied by the town councils in burghs
and by county councils elsewhere; to cover their expenditure, district councils
levy a requisition each year to the county council; a town council has to meet
an annual requisition from the county council in respect of the burgh’s share
of the expenditure on functions exercised by the county council throughout
the county, including the burgh. In Northern Ireland county councils are
responsible for making, levying and collecting the rates, except in such parts
of the county as fall within the jurisdiction of the county borough, borough,
or urban district councils.
Loans may be raised by all types of local authority for financing such
items of capital expenditure as are sanctioned by the Minister of Housing
and Local Government, the Secretary of State for Scotland, or, occasionally,
the Government department responsible for the service for which the capital
is required. In Northern Ireland the Government department responsible
for the service also issues the appropriate loan approvals. Borrowing powers
for specific purposes may also be taken under Acts of Parliament of local
application. The London County Council seeks parliamentary sanction every
year to raise the money it needs for capital expenditure. Treasury consent
is required for all local authority borrowing, except for internal borrowing,
i.e. the transfer of money from one account to another.
Local authorities may raise long-term loans by issuing stock upon the
Stock Exchange, by private mortgage, or from the Public Works Loan Board,
which is financed by the Exchequer and acts as lender of last resort to local
authorities which cannot borrow on reasonable terms on the market. They
may also borrow temporarily pending the raising of these loans.
Internal control of finance is exercised on behalf of the council concerned
by a finance committee, whose function it is to keep the financial policy of
the council under constant review. In England and Wales an external audit
is carried out (except for certain general accounts in most of the county
borough and about two-thirds of the borough councils) by district auditors
appointed by the Ministry of Housing and Local Government. County
borough councils must use the services of the district auditor for accounts
which relate to children and education, and local health and welfare services.
In both county and non-county boroughs rating and coast protection are
also subject to district audit. For their other accounts borough councils use
mainly professional auditors; a few use ‘elective audit’, which provides for
the appointment of three auditors: two elected by the local government
electors and one appointed by the mayor. In Scotland the accounts of each
authority are audited by a professional auditor appointed by the Secretary

of State for Scotland and paid by the council concerned, and in Northern
Ireland by special local government auditors appointed by the Ministry of
Health and Local Government.
In the seventy years since the existing local government structure was set
up, the population of England and Wales has grown by nearly 14 million, the
greatest concentration of people being in the London area and the five other
conurbations of England (see p. 18). At the same time, the number and
scope of local authority activities have progressively increased: local authorities
are nowadays responsible not only for most of the environmental and personal
welfare services, but also for important functions in relation to a number of
services of nation-wide concern.
In contrast to all this, the basis of local government has remained virtually
unchanged. In some areas, and more especially in those with a high density
of industry and population, developments have inevitably led to some con¬
fusion and loss of efficiency, since the structure is no longer in balance with
the work that modern councils have to do. For this reason a Royal Commission
was appointed in 1957 to study the problems of local government in Greater
London. Shortly afterwards two Local Government Commissions were
established to carry out a similar function for the rest of England and for
Wales respectively, though working in a different way.
The principal recommendation of the Royal Commission on Greater
London, which published its report in i960 {Report of the Royal Commission
on Local Government in Greater London. Cmnd. 1164), was that a directly
elected council for Greater London should be established to administer those
services which could best be administered over the whole area, and that all
other local authority functions should be exercised by a number of London
boroughs—a new type of local authority which should be the primary unit
of local government in its area. In a White Paper {London Government:
Government Proposals for Reorganisation. Cmnd. 1562), published in 1961, the
Government broadly endorsed the Commission’s overall design although it
considered that larger (and therefore fewer) boroughs than those of the size
and number suggested by the Commission wrould be better equipped to
carry out the important duties for which they would be responsible.
The London Government Act, 1963, gives statutory effect to these changes.
Greater London, with a Greater London Council, is made up of the present
County of London, nearly all of Middlesex and parts of Essex, Hertfordshire,
Kent and Surrey. Its area is nearly 400,000 acres and it has a population of
rather more than 8 million. Within Greater London there are to be 32 London
boroughs, but the City of London will retain its ancient rights. The London
borough councils will be responsible for nearly all the functions of local
government, except for those which need to be administered in respect of the
whole area by the Greater London Council. Education, in broadly the
existing County of London, is, however, to be the responsibility of the Greater
London Council, acting through the Inner London Education Authority,
elsewhere in Greater London the boroughs will be the local education
authorities.
The new authorities, to be elected in the spring of 1964, will take up their
full functions on 1st April, 1965.
The Local Government Commission for England is charged with reviewing
local government in the five special review areas of the West Midlands,
Tyneside, West Yorkshire, South-East Lancashire and Merseyside and in the
counties and county boroughs elsewhere in England (outside Greater London).
GOVERNMENT
8l
It has produced final reports on five review areas (including two special
review areas) and published draft proposals for four more. The Local Govern¬
ment Commission for Wales has produced its final report with proposals
covering the whole of Wales. Before making proposals the Commissions
must consult the local authorities and other interested bodies and persons,
and take their views into account. The final reports must be submitted to
the Minister of Housing and Local Government who decides whether or
not to accept the Commission’s proposals after holding public local inquiries,
where necessary, to hear objections. Proposals are put into effect (with or
without modifications) by means of orders made by the Minister, which
must be laid before Parliament.
THE FIRE SERVICE
The fire services in Great Britain are organised on a local basis, subject to
a measure of central control exercised by the Home Secretary (in England
and Wales) and the Secretary of State for Scotland. The fire services in
Northern Ireland are controlled by two authorities, the Belfast Corporation
and the Northern Ireland Fire Authority, which are responsible to the
Minister of Home Affairs. Every part of the United Kingdom is covered
by a public fire brigade.
FIRE SERVICES IN There are 135 local authority fire brigades in England and Wales and 11 in
GREAT BRITAIN Scotland.
Fire Authorities In England and Wales, under the Fire Services Act, 1947, separate fire
brigades are administered by the county or county borough councils, which
are the fire authorities for their areas and have powers and duties which they
exercise either separately or as combined authorities where neighbouring
councils care to make such arrangements in the interests of the efficiency of
the service. The London County Council is in direct control of the London
Fire Brigade. In Scotland the local authorities are grouped in eleven areas
each with a single brigade; with the exception of Glasgow, where the town
council of the city is the responsible authority, each area is administered by
a joint committee representative of the councils of the counties and large
burghs in the area.
Central Control The Home Secretary and the Secretary of State for Scotland are empowered
to make regulations prescribing such matters as the maintenance of discipline,
training, and pensions in local fire brigades, and their approval is necessary
for certain reductions in establishment schemes. In matters affecting the fire
brigades as a whole (excluding discipline and similar matters), each Minister
is advised by the appropriate Central Fire Brigades Advisory Council, con¬
sisting of representatives of the local authority associations, representatives
of the chief officers (firemasters in Scotland) and other members of the
brigades, and other persons having special qualifications. The advisory
councils are not concerned with the conditions of service of members of the
brigades; on these subjects the National Joint Council for Local Authorities’
Fire Brigades in Great Britain and the National Joint Council for Chief
Officers of Local Authorities’ Fire Brigades in Great Britain are the nego¬
tiating bodies.
Central control is also exercised through the inspectors of fire services,
whose duties include advising the Ministers on technical matters.

Each fire authority is required to draw up a scheme showing the establishment
of officers and other ranks (both whole-time and part-time), the number and
location of fire stations and the number and type of appliances considered
necessary for the provision of an all-over cover of its area. Establish¬
ments vary considerably according to the fire risks in the area concerned
and are not always up to strength, but in the whole of England and Wales
there are about 22,500 whole-time and 14,500 part-time firemen, operating
more than 3,500 fire-fighting appliances (including pumps, turntable
ladders, water tenders, and emergency and salvage tenders) housed in
some 1,600 fire stations. In Scotland there are approximately 2,400 whole¬
time and 2,000 part-time firemen, 600 fire-fighting appliances, and 320 fire
stations.
It is the duty of each fire authority to purchase such vehicles and equip¬
ment as are required under the establishment scheme. Equipment is standard¬
ised, and appliances are bought by fire authorities to requirement specifications,
which ensure that essential standards are maintained and yet allow sufficient
freedom of design to meet local requirements.
Each fire authority is required to appoint a chief fire officer (firemaster in
Scotland) to be the head administrative and executive officer for its fire
services. The appointment must be approved by the Home Secretary or by
the Secretary of State for Scotland. The chief fire officer or firemaster is
responsible to the fire authority for seeing that the fire brigade is organised
and managed in accordance with policy laid down.
There is a central headquarters for operational control, which is usually
exercised on a local basis by divisional officers in charge of the geographical
divisions into which most areas are divided. Each divisional officer has at his
disposal a staff of whole-time officers and men, often supplemented—par¬
ticularly in country areas—by part-time officers and men; and he is responsible
for mobilising this force in the strength necessary for dealing with any
outbreaks of fire in his division. Constant communication is maintained
between divisional and brigade headquarters, and if at any time an outbreak
of fire should grow beyond the capabilities of a divisional force, help is sent
from one or more neighbouring divisions in its area, or even from the area
of another fire authority. Under arrangements for mutual help made by all
fire authorities, the nearest available force is sent to the scene of a fire,
regardless of area boundaries. Some fire authorities employ firewomen on
communication and mobilising duties.
In England and Wales the average number of fire calls a year totals about
318,000, including false alarms and special service calls for such purposes as
rescuing persons and animals trapped in dangerous situations, dealing with
crashed aircraft, and pumping and salvage operations. In Scotland the
average number of fire calls a year, including false alarms and special services,
is 28,000.
About two-thirds of the total number of firemen work on a whole-time basis.
The part-time firemen include: retained firemen who, in return for a retaining
fee, undertake to attend fires if called upon; volunteer firemen, who receive
no remuneration; and auxiliary firemen, who are enrolled as members of
individual fire brigades but with restricted duties. In addition, there are the
fire-fighting organisations outside the national service, for example, those
maintained by the Admiralty, the War Office, the Air Ministry, the Ministry
of Aviation, and by some large industrial and commercial concerns.

Recruits and junior ranks in the fire service in England and Wales receive
practical training in basic firemanship at training schools run by fire authorities.
In Scotland similar training is carried out at a central training school which
is the responsibility of the Scottish Home and Health Department. Advanced
and specialised training courses, including fire prevention courses, are pro¬
vided for the higher ranks at the Fire Service College, Wotton House, near
Dorking, Surrey, which is maintained by the Home Office and the Scottish
Home and Health Department as the central training institution for the fire
services, and at the Fire Service Training Centre (an annexe to the college)
at Moreton-in-Marsh, Gloucestershire. The Home Office Fire Service
Department arranges facilities for properly accredited officers from overseas
fire services to study the organisation, current training methods, appliances
and equipment of the British fire brigades.
A few fire authorities in England and Wales have recently introduced
schemes for the employment of junior firemen, between the ages of 16 and
18 years, with a view to their being enrolled as regular firemen at the
age of 18. This system of entry is still in its early stages, but arrangements
are being considered upon which a more general introduction of the scheme
might be based.
The fire authorities bear the cost of maintaining the fire service. There is an
Exchequer contribution which is included in the aggregate amount of the
local authority general grant (see p. 78). For the purpose of arriving at the
amount of this contribution, the Government receives from fire authorities
(at the time when the grant is to be considered) details of the last known actual
expenditure for a year, together with estimates for the impending general
grant period.
Research into all aspects of fire prevention and fire-fighting, and in particular
into the relationship between the fire-fighter, the availability of fire equipment
and fire losses, is undertaken by the Joint Fire Research Organisation under
the direction of the Fire Research Board. The costs of the Organisation are
shared equally between the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research
and the fire insurance companies who, jointly, nominate the members of
the Fire Research Board. The organisation operates from a fire research
station at which practical tests are carried out. Problems of fire protection
are also studied by the Fire Protection Association, established by the Fire
Offices’ Committee1 as the national advisory centre for industry and the
general public on the protection of life and property against fire.
In Northern Ireland the Belfast Corporation controls the Belfast Fire
Brigade and is responsible for the area inside the city boundary, and the
Northern Ireland Fire Authority covers the rest of the country outside
Belfast.
The Belfast Fire Brigade maintains five whole-time stations and has an
establishment of 263 officers and men manning 13 appliances, while the
Northern Ireland Fire Authority has one whole-time station in Londonderry
and 44 other stations throughout the remainder of the area, and an establish¬
ment of 113 whole-time officers and men and 700 part-time firemen, manning
72 appliances.

ance companies in Britain.

The Fire Services (Amendment) Act (Northern Ireland), 1956, provides that
the amount of fire service grant payable to the Northern Ireland Fire
Authority should be 50 per cent of the loan charges in respect of capital
expenditure which do not exceed £60,000 and 25 per cent of the amount
(if any) by which the loan charges exceed £60,000, together with 50 per cent
of the first £150,000 of other net expenditure and 25 per cent of the excess
over that amount. Expenditure in excess of the fire service grant is apportioned
among the local authorities liable to contribute to the funds of the Authority.
Under the Fire Services Acts, the Belfast Fire Brigade cannot qualify for
the payment of fire service grant.

LAW AND ORDER
THE LAW
In the United Kingdom the maintenance of public order depends on the
obedience which the public accord to the law. Individuals obey the law out
of a sense of private conviction or public duty, or, in the last resort, because
they know that if they fail to do so they will be penalised by the authorities
of the State. On the other hand, the use of penal measures by State authorities
must be, and in fact is, confined to what the law allows.
Although the United Kingdom is a unitary state, it does not have a single
body of law applicable universally within its limits; and in England and
Wales, Northern Ireland, and Scotland, respectively, separate systems are in
force (see p. 27). There are, however, similarities between the systems. As
between England and Wales on the one hand and Northern Ireland on the
other the similarity is general, due to the closeness of the association between
these countries since the twelfth century. As between Scotland and the rest
of the United Kingdom the differences are more extensive, although the
existence, during the past 250 years, of a common Parliament, a common
public opinion on broader issues, and a common court of appeal for civil
cases has resulted in substantial identity at many points.
A feature which is common to all the systems of law in the United Kingdom
(and differentiates them from some continental systems) is that there is no
complete code. The sources of law in all the British systems include statutes
dealing with particular subjects, and a large amount of unwritten or ‘common’
law, which can be gathered from numerous decisions of the courts and from
other sources.
The common law of England originated in the customs of the realm and
was built up by decisions of the courts. A supplementary system of law,
known as ‘equity’, came into being during the Middle Ages to provide and
enforce more effective protection for existing legal rights. It was administered
by a separate court and later became a separate body of legal rules. In 1873
the courts of equity were fused with the courts of common law, so that all
courts now apply both systems, but where they conflict, equity prevails.
In Scotland the basis of the modern common law is embodied in the writings
of certain seventeenth, eighteenth and early nineteenth century lawyers of
great repute who, between them, described systematically almost the whole
field of private and criminal law as existing in their times. Broadly speaking,
the principles enunciated by these lawyers, together with the many judicial
decisions which have followed and developed those principles, form the body
of Scots non-statutory law. Scotland has never had a separate system of
equity—equitable principles having always permeated the ordinary rules of
law.
Statute law includes Acts of Parliament and delegated or subordinate
legislation made under powers conferred by Parliament. It is absolutely
binding on all courts of the United Kingdom, taking precedence over any
other source of law.

AND WALES
Criminal Courts
Magistrates'
Courts

Assizes
Crown Courts
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Another feature common to the legal systems of the United Kingdom is
the distinction made between the criminal law and the civil law. Criminal
law is concerned with wrongs against the community as a whole; civil law
is concerned with the rights, duties and obligations of individual members
of the community between themselves.
The courts of ordinary criminal jurisdiction in England and Wales include:
magistrates’ courts, which try the less serious offences and conduct preliminary
inquiries into the more serious offences; courts of quarter sessions, which
try most of the more serious offences; and courts of assize (including the
Central Criminal Court in London and the Crown Courts in Liverpool and
Manchester) which try the gravest offences and cases of special difficulty.
All trials at quarter sessions and assizes are conducted with a jury (see p. 98).
Most magistrates’ courts consist of two to seven lay magistrates who are
unpaid and do not normally possess any legal qualifications but obtain advice
on points of law, when required, from the clerk to the justices. In central
London, however, and some of the other large cities, there are also paid,
or ‘stipendiary’, magistrates who are professional lawyers; they usually sit
alone. The great majority of offences (over 97 per cent) committed in
England and Wales are disposed of in magistrates’ courts.
Specially qualified magistrates sit in juvenile courts to hear cases involving
young persons under 17 years of age who are charged with any offence except
homicide or are brought before the court as being in need of care or protection,
as beyond control, or as persistent truants. These courts also deal with many
applications for the adoption of children. Consisting of not more than three
justices (normally including at least one man and one woman), they sit
either in a different room or building from that in which other courts are
sitting, or on a different day; only persons within certain specified categories
are admitted and only limited publicity is allowed.
Domestic Proceedings are also tried by not more than three justices, of
whom one should be a man and one a woman. The hearing of domestic
proceedings is separated from other business and, as in juvenile courts, the
public is excluded.
Courts of quarter sessions sit at least four times a year; in the busier places,
they meet much more frequently than this.
All counties have courts of quarter sessions and 98 boroughs also have
separate courts which exercise jurisdiction within their own boundaries. In
counties the courts are generally presided over by a bench of lay magistrates
under a legally qualified chairman. In London, where the courts have con¬
tinuous sittings, the chairman and deputy chairman usually preside alone.
In boroughs the courts are presided over by a single judicial officer, the
Recorder, who is a barrister specially appointed to act part-time in this
capacity.
Courts of assize are branches of the High Court presided over by High Court
judges and held at assize towns—generally in the county town of each county
and in certain of the other larger towns and cities. The judges go round
‘on circuit’ three times a year—on the autumn, winter and summer assizes.
Each town is visited once on each circuit; the larger towns are visited twice.
After the trial of criminal cases in each town, the judges deal with civil cases.
In Liverpool and Manchester, Crown Courts act both as quarter sessions for
the two cities and as assize courts for South Lancashire. The courts are

LAW AND ORDER 87
presided over by the Recorders of Liverpool and Manchester, who are
whole-time judicial officers.
The Central Criminal Court at the Old Bailey in the City of London acts as
the court of assize for the criminal business of London, Middlesex and parts
of the other home counties. More than one court sits at a time, each presided
over by a salaried judicial officer. The judges sitting at the Old Bailey include
one High Court judge and the Recorder of London.
Appeals may be brought on a point of law by either the prosecutor or the
defendant direct from the magistrates’ court to the High Court; but the more
usual appeal is that of a convicted person against his conviction or his sentence,
which is heard by quarter sessions.
Appeals against convictions or sentences by quarter sessions, assizes or
Crown Courts go to the Court of Criminal Appeal. Appeals on questions of
law may be brought as of right, but on other grounds only by leave of the
court. The Lord Chief Justice usually presides in the Court of Criminal
Appeal, which consists of three or, in special cases, five judges of the Queen’s
Bench Division.
A further appeal from the Court of Criminal Appeal to the House of Lords
can be brought if the court certifies that a point of law of general public
importance is involved and it appears to the court or the House of Lords
that the point is one that ought to be considered by the House.
There is no restriction on the right of a private citizen to institute criminal
proceedings, but most prosecutions in England and Wales are, in fact,
initiated and conducted by the police. In some cases the consent of the
Attorney General or the Director of Public Prosecutions or, less frequently,
a Government department is required. The Director of Public Prosecutions
is also concerned with prosecutions in all the more serious classes of indictable
offences (i.e. those offences involving formal written accusation); in courts
where a substantial number of cases with which he is concerned are tried,
standing counsel are appointed by the Attorney General to appear on his
behalf. At the Central Criminal Court in London, for instance, there is a
panel of counsel known as Treasury Counsel, who are retained to prosecute
in the Director’s cases.
In criminal cases arrest may be effected either on a warrant issued by a
judicial authority on information laid before it or, in certain cases, without
a warrant. In the latter circumstances, a police officer may release the defen¬
dant on bail, that is to say, he may discharge him temporarily, subject to his
entering into a recognisance, with or without sureties, for a reasonable sum
of money, to appear in court at the time appointed for the trial. Magistrates
also have discretion to grant bail, and this discretion is liberally exercised
in accordance with well-established principles. An arrested person must be
charged at once with the offence of which he is suspected; the Judges Rules1
forbid anything in the nature of cross-examination by the police once a charge
has been preferred and if an arrested person wishes to make a statement he
must first be cautioned that anything he says may be used in evidence.
Unless the offence of which an arrested person is suspected is serious, he may
be granted bail if he cannot be brought before the court within a day.
1 These Rules, formulated in 1912 and at present under review by the judges, do not
have the force of law but carry very great weight.
D
88
Trial
BRITAIN*. AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
If anyone is detained in custody otherwise than upon lawful grounds1 he
(or, if he is unable, someone acting on his behalf) may sue out a writ of
habeas corpus against the person who detained him, this person then being
required to appear before the court on the day named to show cause for
detention. The writ of habeas corpus may be granted by a single judge of the
High Court but may be refused only by a divisional court of the Queen’s
Bench Division.
Most indictable offences are tried in a superior court before a jury, although
some may be dealt with in magistrates’ courts, if the defendant consents.
Conversely, a criminal case which would ordinarily be dealt with in a
magistrates’ court must usually be heard before a jury if the offence is
punishable by more than three months’ imprisonment and the defendant
elects to be so tried.
Since criminal law presumes the innocence of the accused until his guilt
has been conclusively proved, the prosecution should not have any advantage,
apparent or real, over the defence. Every accused person has the right to
employ a legal adviser for the conduct of his defence and if he cannot afford
to pay he may be granted legal aid at the public expense. Anyone remanded
in custody may be visited in prison by his legal adviser. During the preparation
of the case, it is customary for the prosecution to inform the defence of any
relevant documents which it is not proposed to put in evidence and to disclose
them if asked to do so. .
All criminal trials are held in open court and the rules of evidence (which
are concerned with the proof of facts and much the same in civil and criminal
trials) are rigorously applied. For instance, although the uncorroborated
evidence of one witness is, as a matter of English law, sufficient, conviction
in criminal cases solely on the evidence of an accomplice (or accomplices) is,
in practice, never allowed unless the judge has warned the jury of the danger
of convicting without corroboration.
During the trial the accused has the right to hear and subsequently to
cross-examine (normally through his counsel) all the witnesses for the
prosecution; to call his own witnesses who, if they will not attend the trial
of their own free will, may be ‘subpoenaed’, or legally compelled, to attend,
and to address the court either in person or through his counsel. But he
cannot himself be questioned unless he consents to be sworn as a witness
in his own defence. The right to cross-examine the accused, even when he
is so sworn, is limited by law, with the object of excluding inquiry into his
character or into past offences not relevant to the particular charge on which
he is being tried. Furthermore, although confessions made in the course of
previous judicial proceedings are admissible as evidence if they have been
made upon oath, no confessions made in any other circumstances should be
admissible unless it can be proved that they were made voluntarily, i.e.
without fear of prejudice or hope of advantage.
In criminal trials by jury it is, broadly speaking, the duty of the judge to
determine questions of law, to sum up the evidence for the benefit of the
jury, and to acquit the accused or pass sentence, according to the verdict
of the jury; but the jury alone decides the issue of guilt or innocence. The
1 These are: in pursuance of criminal justice; for contempt of court or of either House
of Parliament; in certain circumstances for civil debt; detention of persons found to be
mentally disordered; detention of children by their parents or guardians. I he writ ot
habeas corpus runs in both criminal and civil cases.
LAW AND ORDER 89
verdict of a jury must be unanimous; if its members are unable to reach
agreement, the case must be tried before a new jury.
If the jury returns a verdict of ‘not guilty’, the prosecution has no right of
appeal and the defendant cannot be tried again for the same offence. If a
defence of insanity is accepted by the jury the verdict will amount to an
acquittal, but the accused will be detained in a suitable institution. From a
verdict of ‘guilty’ there is a right of appeal on the part of the defendant to
the appropriate court.
CIVIL LAW IN
ENGLAND AND
WALES
Civil Courts
County Courts
The High Court of
Justice
The main courts of civil jurisdiction in England and Wales are the county
courts, which are the courts for the lesser cases, and the High Court, where
the more important cases are tried. Most appeals go to the Court of Appeal
and from there may go to the House of Lords.
County Courts (of which there are nearly 400) are so located that no part of
a county is more than a reasonable distance from one of them. They are
presided over by a paid judge, who almost always sits alone, although he may
sit with a jury consisting of eight persons if either party wishes it and the court
makes an order to that effect. There are 77 county court judges now in office,
each having a circuit, which is either one court, or a group of courts, depending
on the amount of work to be done. In districts where the pressure of business
is exceptionally heavy the Lord Chancellor may, on representations made to
him by the judge of the district, appoint a person (who must previously have
held office as a judge or be a barrister of at least seven years’ standing) to act
for the judge at any sitting of the court.
Generally speaking the jurisdiction of the county courts includes all civil
actions where the amount claimed is not more than ^400 or where, in actions
for the recovery of land, the rateable value of the land is not more than £400
a year. Cases outside these limits may be tried in the county court by consent
of the parties, or may be transferred to the High Court. Some actions, in
particular actions for libel and slander, cannot be brought in the county court.
In addition to the ordinary county courts, there are still a few local courts with
somewhat similar jurisdiction. Most of these are survivals from the medieval
borough courts, and have little or no work to do at the present time, but
the Liverpool Court of Passage, the Salford Hundred Court and the Mayor’s
and City of London Court are still well used.
The High Court of Justice forms part of the Supreme Court of Judicature.
Its jurisdiction is both original and appellate, and covers virtually all civil
causes and some criminal causes.
The High Court is divided into the Chancery Division, the Probate,
Divorce and Admiralty Division, and the Queen’s Bench Division. The work
is distributed between them in accordance with the Rules of Court (see p. 96)
and the practice of the courts. Although the rules do not give exclusive
jurisdiction in any matter to any one division, in practice each division has
a separate field of jurisdiction and the judges are attached to a particular
division.
The High Court is staffed by 52 puisne1 judges. The Lord Chancellor is,
in strict law, the president of the whole High Court (although, in practice,
he does not sit in any Division); he is also nominally head of the Chancery
Division, of which the Master of the Rolls2 is another nominal member; there is
1 Judges without any other special office.
2 Originally keeper of the records and assistant to the Lord Chancellor, the Master of
the Rolls has for centuries held high judicial office.

a President for the Probate, Divorce and Admiralty Division ; and the Lord
Chief Justice of England presides over the Queen’s Bench EHvision. For the
hearing of cases at first instance, High Court judges sit singly. Appellate
jurisdiction is exercised either by divisional courts consisting of three (or
sometimes two) judges, sitting in one of the three Divisions of the High Court
or, in some cases, by a single judge.
Nearly all appeals from magistrates’ courts, ministerial decisions and the
decisions of judges sitting in Chambers1 are heard in the first instance in the
appropriate divisional court of the High Court,2 but all the more important
appeals in civil actions come before the Court of Appeal, which is part of
the Supreme Court of Judicature, and some (with leave of the Court of Appeal
or of the House of Lords) before the House of Lords, which is the ultimate
court of appeal in civil cases in the whole United Kingdom.
The Court of Appeal hears appeals from the High Court, the county courts
and assizes in civil cases. The Lord Chancellor, the Lord Chief Justice the
President of the Probate, Divorce and Admiralty Division, the Lords of
Appeal in Ordinary are all members of the court, but its effective head is the
Master of the Rolls, who is assisted by eleven Lord Justices of Appeal,
sitting in four divisions. , . _ ,
The judges in the House of Lords are the Lords of Appeal in Ordinary,
who must have a quorum of three, but often sit as a group of five, and some¬
times of seven. Lay peers may not attend the hearing of appeals (which
normally takes place in a committee room and not in the legislative chamber),
but peers who hold or have held high judicial office may sit. The president
is the Lord Chancellor.
In England and Wales civil proceedings are instituted by the aggrieved
person; no preliminary inquiry as to the authenticity of the grievance is
required. The most common form of proceedings is an action commenced
by a writ served on the defendant by the plaintiff, which notifies the defendant
that the plaintiff has a claim on him and states the nature of the claim. If the
defendant intends to contest the claim, he ‘enters an appearance by informing
the court to this effect and documents setting out the precise question in
dispute (the pleadings) are then delivered to the court.
Because civil proceedings are a private matter, they can at any time be
abandoned or compromised without leave of the court,3 and in fact, in the
great majority of cases, the parties to a dispute are able to settle their differences
through their solicitors before the stage of actual trial is reached. Actions that
are brought to court are usually tried by a judge without a jury, except in cases
involving claims for defamation, false imprisonment, unlawful arrest, seduction,
or breach of promise to marry, when either party may insist on trial by jury,
or in a case of fraud, when the person charged may also claim this right In
trials where a jury is present, it is responsible for deciding questions of fact
(as in criminal trials) and also the amount of damages to be awarded to the
injured party. .
Judgments in civil cases are enforceable through the authority of the court.

abstain from doing something may result in imprisonment for contempt of
court. Arrest under an order of committal may be effected only on a warrant
of the court.
As a rule, the court awards the costs of an action (the solicitor’s charges
and essential disbursements) to the winning party, although in practice he
always pays part of them. In certain circumstances (for instance, extravagance
or negligence in the conduct of the case), the court may, in its discretion,
refuse to order that one party’s costs should be borne by the other.
Criminal cases in Scotland are heard either under solemn procedure, that is,
where proceedings are taken on indictment and the judge sits with a jury,
or under summary procedure, where the judge sits without a jury. All cases
in the High Court of Justiciary and the more serious ones in the sheriff court
are tried under solemn procedure. Proceedings are taken under summary
procedure in the more minor cases in the sheriff court, and in the justice of
the peace and burgh (or police) courts.
These courts are established in burghs. The judges are town councillors who
are serving (or have served) in the office of the magistrate of the burgh. In
Glasgow a stipendiary magistrate acts as judge of one of the courts.
These courts are organised on a county (and county of city) basis, the judges
being the justices of the peace for the county (or county of city).
Any court of summary jurisdiction sits as a juvenile court when hearing
charges only against persons under 17 years of age. Special justice of the peace
juvenile courts have been established in three counties and in the city of
Aberdeen.
Scotland is divided into sheriffdoms, each consisting of a county or combination
of counties, and these sheriffdoms are further divided into sheriff court
districts. A sheriffdom has a sheriff and a number of sheriffs-substitute who
act as the judges of the court. The sheriff courts exercise an extensive civil
jurisdiction, as well as a criminal jurisdiction.
The High Court of Justiciary is the supreme criminal court of first instance.
Any one of the following judges is entitled to try cases in the High Court:
the Lord Justice General (who is also the Lord President of the Court of
Session), the Lord Justice Clerk, or any one of the 14 Lords Commissioner
of Justiciary who are also judges of the Court of Session. The seat of the
court is in Edinburgh, but the judges go on circuit to preside at trials in
other towns.
A person convicted in the High Court or in a sheriff court on indictment
may appeal to the High Court of Justiciary (a) against his conviction on any
ground which involves a question of law alone, or, with leave of the High Court
or upon the certificate of the judge who presided at the trial that it is a fit
case for appeal, on any ground, and (b) against his sentence, with the leave
of the High Court, unless the sentence is one fixed by law. Appeals are heard
by three or more judges, and there is no further appeal to the House of Lords.
A person convicted summarily may appeal to the High Court, but only on
questions of law and procedure, and not on issues of fact.
In Scotland the police make preliminary investigation of all cases of crime
discovered by or made known to them, but it is for the Public Prosecutor
concerned (the Lord Advocate in the High Court, the Procurators Fiscal in
the sheriff court, and the justice of the peace fiscal and burgh prosecutor in
92
Arrest
Trial
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
the justice of the peace and burgh courts respectively) to decide whether or
not to prosecute and, in the case of the Procurator Fiscal, to decide whether
to proceed summarily or to charge the accused by petition with a view to
proceedings on indictment.
The police in Scotland have the same powers of arrest as have the police in
England and Wales. The Judges Rules do not apply in Scotland, but when
an accused person is arrested, he should be cautioned and have the charge
read over to him. Thereafter, only the accused’s voluntary statements should
be used in evidence at his trial, and the court will reject any statements made
by him unless it is satisfied that they have been fairly obtained.
As in England and Wales, a person apprehended in Scotland must be
brought before the court competent to deal with his case with the least possible
delay. There is no equivalent in Scotland to the public preliminary investiga¬
tion before examining magistrates held in England and Wales prior to
committal for trial. Where a prosecution on indictment is contemplated, the
accused is brought before a magistrate for judicial examination. The magi¬
strate then commits the accused for trial, but he may first commit him for
further examination. Eight days may elapse between commitment for further
examination and commitment for trial.
Persons in custody, other than those charged with murder or treason, may
be liberated on bail by the sheriff or, if the offence is within the jurisdiction
of a summary court other than the sheriff court, by that court or the police.
Even in the case of murder or treason, bail may be accepted at the discretion
of the Lord Advocate or the High Court of Justiciary. There is a right of
appeal to the High Court by the accused person against the refusal of bail,
by the prosecutor against the granting of bail, or by either party against the
amount fixed.
The writ of habeas corpus does not apply in Scotland, but the High Court
of Justiciary has power to release persons unlawfully detained and accused
persons must, in any event, be brought to trial within no days of committal.
In trials on indictment, the first ‘pleading’ diet takes place in the sheriff
court, when the accused is called upon to plead guilty or not guilty. If he
pleads not guilty, the case is continued to the second ‘trial’ diet in the appro¬
priate court. If he pleads guilty, and it is a case which is to be dealt
with in the sheriff court, the sheriff may dispose of it at once. If it is a
High Court case it is continued to the second diet in the High Court for
disposal.
The second diet is held at least nine days after the pleading diet, either
before the sheriff or the High Court, with a jury. Evidence is led (without
opening speeches) and there are closing speeches for the prosecution and for
the defence, followed by the judge’s charge to the jury. The jury may return
a verdict of ‘not guilty’ or ‘not proven’, both of which result in acquittal, or
they may find the accused ‘guilty’, in which case the court proceeds to deliver
sentence. The verdict (unlike that of an English jury) may be by a majority.
Fairness to the accused is ensured by the fact that, with a few minor exceptions,
no person may be convicted without the evidence of at least two witnesses,
or corroboration of one witness by facts and circumstances which clearly
implicate the accused person in the crime.
At summary trials the accused is asked to plead to the charge at the first
calling of the case and, if he pleads guilty, the court may dispose of the case.
Where the plea is ‘not guilty’, the court may proceed to trial at once or it
may appoint a trial diet for a later date.

COURTS IN
NORTHERN
IRELAND
The main courts of civil jurisdiction in Scotland are the sheriff courts which,
in their civil capacity, correspond roughly to the county courts in England
and Wales, and the Court of Session, which is the supreme civil court
in Scotland.
The civil jurisdiction of the sheriff court extends to nearly all actions and is
unlimited by the value of the case. Much of the work is done by the sheriff-
substitute, against whose decisions an appeal may be made to the sheriff-
principal or directly to the Court of Session. Minor civil matters (actions
not exceeding £5 in value) may be tried by justices of the peace.
The Court of Session has universal jurisdiction, sits only in Edinburgh, and
has sole jurisdiction, inter alia, in divorce actions. The court is divided into
two parts: the Outer House, a court of first instance, and the Inner House
which is mainly an appeal court. The Inner House is divided into two divisions
of equal status, each consisting of four judges—the first division being
presided over by the Lord President and the second division by the Lord
Justice Clerk. From the Inner House an appeal may lie to the House of Lords.
The Scottish Land Court is a special court that deals with certain agricultural
matters. The court is presided over by a legal chairman, who has the rank
and dignity of a judge of the Court of Session.
In Scotland civil proceedings are initiated by the service on the defender of
a writ or summons, which sets out the nature of the decree which the pursuer
seeks, a statement of facts upon which the pursuer founds his claim, and a
statement of the legal propositions upon which the pursuer maintains he is
entitled to the remedy which he seeks. In Court of Session actions the next
step is the calling of the summons, which is the publication of the action in
the court lists. If the defender intends to contest the action, he must ‘enter
appearance’ within two days of calling and thereafter lodge defences to it.
In the sheriff court ‘entering appearance’ precedes the ‘tabling’ of the case.
It is much more common in Scotland than in England and Wales to have
legal debates in court as to the competency or relevancy of the written pleadings
prior to the proof.
In Scotland a pursuer can abandon his case, including any matrimonial
case, at any time, but where abandonment is sought after the commencement
of the proof or trial, only with leave of the court. Trial by jury in civil action
in Scotland is much more common than in England and Wales, being the
usual form of proof in actions for damages for personal injuries.
Both civil and criminal courts in Northern Ireland are similar to those in
England and Wales with some minor modifications to suit a smaller com¬
munity. The superior courts comprise the Supreme Court of Judicature
(consisting of the High Court of Justice and the Court of Appeal) and the
Court of Criminal Appeal. The High Court is the superior court of first
instance, is divided into the Chancery Division, the Queen’s Bench Division
(including probate, matrimonial and Admiralty proceedings) and the circuit
courts (assizes) and is constituted of the Lord Chief Justice, as president,
and two judges. The Court of Appeal, which is the appellate tribunal, is
constituted of the Lord Chief Justice and two Lords Justices of Appeal.
The inferior courts are the county courts and courts of summary jurisdiction
(petty sessions). Courts of quarter sessions have been amalgamated with the
county courts, which now exercise both civil and criminal jurisdiction and
are presided over by county court judges, of whom there are five (two of

them having the title of Recorder—of Belfast and of Londonderry). At least
four sittings of the court are held annually in each division. Petty sessions
courts are composed of one resident magistrate (who corresponds to a
stipendiary magistrate in England and Wales) who sits alone except in some
specific cases, for instance in a special crimes court, where two may adjudicate.
Juvenile courts are composed of one resident magistrate and two lay members,
one of whom must be a woman.
Coroners’ courts are common law courts convened when a person appears
to have died a violent or unnatural death or a sudden death of which the
cause is unknown, and in certain other circumstances. In such cases, it is
the duty of the local coroner (who may be a barrister, a solicitor, or a medical
practitioner of not less than five years’ standing, appointed by a county or
a county borough council) to hold an inquiry into how, when, and where the
deceased died; he may hold an inquest in court for this purpose, and he must
do so if he has reasonable cause to believe that the deceased has died a violent
or unnatural death or has died in prison or in circumstances for which an Act
of Parliament provides that an inquest must be held. A jury must be summoned
in certain cases, including those in which there is reason to suspect that the
death was due to murder, manslaughter, or infanticide, or was caused by an
accident arising out of the use of a vehicle on the public highway. If the jury
returns a verdict of murder, manslaughter or infanticide by a particular person,
the coroner must commit that person for trial at assizes. If the death is merely
a sudden death of which the cause is unknown, the coroner need not hold
an inquest, but may order a post-mortem examination to ascertain the cause
of death.
In Scotland the office of coroner does not exist. The Procurator Fiscal
inquires privately into all sudden and suspicious deaths in his district and
may report the result of his inquiries to the Crown Agent in order that
Crown Counsel may consider what proceedings, if any, are required.
In Northern Ireland coroners are appointed by the Minister of Home
Affairs and must be either barristers-at-law of not less than five years’
standing practising in Northern Ireland or practising solicitors of the Supreme
Court of Judicature in Northern Ireland of not less than five years
standing.
Administrative tribunals consist of persons or bodies exercising judicial or
quasi-judicial functions outside the ordinary hierarchy of the courts. As a
rule, they are set up by Act of Parliament or under powers conferred by
statute, which also govern their constitution, functions and procedure.
The continuing expansion of governmental activity and responsibility for
the general well-being of the community has greatly multiplied the occasions
on which the individual may find himself at issue with the administration,
or with another body of persons or an individual; consequently there has
been a substantial growth in the number of tribunals (there are over 2,000
in existence) and in the range of their activities during the past fifteen years.
Their constitution follows a fairly general pattern: all, for instance, consist
of an uneven number of persons so that a majority decision can be reached,
members are usually appointed by the minister concerned with the subject
but other authorities (for instance, the Crown, the Lord Chancellor and the
Master of the Rolls) have the power of appointment in appropriate cases and
the Lord Chancellor, or the Lord President of the Court of Session in Scot¬
land, makes appointments in all cases where a lawyer chairman or member
LAW AND ORDER
95
is required; and, with some exceptions, members of tribunals hold office for
a period specified in the warrant or instrument by which they are appointed.
Administrative tribunals may be broadly classified as follows:
(i) those which have permanent members appointed for their special
knowledge, and a chairman who must be a lawyer of experience: for
instance, the Transport Tribunal, which has jurisdiction over British
Railways passenger fares within the London area and London Transport
road and rail fares and also hears appeals relating to road carriers’
licences throughout Great Britain, and the Lands Tribunal, which has
jurisdiction in a variety of matters relating to the value of property;
(ii) those which are purely administrative: for instance, the Special Com¬
missioners of Income Tax, who hear appeals on income tax matters
from the rulings of the Inland Revenue officials;
(iii) those which deal exclusively with matters of interest to one Government
department or public authority: for instance, the Pensions Appeal
Tribunals, which hear appeals against the rejection by the Minister of
Pensions and National Insurance of war service pension claims; and
(iv) those which consist of ordinary people appointed by a minister to arbi¬
trate between individuals: for instance, the Rent Tribunals, which have
jurisdiction in the determination of rents of certain properties.
There are also tribunals which enforce professional discipline, such as the
General Medical Council and the Disciplinary Committee of the Law
Society, but these are entirely different in constitution from the statutory
tribunals and are of no concern to the general public.
Although there is no general provision respecting appeals from statutory
tribunals, the Tribunals and Enquiries Act, 1958, and other Acts provide
for an appeal, at least on a point of law, from all the more important tribunals
to the High Court. An appeal may also lie to a specially constituted appeal
tribunal, to a minister of the Crown or to an independent referee. An advisory
body known as the Council on Tribunals (appointed jointly by the Lord
Chancellor and the Secretary of State for Scotland) exercises general super¬
vision1 over the tribunals and reports on particular matters, those peculiar
to Scotland being dealt with by the Scottish committee of the Council.
Military Courts Generally speaking, courts martial have jurisdiction over serving members
of the armed forces in connection with the system of military law enforceable
under provisions of the Army Act and Naval Discipline Act. (Non-military
offences committed by members of the armed forces are dealt with in the
ordinary criminal courts.) A military or air force court martial may be con¬
vened by any officer authorised to do so; a naval court martial may be ordered
either by the Admiralty or by any authorised officer.
At every general court martial, and in important cases at district courts
martial, an officer, known as a judge advocate, must be present to advise the
court upon law and procedure and ensure that the accused is afforded a fair
trial. The Judge Advocate General’s Department acts for the Air Force
as well as the Army, but the Navy has a separate Judge Advocate of
the Fleet.
Appeals lie to the Courts-Martial Appeals Court, and from that court to
the House of Lords if the court certifies that a point of law of general public

importance is involved and it appears to the court or the House of Lords that
the point is one that ought to be considered by the House.
ADMINISTRATION There is no Minister of Justice in the United Kingdom. Responsibility for
OF JUSTICE the administration of the judicial system in England and Wales, when it
does not rest with the courts themselves, lies partly with the Lord Chancellor
and partly with the Home Secretary. The former is concerned with the
composition of all courts, both criminal and civil, with parts of criminal
procedure and with everything relating to civil law, and the latter with
criminal law, preventing offences, apprehending offenders, part of the process
of trying them, and virtually the whole of their treatment. The Prime Minister
is also concerned in that he is responsible for recommending to the Crown
the highest judicial appointments.
The administrative business of the Supreme Court of Judicature and the
appointment of the officers of the court (for instance, the masters, registrars
and clerks) is partly in the hands of the Lord Chancellor and partly in the
hands of the appropriate judges. The Lord Chancellor is concerned with
legal procedure in that he is a member of the Rule Committee which makes
the rules of the Supreme Court, appoints the County Court Rule Committee
and has power to alter or disallow the rules made by it. He is concerned with
law reform in that he refers questions on this subject (save in the field of
criminal law, where the Home Secretary is primarily responsible) to the
Law Reform Committee and the Private International Law Committee, and
that the reports of these committees, which often become the basis of legisla¬
tion, are presented to him.
Magistrates’ courts are mainly administered by the magistrates themselves,
chiefly through committees known as magistrates courts committees, but
the local authorities, with financial assistance from the Government, are
responsible for meeting their costs, and the Home Secretary, besides exercising
a general oversight, has certain specific responsibilities, including the approval
of boundary changes, approval of the appointment of justices clerks, and
deciding disputes on financial matters.
In Scotland the High Court of Justiciary and the Court of Session are
administered by the Clerk of the Justiciary and his staff and the principal
Clerk of Session and his staff respectively. The Secretary of State for Scotland
is responsible for the staffing and general organisation of the sheriff courts.
In Northern Ireland the administration of the superior courts has been
reserved to the United Kingdom Parliament. The judges are appointed by
the Crown and are removable only on an address of both Houses of that
Parliament. The Minister of Home Affairs for Northern Ireland is responsible
for the staffing and general organisation of the county and petty sessions
courts; the judges of the county court and resident magistrates are appointed
by the Governor of Northern Ireland.
THE PERSONNEL
OF THE LAW
The operation of the law requires the participation of judges with whom,
aided in certain cases by juries, the decision of disputed cases rests; of the
officers of the court, who have general or specialised functions of an adminis¬
trative (and sometimes of a judicial) nature in the courts to which they are
attached; and of the barristers (advocates in Scotland) and solicitors who are
entrusted with representing the interests of the parties to a dispute.1
The law allows full liberty to the individual to conduct his own case, both in its imtial
id final stages, if he thinks fit. The more usual practice, however, is to be legalh
^presented.
LAW AND ORDER
97
Judges
The courts of the United Kingdom are the Queen’s Courts (since the Crown
is the historic source of all judicial power) and the Sovereign, acting on the
advice of ministers, is responsible for all appointments to the judiciary. In
England and Wales appointments to the highest positions—the Lords of
Appeal in Ordinary, the Lord Chief Justice, the Master of the Rolls, and
the President of the Probate, Divorce and Admiralty Division—are made on
the recommendation of the Prime Minister, while the Lord Chancellor
recommends the appointment of the puisne judges, the county court judges
(except in Lancashire where they are recommended by the Chancellor of the
Duchy of Lancaster), the chairmen of quarter sessions, the recorders of
boroughs, and the metropolitan and other stipendiary magistrates. Justices
of the peace are appointed on behalf of the Crown by the Lord Chancellor,1
who is advised, as to a county by the Lord Lieutenant2 with the assistance
of a local advisory committee, and as to the boroughs by separate advisory
committees.
In Scotland the Prime Minister makes recommendations for the appoint¬
ment of the Lord Justice General and Lord President and also of the Lord
Justice Clerk. Power of submission for appointment of all other judges lies
with the Secretary of State for Scotland. The Secretary of State is responsible
for the appointment and removal of justices of the peace.
Judges are not engaged in politics, except in the case of the Lord Chancellor
who, as well as being head of the judiciary, is a leading member of the
Government in power. With the exception of justices of the peace, judges
have always been appointed from practising barristers or advocates and neither
their training nor their career is in any way dictated by the State.
Once appointed, judges normally hold office for life or until statutory
retiring age. However, in certain circumstances (for instance, in cases of mis¬
conduct or proven incapacity) judges of the inferior courts in England and
Wales may be removed from their position by the Lord Chancellor. In
Scotland the Secretary of State may issue an order for the removal from
office of a sheriff-principal on a report prepared by the Lord President of the
Court of Session and the Lord Justice Clerk, on the grounds of inability,
neglect of duty or misbehaviour, but this order is required to lie before both
Houses of Parliament for a period of four weeks. A sheriff-substitute may
similarly be removed from office, but in his case no parliamentary procedure
is necessary.
In England and Wales all superior judges (other than the Lord Chancellor
who, as a Cabinet Minister, changes with the Government) are subject to a
power of removal only by the Sovereign on an address presented by both
Houses of Parliament.3 Since 1701 only one such address has been moved
(against a judge convicted of misappropriation of funds, in 1830); and it can
be stated with confidence that Parliament would never use this means to
attempt to interfere with judicial independence. Similarly, although no court
in the United Kingdom would ever question the validity of an Act of Parlia¬
ment which had been legally promulgated and published it might, through
its interpretation of the statute, come to a decision contrary to the policy of
1 Except in Lancashire, where the Chancellor of the Duchy acts on behalf of the Crown
in this matter.
2 The office of the Lord Lieutenant of the county was first created in the sixteenth
century. Its holder was chief among the county justices and commander of the county
militia.
3 There is no statutory provision for removal of judges of the Court of Session or High
Court of Justiciary from office and it is probable that special legislation would be
required to effect such a dismissal.

the Government which introduced the Act. In such a case the Government
could try to persuade Parliament to clarify or amend the statute by new
legislation. It would not be open to it to penalise the judge or to try to
influence the court in any other way.
A jury in England and Wales summoned to assizes or county quarter sessions,
or in a civil action, consists of twelve persons. In Scotland the jury consists of
fifteen persons in criminal cases and twelve in civil cases and in ^Northern
Ireland of twTelve in criminal and seven in civil cases. Most householders (men
and women alike) are liable for jury service if they are British subjects between
the ages of 21 and 60, but persons following certain occupations can claim
exemption.1 A jury is completely independent of both the judiciary and the
executive. In criminal cases the accused can have up to seven jurors changed
without giving reasons and both defence and prosecution can object for cause
shown (for instance, lack of impartiality), but once members of the jury have
been sworn, they are protected from interference of any kind. It is an offence
to assault, threaten or attempt to corrupt a juryman either before or during
<1 trial.
At certain inquests at coroners’ courts in England and Wales and Northern
Ireland, a jury is required to be present to return a verdict on how, when and
where a deceased person died. The jury in this instance consists of from
seven to eleven jurors. A jury is also required at an inquest held by a coroner
to decide whether objects of gold or silver found in the ground are ‘treasure
trove’.
The legal profession is divided into two branches: barristers (advocates in
Scotland) and solicitors. Each performs distinct duties—solicitors undertake
legal business for lay clients, while barristers advise on legal problems sub¬
mitted through solicitors and conduct proceedings in the higher courts thoug
certain functions are common to both. t .
A barrister in England is required to have reached an accepted educational
standard, to have passed the legal examinations conducted by the Council of
Legal Education and to have become a member of one of the four Inns of
Court—Gray’s Inn, Lincoln’s Inn, the Middle Temple and the Inner Temple.
A barrister with a substantial junior practice may apply to the Lord Chancellor
for a patent appointing him Queen’s Counsel—a proceeding known as taking
silk’. Most higher judicial appointments are made from among barristers who
have become Queen’s Counsel. The professional conduct of a barrister is
subject to the scrutiny of the General Council of the Bar; but disciplinary
powers are vested exclusively in the Benchers of the Inns of Court.
A prospective solicitor in England and Wales must be considered suitable
by the appropriate committee of the Law Society (the professional organisation
of solicitors) and he must enter into ‘articles of clerkship with a practising
solicitor of not less than five years’ standing before he can begin his professional
career The term of articles lasts for three or five years, depending upon the
educational qualifications of the student. An articled clerk must pass the
necessary examinations held by the Law Society and, unless he has been a
barrister or is a law graduate of a university, he is generally required to attend
a course of studies at a recognised law school. Once a solicitor is qualified,
he may become a member of the Law Society.

LEGAL AID AND

Courts
In Scotland an advocate requires to have an arts degree or its equivalent.
The conditions applying for the admission of solicitors are similar to those
applying in England and Wales. The analogous professional organisations
are the Faculty of Advocates and the Law Society of Scotland.
In Northern Ireland barristers are members of the Inn of Court of Northern
Ireland; there is also a General Council of the Bar of Northern Ireland. The
professional organisation for solicitors is the Incorporated Law Society of
Northern Ireland.
Schemes for free legal assistance to persons of slender means and resources
have existed for centuries in some courts—to a limited extent in England and
Wales, and to a somewhat greater extent in Scotland. The Legal Aid and
Advice Act, 1949, and the corresponding Legal Aid (Scotland) Act, 1949,
were introduced to improve existing arrangements in civil proceedings so that
no one would be financially unable to prosecute a just and reasonable claim
or to defend a legal right, and also to make the facilities already available in
criminal proceedings more easily accessible to those who needed them.
The scheme established by the Act of 1949 for providing legal aid in civil
matters has been gradually brought into operation, until today legal aid is
available for nearly all types of civil proceedings in nearly all courts of law.
It is also available for getting oral legal advice and in certain circumstances
where the assistance of a lawyer is needed but which do not (or do not yet)
involve litigation.
Free legal aid in civil cases is available to persons with very small incomes and
capital, and contributory legal aid to those in higher income and capital groups.
The majority of people in England and Wales are financially eligible for legal aid.
Th elegal aid scheme in England and Wales is run by the Law Society under
the general guidance of the Lord Chancellor. It is operated by 12 area com¬
mittees and a network of local committees composed of barristers and
solicitors (who may be paid a fee), with a salaried staff. 1 he cost is met from
the Legal Aid Fund, drawn from three sources: contributions from assisted
persons; costs recovered from opposite parties in litigation; and a grant from
the Exchequer.
Applicants for free legal aid must show that they have reasonable grounds
for asserting or disputing a claim. A successful applicant is allowed to select
from a panel a solicitor who, if necessary, instructs a barrister, and the case
is then conducted in the ordinary way. Certain types of action, including
libel and slander, are excluded from the scheme.
In Scotland the legal aid scheme is administered by the Law Society of
Scotland through a supervisory central committee, the Supreme Court
committee and sixteen local committees. To obtain legal aid for litigation an
applicant is required to show ‘probable cause’ and produce in support of his
application a statement corroborated according to the requirements of
Scottish law. Assistance is available in connection with appeals to the House
of Lords from the Court of Session, in civil proceedings before the Court of
Session, the Lands Valuation Appeal Court and the sheriff courts and in
matters not involving litigation. Where litigation is not involved, the applicant
must show he has reasonable grounds for taking the proposed legal action.
V
Free legal aid is available in the criminal courts in England and Wales under
the Poor Prisoners’ Defence Act, 1930, which provides for the granting of
either a legal aid certificate which entitles the recipient to the services of a

solicitor (or, in the case of a preliminary inquiry into a charge of murder, of
a solicitor and counsel) in defending a charge heard summarily or at committal
proceedings in indictable cases, or a defence certificate which provides both
solicitor and counsel in a trial on indictment. The granting of these certificates
is in the discretion of the justices or judge before whom the applicant is to be
tried, except in the case of a person committed for trial on a charge of murder,
when a defence certificate must be granted if the defendant has insufficient
means.
Free legal aid for an appeal to quarter sessions is provided for in the
Summary Jurisdiction (Appeals) Act, i933> which lays down that, in proper
cases, an appeal aid certificate may be granted by a magistrates court 01
quarter sessions. The granting of legal aid in appeals to the Court of Criminal
Appeal rests with a judge of that court who may also grant legal aid for the
purposes of a further appeal to the House of Lords.
The cost of legal aid in magistrates’ courts is paid out of the Legal Aid Fund.
In the higher courts payments are made in the first instance out of local
authority funds and the cost is reimbursed by the central Government.
Pending the full implementation of the Legal Aid and Solicitors (Scotland)
Act, 1949, legal aid in criminal cases in Scotland has been limited to voluntary
arrangements, operated by the legal profession, for the representation of
poor persons, either free of charge or at modified fees. Legislation has
recently been passed, however, to facilitate the introduction of a statutory
scheme, financed by the State, of legal aid in criminal proceedings.
Oral advice on legal matters is available, both in England and W ales and in
Scotland, free of charge to persons in receipt of national assistance and at a
very reasonable cost, i.e. at 2s. 6d. for an interview of up to thirty minutes,
to those of limited means. Advice is given by practising solicitors paid out
of the legal aid funds of the two countries. The scheme is administered by the
two Law Societies, which also run voluntary schemes (for a fee of £1) for
those who do not qualify for statutory assistance.
In Northern Ireland free legal aid in criminal cases is afforded to poor persons
under the Criminal Justice (Northern Ireland) Act, 1945, the cost being met
from public funds.
Legislation providing for a comprehensive system of legal assistance
(covering legal advice, preliminary legal aid and legal aid by way of repre¬
sentation by solicitor and counsel in all courts and tribunals) to persons
within the income and capital ranges specified in the Legal Aid Act, i960,
was recommended in a majority report of a committee appointed by the
Northern Ireland Minister of Home Affairs. Legislation to introduce a Legal
Aid and Advice Scheme is pending.
TREATMENT OF OFFENDERS
The chief aims of the penal system of the United Kingdom are to deter the
potential law-breaker and to reform the convicted offender. The element of
deterrence is intended to lie in the fear of detection, public trial, and possibility
of punishment rather than in the severity of the punishment itself. The treat¬
ment of offenders today is based increasingly on the recognition that the
community has a responsibility not simply to punish or reject the law-breaker
but to prevent him from returning to crime.
Penalties
LAW AND ORDER 1U1
Except in relation to murder and certain rare offences for which there is a
fixed penalty, the court has discretion to select the penalty (within maxima
prescribed by law) that it considers most suitable in the light of the circum¬
stances of the offence and the offender. In general, the courts have power to
impose either imprisonment or a fine for serious offences (both in certain
cases); while most minor offences are punishable by a fine only, with the
alternative of imprisonment if the fine is not paid. Moreover, the court has
discretion, instead of sentencing an offender, to discharge him absolutely, to
place him on probation or (in England, Wales and Northern Ireland only) to
discharge him conditionally (i.e. subject to the condition that he commits no
offence during a specified period not exceeding twelve months). Summary
courts, when they consider sentencing a first offender to imprisonment, must
be satisfied that no other method of dealing with him is appropriate.
In England and Wales no offender under the age of 17 years is subject
to imprisonment in any circumstances. Offenders aged 17 and under 21 years
are not sent to prison for any period between six months1 and three years
(unless they are persistent offenders, in which case a sentence of imprisonment
of 18 months or more may be passed). In Scotland the Criminal Justice
(Scotland) Act, 1963, provides that no person under 21 years of age may be
detained in a prison. Methods of dealing with young offenders are described
on p. 106.
Persistent offenders may be sentenced to corrective training or preventive
detention. Corrective training which lasts from two to four years (seven years
in Northern Ireland), is designed to correct a man’s criminal tendency and
encourage him to become a responsible citizen. Preventive detention is
usually imposed on offenders with a long record of previous offences, whose
response to previous institutional training has been unsatisfactory; the sentence
runs for not less than five years (three in Northern Ireland) or more than
14 years, as the court decides.
Since 1957 the death penalty in Great Britain for murder has been limited
to murders classified as ‘capital murder’. Tl hese are not necessarily the type
of murder regarded as the most wicked, but are those which strike especially
at the maintenance of law and order and on which the deterrent effect of
capital punishment is believed to be most likely to operate, i.e. murder done
in the course or furtherance of theft, murder by shooting or by causing an
explosion, murder committed to escape lawful arrest or to effect or assist
escape or rescue from legal custody, murder of a police officer (or person
assisting him) acting in the execution of his duty, or murder by a prisoner
of a prison officer (or person assisting him) acting in the execution of his duty.
The penalty for murder not in capital categories is imprisonment for life,
except that the death penalty continues to apply where a person who is
convicted of murder has previously been convicted of another murder com¬
mitted in Great Britain on a different occasion. Murderers under the age of
18 years at the time that the crime was committed are not sentenced to death
or to life imprisonment, but ‘to be detained during Her Majesty s pleasure .
If it can be proved that a person accused of murder was suffering from such
abnormality of mind as substantially impaired his mental responsibility at
the date of conviction, he is entitled to be convicted of the lesser offence of
manslaughter.
1 The Criminal Justice Act, 1961, provides for the eventual abolition of short-term
sentences (less than six months) for young offenders such sentences to be replaced,
when sufficient accommodation is available, by detention in a detention centre for
between three and six months.

BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Administrative
Authorities
It is the long-established practice for the Home Secretary or the Secretary
of State for Scotland to review every capital case before the law is allowed to
take its course and to consider whether there are grounds for advising the
Crown to exercise the prerogative of mercy. Where a reprieve is recommended,
the sentence of death is commuted to one of imprisonment for life. A person
subject to a sentence of life imprisonment is liable to be detained for the rest
of his life, but the Home Secretary may, if he thinks fit, release him on licence
at any time. In recent years, the period served, in an average case, by persons
whose death sentences have been commuted has been about nine years, but
the period varies according to the circumstances of the particular case and
the question of whether the prisoner’s release would be likely to involve risk
to the public.
The Homicide Act, 1957, is not applicable to Northern Ireland where
sentence of death is passed in all cases of murder. The exercise of the preroga¬
tive of mercy in such cases is considered by the Northern Ireland Cabinet,
which tenders advice to the Governor in his capacity as representative of
the Crown.
In England and Wales the Home Secretary is the minister generally responsible
for legislation relating to the treatment of offenders, for collecting statistical
and other information about the operation of the penal system, for reviewing
the advantages and defects of the various methods of treating offenders, and
for bringing information about these methods to the attention of the courts.
He is specifically responsible for supervising the approved schools, for pro¬
moting the efficiency of the probation service, and for providing, maintaining
and managing prisons and borstal institutions.
The Home Secretary is advised in the discharge of his duties as the central
authority for all questions relating to the treatment of offenders by the
Advisory Council for the Treatment of Offenders, which also acts as the
National Working Party Group for the Economic and Social Council of the
United Nations, and as the National Committee of the International Penal
and Penitentiary Commission.
The general supervision of penal institutions is the responsibility of visiting
committees, appointed by the justices, for those prisons to which convicted
persons are committed direct from their courts, or of boards of visitors,
appointed by the Home Secretary, for the other prisons and institutions.
The main functions of the committees and boards are: to act as the superior
disciplinary authority of the prison or institution; to constitute an independent
judicial body to which any prisoner or inmate may make a complaint or
request; and to report direct to the Home Secretary, both by formal annual
report and as occasion may require, on every aspect of the administration of
the prison. The boards also advise on the release on licence of the inmates of
borstal institutions.
The penal systems in Scotland and Northern Ireland are based on principles
similar to those applied in England and Wales. The Secretary of State for
Scotland is advised in the discharge of his duties by the Scottish Advisory
Council on the Treatment of Offenders. In Northern Ireland the system is
the responsibility of the Ministry for Home Affairs.
The rising trend in the total number of people found guilty of indictable
offences has led to severe overcrowding in prisons and has strained the
resources of other agencies, such as borstals, approved schools and the pro¬
bation service. Measures to deal with the problems include plans for a
Prisons
LAW AND ORDER io3
substantial increase in the number of prisons and other penal institutions
and the reconstruction or replacement of a number of old prisons.
Prisons in England and Wales are of the following types: local prisons of
the ordinary type, which receive all classes of prisoners direct from the courts;
local prisons of a special type, which may be open or walled, for short-
sentence prisoners, chiefly first offenders; young prisoners’ centres for the
reception of youths under 21 years of age with sentences of three months
or over, as far as accommodation permits; regional training prisons (some of
which are open) for first offenders and trainable prisoners of other categories,
including those sentenced to corrective training; and central prisons for
habitual law-breakers and long-term first offenders—one for the latter class
is an open prison.
The Scottish system of classification of prisoners is broadly the same as
that of England and Wales; but each prison in Scotland, except the open
prison, accommodates more than one classification group. In Northern
Ireland, with its smaller population, the necessity for several kinds of prison
to separate the various classes of prisoners does not arise to the same extent.
Glassification of Every person committed to prison is received in the local prison serving the
Prisoners court from which he is committed. Subsequently, he may either serve his
whole sentence at the local prison or be sent to another institution, depending
on his age, the length and nature of his sentence, and his personal history
and character.
The object of classification is first to ensure the separation of the sexes, of
young persons from adults, of untried prisoners from convicted prisoners
and of civil prisoners from criminal prisoners; secondly, to prevent con¬
tamination, among convicted prisoners, of the better by the worse; and
thirdly, to provide training appropriate to their needs for those among
convicted prisoners who seem likely to benefit therefrom.
Training In prison training, efforts are being made to provide (1) work of a kind likely
to help fit prisoners to earn their living after release, with technical training
in skilled trades for certain persons, (2) suitable educational facilities, and
(3) opportunities for the development of a sense of personal responsibility,
including (for suitable prisoners) training in open conditions. A system of
vocational training courses, designed to give partial training in skilled trades
and to enable suitable trainees to take the examinations of recognised
examining bodies, is in operation in borstals and a number of prisons.
Employment New problems in the organisation and management of industries in prisons
have arisen as the result of changes that have taken place both in industrial
methods and in the prison system during the past thirty years, and because
of the substantial increase in the number of prison inmates for whom employ¬
ment must be found. The whole subject is therefore being studied by a
standing Advisory Council on the Employment of Prisoners, appointed by
the Home Secretary and the Secretary of State for Scotland. The Council
has so far made two reports: the first deals with work for prisoners, including
suitable kinds of work, job training and earnings; the second deals with the
employment and industrial training of borstal inmates.
Except in local prisons in England and Wales, where the hours are shorter,
most prisoners spend about 40 hours a week in the prison workshops or in
other employment such as building, farm work, domestic work and gardening
in the prison precincts. A few prisoners are employed outside the prisons
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
IO4
on various projects of public value, such as agriculture, land drainage, road
works and forestry.
In England, Wales, and Scotland, small payments are made to inmates for
the work they do, and good work is rewarded by payments above the mini¬
mum; in Northern Ireland there is a progressive system of earnings, which
is not related to output nor to work done.
Education Educational schemes are provided in prisons in England, Wales, and Scotland
by the local education authorities with the advice of the Government depart¬
ments responsible for education in their respective countries, and in Northern
Ireland by the Ministry of Home Affairs. In England and Wales the local
authorities also provide tutor organisers and most of the instructors; in all
cases the full cost of their services is reimbursed. Evening classes and a wide
range of correspondence courses are available for those who have a serious
desire to improve their education and qualifications.
Educational schemes are supplemented by periodical lectures, film displays,
concerts, and dramatic performances. Prisoners may also use the prison
library, which in most cases is now stocked by the county, city or borough
library committee.
Medical Medical attention is provided by full-time and part-time medical officers whose
Services duties include not only the care of the physical and mental health of prison
inmates, but also the oversight of those services which affect health in prisons.
A few prisons and borstals have their own psychiatric clinics (with qualified
medical staff, visiting psychotherapists and psychiatric social workers) to
which inmates may be transferred where necessary. In England and Wales
there is one psychiatric prison, with accommodation for some 350 people,
and a prison psychological service, whose officers are employed to assist
governors and medical officers in their work of examining and classifying
prisoners, and to advise on methods of treatment. The hospital facilities of
the National Health Service (see Chapter 5) are also available for the treatment
of prisoners in appropriate cases. Arrangements may be made for prisoners
serving short-term sentences to receive treatment after release.
Religion and A chaplain of the Church of England (in Scotland, of the Church of Scotland
Welfare and in Northern Ireland, of the Church of Ireland and Presbyterian Church)
and a Roman Catholic priest are appointed to every prison. Ministers of the
Methodist Church and of other denominations are either appointed or
specially called in as required. Regular services are held, and chaplains and
other ministers of religion may visit prisoners in their cells.
Welfare is the general concern of the prison staff, particularly of the
chaplains and assistant governors but all prisons have resident or visiting
welfare officers.
Prisoners may be visited by their relatives and friends at specified intervals
and by prison visitors specially appointed for the purpose. The voluntary
work of prison visitors in England and Wales is co-ordinated and guided by
the National Association of Prison Visitors.
Privileges and On reception under sentence, all prisoners, except those sentenced to im-
Discipline prisonment for life, are credited with remission of one-third of their sentence
(one-fourth in Northern Ireland in respect of sentences of less than two
years), provided that this does not reduce their sentence below 31 days (in
Scotland, 30 days). A life prisoner may be released on licence by the Home
Discharge and
After-Care
LAW AND ORDER I05
Secretary (see p. 102). All prisoners become entitled to certain personal
privileges at successive stages in their sentence.
For breaches of discipline in prison, the prison governor, the visiting
committee or the board of visitors have power to order forfeiture of remission
(or postponement of the date of release) and forfeiture of privileges.
All prisons have welfare officers, either resident or visiting. These officers
are available to help in any personal problems that a prisoner may have;
to take such steps as may be practicable to alleviate any anxieties he may
express about the circumstances of his dependants; and to encourage and
assist him to make suitable plans for his future. Prison welfare officers work
closely with those agencies in the community whose aid the prisoner and
his family may need either during his sentence or after his release.
In England and Wales pre-release courses, at which experts hold open
forum with prisoners nearing their release on the domestic, social and
industrial problems with which they are likely to be faced, are conducted
at all prisons. Specially selected men amongst those sentenced to preventive
detention, long-term imprisonment and, in Scotland, corrective training are
allowed to work, as free men, in ordinary civilian jobs outside prison during
the months immediately preceding their discharge; hostels for this purpose
have been established at several prisons. Home leave, allowing five clear
days at home, is extensively granted to many categories of prisoners with
sentences of two years or over towards the end of their sentences to enable
them to make family adjustments and contacts with potential employers.
On discharge from local or regional prisons, certain classes of prisoners
serving sentences of less than four years (three years in the case of most
women) are assisted by local discharged prisoners’ aid societies (voluntary
bodies supported partly by private and partly by public funds) or by the
National Association of Discharged Prisoners’ Aid Societies (a central co¬
ordinating body, maintained by grants from public funds for its administrative
expenses). The National Association is also responsible for welfare and after¬
care arrangements at regional training prisons and special local prisons.
Statutory supervision in England and Wales applies to persons released
from preventive detention and corrective training, to young prisoners, and to
persons discharged from borstals. The sanctions for failure to observe the
conditions of supervision are recall to prison or borstal. Statutory supervision
is the responsibility of the Central After-Care Association, a voluntary body
financed from public funds and governed by a council appointed by the
Home Secretary, which includes in its membership representatives of the
Ministry of Labour, of the National Assistance Board and of the probation
service. The Association also undertakes voluntary after-care of certain
persons released after serving long terms of imprisonment. The After-Care
Council, appointed by the Secretary of State for Scotland, carries out similar
duties in Scotland.
The Central After-Care Association works through local associates, usually
probation officers, and the National Association also works through the after¬
care officers of local aid societies. The After-Care Council in Scotland uses
the services of voluntary guardians. The officers of the local organisations
make all arrangements for the reception of the prisoner after his discharge,
and will advise, assist and befriend him for as long as is necessary, or as
required by statute.
In Northern Ireland the after-care of all prisoners is carried out by the
discharged prisoners’ aid societies with the help of probation officers.

Treatment of
Young
Offenders
Remand
Approved Schools
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Under the English legal system, a child under the age of ten cannot be
charged with an offence. A child between ten and 14 years old, who is
charged with an offence other than homicide, must be dealt with in a
juvenile court unless charged jointly with an adult. A young person (i.e. one
between 14 and 17 years of age) charged with an indictable offence may be
dealt with summarily (as is usually the case) or committed for trial by jury.
In certain cases young persons may claim to be tried by jury, though this
right is rarely exercised.
In Scotland all children and young persons between eight and 17 years of
age who are charged with offences must be dealt with in juvenile courts,
unless they have been charged in conjunction with adult offenders or are
proceeded against on indictment.
In Northern Ireland, likewise, a child or young person between the ages
of eight and 17 will normally be dealt with by a juvenile court unless charged
jointly with an adult or committed for trial by jury in the case of an indictable
offence. Such committal may take place at the request of the accused’s parents
or at the discretion of the juvenile court.
Methods of treatment available in law for dealing with children and young
persons found guilty of committing an offence include: absolute discharge;
conditional discharge (in England and Wales only); fines imposed upon the
offender or, in certain circumstances, upon his parents; probation; committal
to the care of a fit person (normally the appropriate local authority) until
the age of 18; or committal to an approved school. Offenders aged not less
than 10 and under 21 years may be ordered to attend an attendance centre,
aged not less than 14 and under 21, they may be detained in a detention
centre; aged not less than 15 and under 21, they may be sent for a period
of borstal training. In Scotland offenders of 17 and under 21 found unsuitable
for detention centre or borstal training may be detained in a young offenders
institution.
In England, Wales and Scotland remand homes are provided by local
authorities for the custody of boys and girls under the age of 17 before their
appearance in court, or between court appearances (while inquiries are
made as to the best method of treatment for them), while they are awaiting
vacancies in approved schools, or for a short period (up to a month) of
punitive detention. In Northern Ireland the responsibility for providing
or arranging for the provision of remand homes rests with the Ministry of
Home Affairs.
In addition to remand homes, remand centres are being established in
England and Wales (and are planned for Scotland), to which a court may send
young persons between the ages of 17 and 21 who would otherwise be re¬
manded to prison, and those under 17 years old who are unsuitable for
remand homes.
The system of remand offers valuable opportunities for observation, the
results of which are included in reports for the guidance of those responsible
for the future of young offenders.
Approved schools are residential schools for boys and girls under the age of
17 years who, the courts consider, need not only removal from home but
also a fairly long period of training. These boys and girls may be sent to
approved schools because they have committed an offence or are in need of
care or protection or on certain other grounds not involving the commission
of an offence. The schools may be provided by local authorities, by voluntary
organisations concerned with the welfare of children and young people on a
LAW AND ORDER '
national scale, or by local committees formed by people interested in such
work. In England and Wales the schools must be approved by the Home
Secretary; in Scotland, by the Secretary of State for Scotland; and in Northern
Ireland, where they are known as training schools, by the Ministry of Home
Affairs.
The schools are for boys only or for girls only. They are classified according
to age on admission, and include separate schools for Roman Catholics.
Assignment to a school in the appropriate age group is determined by such
considerations as the location of the school in relation to the home, the type
of training provided, and the probable reaction of a child or young person
to the individual personalities of the staff.
The main ingredients of approved school training are education in the
formal sense, religious education and guidance, craft training (for the older
groups), attention to health and to the use of recreation and leisure, social
training and personal case work. Its primary object is the re-adjustment of
the boys and girls for their return to the community; contact is maintained
with their homes while they are in approved schools and after they ha\ e left
help and supervision are given.
The period during which a child or young person may be detained in an
approved school or training school is three years, except for boys and girls
under the age of 12 years and 4 months at the time of committal, who may
be kept until the age of 15 years and 4 months, and those over the age of
16 on committal, who can be detained only up to the age of 19, or 19! if
they have been found guilty of absconding or of serious misconduct in an
approved school. In England and Wales young people over the age of 15,
and in Scotland any approved school pupils, who present a threat to the
discipline of a school may be temporarily transferred on a justice’s warrant
to another establishment. In England and Wales those who are thought to
be more suitable for borstal training may, with the consent of the Home
Secretary, be brought before a magistrates’ court, which has power to order
removal to borstal. Managers of all approved schools are under an obligation
to review the progress of each pupil in their charge with a view to granting a
release as soon as he or she is fit for it; release within the first six months of
the detention period requires the consent of the responsible Minister.
Statutory responsibility for after-care of boys and girls released from approved
schools rests on the school managers who are assisted in this work by welfare
officers and the probation and child-care services.
Attendance Centres A number of attendance centres have been established in England and W ales
to deal with boys between the ages of 10 and 17 found guilty of offences for
which an adult can be sentenced to imprisonment. This form of treatment is
designed to teach young offenders a respect for the law and to give them
some instruction in the proper use of leisure. Boys ordered to attend must
do so during their spare time on Saturday mornings or afternoons; they may
be required to attend for up to three hours on any one occasion and for a
total of not less than twelve hours (with certain exceptions) and not more
than twenty-four. The activities include a period of instruction in handicrafts,
or a lecture (for example, on first aid) and a period of physical training or
disciplinary tasks under supervision. Efforts are made at the centres to
induce the boys to join a youth club or other suitable organisation.
There is also a centre for youths aged 17 to 21 in Manchester. This operates
on lines similar to those adopted at the juvenile centres, but the acti\ ities
have been adapted to meet the needs of the older age group.
io8
Detention Centres
Borstal Institutions
Probation
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Detention centres provide a means of treating young offenders for whom a
long period of residential training in an approved school or borstal does not
seem necessary but who cannot be taught respect for the law by such measures
as fines or probation. In England and Wales junior centres are available for
boys between the ages of 14 and 17 years, and senior centres for boys between
the ages of 17 and 21. One centre is also available for girls in both age groups.
In Scotland there are two senior centres. Detention in England and Wales
may be for not less than three and not more than six months; if consecutive
sentences are passed, the total term may not exceed nine months at any one time.
Remission of up to one-sixth of the sentence may be earned for good conduct. In
Scotland the fixed period for all detention centre sentences is three months.
As the intention is primarily deterrent, the life of a centre is strict and
vigorous, demanding a brisk tempo and the highest possible standard of
discipline and behaviour in every aspect of training. The routine provides a
normal working week of 44 hours, including one hour daily devoted to
physical training, and experience has shown that much positive training can
be given within the limits of this framework. Boys of compulsory school age
receive full-time education, and classes of further education are provided for
others in the evenings. Recent legislation provides for statutory after-care for
up to 12 months after discharge from a detention centre.
The borstal training system consists of different borstals specialising in
different types of young offender, classified according to such criteria as age,
intelligence and criminal sophistication. There are also a few borstals for
special purposes, such as allocation or recall. In England and Wales the
period of the sentence ranges from six months to two years and is followed
by supervision for two years from the date of release. In Scotland, where
there is no minimum period of detention, the maximum is two years and the
supervision period is for one year from the date of release from the institution.
Sentences in Northern Ireland are for periods not exceeding three years
including the period under supervision; normally release does not take place
until at least nine months of the sentence has expired. The system is essentially
remedial and educational, based on personal training by a carefully selected
staff. Emphasis is placed on vocational training in skilled trades; there is
much freedom of movement, and many borstals are conducted in open
conditions. An initial period of classification ensures that each young offender
is sent to the institution best suited to his or her requirements.
The probation service is designed to secure the rehabilitation of an offender
while he remains at work or at school under the supervision of a probation
officer, whose duty it is to advise, assist and befriend him. A cardinal feature
of the service is that it relies on the co-operation of the offender. Before
making a probation order, the court must explain its effects and make sure
that the probationer understands that if he fails to comply with the require¬
ments of the order he will be liable to be dealt with for the original offence.
A probation order cannot be made without the consent of the person con¬
cerned unless (in England, Wales, and Northern Ireland only) he is under
14 years of age. The order usually requires the probationer to keep in regular
touch with the probation officer, to be of good behaviour and to lead an
industrious life. It may also require him to live in a specified place, or to
submit to treatment for his mental condition. A probation order is made for
not less than one year and not more than three years.
Every magistrates’ court and superior criminal court must have available
the services of probation officers of both sexes. In London the appointment

of probation officers is the responsibility of the Home Secretary, and in
Northern Ireland of the Ministry of Home Affairs; elsewhere it is the
responsibility of probation committees appointed by magistrates in England
and Wales, and by local authorities in Scotland (except for certain ex officio
members), but first appointments are subject to confirmation by the Home
Secretary and the Secretary of State for Scotland respectively. Training
facilities in England and Wales are provided by the Home Office on the
advice of the Probation Advisory and Training Board and are made available,
by arrangement, to Northern Ireland officers. In Scotland training is provided
during the first year of appointment and before the officer enters on the
duties of the service.
Research into the causes and prevention of crime and into various methods
of dealing with offenders is increasingly recognised as of vital importance in
dealing with the problems of delinquency, more especially in view of the
continued rise in crime which has been a disquieting feature of the social
scene since the end of the second world war. Such research is being under¬
taken by the Institute of Criminology in Cambridge University, which, in
addition to its research activities, conducts advanced courses in criminology
for people engaged in work relating to the treatment of offenders and the
administration of the criminal law, and a postgraduate course in criminology.
A number of other academic organisations, including the Tavistock Institute
of Human Relations, the London School of Economics, Birkbeck College, the
Institute of Psychiatry at the Maudsley Hospital, Denmark Hill, the Depart¬
ment of Social Administration at Manchester University, the University of
Oxford and, in Scotland, the Universities of Glasgow and Edinburgh, are
also studying various aspects of the problem. The research unit at the Home
Office, which is associated with some of the academic projects, has its own
programme of research.
In addition to research, special inquiries into particular questions are con¬
ducted as necessary, by advisory bodies or specially appointed committees.
Reports have been issued by the Advisory Councils on the Treatment of
Offenders (see p. 102) on such matters as corporal punishment, the after-care
and supervision of discharged prisoners, custodial training for young offenders,
non-residential treatment of offenders under 21 years, and preventive deten¬
tion. Among other committees which have submitted reports are the Home
Office Departmental Committee on Children and Young Persons, which
made 125 recommendations on various legal and administrative aspects of
the working of the law in England and Wales concerning young delinquents
and children in need of care or protection; and the Interdepartmental Com¬
mittee on the Business of the Criminal Courts, which recommended a
number of changes in the present arrangements in England and Wales for
bringing to trial people charged with criminal offences and for providing the
courts with the information necessary to enable them to select the most
appropriate treatment for offenders. Many of the recommendations of the
latter committee have already been given effect in the Criminal Justice
Administration Act, 1962.
THE POLICE SERVICE
The police service of Great Britain is organised and controlled on a local
basis under the guidance of those ministers of the Crown who are responsible
I 10
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
POLICE IN
GREAT BRITAIN
Police Forces
Police
Authorities
for the maintenance of law and order in their respective countries. In England
and Wales the responsible minister is the Home Secretary; in Scotland, the
Secretary of State for Scotland. In Northern Ireland the police force is con¬
trolled by an Inspector-General, who is responsible to the Minister of Home
Affairs.
There are 157 regular police forces in Great Britain: 125 in England and
Wales and 32 in Scotland. Each of these forces (between which there is close
and constant co-operation) is responsible for a separate police district. In
England and Wales the forces are defined according to area of responsibility
as: county forces; borough forces; combined forces, which are forces whose
area of responsibility extends over neighbouring counties or boroughs; the
Metropolitan Police Force, which is responsible for an area of approximately
fifteen miles radius from Charing Cross, but excluding the City of London;
and the City of London force. In Scotland there are county forces, burgh
forces and combined forces.
In England and Wales and Scotland police forces vary considerably in size
according to the area and population which they serve. Thus the Metropolitan
Police Force has a strength of approximately 18,000, while that of the smallest
force in Scotland is 18.
The actual strength of the regular police force in Great Britain is approxi¬
mately 87,000, including women. This is below the desirable figure, but the
improvement in recruitment shown in recent years has been maintained.
In addition to the regular police forces, there are police forces maintained
by certain public services, such as the statutory transport authorities, and
the police of the Service departments.
In the counties of England and Wales the police authority is the standing
joint committee, half of whose members are members of the county council
while the other half are justices of the peace. In the boroughs the police
authority is known as the ‘watch committee’ and is elected by the council
from among its members. The police authority of a combined force is made
up of representatives of the constituent areas as prescribed in the scheme
under which they combine.
The police authority for the Metropolitan Police Force is the Home
Secretary. In the City of London, the Court of Common Council is the
police authority, although it usually appoints a standing committee to deal
with all police matters on its behalf.
In Scotland the police authority for the counties is the county or joint
county council; in the large burghs it is the town council; where there are
combined forces there is a joint police committee.
It is the statutory duty of the police authorities to establish and maintain
efficient police forces for their areas. They are responsible for the appointment
of the chief officer of police in their areas, subject to the approval of the Home
Secretary in the provinces of England and Wales, of the Crown in the City
of London, and, in Scotland, of the Secretary of State. In the Metropolitan
Police District, the chief officer of police and his immediate subordinates are
appointed by the Crown on the recommendation of the Home Secretary.
The police authorities are also responsible (with the approval of the Home
Secretary or the Secretary of State for Scotland) for the size of their forces;
for paying the members of the forces their salaries; for providing and main¬
taining police premises; and for exercising disciplinary functions in relation
to the most senior officers.
LAW AND ORDER
111
Central
Authority
Police Officers
Co-ordination in the administration of the police service is exercised through
detailed police regulations which are made by the Home Secretary and the
Secretary of State for Scotland under the Police Act, 1919, the Police (Scotland)
Act, 1956, and under the Police (Pensions) Acts. The police regulations cover
such matters as organisation, discipline, pay, allowances, pensions, clothing
and conditions of service of the members of all police forces to which the
Acts apply; some of these are first negotiable on the Police Council for
Great Britain.
In their supervisory responsibilities the Home Secretary and the Secretary
of State for Scotland are assisted by Her Majesty’s Chief Inspector of Con¬
stabulary and seven inspectors. Each inspector is responsible for a certain
number of forces, and satisfies himself of their continuing efficiency by annual
inspection, ad hoc visits and consultations when particular problems arise.
The inspectors report to the Ministers on the condition of all the forces, with
the exception of the Metropolitan Police Force.
All police authorities receive a Government grant equal to half their net
expenditure reckoned in accordance with the provisions of orders made under
the Miscellaneous Financial Provisions Act, 1950 (as regards England and
Wales), and the Police (Scotland) Acts, 1946 and 1956 (as regards Scotland).
These orders empower the Home Secretary and the Secretary of State for
Scotland to withhold the grant, in whole or in part, permanently or for such
time as they may determine, if they are not satisfied that a police area is
efficiently policed, that a force is properly maintained and administered, or
that the rates of pay or allowances are as prescribed or approved by them.
The Police Council for Great Britain, which is representative on the one
side of all ranks of the police service and on the other of the local police
authorities, the Home Office and the Scottish Home and Health Department,
has power to reach agreement on conditions of service in the police forces,
including police pay, and on certain procedural matters. It may also advise
the Ministers on police pensions and any other matter which may be referred
to it by the Ministers or any other body concerned.
There are several different kinds of police officer in Great Britain: regular
police officers who usually serve for 25 years or more and thereafter retire on
pension; members of the first police reserve, which is composed almost
entirely of police pensioners or men with previous police experience who are
prepared to give whole-time paid service to a particular force in an emergency,
whether national or local; and special constables, who are volunteers who
perform short periods of duty without pay in their spare time from their
normal occupations.1
In general, entry to the regular police force is open to men between the
ages of 19 and 30, although an exception may be made, in special circumstances
approved by the Ministers and on the recommendation of the appointing
authority, in the case of men of over 30 years of age. Women entrants in
England and Wales must be between the ages of 20 and 35, and in Scotland
between 20 and 30 years old. The standard police ranks in Great Britain,
except in the Metropolitan Police District, are: chief constable, superintendent,
inspector, sergeant and constable. Intermediate ranks may also be adopted in
areas where varying degrees of responsibility make them necessary. In the
Metropolitan Police District the chief officer is the Commissioner of Police
1 In Scotland the employment of special constables, other than in emergencies, is
subject to strict limitations.

of the Metropolis. He is assisted by a deputy commissioner and four assistant
commissioners. Next in rank are commanders, then deputy commanders;
thereafter (i.e. from chief superintendent downwards) the ranks are the same
as in the rest of the country. In the City of London the ranks are the same as
in the provinces, except that the chief officer is the Commissioner of Police
and the second is command is an assistant commissioner.
No member of the police service may belong to a trade union, since it is a
basic principle of the service that its members must not only be free from
political bias, but must also be seen to be free of it. All ranks, however, have
their own representative associations which can make representations to
ministers or to police authorities on matters of interest or concern to their
members.
Police cadets are recruited by most forces from among youths between 16 and
18 years of age. They have no police powers but are given some training in
police work, partly as useful preparation for subsequent appointment as
constables and partly to give them sufficient insight into police duties to
enable them to decide whether or not they wish to make a career in the police
service. A few forces also recruit girl cadets.
A number of police authorities employ civilians as shorthand-typists, switch¬
board operators, mechanics, canteen staff and cleaners, in order to release
uniformed personnel for police duties.
Traffic wardens are employed in London and several other areas to assist the
police in dealing with the problems created by parked vehicles. In specially
designated areas traffic wardens have power to give motorists who have
committed certain parking offences an option to pay a fixed penalty to the
clerk of the appropriate magistrates’ court instead of having their cases tried.
Every police officer in Great Britain is an independent holder of a public
office. His powers as a constable, whether conferred by statute or by common
law, are exercised by him by virtue of his office and cannot be exercised on
the responsibility of any person but himself. Thus, a police officer is personally
answerable at law for any wrongful act. He is not the servant of the police
authority, and in discharging his duties must rely on his own good sense,
discretion and knowledge of the law.
The many and varied functions of a police officer as a constable range from
the protection of persons and property, road or street patrolling and traffic
control to criminal investigation, the apprehension of offenders, and, in
England and Wales, the preparation and presentation of straightforward cases
in magistrates’ courts.
All police forces have their own criminal investigation departments, and
many have other specialised departments, including motor patrols, river police
(in districts which include long stretches of navigable waterway), a mounted
branch (for maintaining order and safety in large crowds), and police dogs.
During recent years a number of common services have been established to
supplement those provided by the police authorities for their own use. In
England and Wales such services include a training service, which provides
eight residential district training centres and a central police college; an
installation and maintenance service of wireless equipment for the police; a
forensic science service, which provides laboratories for the use of regional
groups of forces; and arrangements for conducting centralised police pro¬
motion examinations. In Scotland there is a central police college, which

Commission

IRELAND

provides training courses for recruits and courses of higher training, and
there are central arrangements for promotion examinations; but the installation
and maintenance of wireless equipment is a direct charge upon the police
authorities concerned and there is no centrally run forensic science service.
The resources of the Glasgow police force’s criminal investigation department
(which includes an extensive laboratory service) are, however, made available
to other forces, and the universities render assistance when required.
A number of national services are provided by the Metropolitan Police
Force, whose functions in this respect include: (i) the maintenance of
criminal records* and fingerprints, which are available to all police forces of
the United Kingdom and to certain foreign forces; (2) the publication of the
Police Gazette,1 2 which contains particulars of people wanted for crime and
details of stolen property, and is supplied without charge to the police forces
of the United Kingdom and to certain other Commonwealth and foreign
forces; (3) the organisation and control of the special branch of the criminal
investigation department at New Scotland Yard, whose duties include the
physical protection of royalty, some ministers, and distinguished foreign
visitors; and (4) the carrying out of extradition orders made by the courts.
The Metropolitan Police Force also provides the United Kingdom bureau
of the International Criminal Police Organisation (Interpol). For certain of
these services, the Metropolitan Police Force receives an additional Exchequer
grant.
A Royal Commission on the Police was appointed in i960 to review the
constitutional position of the police throughout Great Britain and the arrange¬
ments for their remuneration, administration and control. Within a few
months of its appointment the Commission issued an interim report recom¬
mending substantial increases in the pay of constables, on which the Govern¬
ment took immediate action. The final report, issued in 1962, included
recommendations for a reduction in the number of separate police forces;
for greater uniformity in the composition and functions of local police
authorities; for an extension of the responsibility and powers of the Home
Secretary and the Secretary of State for Scotland in regard to the efficiency of
the police services; for the appointment of a chief inspector of constabulary
for the whole of Great Britain and of additional regional inspectors; and for
the establishment of a new central unit for planning and research. A Chief
Inspector of Constabulary has already been appointed (see p. 111) and a
planning and research unit has been set up at the Home Office; final decisions
on the other proposals in the report have not yet been made.
The Royal Ulster Constabulary comes under the direction of the Inspector
General, who is responsible to the Minister of Home Affairs. It undertakes
the policing of the whole of Northern Ireland, its cost being borne by the
Northern Ireland Exchequer.
The strength of the Royal Ulster Constabulary is approximately 3,000. The
Inspector General has, under his immediate command, a deputy inspector
general, a commissioner for the City of Belfast, and a county inspector for
each of the six counties. The area is further sub-divided into districts, each

district coming under a district inspector and each sub-district under a head
constable or a sergeant. Conditions of service and pay follow closely on the
lines of the police service in Great Britain, and the general duties pertaining
to the various ranks are much the same. Although the more senior ranks bear
different titles, the ranks of head constable, sergeant and constable are broadly
equivalent to the three junior ranks in the police service of Great Britain.
The Ulster Special Constabulary also comes under the direction of the
Inspector General. In the main, this force is a part-time body and, apart from
training, its duties consist in affording assistance to the Royal Ulster Con¬
stabulary on special occasions; if necessary, however, its part-time personnel
may be mobilised for full-time duty.

DEFENCE
The defence forces of Britain are required for three main tasks: to maintain
the country’s security; to carry out Britain’s obligations for the protection
of its territories overseas and other territories to which a special duty is o\\ ed
by treaty or otherwise; and to contribute to the defence of the free world
and the prevention of war in accordance with arrangements made with
individual countries and under collective security treaties.
At the same time it is recognised that the most effective means of accom¬
plishing these purposes would be through international agreement on general
disarmament, with adequate international inspection and control, for which
Britain continues to work.
Britain’s defence policy provides for the maintenance of a balance between
nuclear and conventional strength, neither element being so small as to
encourage an aggressor to seek a quick advantage, or to risk a pro\ocati\e
local incident which could develop quickly into a major war. It is estimated
that strategic nuclear weapons, and the means of delivering them, account for
some 10 per cent of the defence budget.
The object of nuclear defence policy is the deterrence of an aggressor by
the fear of devastating retaliation. Britain’s principal ‘nuclear deterrent’ is
at present the Blue Steel propelled stand-off bomb, carried by the V-bombers
of the Royal Air Force; these bombs greatly reduce the vulnerability of the
bomber as they can be released a long distance from the target. Long-term
nuclear strategy is based on the nuclear-powered submarine, equipped with
Polaris missiles. Under an agreement signed between the British and United
States Governments in April iq63> Britain will buy from the United States
Polaris missiles, to be fitted with British nuclear warheads, for submarines
to be built largely by Britain. Initially, four or five submarines will be
constructed, each to be equipped with 16 missiles. It is expected that the
first submarines will be ready for service by 1968.
Further nuclear striking power wall be provided by a weapon to be carried
by the TSR.2 aircraft (see p. 130). > # .
Details of the main conventional forces are given in the sections on the
three Services (pp. 121-132).
The national defence policy has been increasingly based on the realisation
that no country can protect itself in isolation and the defence of Britain is
possible only as part of a system of collective defence. Britain maintains
forces in three areas of the world as contributions to the collective security
alliances of which it is a member—the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation
(NATO) and the Western European Union (WEU), the Central Treaty
Organisation (CENTO) and the SEATO defence system in South-East Asia.
Close liaison is maintained with other Commonwealth countries, facilitating
considerable standardisation of equipment and training and interchange of
personnel.
Britain’s contribution to NATO includes over three-quarters of the
operational and reserve fleets, half of the Royal Air Force front-line aircraft

including the whole of Fighter Command and the V-bomber force, and the
British Army of the Rhine. The British Polaris submarines will be assigned
to the NATO nuclear force. A further contribution is the provision of
facilities for a depot ship in the Holy Loch (Firth of Clyde, Scotland) for
the United States Polaris submarines.
The main base for the support of CENTO is in Cyprus, where the Air
Officer Commanding-in-Chief is responsible for all British forces in the
Near East. Aden is the headquarters for Britain’s land and air forces in the
Arabian Peninsula, Persian Gulf and East Africa, together with the naval
forces allotted to the Persian Gulf. In the Mediterranean there are Army
garrisons for local defence and naval and air operating facilities in Malta and
Gibraltar.
Singapore is a base for all three Services and there are forces, including
Britain’s contribution to the Commonwealth Brigade Group (to which
Australia and New Zealand also contribute), stationed in Malaya. An
amphibious joint Service task force is maintained east of Suez.
Britain’s defence policy is set out in the statement issued in 1962, The Next
Five Years {Cmnd. 1639), to which some additional details are added by the
1963 Statement on Defence {Cmnd. 1936). The plans provide for closely
integrated well-trained, highly mobile, all-regular forces equipped with the
most modern weapons and organised on up-to-date lines; and for a central
Strategic Reserve maintained in Britain, with means of transport, including
airlift, to take it rapidly to the scene of any trouble.
Under an agreement between the British and United States Governments
signed in i960, a joint Ballistic Missile Early Warning Station has been built
at Fylingdales Moor, in Yorkshire. The United States is providing equipment
for this station.
Supreme responsibility for national defence rests with the Prime Minister
and the Cabinet, under the ultimate control of Parliament. Defence problems
are normally handled on the Cabinet’s behalf by the Defence Committee,
meeting under the chairmanship of the Prime Minister. Government depart¬
ments responsible for defence are the Ministry of Defence, the Service
Ministries (Admiralty, War Office—which is concerned with the Army—and
Air Ministry) and the Ministry of Aviation.
The Minister of Defence, who is a member of the Cabinet, decides
(subject to the responsibility of the Cabinet) all major matters of defence
policy affecting the size, organisation and disposition of the forces and their
weapons, equipment and supply (including defence research and development).
He is also ministerially responsible to the Prime Minister for the
execution of military operations approved by the Cabinet or the Defence
Committee.
The Service Ministers, working through the Board of Admiralty and the
Army and Air Councils, are responsible to the Minister of Defence for the
efficiency and administration of the three Services. The Minister of Aviation
is responsible for the supply to the Services of aircraft, guided and nuclear
weapons, and electronic equipment.
The Defence Board, of which the Minister of Defence is chairman, brings
together the Service Ministers, the Minister of Defence and the Chiefs of
Staff for consultations on defence policy and discussion of inter-Service
problems.

II?
A major reorganisation of defence administration, with the object of im¬
proving the central control of defence policy, was announced in a White
Paper, Central Organisation for Defence, Cmnd. 2097, published in July 1963.
Subject to approval of the necessary legislation by Parliament, most of the
changes will come into effect on 1st April, 1964. A unified Ministry of Defence
will be set up, under a Secretary of State for Defence, absorbing the present
Ministry of Defence, Admiralty, War Office and Air Ministry. The offices of
First Lord of the Admiralty and of Secretaries of State for War and Air will
be abolished, together with the Board of Admiralty and the Army and Air
Councils, the present governing bodies of the three Services. There will be
three Ministers of State for Defence, with responsibilities over the whole of
the defence field delegated to them by the Secretary of State, but whose
primary functions will be in respect of a designated Service as Ministers of
State for Defence (Royal Navy), (Army), (Royal Air Force). The Defence
Committee will be replaced by a Committee on Defence and Oversea Policy.
A Defence Council will be set up, exercising the powers of command and
administrative control previously exercised by the Board of Admiralty and
the Army and Air Councils and replacing the Defence Board; it will deal
mainly with major defence policy. Management will be delegated to Navy,
Army and Air Force Boards of the Defence Council.
The Chiefs of Staff Committee will retain its present form. It comprises the
Chief of the Defence Staff (who is principal military adviser to the Minister
of Defence), as chairman, and the professional heads of the three Services, and
is collectively responsible to the Government for professional advice on
strategy and military operations and on the military implications of defence
policy. Its collective advice is given to the Minister of Defence by the Chief
of the Defence Staff, who tenders his own advice, together with the views of
the other members of the committee, if the committee cannot reach agreement.
The Chief of the Defence Staff is responsible for issuing operational orders,
and he is entitled to call on the respective Chiefs of Staff for assistance from
the services of the Naval, General and Air Staffs. The Chiefs of Staff are in
attendance at meetings of the Committee on Defence and Oversea Policy, as
the nature of the business requires, and may be invited to attend meetings of
the full Cabinet as necessary; they have at all times a right of access to the
Minister of Defence and to the Prime Minister.
In recent years defence has accounted for about a quarter of all central
Government ordinary expenditure. The cost of the defence programme for
1963-64 was estimated at £1,837-7 million, or 7 per cent of the gross national
product. Britain’s contribution to the Western nuclear deterrent accounts
for some 10 per cent of this total.
Britain’s contribution to the NATO shield forces involves a deployment
of forces overseas and a consequent heavy burden on the country s balance of
payments. An agreement was reached in 1962, whereby the Federal Republic
of Germany relieves this burden to the extent of about £54 million in
each of the two years 1962-63 and 1963-64, mainly by placing in Britain
contracts for military (and some civil) goods. This figure represents three-
quarters of the foreign exchange expenditure on British forces in Germany.
In 1961 the expenditure in foreign currency for the maintenance of
British forces abroad and other military purposes amounted to some £229
million and in 1962 to some £249 million.
The allocation of finance between Government departments is shown in

The Ministry of Defence Estimates consist mainly of contributions to
NATO and other international defence organisations. The Ministry of
Public Building and Works Estimates cover works services for the three
Service departments.
Home defence expenditure by civil departments in 1963-64 is estimated
at £23-oi million.
Under the new organisation, the long-term financial planning and control
of the defence programme and the allocation of resources to the three Services
will be the responsibility of the Permanent Under-Secretary of State of the
new Ministry, who will co-ordinate the views of military, scientific and civil
administrative staffs.
The 1957 five-year plan provided for the ending of National Service and for
a reduction of about 300,000 in the combined strength of the three Services,
which stood at nearly 700,000 (adult United Kingdom males) in 1957. The
present aim is a defence force of between 390,000 and 400,000 professional
Service men, with the highest possible proportion in effective combat units,
backed by an equal number of civilians, to whom have been transferred
many duties formerly performed by uniformed members of the forces.
National Service under the National Service Acts, 1948 t° I955> consisted
of two years’ full-time service in the regular forces followed by three and a half
years’ part-time service in an auxiliary force. In the main, the Acts applied
to male British subjects between the ages of 18 and 26. While call-up for
National Service ceased in November i960, the growth of international
tension over the Berlin crisis and the temporary shortage of manpower
created during the transition to an all-regular army led to the passing of the
Army Reserve Act in 1962. This provided for a new form of volunteer
reserve, known as the Territorial Army Emergency Reserve (the ‘Ever-
Readies’), within the Territorial Army (see p. 128) and, in addition, for
permissive power to retain serving National Service men for up to six months
and to recall ex-National Service men for a similar period during their
statutory period of three and a half years’ part-time service.
An analysis of the strength of the forces in April 1963, with estimates for
1964, is given in Table 6. In addition, reserve and auxiliary forces with
training liability (volunteers and part-time National Service men) totalled
333,961 on 1 st January, 1963. After 1963 the armed forces should consist
entirely of regular volunteers, for the first time since 1939.
Arrangements for recruitment and training of regulars are summarised for
each Service separately later in this chapter. Pay and pensions are reviewed
at intervals of not more than every two years and other steps, including an

Staff College at Chesham (Buckinghamshire), where they live and work
together and where particular attention is paid to the inter-Service aspects
of staff work. This college caters for about 150 students a year from the Navy,
Army and Air Force, the Civil Service, and from other Commonwealth
countries. A few specially selected and more senior officers from the Services,
the Civil Service, and from other Commonwealth countries are sent to the
Imperial Defence College in London.

aircraft, guided weapons (including ballistic missiles), nuclear weapons, and
certain radar and other electronic equipment. The individual Service depart-

ments are responsible for the procurement of other weapons, stores and
equipment, except that responsibility for such stores and equipment when
used by more than one Service normally rests with the War Office, which in
many cases is the largest user. Improved arrangements for formulating
requirements for weapons and equipment on a Defence, rather than a single
Service basis, are proposed under the new organisation.
Production for the Services is carried out to a great extent by private industry
on a contract basis, but also by the Royal Ordnance Factories, the Royal
Dockyards and other establishments operated by the Ministry of Aviation,
the Admiralty and the War Office. The Ministry of Aviation’s research
establishments carry out research and development related to their supply
responsibilities. Among the most important of these establishments are:
the Royal Aircraft Establishments, Farnborough and Bedford; the Royal
Radar Establishment, Malvern; the National Gas Turbine Establishment,
Farnborough; the Guided Weapons Establishment (an outstation of the
Royal Aircraft Establishment) at Aberporth, Cardiganshire; the Rocket
Propulsion Establishment, Westcott, Buckinghamshire; and the Aircraft
and Armament Experimental Establishment, Boscombe Down, "Wiltshire.
Research establishments controlled by the War Office include the Roya
Armament Research and Development Establishment, Sevenoaks, Kent;
and the Fighting Vehicles Research and Development Establishment,
Chobham, Surrey. The Admiralty research establishments (see p. 123) carry
out research on ships, maritime equipment and weapons and also on certain
kinds of electronic equipment on behalf of all three Services. Current
production and development programmes are summarised later in this
chapter in the sections dealing with the three Services individually.
Development and production of nuclear warheads to meet Service require¬
ments are carried out by the Atomic Energy Authority (see p. 219) under
contract from the Ministry of Aviation, which is responsible for the completed
weapons. The Atomic Energy Authority is also co-operating with the
Admiralty in research on the development of nuclear propulsion (see p. 123).
Service officers attend courses at the Atomic Energy Research Establish¬
ment, Harwell, and have also been attached to industrial firms manufacturing
guided weapons during the development stage.
Guided missiles are tested at the Ministry of Aviation s research estabhs -
ments, and guided and ballistic missiles at the Woomera range set up in
Australia under the Joint United Kingdom/Australia Guided Weapon
Project. Service firing trials of air-to-air and surface-to-air missiles are carried
out at Aberporth and at the Army gunnery range in Anglesey; a range for
testing surface-to-surface missiles has been set up on South Uist in the
Hebrides. There is close collaboration with the United States in the exchange
of information and visits by technical personnel.
Provision for greater co-ordination of defence research and weapons
development is made in the proposals for the reorganisation of the defence
departments.
Military research work and development of new military equipment are
extremely expensive and complex and Britain is pursuing a policy of inter¬
dependence in this field with its NATO and Commonwealth partners and
with other friendly nations. One example of an interdependence project is
the joint programme that has been agreed with the German Federal Republic
and the United States to obtain logistic and operational experience of vertical
take-off and landing using the P.1127 aircraft; another is the tripartite

agreement with the German Federal Republic and France to develop the
Rolls-Royce lightweight lift engine, which should have important applications
in vertical take-off.
On the production side, Britain is taking a major part in the European
manufacture, under a NATO international agency, of the American Bullpup
short range, air-to-surface guided weapon which has been adopted by the
Royal Navy. Britain has also bought the French AS 30 air-to-surface guided
weapon for the RAF. British defence equipment has been adopted by allied
and friendly nations: for example, the United States, the German Federal
Republic, Denmark and Sweden are adopting the British 105 mm. tank gun,
while British early warning radar equipment has been adopted by several
countries and by NATO.
During the second world war British research workers played an essential
part in the allied project that led to the production of the first atomic bombs
in the United States. After the war the exchange of information on atomic
weapons was for a time prohibited by an Act1 of the United States Congress
(later amended), and Britain therefore developed its own independently.
The first test explosion of a British atomic weapon was carried out in 1952
in the Monte Bello Islands, off the north-west coast of Australia; further
tests took place a year later near the Woomera rocket range, in central
Australia, and early in 1954 it was announced that delivery of atomic weapons
to the armed forces had begun. Tests were held again in 1956 and 1957, in
the Monte Bello Islands and in the South Australian desert.
In 1955 the Government announced its intention to proceed with the
development of thermonuclear weapons. The first test explosions were
successfully carried out in May and June 1957 near Christmas Island in
the central Pacific, and further tests were carried out in the same area later
in 1957 and in 1958. The production of British kiloton and megaton weapons
has proceeded steadily and the exchange of information with the United
States2 has enabled important technical advances to be made in the design
and production of nuclear warheads which will permit a significant increase
in the rate of production. Since the resumption of nuclear weapon testing,
in September 1961, Britain has carried out two nuclear weapon tests in
Nevada, USA.
In 1963 Britain, with the United States, the Soviet Union and many other
countries, signed a treaty prohibiting testing of nuclear weapons in the
atmosphere, outer space and under water.
The Royal Navy is governed by the Board of Admiralty, which has three
civilian and six naval members. The First Lord of the Admiralty is the
minister responsible to Parliament for the Navy. The other civilian members
of the Board of Admiralty are the Civil Lord, a junior minister, and the
Permanent Secretary, who is a civil servant and responsible for the general
conduct of Admiralty business, including finance. The naval members are
1 The Atomic Energy Act, 1946 (known as the McMahon Act), subsequently replaced
by the Atomic Energy Act, 1954. Substantial relaxations were made by amending
legislation passed in 1958.
2 An Anglo-American agreement, signed in July 1958, made possible the exchange of
information on the design and manufacture of nuclear weapons. This agreement was
amended and supplemented by a further agreement, signed in May 1959, which con¬
tained provisions to enable Britain to buy from the United States component parts of
atomic weapons and weapons systems, other than actual warheads, and to make possible
the exchange of nuclear materials between the two countries.

the First Sea Lord and Chief of Naval Staff; the Second Sea Lord and Chief
of Naval Personnel; the Third Sea Lord and Controller of the Navy, whose
responsibilities include ship construction and repair, research and the
provision and repair of naval aircraft; the Fourth Sea Lord, Chief of Supplies
and Transport and Vice-Controller, who is also responsible for maintenance
and dockyard organisation; the Vice-Chief of Naval Staff, who assists the
First Sea Lord; and the Deputy Chief of Naval Staff and Fifth Sea Lord,
responsible for stating requirements for ships, aircraft and weapons and for
laying down Admiralty policy on aircraft research and development. The
membership of the proposed new Navy Board of the Defence Council will
include the Chief Scientist (Royal Navy) in addition to the membership of
the present Board of Admiralty.
The Navy’s main home commands are Portsmouth, Plymouth, Scotland
(Rosyth) and the Commander-in-Chief, Home Fleet. In the North Atlantic
and Mediterranean area, United Kingdom naval forces (assigned to NATO)
are equipped predominantly for an anti-submarine role and consist of one
aircraft carrier, one cruiser and a number of destroyers, frigates and sub¬
marines. East of Suez the fleet (with its main base at Singapore) is an all¬
purpose force of two aircraft carriers, one commando ship and one cruiser,
together with destroyers, frigates, submarines and smaller vessels. Naval
command in the Middle East rests with the Flag Officer, Middle East, and in
the Far East with the Flag Officer Commanding-in-Chief, Far East. Smaller
naval forces operate under the Commander-in-Chief, South Atlantic and
America Station, and the Senior Naval Officer, West Indies Station.
The new Navy that is coming into being is smaller than that of the past but
highly mobile and flexible. The aircraft carrier will continue to be the core,
and grouped round the carriers will be supporting ships carrying the latest
weapons for dealing with air, surface and underwater attacks and capable of
acting by themselves on detached service. Seaborne task forces will include
commando ships and assault ships designed to carry a striking force of
troops with their tanks, guns and logistic backing.
During 1963 there were 141 ships in the operational Fleet (including
4 aircraft carriers, 2 commando ships, 2 cruisers, 52 destroyers and frigates
and 35 submarines), together with 48 engaged on trials and training and
83 support ships and auxiliaries.
The modern carriers are equipped with the angled flight deck, the steam
catapult, the automatic aircraft positioning device, and the mirror and
‘Audio’ landing aids (all British inventions), and the most advanced type of
air warning and direction system. Two former aircraft carriers, the Bulwark
and the Albion, have been converted into commando carriers, designed to
carry a Royal Marine commando (some 750 men), together with helicopters,
landing craft and vehicles. For the 1970s a force of three aircraft carriers is
planned, two now in the Fleet and a third which is being designed.
Three ‘Tiger’ class cruisers, with fully automatic armament and the latest
control equipment, have been completed. Of six ‘County’ class guided
missile destroyers planned for the Navy, four have joined the active fleet.
Their armament includes the Seaslug missile, a most effective weapon for
the interception of attacking aircraft, and the shorter range Seacat missile
for close air defence.
The seven Type 81 ‘Tribal’ class frigates, embodying the new gas turbine
boost machinery pioneered by the Royal Navy, are now operational. Six

fast long-range conventional submarines of the ‘Porpoise class are now in
service, as well as ten of the highly manoeuvrable ‘Oberon’ class. The Navy’s
first nuclear-propelled submarine, the Dreadnought, was commissioned in
1963. It incorporates a United States nuclear propulsion unit. The second
nuclear submarine, Valiant, of British design, is now well advanced.
Experience gained in constructing these hunter-killers will be invaluable for
the programme of Polaris vessels now to be started.
One of the main purposes of Reserve ships is to have ready, at short notice,
ships to replace those in the Active Fleet which are damaged or withdrawn
for refit or modernisation. Under the new defence policy the number of
Reserve ships is smaller than in the past, but they are being maintained at
a higher state of readiness.
Afloat support to the Fleet for replenishment at sea, or in harbours or
anchorages, is provided by the Royal Fleet Auxiliary Service, comprising
tankers, store-issuing ships, tugs and salvage vessels. These ships fly the Blue
Ensign and are manned by Merchant Navy officers and seamen.
The dockyards at Portsmouth, Devonport, Chatham and Rosyth provide
the Navy with major supplies and repair facilities at home. Singapore and
Gibraltar are the main dockyards overseas.
The Supermarine Scimitar, which can carry an atomic bomb and which is
fitted, owing to its high speed, with a ‘flap-blowing’ system to facilitate
landing on carriers, and the de Havilland Sea Vixen, with armament which
includes an air-to-air guided weapon, the Firestreak, provide the main strike
and fighter strength of the Fleet Air Arm. The first operational squadron of
the new long-range strike aircraft, the Buccaneer, embarked in HMS Ark
Royal in February 1963. A second operational squadron has been com¬
missioned ashore and a third is in the offing. The United States air-to-surface
missile, Bullpup, has been adopted for use in naval fighter and strike
aircraft.
Helicopters are being increasingly employed by the Navy. Reinforcing the
Whirlwind, a more powerful all-weather helicopter, the Wessex, is in front
line service as the Navy’s main anti-submarine aircraft. It carries both
homing torpedoes and dipping sonar (sound navigation and ranging) sub¬
marine detection equipment. It is in service with carriers and the guided
missile-carrying destroyers, and a commando troop-carrying version armed
with the SS11, a French anti-tank guided missile, is serving with the
commando ships. In 19^3 Wasp helicopter entered service with the
‘Leander’ and ‘Tribal’ classes of frigates. With the latest detection equipment
and a new lightweight homing torpedo it will greatly increase the effectiveness
of the Navy’s escort forces against high-speed submarines.
Much experimental work has been carried out, with the Atomic Energy
Authority, on nuclear propelled submarines and a nuclear submarine power
unit prototype at Dounreay (see p. 220) began operations in 1963. The
hunter-killer nuclear submarines, with new detection equipment of advanced
design and an armament of homing torpedoes, will be specially effective
anti-submarine weapons. To provide the Navy with facilities for basic educa¬
tion in nuclear engineering and research, a low-power training reactor has
been installed at the Royal Naval College, Greenwich. Research is proceeding
with the aim of providing automatic means for handling tactical information
in warships.

for weapons is now concentrated in two establishments. At Portsdown (near
Portsmouth), the design and development of ship-borne gunnery and guided
missile systems is carried out. At Portland (Dorset), all aspects of work on
underwater detection are co-ordinated with work on underwater weapons.
The Corps of the Royal Marines is a body of men trained for service on sea
or land. Its official existence dates from 1664. The present-day functions of
the corps are:
(1) to provide personnel for Commandos;
(2) to provide crews for minor landing craft and certain other parties
required for amphibious assault; and
(3) to supply for H.M. ships detachments which take part in the routine
duties, including guard duty, and provide emergency landing parties.
The Women's Royal Naval Service (WRNS) is an integral part of the Navy.
Its members serve both at home and overseas. It has its own disciplinary
code. Nursing services for the Navy are provided by Queen Alexandra's
Royal Naval Nursing Service (QARNNS).
The main entry for naval officers is the Cadet Entry. Cadetships on the
General List (Seaman, Engineer, Electrical1 and Supply) are available to
young men between the ages of about 17 and iqj. A number of scholarships
are awarded to boys between the ages of 15 and 17^ to help with maintenance
and school fees for the two years before a boy goes to Dartmouth. Those
selected enter Britannia Royal Naval College, Dartmouth, where they spend
a year doing Basic Naval Training, ashore and afloat, followed by a year as
midshipmen at sea in the Fleet. The Seamen and Supply Officers then
return for a further year at Dartmouth for academic training, followed by
specialist courses and a further year at sea. The Engineer Officers study for
a degree, for which specially selected officers go to Cambridge, the others
reading for an external London degree at the Royal Naval Engineering
College, Manadon. There is an entry into the Engineering specialisation of
the General List for graduates in mechanical or electrical engineering.
Candidates must be under the age of 25. A few direct entry permanent
commissions as Instructor Officers are also available to graduates.
Special commissions on the Supplementary List for Seaman duties, for
aircrew duties with the Fleet Air Arm or in electrical specialisation are
available to young men with appropriate qualifications. Doctors, dental
surgeons and instructor officers can enter on short service commissions after
completing their professional training; cadetships leading to short service
commissions have been introduced in the Medical and Dental Branches.
Permanent commissions are awarded according to the vacancies available.
Ratings may qualify for a commission on the General List, on the Supple¬
mentary List for Seaman and aircrew duties, and on the Special Duties List.
Commissions in the Royal Marines are gained through similar procedures
as for Royal Navy Cadet Entry. Age limits for entry are about 17I-19J.
1 The Electrical and Engineering specialisations were amalgamated into the one
Engineering specialisation in the summer of 1961. The amalgamation will be pro¬
gressively implemented as officers trained or experienced in the new departmental
responsibilities become available for Fleet appointments. The organisation of all units
of the Fleet will take from two to three years, the cross-training of individual officers
will continue for about six years and the initial Engineering training of General List
officers is being adjusted; the first officers so trained reached the Fleet during 1962.
DEFENCE ^
Successful candidates are given a special training, part naval and part
military, which lasts three and a half years. Other ranks may qualify for
commissions on the Royal Marines General or Special Duties Lists.
The age limits for entry as a rating in the Navy are as follows: seaman,
communications, engineering mechanic, electrical mechanic and naval air
mechanic branches, and stores and cook ratings in the supply and secretariat
branch, 15 to 28; naval airman branch and writer and steward ratings in the
supply and secretariat branch, i6j to 28; artificer apprentices, 15^ to 172 >
mechanician apprentices, 17^ to 23; sick berth branch, 16 to 28; artificers
(trained), up to 28. The initial engagement is for a period of 9 years over the
age of 18, plus a period of up to three years in the Royal Fleet Reserve.
Exceptionally, for artificer apprentices it is 12 years over the age of 18. Age
limits for entry into the ranks of the Royal Marines are: marines, 17 to 28,
junior entry (general service duties), 16 to 17; boy buglers, 15 to 161; junior
musicians, 14 to 17I; musicians (trained), 17^ to 28. Women may enter
the Women’s Royal Naval Service between the ages of 17! and 28 for
an initial period of 4 years; most WRNS officers are selected from serving
ratings.
On entry, all naval and WRNS ratings and Royal Marines other ranks are
given a basic training at the appropriate school or shore establishment and,
in most branches, are given further training during their careers to fit them
for promotion within the branch, to qualify them for the award of a higher
specialist qualification or to prepare them for Special Duties which are not
covered by the standard promotion courses.
Reserve and The Royal Naval Reserve (RNR) consists of volunteer reserves—serving at
Auxiliary Forces sea in the Merchant Navy or the fishing fleets or in civilian employment
ashore—who carry out training in time of peace to meet the Navy’s mobilisa¬
tion requirements. Other reserves include the Royal Fleet Reserve (RFR),
composed of men who have completed their service as regulars; the Royal
Naval Special Reserve (RNSR), which includes most of the National Service
men who are discharging their liability for part-time service; the Royal
Marine Forces Volunteer Reserve (RMFVR); and the Women's Royal Naval
Reserve (WRNR).
The Royal Naval Auxiliary Service, a civilian organisation composed of
men and women volunteers, is responsible in time of war for minewatching
duties around the coast and the waterways, for providing the basic support
staff for naval organisations at commercial ports in Britain, and for manning
the naval organisation required in Britain to control the movements of
merchant ships.
Sea Cadet Corps The Sea Cadet Corps, which is administered by the Navy League in con¬
junction with the Admiralty, is a voluntary youth organisation for boys
between 12 and 18 years of age. Its origin dates from the time of the Crimean
War in the mid-nineteenth century. It aims at developing in the cadets
qualities which make for good citizenship, and through its discipline and sea
training it greatly assists those boys who wish to make their career at sea,
whether in the Royal Navy, Royal Marines or Merchant Navy.
THE ARMY The control of the Army is vested in the Army Council, of which the Secretary
of State for War is president. The other civilian members of the Council
are the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for War and Financial
Secretary of the War Office (who is a minister and vice-president of the
126 BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Council), and the Permanent Under-Secretary of State for War, a civil
servant who acts as secretary to the Council. The Service members of the
Army Council are the Chief of the Imperial General Staff, who is assisted
by the Vice-Chief of the Imperial General Staff, responsible for strategic
policy and plans, operations and intelligence, and the Deputy Chief of the
Imperial General Staff, responsible for organisation, equipment, weapons and
training; the Adjutant-General to the Forces, responsible for manpower,
personnel, discipline, medical services, welfare, education, and the women’s
services; the Quartermaster-General to the Forces, responsible for supplies,
transport and, jointly with the Permanent Under-Secretary, works services;
and the Master-General of the Ordnance, responsible for research into, and
the design, development, production and procurement of, Army stores. The
Army Board of the Defence Council, which will be established under the new
organisation, will have as an additional member the Chief Scientist (Army).
Commands Within the United Kingdom, the Army is organised into Scottish, Northern,
Southern, Eastern, Western, and Northern Ireland Commands. There are
four main commands overseas: Middle East Land Forces (Arabian Peninsula),
East Africa Command, Far East Land Forces, and the British Army of the
Rhine (which forms part of Britain’s contribution to the NATO forces).
As the strengths of overseas garrisons are reduced, increased importance
is being attached to a central strategic reserve, based mainly in the United
Kingdom.
Organisation of The active Army is organised in 30 arms and services,^ which include the
the Active Army Household Cavalry, the Royal Armoured Corps (the historic Cavalry Regi¬
ments and the Royal Tank Regiment), the Royal Regiment of Artillery,
the Corps of Royal Engineers, the Royal Corps of Signals (which provides
land and wireless communications), the five regiments of Foot Guards (the
Brigade of Guards), the regiments of the Infantry of the Line (grouped into
brigades and the Parachute Regiment), the Army Air Corps (which operates
light aircraft on reconnaissance and undertakes aerial observation and liaison
work), the Royal Army Service Corps (responsible for the provision of food
and fuel supplies and transport vehicles), the Royal Army Medical Corps,
the Royal Army Ordnance Corps (responsible for most equipment and
stores), and the Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers.
Women’s Army The Women’s Royal Army Corps (WRAC) and the Queen Alexandra’s
Services Royal Army Nursing Corps (QARANC) are both corps of the Regular Army,
their officers and other ranks being subject to military law and the Queen’s
Regulations in the same way as members of the other corps.
Equipment The Army is being completely rearmed with a new range of weapons, vehicles
and other equipment.
Air portability is a major feature of the Army’s new equipment (except
for very heavy equipment, such as certain tanks) to secure strategic mobility.
Equipment transportable by air, in service or being planned, includes the
Wombat and the Carl Gustav anti-tank weapons, improved mortars and light
vehicles, the Ferret scout car and the Saladin armoured car in service with
the Royal Armoured Corps, the Malkara guided missile anti-tank system,
the Thunderbird surface-to-air anti-aircraft guided weapon for the Royal

Air-portable howitzers have also come into service.
For tactical mobility within a theatre of operations, new engineer equipment
for rapid construction and repair and new bridging equipment are on order.
To assist in achieving mobility on the battlefield itself, the Centurion tank
has been equipped with more powerful armament, pending the entry into
service of its successor, the Chieftain, approved for production; the Vigilant
anti-tank guided weapon system, which is small enough to be carried by its
crew, is on order; certain infra-red devices to facilitate movement and viewing
by night without the aid of visible light, are being introduced; radio com¬
munications in the field are being greatly improved with new equipment
which includes the manpack portable set, a radio relay set, and a new set
for armoured vehicles; new radar equipment to detect enemy mortars is in
service; the Abbot self-propelled tracked close support gun of increased range
and performance is on order; and an improved type of armoured personnel
carrier is coming into service. The Canadian Beaver, a light liaison aircraft,
and the Scout helicopter are also in service. The Regular Army has been
re-equipped with the British version of the FN self-loading rifle, a weapon
of Belgian origin adopted by the United Kingdom in the interests of standard¬
isation with other NATO forces; the FN general purpose machine gun is
replacing the Vickers and the Bren.
Surface-to-surface guided weapons are in service with the British Army
of the Rhine (BAOR). Artillery regiments have been equipped with the
Corporal. A number of composite regiments armed with the United States
Honest John missile and the eight-inch howitzer are serving in BAOR. Some
of the Army’s heavy anti-aircraft regiments have been equipped with the
Thunderbird surface-to-air missile. The Australian Malkara air-portable
anti-tank guided weapon is in service and training has started on the Vigilant
anti-tank weapon.
The normal method of entry for a regular commission in the Army is through
the Royal Military Academy, Sandhurst (Camberley), where selected cadets
undergo a course lasting two years before receiving their commissions. This
course gives a general military and academic background for all arms and
services. On leaving Sandhurst young officers attend special courses to
prepare them for their own arm, some attending technical courses at the
Royal Military College of Science, Shrivenham (Berkshire), and at Cambridge
University, while a limited number attend Arts courses at Oxford. Up to
40 scholarships for Sandhurst are awarded each year on the results of a
competitive examination held twice a year. University graduates may be
accepted for direct regular commissions without previous service in the ranks.
The War Office also maintains a boarding school, Welbeck College, at
Worksop, Nottinghamshire, where 150 boys are educated for two years
between the ages of 16 and 18 years. These boys pass into the Royal Corps
of Signals, Royal Army Ordnance Corps or the Royal Electrical and
Mechanical Engineers. A few may be commissioned into the Royal Artillery,
Royal Engineers and Royal Army Service Corps.
Long-service regular commissions may also be granted to officers already
on short service commissions. Candidates for short service commissions are
trained at the Officer Cadet School, Mons Barracks, Aldershot. At this school
the course, which consists of purely military training, lasts for four months.
Entry to the school for short service commissions is either directly from
civilian life or through the ranks.

The Reserve
Army
Men wishing to enlist in the ranks must be British subjects between the
ages of 17! and 30, of good character, medically fit and able to pass an
intelligence test. Those with certain trade qualifications may be accepted up
to the age of 33. Men can sign on for 22 years (with the option of finishing
their Colour Service at the end of six years or at the end of any consecutive
period of three years thereafter, provided they give six months’ notice in
writing). Recruits may choose the corps in which they wish to serve and their
wishes regarding trade training are met as far as possible.
On entry into the Army, other ranks are trained at the depots or with the
training units of the arms or services for which they have been selected. This
initial training consists of six weeks’ basic military training common to all
arms and services, and a further period of training which is special to the
arm or service concerned. This latter training varies in length of time,
for example, infantry, four weeks; Royal Signals electronic technician,
22 weeks.
A boy can enlist in the Army as an apprentice tradesman, between the
ages of 15 and 17; a junior leader, between the ages of 15 and 16^; and a
drummer band boy, piper or tailor, between the ages of 15 and 17I.
After the age of 18 years, Army apprentice tradesmen serve nine years
with the Colours and three years in the Reserve. Boys enlisted for training
with junior leaders’ units may serve either for nine years with the Colours
and three years in the Reserve, or six years with the Colours and six years in
the Reserve. The object of the junior leaders’ units is to produce long-term
regular warrant officers and senior non-commissioned officers, and that of
the apprentice schools is to produce warrant officer and non-commissioned
officer tradesmen for the Regular Army, some of whom may become specialist
commissioned officers.
Women may enlist into the Queen Alexandra’s Royal Army Nursing
Corps or into the Women’s Royal Army Corps between the ages of 17I
and 33.
With a smaller Regular Army, the Reserve Army, consisting of the Regular
Reserve, the Army Emergency Reserve and the Territorial Army, including
the Territorial Army Emergency Reserve, have an increasingly important part
to play.
The Regular Reserve consists of officers and other ranks who have served
in the Regular Army and are liable to be called out to reinforce the Regular
Army in an emergency.
The Army Emergency Reserve has as its main function to provide essential
communications and the technical and administrative services required on
mobilisation by the Regular Army. It consists of specialist units and pools
of skilled men—both volunteers and part-time National Service men—who
can be called upon at short notice to fill gaps in regular units. A special
category of the Army Emergency Reserve consists of units and individuals
willing to be called for service with the Regular Army on the authority of
the Secretary of State for War before a proclamation of mobilisation has
been issued.
The Territorial Army consists of volunteer officers and other ranks (in¬
cluding women) and the Territorial Army Reserve of Officers; plus officers
and men carrying out the statutory obligation of three and a half years part-
time service following full-time National Service (see p. 118). Its main role in
the event of war would be the defence of the United Kingdom but some units
might be needed overseas and all its members are liable for service in any part of

the world when the Army reserve is called out by proclamation, \olunteers
are required to attend annual camp and to carry out a minimum number of
training periods. Selected units undergo civil defence training each year and
attend a civil defence camp once every four years. While the military authorities
are responsible for policy, training and discipline, local administration of the
Territorial Army is carried out largely by county territorial and auxiliary
forces associations.
The Territorial Army Emergency Reserve (the ‘Ever-Readies’) provided for
in the Army Reserve Act, 1962, is designed to provide a trained reserve
ready to supplement the Regular Army at short notice and to increase the
deterrent power of the conventional Army in time of serious tension short
of actual hostilities. Volunteers, who are paid a bounty and would receive
Regular rates of pay on call-up, sign on for a period of one year, which is
renewable, and are liable to be called up for a period not exceeding six months
during any individual contract.
The Combined Cadet Force (CCF) and the Army Cadet Force (ACF) provide
training on Service lines for boys between the ages of 14 and 18. The CCF
provides training in schools in which education is continued to the age of
17 years or above. Cadets receive a general basic training and then specialised
training in the Royal Navy, Army or Royal Air Force sections. Contingents
are affiliated to regular units and establishments of the Services. The ACF
is recruited from schools which do not raise contingents of the CCF, and
from boys who have left school. Like all the pre-Service organisations, these
forces provide citizenship and character training as well as specifically military
training. There is a training centre for the CCF and ACF at Frimley Park,
Surrey.
The Royal Air Force is administered by the Air Council, composed of the
Secretary of State for Air, who is president, and seven other members. The
Parliamentary Under-Secretary for Air is vice-president and the Permanent
Under-Secretary of State for Air, who is a civil servant, is secretary of the
Council. The Service members are the Chief of the Air Staff, who is res¬
ponsible for strategic policy and the fighting efficiency of the RAF; the
Vice-Chief of the Air Staff, responsible for inter-Service policy, operations,
intelligence, liaison with other air forces, standardisation and ground defence;
the Deputy Chief of the Air Staff, responsible for the preparedness for war
of the RAF, for command, staff and air training, and for policy regarding
future aircraft and weapons; the Air Member for Personnel; and the Air
VIember for Supply and Organisation. The Chief Scientist (Royal Air Force)
will be an additional member of the Air Force Board of the Defence Council
under the new organisation.
The Royal Air Force is organised into commands administered by the Air
Council:
At Home: Bomber, Fighter, Coastal, Transport, Flying Training,
Technical Training, Maintenance and Signals Commands.
Overseas: The Near East Air Force (headquarters in Cyprus), Air Forces,
Middle East (headquarters in Aden), the Far East Air Force
(headquarters at Changi, Singapore) and Royal Air Force,
Germany (Second Tactical Air Force, stationed in Germany
as part of Britain’s contribution to the NATO forces).

BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
The spearhead of the RAF is the force of Vulcan and Victor four-engined
jet bombers. The Mark 2 versions of the Vulcan and Victor bombers can
carry the Blue Steel propelled stand-off bomb which has a warhead in the
megaton range (brought into service in 1962) and are capable of being refuelled
in flight, giving them an increased range. Valiants have been converted as
flying tankers. The V-bombers will thus contribute an effective deterrent
force under independent British control for some years to come. The TSR.2,
now being developed, although its main role is tactical strike reconnaissance,
will also be capable of a strategic nuclear role and has an exceptional all¬
round performance. The present reconnaissance force is composed of Victors,
Valiants and Canberras.
A tactical force in Bomber Command, equipped with Valiants, is assigned
to the Supreme Allied Commander Europe. The Canberra light bomber and
reconnaissance aircraft continues to give good service in Germany and the
Near East; it can carry the French AS JO guided bomb. For shorter range
tactical strike reconnaissance operations for close support, supersonic vertical
take-off and landing aircraft are under study.
The deployment of Bloodhound 2 squadrons is expected to begin in 1964.
Bloodhound 2 is an advanced air defence missile and will be transportable
by air for overseas reinforcement. Manned fighters will, however, continue
to be needed to deal with manned aircraft, the stand-off bomber and radar¬
jamming aircraft, to prevent reconnaissance and to investigate unidentified
movements. Fighter Command is equipped with Lightning and Javelin
aircraft. Both carry the air-to-air guided missile Firestreak. The Lightning,
the RAF’s first supersonic fighter, in service since i960, is fitted with an
electronic computer to aid bomber interception and is equipped for flight¬
refuelling to augment Fighter Command’s capacity for overseas reinforcement.
the Lightning 2 is now being introduced, and development of Lightning J,
which will carry the Red Top air-to-air missile, is making successful progress.
The replacement aircraft for the Hunter fighters is to be based on the Hawker
P.iij/f supersonic vertical take-off and landing aircraft.
The system of control and reporting, which has been built into a highly
efficient organisation, is closely linked with the radar systems of Continental
allies. A reconstructed radar chain now covers the whole of the United
Kingdom. Work has begun on a new high-performance radar system, which
will include computers and data-handling equipment for the interception of
supersonic aircraft. The Royal Air Force commands and operates the joint
UK-US ballistic missile early warning stations at Fylingdales, in Yorkshire
(see p. 116). .
Coastal Command’s long-range maritime reconnaissance force, which is
committed to NATO, is wholly equipped with Shackleton aircraft. An
improved version—the Shackleton Mark 3—is in service, and earlier marks
have been modernised to an equivalent standard.
Transport Command is being re-equipped to provide increased mobility
for the strategic reserves of both land and air forces. A Comet 2 squadron
formed in 1956—the first all-jet transport squadron in any air force has
proved very successful, and the first Comet 4CS came into service in 1962.
Two squadrons of Britannia aircraft are in service for long-range transport
and eleven VC10 troop carriers are on order. The Beverley and Hastings
freighters are to be replaced by the Armstrong Whitworth 681 short take-off
and landing tactical transport, which will be capable of conversion to vertical
take-off and landing. The Belfast (formerly known as Britannic) aircraft is
on order to supply the need for a strategic freighter able to carry large military

loads quickly over long distances. The Armstrong Whitworth Argosy is in
service as a tactical freighter also used for trooping and the dropping of
parachutists. Twin Pioneer short-range aircraft are in service and the Avro J4-&
has been ordered as a close support aircraft.
Increasing use is being made of helicopters for operations in support of
the Army in the field and for the Search and Rescue Organisation of Coastal
Command, which in peace time also operates for the rescue of civilians
involved in shipping accidents or other difficulties in coastal waters. The
twin-rotor Belvedere and the gas-turbine engined Whirlwind are both in
service. The Wessex, which has a greatly improved load capacity, particularly
in tropical conditions and at high altitudes, is on order.
Basic flying training schools have been equipped with the Jet Provost
and Gnat trainers. The DH125 is on order to replace the Varsity for advanced
navigational training. A training version of the Lightning is in service. The
RAF was the first air force to adopt all-jet training.
Pilots, navigators and air electronics officers are appointed to commissions
in the General Duties Branch, the flying and executive branches of the RAF.
They enter either on the General List, with an assurance of a pensionable
career to the age of 55, or on Direct Entry Commissions. Appointment to
commissions on the General List may be obtained through a cadetship at the
RAF College, Cranwell, Lincolnshire (pilots and navigators only), by entry
as a university graduate or a university cadet (university entrants undertaking
a full career commission go to university as commissioned officers), or under
a special arrangement for other well-qualified entrants. The majority, how¬
ever, are appointed to Direct Entry Commissions of varying lengths, with
opportunities of permanent commissions which offer a pensionable career
initially to about the age of 38, with the possibility of leaving with a gratuity
at an earlier stage and with opportunities of serving to the age of 55. Except
for those entering through Cranwell, where the course lasts three years, flying
training takes about 18 months for pilots and one year for navigators and
air electronics officers.
Officers in ground branches are usually found from people in civil life,
some of whom already hold professional qualifications, who enter the Royal
Air Force on short service or permanent commissions. Short service officers
may be selected for permanent commissions while in the Royal Air Force.
Permanent commissions may also be obtained through cadetships at the
Royal Air Force Technical College, Henlow, Bedfordshire (Technical Branch),
or the RAF College, Cranwell (Secretarial and Equipment Branches and
RAF Regiment), or through university cadetships for the Technical Branch.
University graduates are also eligible for permanent commissions under
special conditions.
Applicants for enlistment for service as airmen or airwomen must be
British subjects of good character and medically fit. Men between the ages
of 17J and 39 may be enlisted as trained tradesmen if they can pass the
appropriate trade test, or otherwise for training in any RAF trade for which
they may be suitable, subject to vacancies. Enlistment is for one of specified
periods. Subject to requirements, airmen may re-engage to serve for 22 years’
reckonable service for pension and towards the end of that period may apply
to continue to serve to the age of 55. A recruit training course of 8 weeks is
followed by trade training where necessary and posting for duty.
Boys may enlist between the ages of 15 and 17 as apprenticed advanced
tradesmen or between the ages of 15! and i6| as boy entrants for training in

skilled trades. Apprentices and boy entrants enlist for 12 years or 9 years
plus 3 years’ reserve service from the age of 18.
Women play an important part in the work of the Royal Air Force and of its
reserve and auxiliary formations. The Women’s Royal Air Force (WRAF) is
an integral part of the Royal Air Force and its members train with and work
alongside airmen in the same trades, serving both in the United Kingdom
and overseas. Nursing services are provided by Princess Mary's Royal Air
Force Nursing Service.
Women between the ages of 17 and 39 may enlist for normal service as
airwomen for periods of 3, 4, 5 or 6 years. Subject to requirements, women,
like airmen, may re-engage to serve for 22 years’ service reckonable for pension
and towards the end of that period may apply to continue in the Service
until the age of 55. Women between the ages of 17 and 52 may enlist for
local service as airwomen for 2 years, which period may be extended by one
or two years at a time. Women of at least 18 years of age and of the requisite
educational standard may be selected for short service commissions in a
variety of branches. Opportunities exist for both short service officers and
airwomen to gain permanent commissions.
The Royal Auxiliary Air Force consists of three maritime headquarters units
and a maritime support unit. The units are raised and maintained by local
Territorial and Auxiliary Forces Associations and functionally controlled by
Coastal Command. In addition the Royal Auxiliary Air Force General List
comprises officers specially selected for service in war appointments.
The Royal Air Force Reserve consists mainly of officers and airmen who
have served in the Air Force. It includes the Royal Air Force Volunteer
Reserve, whose members, like the officers, airmen and airwomen of the Royal
Auxiliary Air Force, have a liability to carry out training on a part-time
basis. University air squadrons (established at 17 universities) form part of
the Royal Air Force Volunteer Reserve.
Ex-regular airmen with a liability for reserve service carry out this liability
in Class E of the Royal Air Force Reserve.
The Royal Observer Corps, a predominantly civilian and voluntary organisa¬
tion, administered by Fighter Command, originated during the first world
war and was officially established in 1925. Its present strength is over 15,000
men and women whose principal task would be the measuring and reporting
of radioactivity in the event of nuclear attack. Some 1,500 underground
operation centres have been built for the corps.
The Air Training Corps provides pre-Service training for boys between the
ages of 14 and 20. Like the other pre-Service formations, it seeks to inculcate
good citizenship as well as training for the RAF. There is also an Air Section
of the Combined Cadet Force (see p. 129).
HOME DEFENCE
The second world war showed the importance of having trained and organised
bodies of men and women ready to mitigate the effects of enemy air attacks
on the civil population; and the Civil Defence Act, 1948, recognised that a
permanent system of civil defence was essential to national safety. The
development of nuclear weapons, while creating many new problems for
DEFENCE
133
civil defence and calling for much replanning, has increased rather than
lessened the need for an efficient civil defence organisation. Civil Defence
remains an integral part of the country’s defence plan.
In the event of nuclear attack, the problems of rescue, fire-fighting and
welfare operations would be greatly intensified by the presence of radio¬
activity, which would have to be detected and measured. The first call would
be met by the civilian services on the spot, supported by the armed forces
in the country at the time, whether regular or reserve, which were not
immediately required for combat operations. The Minister of Defence is
charged with planning the part which the armed forces would play in home
defence, and with co-ordinating the plans of the military authorities and civil
authorities.
The country’s economic capacity limits the effort which can be devoted
to home defence preparations; and the main defence objective must be to
maintain the nuclear deterrent—not to prepare for war but to prevent it.
In home defence the main task in peace time is to keep a local organisation
in being as a framework for expansion if necessary, to provide training
equipment and to proceed with essential research. The Government has
declared its conviction that, if the deterrent were to fail, countless lives could
be saved by civil defence preparations made in advance. An example of this
is the scheme which is being worked out with the local authorities for dis¬
persing mothers and children and others in priority classes from major
centres of population, should circumstances warrant it.
Organisation of Civil defence planning in Britain is the responsibility of a number of ministers
Civil Defence each of whom undertakes the duties which, in war time, would represent a
natural extension of his peace-time functions. As the development of effective
civil defence services involves much detailed planning at local level, the
central Government has enlisted the assistance of local government authorities,
of industry and commerce and of public bodies of many kinds, including
voluntary organisations such as the Voluntary Aid Societies and the Women s
Voluntary Service.
In addition to his direct responsibilities under the Civil Defence Act, 1948,
the Home Secretary is responsible for co-ordinating the defence plans of all
the civil agencies of the Government. The Secretary of State for Scotland
is responsible for civil defence matters in Scotland.
In England and Wales the Home Secretary supervises the civil defence
activities of the police and fire services, the Civil Defence Corps and the
Industrial Civil Defence Service as well as such matters as shelter policy and
the national air attack and fall-out warning and monitoring organisation.
Other Government departments have direct responsibility for the civil defence
applications of the services which they control; for example, the Ministry
of Health is responsible for the hospital and first-aid services, and the Post
Office for telecommunications.
In Scotland the Scottish Home and Health Department deals with questions
corresponding to those dealt with by the Home Office in England and Wales,
and is responsible for such matters as the hospital and first-aid services.
In Northern Ireland the Civil Defence Act (Northern Ireland), 1950,
places responsibility for civil defence matters on the Ministry of Home Affairs,
which may arrange for other departments to undertake some functions on
its behalf.
England is divided into ten civil defence regions in charge of Regional
Directors of Civil Defence, appointed by the Home Office, and there is also
i34
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
The Civil
Defence
Services
a Director of Civil Defence for Wales. Their duties include liaison with the
armed forces and the planning of combined exercises. In Scotland, planning
is carried out centrally, but the country is divided into three zones for
operational purposes.
To provide the personnel required in war for civil defence tasks, the following
services, in which only part-time service is required in times of peace, are
raised in Great Britain by voluntary recruitment of civilians:
1. The Civil Defence Corps, which helps local and other authorities to
carry out their civil defence functions.
2. The Industrial Civil Defence Service, which comprises civil defence
units formed by managements in the larger industrial and commercial
premises for the protection of their personnel and to assist the public
civil defence services.
3. The Auxiliary Fire Service, which reinforces the fire services main¬
tained by local authorities under the Fire Services Act, 1947. Auxiliary
firemen are enrolled by the fire authorities (see p. 81) as members of
the individual brigades, but the Fire Service would become a national
organisation in time of war.
4. The National Hospital Service Reserve, limited at present to trained
nurses and people willing to be trained as nursing auxiliaries, reinforces
the National Hospital Service in England and Wales. In Scotland there
is also an Ambulance Section of the Reserve to provide the additional
manpower for the war-time operation of the Scottish Ambulance
Service.
In Northern Ireland there are three main services: the Civil Defence
Corps, the Auxiliary Fire and Rescue Service, and the Hospital Service
Reserve.
Subject to restrictions regarding age and obligation to serve in the armed
forces, recruits for all services are drawn from men and women volunteers
who will undertake to train regularly.
Strengths in Great Britain on 31st March, 1963, were:
Civil Defence Corps .. .. .. .. .. 304,974
Industrial Civil Defence Service (on 31st October, 1962) 180,556
Auxiliary Fire Service .. .. .. .. .. I5>23^
National Hospital Service Reserve .. .. .. 74>34^
The Civil Defence Corps is recruited and organised by certain local
authorities (mainly the councils of counties and county boroughs in England
and Wales, or counties and large burghs in Scotland) in local divisions. The
local divisions are subdivided into five sections as follows:
Headquarters:
Wardens:
Rescue:
Ambulance
and First Aid:
control of civil defence operations, communications,
reconnaissance (including scientific matters).
public guidance and control, reporting of damage and
radioactive fall-out, organisation of immediate self-help
measures, and the local control of life-saving operations.

Units and to hospital, and the organisation of stretcher-

In Scotland there is no separate Ambulance and First Aid section, ambu¬
lance services being provided by the National Hospital Service Reserve, and
casualty collecting being a warden duty.
In Northern Ireland the Civil Defence Corps, which is organised directly
by the Ministry of Home Affairs and not by the local authorities, consists
of three sections—Headquarters, Wardens and Welfare; the Ambulance
Service forms part of the Hospital Service, and the Rescue Section has been
integrated with the Auxiliary Fire Service to form the Auxiliary Fire and
Rescue Service.
Members of the Civil Defence Corps must undertake a standard training on
entry. Those already in the Corps in 1962, when this requirement was
introduced, have two years in which to complete their training. Members
who pass the standard training test may take advanced training (Class A)
and if they undertake to perform a total of 45 hours’ approved duty, including
advanced training, may qualify for a bounty of ^10 to j£i5) according to
rank. Those unable to accept this responsibility may perform less onerous
training (Class B) or pass to the Civil Defence Corps Reserve.
Units of the Industrial Civil Defence Service are organised in sections
corresponding to those of the Civil Defence Corps (with the addition of a Fire
Guard Section) and are trained to similar standards as members of the corps.
Civil defence instructors are trained either at one of the three Home Office
Civil Defence Schools or locally under arrangements made by local authorities,
in accordance with directions given by the Home Office or the Scottish
Home and Health Department. Courses and studies for senior officials are
held at the Civil Defence Staff College at Sunningdale, Berkshire, and in
Scotland, at the Civil Defence School at Taymouth Castle, Perthshire.
Auxiliary firemen are trained by officers and men of the regular brigades.
In addition, both regular and auxiliary firemen receive special training in
emergency fire-fighting at the Home Office Fire Service Training Centre at
Moreton-in-Marsh, Gloucestershire. Auxiliary firemen are encouraged to
gain practical experience of fire-fighting by performing stand-by duty at fire
stations to enable them to respond, with regular members of the brigade, to
calls to fires. Exercises are also held, involving the control and operation of
large numbers of pumping and other fire-fighting appliances. New regulations
similar to those for the Civil Defence Corps were introduced in the Auxiliary
Fire Service in July 1962, under which auxiliaries are expected to do 50 hours’
standard training before they go on to advanced training to qualify for a
bounty of £10 to £15. Those who do not wish to qualify may pass into the
Auxiliary Fire Service Reserve, in which only occasional refresher training
and exercises are required.
In time of war the police would continue to be responsible for the prevention
of crime, for the maintenance of law and order and for the control of essential
service routes. They are also likely to have duties in connection with evacua¬
tion, care of the homeless and other specialised civil defence tasks. In all
these duties they would have the aid of the Special Constabulary.
There are two main ways in which the fighting Services within the country
can render assistance: by helping the civil authorities to maintain control; and
136
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
by the direct employment of units on various tasks such as aid to the police
in the maintenance of law and order and traffic control, aid to the fire service,
assistance in the reception and care of the homeless, in the treatment and
evacuation of casualties and in the clearance of radioactive fall-out zones,
the provision of guards, the maintenance of road, rail and water communica¬
tions, light rescue, reconnaissance and the provision and running of camps.
All units of the Regular and Reserve Armies are trained in peace time for
the civil defence tasks they may be expected to perform in war. In addition,
a number of men of the Royal Air Force have been trained in emergency
fire-fighting operations at Home Office training centres to enable them to
serve as firemen in a National Fire Service.
There is close liaison in peace time between the civil and military authorities
at all levels. Joint exercises are continually being held and everything possible
is being done to align the civil and military chains of command.

SOCIAL WELFARE
STATE AND VOLUNTARY SERVICES
In Britain the State is now responsible, through either central or local govern¬
ment, for a range of services covering family allowances, social insurance,
help for war victims, subsistence for the needy, health services, welfare of
mothers and children, services for the old and the handicapped, and the
care of children lacking a normal home life (all described in this chapter);
and for education (see Chapter 6), housing (see Chapter 7) and employment
services (see Chapter 16). Public authorities in the United Kingdom are
spending over £4,000 million a year on this range of services; that is, about
£80 a year per head of the population.
Voluntary organisations, especially the Churches, were the pioneers of
nearly all the social services. They provided schools, hospitals, clinics,
dispensaries, and social and recreational clubs before these were provided by
the State. They made themselves responsible for the welfare of the very
young and the very old, the homeless and the handicapped, before it was
generally accepted that the whole community had a responsibility towards
these people. Where the services and the facilities they provided were
adequate, they have been encouraged to continue. The State now supplements
these voluntary services and provides financial assistance, sees that essential
services are brought within the reach of every citizen, and ensures that the
necessary standards are maintained.
Many voluntary social services surround and supplement the State services.
The two types are complementary, not competitive, and they merge into
each other. State services often work through voluntary agencies specially
adapted to serve individual or special needs. The officers of central and local
government, in carrying out their duties, co-operate with the workers of
many voluntary social service societies, while the institutional provision made
by the State and by local authorities for the care of the chronic sick and the
aged is supplemented by voluntary homes of various types for the care of
the sick and elderly, most of whom receive State pensions or benefits.
The Charity Commission, a Government department, gives free advice to
trustees of charities, making schemes to modify their trusts and purposes
when necessary; it maintains a Central Register of Charities in which informa¬
tion about all the charities in England and Wales is being gathered together;
and it works to promote co-operation between charities and State services.
Voluntary The number of voluntary charitable societies and institutions in Britain
Organisations runs into thousands; they range from national organisations to small individual
local groups. Most organisations, however, are members of larger associations
or are represented on local or national co-ordinating councils or committees.
Some are chiefly concerned with giving personal service, others are mainly
interested in the formation of public opinion and exchange of information.
Organisations concerned with personal and family problems and mis¬
fortunes include the voluntary family casework agencies, of which the Family
Welfare Association, working mainly in London, is the best known; marriage
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
guidance centres affiliated to the National Marriage Guidance Council; and
the Family Service Units.
Voluntary service to the sick and disabled in general is given by the British
Red Cross, the St. John Ambulance Brigade and the St. Andrew’s Ambulance
Association, but a number of societies exist to help sufferers from particular
disabilities, such as the Royal National Institute for the Blind, the Royal
National Institute for the Deaf, the National Association for Mental Health,
and the constituent members of the Central Council for the Disabled.
Bodies working on a national scale whose work is specifically religious in
inspiration include the Salvation Army, the Church Army, Toe H, the
Committee on Social Service of the Church of Scotland, the Church of
England Children’s Society, the Church of England Council for Social Work,
the Young Men’s Christian Association, the Young Women’s Christian
Association, the Society of Friends, the Crusade of Rescue, the Society of
St. Vincent de Paul, the Catholic Marriage Advisory Council and the Jewish
Board of Guardians.
A wide range of voluntary personal service is given by the Women’s
Voluntary Service, which ‘lends a hand’ in every kind of practical difficulty,
brings ‘meals on wheels’ to housebound invalids and old people, minds
children, and visits the sick in hospital, as well as doing relief work in
emergencies.
A central link between different voluntary organisations and official bodies
concerned with social welfare is provided by the National Council of Social
Service, which brings together most of the principal voluntary agencies for
consultation and joint action, either as a whole or in groups of organisations
concerned with particular aspects, such as youth work and old people’s
welfare, in England and Wales; by the Scottish Council of Social Service
and the Northern Ireland Council of Social Service. It was the National
Council of Social Service which set up the Citizens’ Advice Bureaux, of
which there are now about 430 in Great Britain. The primary role of the
bureaux is to give explanation and advice to the citizen who is in doubt
about his rights or who does not know about the State or voluntary service
which could help him.
Social Workers While the voluntary worker giving full-time or part-time service has done
pioneer work in many of Britain’s social services and continues to play an
essential part, social services of all kinds increasingly depend for their operation
chiefly on the professional social worker, that is, the full-time salaried worker
trained in the principles and technique of social work. Training for many
forms of social work consists of a basic university degree, diploma or certificate
course in social science followed by a university course in applied social
studies or specialised training for a particular service. The latter is sometimes
organised by the profession concerned. Under the Health Visiting and Social
Work (Training) Act, 1962, a Council for Training in Social Work has been
set up to promote the training, in the first instance, of workers in the local
authority health and welfare services and similar services run by voluntary
organisations. Full-time general courses lasting two years, now being provided
by ten colleges of further education, will lead to the Certificate in Social
Work of this council. It is expected that more courses will be arranged in
future years.
Voluntary organisations were the pioneers in the employment and training
of social workers, but Government departments and local authorities now
employ a considerable number of trained social workers, for example, in
Reciprocity

child care, youth work, almoning (medical-social work), psychiatric social
work, and the probation service.
SOCIAL SECURITY
National Insurance, Industrial Injuries Insurance, Family Allowances and
National Assistance together with, in a special category, War Pensions,
constitute a comprehensive system of social security in the United Kingdom
which ensures that in no circumstances need any one fall below a certain
minimum standard of living.
The Ministry of Pensions and National Insurance administers the first
three of these services in Great Britain; in Northern Ireland they are adminis¬
tered by the Ministry of Labour and National Insurance. National Assistance
is administered by the National Assistance Board in Great Britain, and in
Northern Ireland by the National Assistance Board for Northern Ireland.
Pensions and welfare services for war pensioners and their dependants are
the responsibility of the Ministry of Pensions and National Insurance through¬
out the United Kingdom.
Appeals relating to claims for insurance benefits, family allowances or war
pensions, or to applications for assistance, are not decided by the Ministry
or the Board but by independent authorities appointed under the Acts.
Although the development of public provision for social security in Britain
can be traced back for several centuries (the Poor Relief Act of 1601 may be
regarded as specially important in England and Wales), the modern system
of comprehensive provision is a creation of the twentieth century. Non¬
contributory old age pensions were introduced in 1908, and the first con¬
tributory pensions for old people, widows and orphans in 1926. A contributory
National Health Insurance Scheme was begun in 1912, and in the same year
a scheme of unemployment insurance was introduced which in 1920 was
extended to cover the great majority of employed persons. By the beginning
of the second world war the social security services in Britain were among the
best in the world, but they lacked co-ordination by the very fact of their piece¬
meal development, and not everyone came within their scope. In the immedi¬
ate post-war years a series of Acts introduced the present comprehensive
system which became fully operative on 5th July, 1948. Adjustments have
been made by a number of subsequent Acts. Statutory provision for the war
disabled goes back to the end of the sixteenth century, but the main lines of
the present war pension provisions were laid down during the first world war.
Family allowances and national insurance benefits or allowances, other than
maternity, unemployment or sickness benefit, are included in the taxable
income on which income tax is assessed. On the other hand, various income
tax reliefs and exemptions are allowed on account of age or liability for the
support of dependants. War disablement pensions are not taxable.
The national insurance, industrial injuries and family allowances schemes of
Great Britain and those of Northern Ireland and the Isle of Man operate
as a single system. Northern Ireland and the Isle of Man as well as Great
Britain are party to most of the agreements with other countries. Reciprocal
agreements on national insurance, industrial injuries and family allowances
are in operation with Belgium, Denmark, Finland, Jersey, Norway, the
Federal Republic of Germany and Yugoslavia. Agreements with France,
Israel, Italy, Luxembourg, Malta, the Netherlands, Sweden, Switzerland
and Turkey cover national insurance and industrial injuries insurance. With
140
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
FAMILY
ALLOWANCES
NATIONAL
INSURANCE
The Insured
Population
Australia, Canada and New Zealand there are agreements on national
insurance and family allowances. There is an agreement with Guernsey on
family allowances only, with Cyprus on national insurance, and an agreement
with the Irish Republic which covers national insurance and contains some
industrial injuries provisions relating to seafarers. Other agreements are
under negotiation.
Family allowances have been provided by the State since August 1946, under
the Family Allowances Act, 1945, in Great Britain and by the Family
Allowances Act (Northern Ireland), 1945, in Northern Ireland. Nearly
6 million allowances are being paid in Great Britain to about 3! million
families with two or more children and over a quarter of a million in Northern
Ireland to over 116,000 families. An allowance is paid for each child other
than the first or only child below the age limits. The age limits are 15 years
for children who leave school at that age, 16 years for certain incapacitated
children, and 18 for children who remain at school or are apprentices. The
rate of the allowance is 8s. a week for the second child below the age limits
and 10s. a week for the third and each subsequent child.
Family allowances are paid from the Exchequer and their object is to
benefit the family as a whole; they belong to the mother, but may be paid
either to the mother or to the father. There is no insurance qualification for
title to the allowances, but there are certain residence conditions.
The corresponding scheme in Northern Ireland makes similar provision
for family allowances.
The National Insurance Act, 1946, came into full operation on the 5th July,
1948. It has been amended by a number of subsequent Acts, the latest being
the National Insurance Act, 1963. The Acts apply, in general, to everyone
over school-leaving age living in Great Britain. There are similar schemes
in Northern Ireland and the Isle of Man.
The National Insurance scheme provides benefits in specified contingencies
to insured persons who have paid the required contributions. The benefits
are paid for partly by insured persons’ contributions, partly by the contribu¬
tions of employers in respect of their employees, and partly by a contribution
made by the Exchequer out of general taxation. Up to April 1961 the rates
of contributions and benefits were standard amounts varying only with the
sex and insurance class of the insured person (with lower rates for those
under 18). In April 1961 the scheme was modified by the introduction of
the graduated scheme. This applies to all adult employed persons earning
a minimum of £9 a week and not ‘contracted out’ of the graduated scheme
and provides for them to earn additions to flat-rate retirement pension (but
not to any other benefit) in return for graduated contributions, related to
earnings, paid normally in addition to the flat-rate contribution. Employees
whose job provides them with a secure occupational pension at least as good
as the maximum State graduated pension can be ‘contracted out’ of the
scheme. About 4! million have been contracted out.
The National Insurance scheme applies, in general, to everyone over school¬
leaving age and under pensionable age. Contributors are divided into three
classes:
Class 1. Employed persons. Those who work for an employer under a
contract of service or are paid apprentices—nearly 23 million. This class
falls into two groups: those who are, and those who are not, participating
in the graduated part of the scheme.
Contributions
SOCIAL WELFARE I4I
Class 2. Self-employed persons. Those in business on their own account
and others who are working for gain but do not work under the control
of an employer—nearly million.
Class 3. Non-employed persons. All persons insured who are not in
class 1 or 2—just over a quarter of a million.
This general classification is subject to certain modifications, made by
regulations, to meet special circumstances. Married women engaged only in
their own household duties are, in general, provided for by their husbands’
insurance and need not pay contributions. They can choose to pay contri¬
butions provided they were insured persons when they married. (Those who
were already married when the scheme began to operate on 5th July, 1948,
cannot be insured in their own right unless they were then insured under
the old scheme and continued to pay contributions as non-employed persons,
or unless they have since taken up paid work.) Employed married women
may choose whether to pay separate contributions themselves or to rely on
the cover provided by their husbands’ contributions, which make them
eligible for maternity and home confinement grants, retirement pension at
lower rate, widow’s benefit and death grant, but they must pay graduated
contributions if they are employed in a participating employment and their
earnings are over ^9 a week. Students receiving full-time education and
unpaid apprentices need not pay contributions. Up to the age of 18, contri¬
butions are credited to them. Over that age they may, if they wish, pay as
non-employed persons (class 3) and thus safeguard their title to widow’s
benefit and to retirement pension at full rate. Self-employed and non-
employed persons whose income is not more than £208 a year can apply to
be exempted from liability to pay contributions.
Contributions are normally paid on a single contribution card by national
insurance stamps bought from a post office. It is the employer’s responsibility
in the first place to see that the class 1 contributions are paid, but he can
deduct the employee’s share from his or her wages. The self-employed and
non-employed must stamp their own cards. Contributions are usually
‘credited’ for weeks of unemployment, sickness or injury, or if widow’s
benefit is being paid.
Flat-rate contributions are paid by all three classes. Table 7 shows the
main weekly rates of these contributions (including the National Health
Service contribution, which for convenience is paid with it though the two
services are separately administered). The rates were last increased in June
1963. The table also shows the range of graduated contributions payable.
Employed persons aged 18 or over (unless they have ‘contracted out’) who
earn more than £9 a week pay graduated contributions in addition, at the
rate of approximately 4J per cent of that part of their weekly pay between
^9 and £18. The employer pays the same amount. The contributions are
collected through the same machinery as is used to collect Pay As You Earn
(deduction at source) income tax.
An insured person ceases to be liable for national insurance contributions
at the age of 70 for men, 65 for women, or when he retires, or is deemed to
have retired, from regular employment after reaching minimum pension
ag6 (65 for men, 60 for women), whichever is the earlier. If such a person
does any work as an employed person thereafter, he must pay an industrial
injuries contribution; his employer’s liability remains the same as shown in
Table 7.

a The rates given are those paid by men. Women and boys and girls under 18 years of
age contribute at various lower rates.
6 Including, for Class 1, the industrial injuries insurance contribution of 8d. from
employee and tjd. from employer.
The scheme provides payments to contributors in case of unemployment (if
normally working for an employer), sickness (if normally working for an
employer or self-employed), and confinement and the weeks immediately
before and after (for women normally working for an employer or self-
employed and paying national insurance contributions at the full rate).
Retirement pensions are paid to people who have reached 65 (60 for women)
and who, if under 70 (65 for women), have retired from regular work; widows
receive benefit in the first 13 weeks after bereavement and subsequently
while they have young children or if they have reached the age of 50 when
widowed or when their children have grown up; and there are two kinds of
allowance in respect of orphan children where a widow’s pension is not
payable. The scheme also provides lump-sum cash grants for three expensive
contingencies—the birth of a child, a confinement at home (or elsewhere,
otherwise than at public expense), and a death (though not for the death of
someone already over minimum pension age when the scheme started).
For most of the benefits there are two contribution conditions. First,
before benefit can be paid at all, a minimum number of contributions must
actually have been paid since entry into insurance; secondly, the full rate
of benefit cannot be paid unless a specified number of contributions have
been paid or ‘credited’ over a specified period. There are special rules to help
a widow who does not become entitled to a widow’s pension at widowhood
or when her children have grown up, to qualify for sickness or unemployment

benefit in the period before she can have established or re-established herself
in insurance through her own contributions; there are also provisions to help
divorced women who were not paying contributions during their marriage.
The basic standard rate of the majority of benefits is now £3 7s. 6d. a week for
men and women alike, which may be reduced if insufficient contributions
have been paid, but is not affected by other unearned income or the previous
level of earnings. Earnings made while the benefit is in payment, however,
may cause its reduction or withdrawal: unemployment benefit cannot be
paid to a person earning more than a specified amount from a secondary
occupation; widows, and retirement pensioners under the age of 70 (65 for
women), have their pensions reduced in step with earnings over certain
specified amounts; sickness benefit, though not affected by continued payment
of wages, is terminated if the person receiving it does more than a negligible
amount of paid work. Exceptions to the basic standard rate are the higher
rate of £4 15s. a week payable to widows, without regard to any earnings,
during the first 13 weeks after bereavement, the increased retirement pension
payable to someone who has continued at work beyond minimum pension
age, and the lower rate of £2 6s. a week unemployment or sickness benefit
payable to a married woman who is not either separated from her husband
and unsupported by him or else maintaining an invalid husband, i.e. who is
the second not the first breadwinner in the household. The standard rate of
retirement pension for a woman on her husband’s insurance is £2 is. 6d. a
week. Standard increases are payable for dependants at the rate of £2 is. 6d.
for an adult (generally a wife), for the first or only child under the family
allowances age limits and 12s., over and above any family allowances payable,
for other children. However, the amounts payable to widows for their
children are appreciably larger: 10s. for the first or only child and £1 2s.
for others.
Graduated contributions add 6d. a week to retirement pension for each
£7 1 os. of graduated contributions paid by a man, with the matching £7 10s.
paid by his employer, and for each £9 paid by a woman, with the matching
£9 paid by her employer.
The allowance provided for a child who has lost both parents (one of
whom must have been insured under the National Insurance Acts) is a
guardian’s allowance of £1 17s. 6d. a week. It is paid to the person in whose
family a child is, for the time being, included. For certain fatherless children
there is a child’s special allowance; this is payable to a woman whose marriage
has been dissolved or annulled and who has not re-married, if her former
husband dies and she has a child to whose support he was contributing before
he died. The weekly rate of the allowance is £1 10s. for the first or only
child and £1 2s. for each other child.
The rates of grants are varied: £16 maternity grant is payable for a con¬
finement and a further £16 grant for each additional child born at the same
confinement living 12 hours after its birth; £6 is paid for a confinement at
home or elsewhere other than at public expense; and £25 death grant on
the death of an adult (less for a child, or for an adult who was within 10 years
of minimum pension age when the scheme started).
All these amounts have been increased since the scheme came into operation;
the last benefit increases were in the spring of 1963.
In general, National Insurance payments are paid as long as the situation
requiring them lasts. However, sickness benefit cannot be paid for more than
a year if less than 156 contributions have been paid (possible within three

years for a contributor continuously at work) and unemployment benefit is
payable in the first instance for 30 weeks, after which it may be continued
for up to 19 months in all, according to the person’s record of contributions
paid as against unemployment benefit drawn in recent years. Maternity
allowance begins 11 weeks before the expected week of confinement and
ends after the sixth week following the expected week or the actual confine¬
ment if this is later.
Similarly, widowed mother’s allowances at the full rate cease when the
children reach family allowance age limits, though a mother can continue to
receive £3 7s. 6d. a week for herself while she has living with her a son or
daughter above the age limits but under 18. The widow’s pension payable
to the childless widow, provided she is over 50 (and had been married at
least three years when her husband died), and the similar pension normally
paid to the widowed mother who has reached 50 when her widowed mother s
allowance ends, continues until she has reached minimum pension age and
retired, or at most till age 65- If she has satisfied the conditions she then
becomes entitled to a retirement pension.
The Industrial Injuries Insurance scheme, which, in July I948> replaced the
Workmen’s Compensation scheme (first introduced by the Workmen’s
Compensation Act of 1897), provides benefits for personal injuries caused
by accidents arising out of, and in the course of, employment, and for
prescribed diseases due to the nature of employment. It covers practically
everyone in class 1 of the National Insurance scheme and certain others.
Like the National Insurance scheme, the Industrial Injuries scheme is
financed partly from contributions (see Table 7) and partly from taxation.
The relevant Acts are the National Insurance (Industrial Injuries) Acts, 1946
to 1963* Similar cover against industrial injuries and diseases in Northern
Ireland is provided by the National Insurance (Industrial Injuries) Acts
(Northern Ireland), 1946 to 1963.
Injury benefit for an adult is £5 15s. a week plus fz is. 6d. for an adult
dependant and fi for the first or only child under the family allowances age
limits and 12s. for each other eligible child, in addition to any family allowance
payable. It is paid when the insured person is incapable of work as a result
of an industrial accident or prescribed disease, and payment can continue
for a maximum of 26 weeks beginning on the date of the accident or develop¬
ment of the disease.
Disablement benefit may be paid (but not at the same time as injury benefit)
when, as the result of industrial accident or prescribed disease, there is a
loss of physical or mental faculty. The amount depends on the extent of the
disablement as assessed by a medical board; it varies from £5 15s. for 100 per
cent disablement to £1 3s. a week for 20 per cent disablement. For disablement
of less than 20 per cent a gratuity is normally paid, ranging up to ^3^°-
In certain circumstances disablement benefit may be supplemented as
follows: unemployability supplement, at the weekly rate of £3 7s. 6d.; constant
attendance allowance of up to fiz 10s. weekly, or at a special rate of £5 a
week in exceptionally severe cases; a special hardship allowance of up to
£2 6s. for a person who is unfit to return to his regular job or work of an
equivalent standard; and hospital treatment allowances which raise the
benefit to that for a 100 per cent assessment during hospital treatment for
the industrial disability. Increases of benefit for dependants are payable with
unemployability supplement and hospital treatment allowance.

If the accident or disease results in the insured person’s death, death benefit
may be paid to the dependants.
For a widow a pension of £4 15s. a week is payable for the first thirteen
weeks of widowhood. Thereafter, if the widow (1) is entitled to a child’s
allowance or was over the age of 40 on ceasing to be so entitled, or (2) was over
50 years of age or was permanently incapable of self-support at the time of
her husband’s death, or (3) is not entitled to child’s allowance, but has
residing with her a young person under the age of 18 who was or could be
treated as being in her late husband’s family, or (4) is over 40 years of age
when (3) ceases to apply, or (5) is pregnant by her late husband, she is
entitled to a pension of £3 15s. a week. If none of these conditions is satisfied,
the widow may receive a pension of ^1 a week. But the pension is limited,
if she had been living apart from her husband, to the weekly rate of main¬
tenance he was paying, if less than the rate otherwise appropriate.
In addition, allowances are paid for children under the family allowances
age limits. For widows, these allowances are normally at the rate of £1 10s.
a week for the first or only child and £1 2s. a week for each other child. For
other beneficiaries, the rate is £1 and 12s. a week respectively.
Certain other dependants, such as parents and other relatives, may be
entitled to pensions (of up to .£1 a week), allowances or gratuities.
Pensions and allowances for persons disabled or bereaved through the wars
or subsequent military service are paid under Royal Warrants and other
instruments administered by the Ministry of Pensions and National Insurance.
The current basic pension for too per cent disablement for a private
soldier is £5 15s. a week, but the amount varies according to rank and the
degree of disablement. The latter is assessed by comparing the general
condition of the disabled person as affected by service with that of a normal
healthy person of the same age and sex. Allowances for a wife and children
are paid in addition to the basic pension. There is a wide range of supple¬
mentary allowances, the main ones being for unemployability (£3 14s. a
week), constant attendance (up to £2 10s. and, exceptionally, £5 a week),
comforts (10s. or £1 a week), and lowered standard of occupation (up to
£2 6s. a week). An age allowance (at rates varying between 5s. and 15s. a
week) is payable to disablement pensioners who are aged 65 or over and whose
assessment is 40 per cent or more.
Both the basic disablement pension and the supplementary allowances are
free of income tax, and children’s allowances are paid in addition to any
allowance payable under the Family Allowances Acts.
Pensions are also paid to war widows and war orphans. The standard rate
of pension for widows of private soldiers is £4 10s. a week, with additional
allowances for their children (£1 14s. for each child), and, in certain cases,
an allowance for rent (up to £1 14s. a week). There is an allowance of 10s.
a week for widows aged 70 or over. Parents or other relatives who were
dependent on a person whose death resulted from military service may
receive pensions if they are in financial need.
The Ministry of Pensions and National Insurance maintains a welfare
service for war pensioners, with a special branch for war orphans, which is
available to help any pensioner who requires advice and assistance. War
pensioners have priority (except over more urgent cases) for treatment of
their war disabilities in National Health Service hospitals.
Many voluntary associations, such as the British Legion and other ex-
Service organisations, give financial aid and personal service to disabled

ex-Service men and women and their families. The Ministry’s welfare officers
work in close co-operation with these voluntary bodies and with the specialist
government welfare agencies.
The National Assistance Act, 1948, abolished the existing Poor Law and, in
place of the various services for the relief of need previously provided from
both central and local government funds, established for the first time a
comprehensive State service of financial assistance according to need which
is administered by the National Assistance Board.
Application to the Board for financial assistance can be made, with certain
exceptions relating to persons in full-time work or involved in a trade dispute,
by anyone over the age of 16 who is in need. The need for assistance is
decided by reference to general standards (which are amended from time to
time) laid down in regulations approved by Parliament. These regulations
contain rules for estimating the requirements of the person or family group
for whom assistance is to be provided and rules for the treatment of their
resources, whether of income or capital (for instance, national insurance
benefits and family allowances are taken fully into account, while some part
of other specified resources may be disregarded).
The regulations make special provision for higher rates for blind persons
and certain tuberculous persons, and also allow the Board’s officer to adjust
the amount payable to suit the particular circumstances of every case. The
help given is in this way related directly to the needs of the individual or
family. There is a right of appeal if the person is dissatisfied with the officer’s
decision.
There are few conditions attached to the grant of assistance, but help
given to able-bodied men or women of working age will normally be con¬
ditional on their registering for work at an employment exchange of the
Ministry of Labour; the assistance will then be paid at the exchange. Other¬
wise assistance is normally received as a weekly cash payment at a post office.

Services for
the Blind, the
Deaf and the
Disabled
All local welfare authorities provide services for the blind, either directly or
through voluntary organisations acting as their agents. They also provide,
or arrange for, welfare services for the deaf and other handicapped people
(including the mentally disordered of all descriptions); voluntary organisations
play an important part in this work by supplementing local authority services.
Local authorities normally keep registers of the blind in their areas and of
deaf and other physically handicapped people who wish to register.
Services for the blind include a home visiting and teaching service, employ¬
ing qualified home teachers, to assist the blind to adjust themselves to their
blindness (special attention is given to the newly blind and to those with
more than one disability, such as the deaf-blind); instruction in craft work
and in the use of embossed symbols for reading and writing; social clubs,
holiday and other recreational facilities; the supply or loan of apparatus, such
as wireless sets, embossed and recorded books, adapted tools and games,
residential social rehabilitation; and an advisory service on the special
financial and other benefits available to the blind (including preventive and
medical treatment, special education, training for employment and placement
in suitable occupations). Voluntary organisations for blind welfare include
local blind societies and also national bodies, notably the Royal National
Institute for the Blind, the National Library for the Blind, St. Dunstan’s (for
those blinded in the wars), the Scottish National Federation for the Welfare
of the Blind and the Scottish National Institution for the War Blinded.

Old People’s

Residential
Accommodation
Progress is being made in providing comparable services for other severely
and permanently disabled people. Help with personal and family problems
arising from disability, the teaching of handicrafts, participation in schemes
for doing industrial work at home, opportunities for social activities, adaptation
of premises to meet individual disabilities, and arrangements for holidays,
are some of those most generally provided. Training for employment in
ordinary or sheltered industry is available through the Ministry of Labour.
Welfare services for the deaf seek to help them to communicate with people
with normal hearing and to provide clubs and social centres where deaf
people can meet and communicate with each other.
A number of home services for old people are provided by statutory and
voluntary bodies to help them to go on living in their own homes for as long
as possible. Local health authorities supply, under the National Health
Service, home nursing and domestic help (see p. 158); over half the district
nurses’ time is spent on the aged or the chronic sick and the same group
makes the heaviest demands on the home help service.
Local authorities are enabled by the National Assistance Act to provide
meals and recreation for old people either directly or through the agency of
voluntary organisations. They also have power to assist voluntary organisations
by contributing to the cost of the services, giving or lending furniture, vehicles
or equipment, permitting organisations to use premises belonging to the local
authority and making available the services of local authority staff in this
connection.
Local Old People’s Welfare Committees have been formed and are aided
by the National Old People’s Welfare Council, an associated group of the
National Council of Social Service widely representative of voluntary and
statutory bodies having direct contact with old people, or by the Scottish
Old People’s Welfare Committee, a committee of the Scottish Council of
Social Service. A National Corporation for the Care of Old People was
established in 1947 by the Nuffield Foundation1 to stimulate and to give
financial support to schemes for the welfare of the aged, to maintain an expert
technical advisory service, and to encourage and undertake research and
experiment for the welfare of old people. It is now concentrating its main
effort on home services.
Local authorities provide residential accommodation, under the National
Assistance Act, for the aged, infirm and others, and temporary accommodation
for people who lose their homes, for example, in some disaster such as fire
or floods. The newer homes provided by local authorities for aged and other
infirm persons usually have accommodation for 40 to 60 residents; nearly
1,400 have been opened in Great Britain since the end of the second world
war. These smaller homes are gradually replacing the larger institutions
which were previously maintained by local authorities. There are also about
2,250 homes for old and disabled people run by voluntary bodies or by
private individuals.
1 The Nuffield Foundation was established by Lord Nuffield in 1943 for the advance¬
ment of health and the prevention and relief of sickness; the advancement of social
well-being; the care and comfort of the aged poor; the advancement of education; and
such other charitable purposes as might be declared by Lord Nuffield in his lifetime and
by the trustees after his death. Prominent among the foundation’s many activities are
the promotion of medical, scientific and social research and the development of medical
services and of technical and commercial education. Its resources consist of a fund of
£10 million provided by Lord Nuffield and of gifts and bequests from other persons.
148 BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
The National Assistance Board, which is responsible for influencing
‘persons without a settled way of living’ to lead a more normal life, provides
temporary accommodation for them in reception centres, sometimes through
the agency of local authorities. For men who have become demoralised by
long unemployment and who are in receipt of national assistance grants or
are using reception centres, it runs one non-residential and two residential
re-establishment centres where they are given help to fit them again for work.
Welfare
Services in
Northern
Ireland
In Northern Ireland the services provided under the Welfare Services Act
(Northern Ireland), 1949 (as amended), are broadly similar in scope to those
provided in Great Britain under the National Assistance Act, the only notable
exception being the inclusion of domestic help services, which in Great
Britain are provided under the National Health Service Act. Local welfare
services are provided by the six county and two county borough councils.
Welfare authorities have provided 30 homes for the aged and infirm and
other homes are under construction. The cost of the services is shared, as in
Great Britain, between local taxation and the Exchequer.
CHILD WELFARE
Care of
Children
Deprived of
Normal Home
Life
The Children Act, 1948, which came into force with the ending of the Poor
Law, places upon local authorities in Great Britain a duty to receive into
their care any child under the age of 17 who has no parent or guardian, or
who has been abandoned or whose parents are unable to provide for him
temporarily or permanently. A child so received remains in the care of the
local authority until he is 18 years old unless the authority finds it to his
advantage to return him sooner to his parents or guardian or to entrust him
to friends. Under the Children and Young Persons Acts, 1933-52 (as regards
England and Wales), and the Children and Young Persons (Scotland) Acts,
1937 and 1956, children in need of care or protection may be committed by
juvenile courts to the care of a ‘fit person’, usually the local authority, until
they reach the age of 18. Both categories of children are to be treated so as
to further their best interests and afford them opportunity for the proper
development of their character and interests.
When practicable, children in care are boarded out with foster parents,
who receive an allowance to cover the cost of maintenance. If a foster home
cannot be found for a child, or he is not suitable for boarding out, he may
be placed in a children’s home provided by a local authority or a voluntary
organisation. Many children’s homes are now provided in small houses, on
housing estates or in ordinary streets, where a group of twelve or fewer
children live in the care of a housemother or houseparents, the husband
following his normal employment. Other children may be placed in hostels
or lodgings or in other accommodation specially suited to their needs. The
desirability of returning a child to his family circle as soon as possible is
fully appreciated, and work is carried out to rehabilitate the family where
this is necessary.
To carry out its functions under the Children Act, each local authority
(county council and county borough council or, in Scotland, council of a
large burgh) is required to appoint a children’s committee and a children’s
officer to be responsible for the care and upbringing of children in the
authority’s care. Children’s officers are assisted by a staff of child care officers
who undertake inquiries and who supervise children placed in foster homes.
Regulations for England and Wales safeguarding the boarding out of children
by local authorities and voluntary organisations and the conduct of children’s
homes have been made by the Home Secretary. In Scotland similar regulations
SOCIAL WELFARE
149

Children Living

Homes
have been made by the Secretary of State for Scotland. The cost of the local
authorities’ child care service, including the provision of training for house-
parents and child care officers, is shared between the local authorities and the
Exchequer.
In Northern Ireland the Children and Young Persons Act (Northern
Ireland), 1950, gave to the welfare authorities of each county and county
borough (under the general direction of the Ministry of Home Affairs) the
duty of caring for homeless and neglected children. Legislation relating to
children and arrangements for their care follow the same general principles
as in Great Britain.
War orphans are the responsibility of the Ministry of Pensions and National
Insurance (see p. 145).
Voluntary organisations, many of which were pioneers in child care,
continue to play a valuable part in this work. The larger societies, such as
Dr. Barnardo’s, the Church of England Children’s Society and the Catholic
Child Welfare Council, are constituent societies of the National Council of
Associated Children’s Homes, to which a large number of smaller voluntary
homes are also affiliated. In Scotland a valuable contribution is also made by
the Children’s Homes and Hostels under the auspices of the Church of
Scotland Committee on Social Service, and by other voluntary organisations.
Children’s homes provided by voluntary organisations (of which there are
about 620 in Great Britain and 23 in Northern Ireland) are required to be
registered under the Children Act (in Northern Ireland under the Children
and Young Persons Act). The boarding out of children and all children’s
homes, whether local authority or voluntary homes, are subject to inspection
by the Child Care Inspectorate of the Home Office, of the Scottish Office
or of the Northern Ireland Ministry of Home Affairs.
Provision for legal adoption was first made in England and Wales in 1926,
in Northern Ireland in 1929 and in Scotland in 1930. Over 17,000 adoption
orders are made annually by the courts in Great Britain and some 250 in
Northern Ireland; there are always more would-be adopters than children
available for adoption. Adoption is now regulated by the Adoption Act, 1958,
in Great Britain and by the Adoption of Children Act (Northern Ireland),
1950, in Northern Ireland. The Registrars General keep registers of adopted
children; adoption societies (there are over 70 societies which arrange adop¬
tions) must be registered with the local authority (in Northern Ireland with
the Ministry of Home Affairs).
Local authorities have a duty to promote the welfare of children, so as to
lessen the need for them to be received into care, by giving advice and
assistance (which may include financial help in some cases) to families in
difficulty and may initiate court proceedings when children seem to be in
need of care, protection or control.
A small minority of families which need special help in managing their
affairs are the focus of much attention from health, housing, education,
children’s and welfare authorities and voluntary bodies. The voluntary
Family Service Units undertake intensive and prolonged casework with such
families and there are several voluntary recuperative centres to which mothers
who cannot cope with their children can be sent for a period of residential
training, sometimes as a condition of a probation order.
The old-established National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to
Children and its Scottish counterpart between them maintain inspectors and

HEALTH
The concern of the State with the nation’s health is chiefly a development of
the years since the passing of the Public Health Act of 1848. The second
half of the nineteenth century was notable for the growth of the environmental
or public health services, such as provision of pure water, sewerage, disposal
of refuse and cleaning of streets, and the first half of the twentieth century
for the development of publicly provided personal health services, as distinct
from environmental services, culminating in the introduction in 194^ a
comprehensive National Health Service available to every citizen. Scientific
discoveries of importance to medicine and health, including the development
of new drugs, and the improved services of the last fifty years, particularly
in maternity and child welfare, school health services and school meals, are
reflected in declining mortality rates (see p. 10) and improved physique.
Diseases now in the forefront of research programmes include cancer and
diseases of the central nervous system, such as muscular dystrophy. Efforts
are also being made to combat some of the most prevalent diseases which
include, besides the common cold and influenza, heart diseases, rheumatism
and bronchitis.
PUBLIC HEALTH The Public Health Act of 1936 brought up to date and consolidated preceding
Acts; it constitutes the present basic public health code in England and
Wales. Local authorities are mainly responsible for its implementation and
they have extensive powers for the making and administration of by-laws
relating to matters of public health. The local authorities chiefly concerned
are the councils of county and non-county boroughs, urban and rural district
councils, and, to a limited extent, parish councils.
Public health services in Scotland and in Northern Ireland have developed
on much the same lines as in England and Wales, although they are based on
separate Acts and there is a different allocation of services between the various
types of local authority. The Public Health (Scotland) Act, 1897, and the
Burgh Police (Scotland) Act, 1892, constitute the basic legislation for
Scotland. The local authorities concerned are the councils of counties and
burghs. In Northern Ireland the councils of county and non-county boroughs
and urban and rural districts are mainly responsible for administering the
Public Health Acts (Northern Ireland), 1878-1955.
Control of Local authorities are responsible for the investigation by their Medical
Infectious Officers of Health of outbreaks of infectious diseases and for disinfection and
Diseases other measures advised by them for preventing the spread of infectious
diseases in the area. They are also responsible to the Ministry of Health (or
the Welsh Board of Health or the Secretary of State for Scotland or the
Ministry of Health and Local Government for Northern Ireland) for recording
notifications of the prescribed infectious diseases.
The same departments have a general responsibility for supervising the
operation of health control at seaports and airports, the primary object of
which is to prevent the introduction of infectious disease into the country.

This health control is undertaken by health authorities using the services of
medical officers, public health inspectors, rodent inspectors and others.
The purity, hygiene and description of food are controlled by legislation
consolidated for England and Wales in the Food and Drugs Act, 1955, for
Scotland in the Food and Drugs (Scotland) Act, 1956, and for Northern
Ireland in the Food and Drugs Act (Northern Ireland), 1958. In England
and Wales the Act and regulations made under it are, in general, carried out
and enforced by food and drugs authorities (i.e. county councils, county
borough councils and, generally, the larger borough and urban district
councils) in relation to composition, adulteration and description, and by local
authorities (i.e. county borough, borough, urban district and rural district
councils) in relation to soundness, purity and hygiene; the Ministry of Health
and the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food are the central depart¬
ments responsible for advising and for making regulations under the Act.
Places where food for sale for human consumption is prepared, sold or
stored must conform to certain hygienic standards. Authorised officers
of the councils concerned may take for analysis or for bacteriological or
other examination samples of any food for sale for human consumption.
Special regulations are in force for certain foods such as milk, meat and
ice-cream.
In Scotland the local authorities chiefly concerned are the councils of
counties and large burghs; the central department is the Scottish Home and
Health Department.
In Northern Ireland administration is in the hands of the county and
county borough health authorities, the central department being the Ministry
of Health and Local Government.
Local authorities are also responsible for the public health aspects of water
supply, sewerage and drainage; street paving and housing; and the abatement
of noise nuisance. They have power to establish smoke controlled areas to
secure cleaner air; they may add fluoride to the water supplies.
The Acts setting up the National Health Service—the National Health
Service Act, 1946, the National Health Service (Scotland) Act, 1947, and the
Health Services Act (Northern Ireland), 1948—came into force simultaneously
on 5th July, 1948.
The object of the National Health Service Act, 1946, is ‘to promote the
establishment in England and Wales of a comprehensive health service
designed to secure improvement in the physical and mental health of the
people of England and Wales and the prevention, diagnosis and treatment
of illness, and for that purpose to provide or secure the effective provision
of services’. The National Health Service (Amendment) Act, 1949, and the
National Health Service Acts, 1951 to 1961, made some modifications in the
scheme for Great Britain and provided for charges to be made for certain
parts of the service, which is otherwise available free of charge to all according
to medical need without regard to any insurance qualification, although
national insurance contributors are required to pay a separate weekly national
health contribution under the National Health Service Contribution Acts,
1957 to 1961 (see Table 7). Visitors from other countries who come to Britain
for treatment are expected to pay for it, but treatment can be given under
the emergency provisions of the National Health Service to any who have
the misfortune to fall ill during a visit to Britain.

BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
In England and Wales the Minister of Health has direct responsibility for
the provision on a national basis of all hospital and specialist services, including
those for mental disorder. He has power to conduct, or assist others to conduct,
research work into matters relating to the causation, prevention, diagnosis
or treatment of illness or mental disorder, and he provides a public health
laboratory service and a blood transfusion service. He has indirect responsibility
for the general practitioner services and local health authority services. He
is advised by the Central Health Services Council and by standing advisory
committees on various aspects of the service.
The hospital and specialist services are administered through regional
hospital boards and hospital management committees and, in the case of
teaching hospitals, by boards of governors. The hospitals are administered
in groups, of which there are nearly 400 under the control of hospital manage¬
ment committees, which are in turn under the control of 15 regional hospital
boards. The regions are arranged so that the hospital and specialist services
can conveniently be associated with a university school of medicine.
The members of a hospital management committee are appointed by the
appropriate regional hospital board. The committees, by their constitution,
reflect the communities concerned, for they usually include not only medical
practitioners but members of local authorities, trade unionists and others.
The regional hospital boards are appointed by the Minister of Health and
are similarly constituted. The boards of governors of teaching hospitals are
appointed by the Minister, a proportion of the members being nominated
by the teaching faculty of the university, the regional hospital board and the
medical and dental teaching staff. All appointments to hospital management
committees, regional hospital boards and boards of governors are honorary.
Medical and dental schools are not under the control of the Minister; but
it is his responsibility to provide clinical facilities for the training of medical
students. The universities are responsible for the provision of teaching.
The general medical, dental, pharmaceutical and supplementary ophthalmic
services are administered by 138 executive councils, most of which cover
the area of a county or county borough; in a few cases two areas are combined
under one council. Each council has an ophthalmic services committee
responsible for administering the supplementary ophthalmic service. Doctors,
dentists and pharmacists are represented on the executive councils and each
profession also forms a local committee. Councils of counties and county
boroughs are the 146 local health authorities in charge of local health services.
In Scotland the Secretary of State for Scotland is the responsible minister;
31 county councils and 24 town councils of large burghs are the local health
authorities; hospital and specialist services are administered by five regional
hospital boards appointed by the Secretary of State, assisted by 83 boards
of management (the equivalent of hospital management committees in
England); and there are 25 executive councils, each serving the area of one
or more local health authorities. The teaching hospitals in Scotland come
under the control of the regional hospital boards, but special medical education
committees consider matters relating to medical teaching. The Scottish
Health Services Council and the standing advisory committees advise the
Secretary of State and keep closely in touch with the Central Health Services
Council on common issues.
The Northern Ireland Health Services are described separately on page 159.
Annual expenditure on the National Health Service in the United Kingdom
amounts to just over 3^ per cent of the total national income. The greater
SOCIAL WELFARE
153
part of the cost falls on the Exchequer, to be met from general taxation, and
a small part is met from local rates. Other income is derived from the national
health contribution paid with the national insurance contribution and from
the payments for those parts of the service for which charges are made.
These charges, first introduced in 1951 and since increased, are designed to
help to limit rising costs without reducing the services offered.
There is a charge of 2s. for each item entered on a prescription form. Charges
are also made for dentures (except for children under 16 or still at school,
and expectant and nursing mothers) and spectacles (except children’s spectacles
in standard frames), for elastic hosiery supplied in the family doctor service
or hospital out-patients’ department, for certain appliances supplied to out¬
patients, for treatment in the dental service (but not for examination only
or for treatment given to people under 21 years or to nursing or expectant
mothers), and for some local health authority services. Certain exemptions
or refunds are made and anyone may apply to the National Assistance Board
for help in meeting any of these charges. Under the 1946 Act, a limited
number of beds may be put aside for hospital patients wishing for privacy,
provided that this accommodation is not needed on medical grounds for
non-paying patients. Charges for these ‘amenity’ beds are fixed by statutory
regulations. Provision is also made at certain hospitals for patients who wish
to occupy private patients’ accommodation on payment of the whole cost of
this accommodation and treatment. Such patients may make private arrange¬
ments for treatment by a doctor of their own choice.
Hospital medical staffs are either full-time and salaried, or part-time;
part-time medical officers are usually paid on a sessional basis and are free
to accept private patients. General medical practitioners in public service are
remunerated mainly by capitation fees according to the number of people
on their lists.
Dentists providing treatment in their own surgeries are paid on a prescribed
scale of fees according to the treatment they have carried out. Pharmacists
dispensing on their own premises are paid on the basis of the prescriptions
they dispense. Doctors and ophthalmic opticians taking part in the supple¬
mentary ophthalmic service are paid prescribed fees for each sight test made;
opticians who dispense spectacles are paid according to the number and type
of pairs supplied.
The general practitioner services cover the medical attention given to
individuals by doctors and dentists of their own choice, from among those
enrolled in the service. Doctors and dentists normally work at their own
surgeries; in a few places they practise in health centres established under
the National Health Service Acts. About 25,000, or almost all, general
medical practitioners (principals and assistants) in Great Britain take some
part in the service.
Doctors previously in practice were entitled to join the service at its start
in the place where they were practising. Those now wishing to enter practice
have to apply through their executive councils to the central Medical
Practices Committee, so that a better distribution of doctors throughout the
country may be facilitated. The maximum number of patients’ names per¬
mitted to be on a family doctor’s list is normally 3,500; the average number
in England and Wales is about 2,300. It is normally through the patient’s
own doctor that access to most other parts of the health service is obtained.
There are over 10,000 dentists in England and Wales and over 1,000 in
Scotland in the general dental service.

Nearly 900 ophthalmic medical practitioners and over 7,000 ophthalmic
and dispensing opticians in England and Wales, and over 70 ophthalmic
medical practitioners and nearly 800 ophthalmic and dispensing opticians in
Scotland, are engaged in the supplementary ophthalmic service. This service
provides for the testing of sight and provision of spectacles. Cases requiring
treatment are dealt with through the hospital eye service.
Nearly all retail pharmacists (13,000 in England and Wales and 1,600 in
Scotland) take part in the service. They are responsible for the dispensing
of all prescriptions except for the small number dispensed by certain general
practitioners.
The hospital and specialist services provide hospital accommodation of all
kinds, including district general hospitals with treatment and diagnostic
facilities both for in-patients and out-patients, hospital maternity departments,
infectious disease units, psychiatric hospitals and units, convalescent homes,
and rehabilitation centres; all forms of specialised treatment; and the services
of specialists and other staff required for the hospitals.
A large proportion of the 3,000 hospitals in the National Health Service in
Great Britain were built in the nineteenth century; some trace their origins
to much earlier charitable foundations, such as the famous St. Thomas’s
and St. Bartholomew’s Hospitals in London. Much has been done in recent
years to improve and extend existing hospitals and a start has been made on
the building of new hospitals. In 1962 ten-year plans for hospital development
were published by the Government, setting out the probable future pattern
of the hospital services. Over 200 new or substantially remodelled hospitals
are to be started in England and Wales and 20 in Scotland, at a total cost of
over £800 million in England and Wales and £70 million in Scotland.
About 2,602 of the existing hospitals in the National Health Service are
in England and Wales, including the 26 teaching hospitals in London (actually
groups of hospitals comprising about 100 hospitals, convalescent homes,
branches, annexes, or treatment centres) and the 10 teaching hospitals
elsewhere in England and Wales (comprising some 70 hospitals and other
establishments). They have over 468,000 staffed beds and a nursing and
midwifery staff of 168,000 full-time and nearly 59,000 part-time nurses and
midwives. There are 385 hospitals in Scotland with about 64,000 beds
and over 24,000 full-time and over 7,000 part-time nurses and midwives.
A small number of hospitals remain outside the service for special reasons.
Most of these are run by religious orders. Some, such as the Italian and
French Hospitals, serve a special group of patients; others are maintained
for the chronic sick or for convalescents by charitable organisations. There
are also private nursing homes, which must be registered.
Rehabilitation is an important aspect of medical care and today hospital
treatment is not limited to the relief of pain or cure of pathological conditions
but aims at helping people to resume normal living as soon as possible.
Specialised rehabilitation facilities are provided at the main hospitals and in
a few special centres. The work is carried out under the guidance of the
appropriate medical specialist by physiotherapists, remedial gymnasts,
occupational therapists and social workers, working as a team. Experience
has shown that efficient medical rehabilitation reduces the stay in hospital,
the incidence of permanent disability and the period of incapacity for full
work. The departments work in close association with the Disablement
Resettlement Service of the Ministry of Labour. Rehabilitation methods have

been applied with advantage in the care of the chronic sick, the mentally
disabled, the aged and the handicapped and have enabled many patients to
become self-sufficient or to be discharged from hospital and to resume an
independent life in their own homes.
The National Blood Transfusion Service in England and Wales is adminis¬
tered by the regional hospital boards under the National Health Service.
Each region maintains an organisation for collecting blood from voluntary
donors in the region, who give their blood without payment. The blood is
kept in the regional blood bank, or issued to area blood banks maintained at
general hospitals in each region. Each regional transfusion centre acts as a
reference centre for all transfusion problems arising in the region. There are
two central laboratories administered by the Medical Research Council on
behalf of the Ministry of Health: the Blood Group Reference Laboratory,
which prepares grouping serum and investigates blood grouping problems
referred to it, and the Blood Products Laboratory, which prepares dried
plasma and plasma fractions. In Scotland the Blood Transfusion Service is
under the direction of the Scottish National Blood Transfusion Association,
an independent voluntary body set up in 1940, which is supported partly by
voluntary contributions, but in the main by a grant from State funds, made
by the Scottish Home and Health Department. A close liaison is maintained
with the National Blood Transfusion Service, the Blood Group Reference
Laboratory and the Blood Products Laboratory.
Mass miniature radiography was introduced in 1943 as a means of early
diagnosis of tuberculosis. About no units in Britain operate under the
regional hospital boards in close co-operation with the local health authorities.
They examine about 3^ million people a year, concentrating increasingly on
areas with a bad record for tuberculosis, on specially susceptible groups in
the population, and on adults in regular contact with organised groups of
children.
Many hospitals have an almoners’ department staffed by medical-social
workers trained to apply the principles of social casework to the problems
of the hospital patient. The almoners’ main function is to co-operate with
the medical staff in their treatment of the patient; to limit, by social action,
the personal anxieties, family difficulties and other problems which arise
during illness; and to arrange, if necessary, for after-care and help with
adjustment to normal life or continuing disability. Psychiatric social workers
are specially trained for work in the mental health services and in child
guidance clinics. They make an invaluable contribution, not only to hospitals
but also to the local health and education services, in assessing the environ¬
mental factors in mental abnormalities and in helping patients to make the
necessary adjustments.
The Public Health Laboratory Service provides a network of bacteriological
and virological laboratories throughout England and Wales which conduct
research and assist in the diagnosis, prevention and control of epidemic
diseases. Its largest establishment is the Central Public Health Laboratory
at Colindale, in north-west London, which includes the National Collection
of Type Cultures, the Food Hygiene Laboratory, and reference laboratories
specialising in the identification of infective micro-organisms.
In Scotland and Northern Ireland, where there is no separate public
health laboratory service, bacteriological work is done mainly in hospital
laboratories.

Since 1963 a committee known as the Committee on the Safety of Drugs has
been responsible for advising the industry and the Health Ministers on
toxicity testing and clinical trials of new drugs and for assessing reports of
adverse reactions to drugs in use.
Treatment for mental disorder is provided as part of the National Health
Service. Patients who are suffering from mental illness can consult the
family doctor and receive specialist advice at hospital out-patient clinics as
they would for any other kind of illness, and if they need to enter a hospital
for treatment, whether a general or a psychiatric hospital, they can do so
without formalities. If patients, or their relatives, are unable or unwilling to
make the necessary arrangements for admission to a psychiatric hospital, it
is the duty of a mental welfare officer of the local health authority to do so.
Where necessary in the interests of society or of the patients themselves,
mentally disordered patients can be compulsorily detained in hospital.
Compulsory admission to hospital is regulated in England and Wales by the
Mental Health Act, 1959, and in Scotland by the Mental Health (Scotland)
Act, i960. There are procedural safeguards to protect the patient from
unnecessary detention and he, or his relatives, may appeal against detention,
in England and Wales to a mental health tribunal, and in Scotland to the
sheriff.
Local health authorities have a duty to make arrangements for helping the
mentally disordered in the community, for their care and after-care. Arrange¬
ments may include facilities for training or occupation, and residential
accommodation. If necessary, the local health authority can place a mentally
disordered person under guardianship within the community. In Scotland
education authorities share the responsibility for providing training or
occupation.
Under the welfare foods service expectant and nursing mothers, children
under five and certain handicapped children can obtain a pint of milk a day
at a reduced price. Beneficiaries get tokens from the Ministry of Pensions
and National Insurance to enable them to get supplies from their usual milk
retailers at the special price.
Other welfare foods distributed by local health authorities to the same
group of people are dried milk, as an alternative to liquid milk and at an
equivalent price, orange juice, cod liver oil and vitamin A and D tablets, at
cost price. Families who cannot afford to pay can apply to the National
Assistance Board for special tokens to enable them to obtain supplies free
of charge.
The Local Health Services administered by the county and county borough
councils (county and large burgh councils in Scotland) consist of the maternity
and child welfare services, including welfare centres, maternity care, dental
care and day nurseries, the services for the prevention of illness, care, and
after-care, including vaccination and immunisation, health visiting, home
nursing and domestic help, and care in some cases of mental disorder, the
ambulance services (in Scotland the responsibility of the Secretary of State,
and in Northern Ireland of the Northern Ireland Hospitals Authority); and
the provision, equipment and maintenance of local health centres (the
responsibility of the Secretary of State in Scotland). A White Paper {Cmnd.
1973) was laid before Parliament in April 1963 setting out the plans of local
authorities in England and Wales for the development of the health and

welfare services over the decade 1962 to i972, Scotland fundamental
studies of services were being carried out as a guide to authorities in their
plans for expansion.
Maternity and child welfare centres are part of the advisory and preventive
services of the local health authority; they offer regular supervision by doctors
and nurses to expectant and nursing mothers and young children. Special
sessions are held for vaccination and inoculation and for early testing of
babies for deafness and other defects, and a feature of the service is the
education of mothers by means of talks, discussion groups, demonstrations
and classes. About 80 per cent of all babies are taken to the centres.
The expectant mother may arrange to have her baby at home or in hospital
according to the advice given by the doctor or midwife, or according to her
own preference if sufficient hospital beds are available over and above those
required for priority cases, i.e. those for whom domiciliary confinement is
inadvisable for medical or obstetric reasons or because of adverse home
conditions. The proportion of confinements taking place in hospital varies
considerably between different areas; the national average has increased over
the past 25 years and is now 64 per cent for England and Wales and 75 per
cent for Scotland.
For a home confinement the services of either a general practitioner
obstetrician or her own family doctor, if he is willing to undertake her
maternity care, besides those of a trained midwife in the domiciliary service
of the local health authority, are now available to every mother. The doctor
carries out ante-natal and post-natal examinations, attends at the confinement
and gives any other medical care required. The services of a consultant
obstetrician are also available if the doctor wishes to ask for his advice.
Routine supervision and advice is given by the midwife, who visits regularly
before the confinement to examine the mother and give her advice and help
generally. In addition, the expectant mother may attend the ante-natal clinic
for instruction in preparation for motherhood and in some cases for interim
ante-natal supervision. Frequently it is the midwife who undertakes the
actual delivery. Both she and the doctor attend during the 10 days after
confinement. Midwives work in close touch with the welfare centres in the
care of the mother both before and after the birth of the child.
Many local health authorities make special arrangements for premature
babies remaining in their own homes, by lending equipment and appointing
experienced nursing staff to supervise their care.
There are about 470 day nurseries for children under five in Great Britain
provided by local health authorities or voluntary associations working with
them. The National Health Service Act, 1952, gave local authorities power
to make charges for the use of day nurseries. Private or factory nurseries (of
which there are about 700 altogether) must be registered with the local
health authorities; this regulation applies also to persons paid for looking
after more than two children who are not all of the same family.
Most local authorities contribute to the cost of the work done by voluntary
denominational and other bodies which care for unmarried mothers and
their babies; a few authorities make direct provision for their special needs
through their health departments. The voluntary associations employ specially
trained workers to help the unmarried mother in making plans for herself
and her child. Most homes and hostels for the ante-natal and post-natal care
(and, in some cases, the confinement) of these mothers are provided by such
organisations.

BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Health visitors (see p. 161) are employed by local health authorities to visit
people in their own homes to give advice on the care of young children,
expectant and nursing mothers, people suffering from illness, including
mental illness, and any injury or disability requiring medical or dental
treatment, and on measures necessary to prevent the spread of infection.
Their duties include health education and attendance at ante-natal and child
welfare clinics. They may also undertake tuberculosis visiting and school
nursing.
The employment of nurses to attend patients who require nursing in their
own homes is the responsibility of the local health authorities. Most authorities
employ nurses directly for this purpose, although others have arranged for
voluntary district nursing associations to provide a service on their behalf.
Local health authorities (welfare authorities in Northern Ireland) have the
power to make arrangements for domestic help (commonly called ‘home help’)
in households where it is needed owing to illness, confinement, or the
presence of children, or old people. This service is mainly used in the care
of old or chronically sick people, in maternity cases and, to a lesser extent
but increasingly, for families where such help is needed to prevent children
having to be cared for away from home, for example, during the absence
of the mother. The authorities may recover from those assisted such charges
as it is considered they can afford to pay, but the service may be provided
without charge to people with very small incomes.
Free conveyance by ambulance in England and Wales between home and
hospital or clinic is provided, where needed, by local authorities either
directly or by arrangement with voluntary organisations. The Hospital Car
Service (organised by the St. John Ambulance Brigade, the British Red Cross
Society, and the Women’s Voluntary Service) augments the ambulance
service in many areas for the conveyance of sitting patients. In Scotland
ambulances are run by the Scottish Ambulance Service (St. Andrew’s
Ambulance Association and the Scottish branch of the British Red Cross
Society) on behalf of the Secretary of State. In Northern Ireland they are
run by the Northern Ireland Hospitals Authority.
Local health authorities are responsible for prevention, care and after-care
arrangements for mental disorder (see p. 156) and tuberculosis. They are
responsible for BCG vaccination and other preventive measures against
tuberculosis and also for rehabilitation, but not for diagnosis and treatment,
which are the responsibility of the hospital service and are provided through
hospitals and chest clinics. The chest physicians in charge of the clinics are,
however, often employed jointly by the hospital authorities and local
authorities to ensure co-ordination of all phases of treatment. They are
assisted by tuberculosis health visitors and nurses, and by almoners or other
social workers.
Care and after-care arrangements are made to varying extents for other
types of illness; in particular there are certain services for people being
nursed at home, such as the loan of special equipment or the laundering of
bed linen. A chiropody service is provided in many areas. As part of their
preventive work, local health authorities may give help and advice to families,
particularly those in difficulties and in danger of breaking up, where there
is a danger to the physical or mental health of the children.
A charge may be made for some of these services if the person wishing
to make use of them can reasonably be expected to contribute towards their
cost.

IRELAND
All local health authorities have arrangements for vaccination, without charge
and as part of the National Health Service, against diphtheria, poliomyelitis,
smallpox, tetanus, tuberculosis and whooping cough.
Vaccination against poliomyelitis by local health authorities is normally
restricted to people under 40 years of age; those over 40 may be vaccinated,
free of charge under the National Health Service, by their general practitioner.
BCG vaccination against tuberculosis by local health authorities is available
to children of ten years and upwards and to others particularly exposed to
risk of tubercular infection.
Seventeen health centres which provide primarily for the association of
general medical practice with maternity and child welfare services and the
school health service have been set up by local health authorities in England
and Wales. This is one form of co-operation between the different elements
in the health service. Other forms of co-operation are growing, such as the
siting of group practices adjacent to local health authority clinics, the attend¬
ance of midwives for ante-natal sessions at general practitioners’ surgeries
and the attachment of health visitors to particular practices for the whole or
part of their time. The provision of the two health centres in Scotland is
the responsibility of the Secretary of State for Scotland and not of local
health authorities.
The National Health Service is not without its difficulties and shortcomings.
For example, the original ideal of comprehensive free treatment for all has
to some extent been breached by the introduction of charges for some parts
of the Service which the majority of the users have to pay. In spite of these,
the total cost of the Service has continued to rise, because of such factors as
increases in prices and in staff salaries, the high cost of many new drugs and
of modern equipment, the increased use made by the public of the services
provided, extensions and improvements of the Service and an increased rate
of capital expenditure. More doctors, dentists, midwives and nurses are
needed by an expanding service. There is also some disparity between different
parts of the country; some areas have more family doctors than others, more
hospital beds for confinements of mothers who would prefer to have their
babies in hospital though they do not need specialist medical care, and more
extensive local authority services.
Against these shortcomings may be set the steady improvement in the
country’s vital statistics to which the National Health Service has largely
contributed, the decrease in ill-health from neglected ailments, and the
removal of anxiety about the cost of treatment, from which many of those
who now use the Service previously suffered.
The health services established under the Health Services Act (Northern
Ireland), 1948, correspond fairly closely to the medical care system established
under the National Health Service in Great Britain and they are financed
in the same way as in the rest of the United Kingdom.
The hospital and specialist services are administered by the Northern
Ireland Hospitals Authority (which corresponds approximately to a regional
hospital board in Great Britain) through hospital management committees.
In hospital administration the role of the central government is not quite
so immediate and direct as in Great Britain: hospital property, for example,
is vested not in the Minister of Health and Local Government but in the
Northern Ireland Hospitals Authority, which has under its control 75 hospitals
containing in all about 17,000 beds. The administration of the general
I6o BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
medical, dental, pharmaceutical and supplementary eye services is in the
hands of the Northern Ireland Health Services Board, which takes the place
of the executive councils in Great Britain. Local health services are adminis¬
tered by the six county councils and the two county borough councils in
Northern Ireland. The range of local authority services and the arrangements
made by the Northern Ireland General Health Services Board for the
provision of services, and for the remuneration of the people providing them,
are similar to those already described for the rest of the United Kingdom.
VOLUNTARY AID
FOR THE
SICK AND
HANDICAPPED
A number of voluntary organisations provide extensive welfare services for
sick and handicapped people in co-operation with, or supplementary to, the
provision made by central and local authorities. Many convalescent homes
and homes for the infirm and for people with specific handicaps are, or were
originally, provided by voluntary effort. In many areas invalid children and
others needing care in their own homes are visited and helped by voluntary
organisations. Though the need for material aid from private sources becomes
less as public provision extends, many forms of help to meet individual
needs that would not otherwise be met are given by voluntary agencies.
Their most valuable role is probably to provide small personal services and
the continued personal interest that can mean so much to a sick or handi¬
capped person. These voluntary agencies usually depend largely on the work
of part-time or full-time unpaid volunteers.
A great deal of help is given to hospitals by voluntary bodies and individual
voluntary helpers. The majority of the hospitals in England and Wales have
their own Leagues of Friends or similar bodies of voluntary workers who
organise and undertake a variety of services for their hospitals. Many hospitals
also have help from the British Red Cross Society, the Order of St. John, the
Women’s Voluntary Service, or a similar organisation. The operation of
canteens for out-patients, and trolley-shops and book and picture library
services for in-patients, visiting in the wards, receiving new patients, and
mending linen are among the tasks commonly undertaken.
THE MEDICAL,
DENTAL AND
ALLIED
PROFESSIONS
Only persons whose names are on the medical register can practise as doctors
under the National Health Service. Apart from registered medical prac¬
titioners, only persons whose names are on the dentists register can practise
the full range of dentistry in Britain; dental auxiliaries who have undergone
a two-year training course may do some simple work under supervision. The
minimum qualification for registration as a doctor requires five to seven years’
training in medical school and hospital, with an additional year s experience
as a resident assistant doctor in a hospital; for a dentist, four or more years
at a dental school are required. The governing body of the medical profession
is the General Medical Council, first set up in 1858; that of the dentists is
the General Dental Council, which succeeded the Dental Board in 1956.
The British Medical Association is the doctors’ professional association; that
of the dentists is the British Dental Association.
The minimum period of hospital training required to qualify for registration
as a general trained nurse is three years. Training is available also in sick
children’s, mental, and mental subnormality nursing. The course for an
enrolled nurse is a two-year one. The governing body of the nursing pro¬
fession is the General Nursing Council, set up in 1919. Midwives must have
the certificate of the Central Midwives Board. Most pupil midwives are
already state registered general nurses or sick children s nurses; for them
the two-year midwifery training period is reduced to one year and, for state

enrolled nurses, to 18 months. The Royal College of Nursing and the Royal
College of Midwives are the professional bodies for nurses and midwives.
Health visitors are state registered general or sick children’s nurses who have
undergone at least the first part of the midwifery course or obstetric nursing
before taking a year’s course in health visiting. This course is promoted by
the Council for the Training of Health Visitors.
Only registered pharmaceutical chemists may practise as pharmacists or
describe themselves as such, and qualifications requiring four to five years’
academic study and practical training are necessary for registration. The
Pharmaceutical Society of Great Britain is the governing body of the profession.
Under the Opticians’ Act, 1958, a General Optical Council regulates the
profession of ophthalmic optician and only registered ophthalmic opticians
(or registered medical practitioners) may test sight. Training takes three
years followed by a year under supervision.
For the professions of chiropodist, dietitian, medical laboratory technician,
occupational therapist, physiotherapist, radiographer, remedial gymnast and
speech therapist a good general education is required, followed by professional
training, mostly of two or three years. Only people with approved qualifi¬
cations may be employed in these professions in the National Health Service;
with the exception of speech therapists, these professions have their own
professional boards, supervised by the Council for Professions Supplementary
to Medicine. The length and nature of the training varies according to the
profession and may be as long as three years.
Almoners must obtain the certificate of the Institute of Almoners, or have
taken a recognised university course to qualify them for membership of the
Institute. Psychiatric social workers are required to have a certificate showing
they have attended the mental health course provided at certain universities.
Medical research in Britain receiving support from Government funds is carried
out by the Medical Research Council (see below), the universities and their
associated medical schools, and also in hospitals in the National Health Service.
A considerable amount of medical research is undertaken by private
organisations, of which the British Empire Cancer Campaign and the
Nuffield Foundation are probably the largest. There is close co-operation
between the Medical Research Council and these organisations to ensure the
best allocation of their respective resources. The pharmaceutical industry also
makes a valuable contribution to research.
The Medical Research Council’s programme of work is carried out both in
its own research establishments and by independent investigators, in the
universities and elsewhere, with support from the Council in the form of
research grants. The programme includes fundamental studies of the structure
and natural processes of the body; clinical and laboratory studies of disease;
the development and evaluation of special methods of treatment and also of
prophylaxis and diagnosis; and the study of social and occupational factors
affecting health and the efficiency of body and mind.
In planning and carrying out its programme, the Council is assisted by
special advisory committees which it appoints. Two of the more important
of these are the Clinical Research Board, set up in consultation with the
health departments to assist the development of clinical research, and the
Tropical Medicine Research Board, appointed in consultation with the Depart¬
ment of Technical Co-operation, to advise on the promotion and co-ordination
of research in this field.

EDUCATION
There are nearly nine million children and young people in full-time
attendance at schools, universities, training colleges or technical colleges in
the United Kingdom. Over 90 per cent of school children attend publicly
provided or aided schools. The universities are independent, self-governing
institutions but are aided from public funds. Most technical colleges and
other centres of further education are publicly maintained. Many schools
and colleges continue to benefit from the endowments provided by benefactors
in past centuries.
The bulk of the expenditure on education in the United Kingdom therefore
comes from public funds. Total public expenditure on education, including
university education, was nearly £1,200 million in the year 1962-63.
In England and Wales the main development of publicly provided primary
education dates from 1870, and that of secondary education from the beginning
of the present century. In 1833 the Government began to make annual
grants to the voluntary societies which were providing schools, and the
Elementary Education Act of 1870 accepted the principle of compulsory
education. By the end of the nineteenth century elementary education had
become virtually both compulsory and free of charge. Public provision of
secondary education (already begun in Wales) started in England under the
Act of 1902. The Education Act of 1944 now governs public education in
England and Wales. It seeks to widen and improve educational opportunities
at every stage.
The Scottish and Northern Ireland educational systems both have long
histories independent of that of education in England, but the same general
policy is now being implemented throughout the United Kingdom, with
some national variations.
Administration of publicly provided education in Britain is divided between
the central Government departments (the Ministry of Education for England
and Wales, with its separate Welsh Department, the Scottish Education
Department, and the Ministry of Education for Northern Ireland), local
education authorities, and various voluntary organisations. The relation
between these three groups is based on consultation and co-operation, both
by direct contact between the parties and through Her Majesty’s Inspectors
of Education who act as liaison officers, particularly between local education
authorities and the departments.
The local education authorities are responsible for ensuring that adequate
provision is made in their areas for the two stages of school education
(primary and secondary), and that those pupils who would profit by proceeding
to a university are not deterred by lack of financial means. They are also
responsible for the provision of all forms of ‘further education’, i.e. post¬
school education outside the universities.
The planning of the curriculum is largely in the hands of the head teacher
of each school and the individual teachers. In England and Wales teachers
are not subject to direction from the central department on questions relating
to curricula or methods. Her Majesty’s Inspectors, who are responsible for
SCHOOLS
EDUCATION 163
the inspection of all schools including independent schools, review and
report on the content and value of the education provided and, during their
visits, are available as advisers. Local education authorities also employ
inspectors to advise on the schools which they maintain. In Scotland the
broad outline of schemes of work in primary and secondary schools is subject
to the approval of one of Her Majesty’s Inspectors. In Northern Ireland
the curriculum of each grant-aided school is subject to the approval of the
Ministry of Education, but considerable latitude is afforded both in
the scope of the curriculum and in the methods employed.
Parents in Britain are required by law to see that their children receive
efficient full-time education, at school or elsewhere, between the ages of
5 and 15. The school-leaving age is to be raised to 16 as soon as enough
teachers and adequate accommodation become available to allow this to be
done without increasing the size of classes; this, however, is unlikely to be
possible for some years. In England and Wales over 7 million children
attend publicly maintained schools, besides the 123,000 others at schools
receiving direct grants from the Ministry of Education. There are also 495,000
children of all ages at about 4,000 independent schools. In Scotland 890,000
children are attending publicly maintained or aided schools and about
18,000 are at independent schools. In Northern Ireland 289,000 children are
attending publicly maintained or aided schools; independent schools are few.
The number of school children in Britain is increasing as more stay on each
year beyond the minimum school-leaving age. Moreover, the birth rate has
continued to rise steadily since 1955, so that primary school numbers are
very high. There is, therefore, a continuing demand for more teachers and
more school buildings.
In England and in Northern Ireland it is usual for boys and girls to be
taught together in primary schools, but rather more than half the secondary
schools are for boys or girls only. Mixed schools are more common in Wales;
and in Scotland all but a few city schools take both boys and girls.
The majority of independent schools are for boys or for girls only, except
in classes for small children. There are, however, a few schools which are
co-educational.
In England and Wales three kinds of school are supported from public
funds: county schools (the largest group) which are provided and maintained
by local education authorities, i.e. their full cost falls on public funds;
voluntary schools (mostly ‘aided’ or ‘controlled’ schools) which have been
provided by a voluntary body, usually of a religious denomination, but which
are maintained by local education authorities1; and direct grant schools which
are completely independent of local education authorities but receive a
grant-in-aid from the Ministry of Education. These last (the smallest group)
mostly provide education of the grammar school type; they include some
schools of ancient foundation.
In Scotland most of the schools supported from public funds are provided
by education authorities and are known as public schools (in England this
term is used for a type of independent school of which there are also a few in
1 Aided schools have more independence than controlled schools, but they are partly
responsible for maintaining their buildings (see p. 170) whereas controlled schools are
not. Over a third of the schools maintained by local education authorities in England
and Wales are voluntary schools and the majority of these are Church of England
schools. There are some 2,000 Roman Catholic voluntary schools and smaller numbers
belonging to other religious bodies.
64 BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Scotland and Northern Ireland, see p. 166). There are also a iew grant-aided
schools (some of ancient foundation) conducted by voluntary managers and
receiving grants direct from the Scottish Education Department.
In Northern Ireland there are county schools, managed by local education
authorities, and voluntary schools, which are grant-aided schools under
voluntary management.
In England and Wales no fees are charged to parents of children attending
schools maintained by local education authorities, and books and equipment
are supplied free. Direct grant schools charge fees but must offer each year,
to pupils who have at any time previously attended a grant-aided primary
school for not less than two years, free places to the extent of not less than
25 per cent of the previous year’s admission; and a further 25 per cent of the
places must be put at the disposal of the local education authorities if they
require them. Pupils occupying these latter places need not previously have
attended a grant-aided primary school. Day pupils not holding free places
are entitled to claim a remission of fees in accordance with an approved
income scale, and the Ministry of Education pays the governors of the school
the amount of the fees so remitted. Local education authorities also pay for
some free places in independent schools which normally charge fees. A
number of independent schools are able to offer some scholarships from
endowments.
In Scotland education authorities may charge fees in certain schools
provided that this does not prejudice the provision of free education for all
who desire it.
In Northern Ireland no fees are charged to parents of children attending
any county or voluntary primary, intermediate or special school; qualified
pupils attending both county and voluntary grammar schools receive
scholarships from the local education authorities which cover the whole or
most of the fees charged by the school.
Primary A child’s primary education continues until about the age of 11 in England,
Schools Wales and Northern Ireland and 12 in Scotland. There are some nursery
schools and classes for children between two and five years old. In England
and Wales there are infant schools, or departments, for all children between
five and seven junior schools for those aged seven to 11, while in Scotland
there are primary departments for children aged five to 12 years.
In Scotland primary pupils must be taught reading, writing, arithmetic,
English, music, art and handwork, nature study, physical training and, at
the appropriate stage, history, geography, and written composition, girls
must learn needlework. Religious instruction is also given. In England, Wales
and Northern Ireland, the curriculum is similar in scope, with the addition
in Wales of the teaching of Welsh. (Children who speak Welsh at home
normally receive the early stages of their primary education in Welsh and
are taught English as a second language.)
Secondary The aim of the public system of secondary education is to give all children
Schools an education suited to their particular abilities.
England, Wales and Since the organisation of schools is a responsibility of local education
Northern Ireland authorities in England and Wales, subject to the approval of the Ministry of
Education, the type of provision made for secondary education varies to
some extent between areas. In some areas, different types of school specialise,
particularly in the later years, in different types of course, with arrangements
for the transfer of pupils between schools where desirable; in other areas
EDUCATION
Scotland

flexibility is achieved by an overlap of the courses provided in different
types of school. There are, however, two main types of publicly maintained
secondary school in England and Wales: grammar and secondary modern.
Grammar schools take children who hope to reach a university and others
likely to profit from an academic type of education. In England and Wales
these schools are attended by about one secondary school pupil in four.
Secondary modern schools form the largest group of secondary schools. They
give a general education, with a practical bias, closely related to the interests
and environment of their pupils. Secondary technical schools offer an education
related to industry, commerce and agriculture, but still general, and not
vocational, in purpose. Schools which provide all three, or any two types of
education in separately organised streams are known as multilateral and
bilateral schools.
Some local education authorities have established comprehensive schools
providing all types of secondary education, without separate streaming, for
all, or most of, the children of a district. In urban areas such schools tend to
be larger than the other types of school and may have as many as 2,000 pupils.
Each local education authority decides how the selection shall be made for
its secondary schools: generally speaking, this selection depends upon an
assessment of the child’s ability as shown in the primary school, often coupled
with objective tests taken at about eleven years of age, which are commonly
known as ‘the eleven-plus’. There is provision for an appeal to the Minister of
Education in the event of a dispute between a local education authority and
a parent, and authorities reconsider original decisions when subsequent events
prove this to be necessary. Both the system of allocating children to different
types of secondary school at the age of eleven and the selection methods used
have been the subject of much public discussion and critical thought. Local
education authorities are constantly experimenting with methods of selection
which will minimise any strain on children or their parents. At the same
time, the authorities are seeking to organise their schools in such a way that
every child will have, and feel that he has, the opportunity to develop his
talents to the full. For those pupils who can profitably follow them, many
modern schools now offer courses of the type found in grammar and secondary
technical schools.
Most grammar school pupils remain at school until they are 16 years old,
some until they are 17, 18 or 19 years old. Most secondary modern pupils
at present leave at the age of 15, but the number of pupils remaining at school
beyond the minimum leaving age has been increasing steadily for some years.
Thirty-four per cent of the 15- to 16-year-old age group are now still in full¬
time education at maintained schools or technical colleges, and over 16 per
cent of the 16- to 17-year-old age group.
In Northern Ireland there are grammar schools, secondary intermediate
schools, which are the equivalent of the secondary modern schools in England
and Wales, and technical intermediate schools, which offer the same facilities
as secondary technical schools in England and Wales.
Scottish secondary schools fall into two main categories, those providing
courses extending normally to three years, generally called junior secondary
schools, and those providing courses of four, five or six years, known as senior
secondary schools. In each type of school the courses are intended to provide
a general education, but they are differentiated in character to suit the varying
needs and abilities of the pupils, and include literary, commercial, boys’
technical, domestic and rural courses. While some schools are purely junior
i66
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Special Schools
Independent
Schools
secondary and some purely senior secondary, there are also many schools of
the comprehensive type, traditional in Scotland, in which all kinds of courses,
both junior secondary and senior secondary, are provided. Over one-third
of all pupils go on to senior secondary courses on reaching secondary school age.
Promotion from the primary to the secondary school takes place usually
between the ages of 11|- and I2|. The fitness of pupils to profit from the various
types of secondary course is assessed on the basis of teachers’ estimates of
attainment, intelligence tests, and attainment tests, with due regard to the
wishes of the parents. There is provision for an appeal to the Secretary of
State for Scotland in the event of a dispute between the education authority
and the parent and also for the reconsideration of original allocations if,
later, transfer to another course appears to be necessary.
Special educational treatment, either in special schools or otherwise, is
provided between the ages of five (or less) and 16 for children who require
it on account of any physical or mental handicap, including maladjustment.
There are about 970 special schools in the United Kingdom, including
hospital schools, day and boarding schools, and boarding homes for handi¬
capped children attending ordinary schools.
In England, Wales and Northern Ireland there are ten categories of
handicapped pupils for whom local education authorities must provide special
educational treatment: blind, partially sighted, deaf, partially deaf, delicate,
educationally subnormal, epileptic, maladjusted, physically handicapped,
and children suffering from speech defects. (There is no separate category
for the delicate in Scotland.)
The largest and most important of the independent schools in Britain are
known as public schools, although not all schools classed as public schools
are independent (those which are not are mostly direct-grant schools) and
public schools form only a minority of all independent schools. (These
schools should not be confused with the State-supported public schools in
Scotland.)
The public school for boys is a characteristic English institution which has
made a notable contribution to English education. Many public schools date
from the sixteenth century, some are older (for example, Winchester, founded
in 1382, and Eton, founded in 1440), and most have some income from
endowments. Each is controlled by its own board of governors. Public
schools have emphasised the importance of character-building, and in these
schools were developed the prefect system, whereby day-to-day discipline is
largely maintained by the pupils themselves, and the house system, whereby
a school is divided into groups of about 50 pupils, each under the care of a
housemaster. The public school is also characterised by a high staffing ratio
and a high proportion of pupils doing advanced work. A public school is
often, although not necessarily, a boarding school; day boys are also taken
at some of them. The usual age of entry to the independent public schools
for boys is 13 and the leaving age about 18. There are some girls’ public
schools modelled to a certain extent on the public schools for boys.
Independent schools also include preparatory schools, many of them
boarding schools, for boys aged from about 8 to 13 years, most of whom are
intending to enter public schools; some similar schools for girls; and a wide
range of other day and boarding schools covering every age group and grade
of education and every variety of educational method. Some of these schools
are owned and managed, often under a trust deed, by independent non-

profit-making bodies. Others are privately owned by proprietors for whom
the running of the school provides a living. All independent schools in England
and Wales must be registered with the Ministry of Education, in Scotland
with the Registrar of Independent Schools and in Northern Ireland with its
Ministry of Education.
There is no national leaving examination in England or Wales, but secondary
school pupils and candidates not attending school may take an examination
known as the General Certificate of Education (GCE). This examination,
which is on a single subject and not a grouped subject basis (i.e. no subject
is obligatory and individual subjects may be taken at different times), is
conducted at ‘ordinary’ and ‘advanced’ levels. Most candidates for the ordinary
level are about 16 years of age, although many take it earlier, at the discretion
of their head teacher. Most grammar school pupils and an increasing number
from other secondary schools take the ordinary examination, and passes in
various subjects are widely accepted for entry to courses of vocational training.
The advanced examination is at university entrance level (supplemented,
since 1963, by special papers to help university authorities in selecting
students) and is accepted also for purposes of entry to many forms of pro¬
fessional training. From 1965 pupils who have completed five years’ secondary
education but who are not taking GCE may take the Certificate of Secondary
Education examination; this will be on a single subject basis and will be
controlled by teachers serving in the schools providing candidates.
In Scotland courses in senior secondary schools lead to examinations
conducted by the Scottish Education Department. School pupils in the fourth
year of secondary courses sit an examination at 16 years for the award of
passes on the Ordinary grade of the Scottish Certificate of Education, and
pupils in the fifth year can obtain passes on the Higher grade of the Scottish
Certificate of Education. Examinations at both grades are open to candidates
who have left school.
In Northern Ireland candidates may take the GCE, as in England and
Wales, or examinations based on group subjects: the Junior Certificate
Examination, at about the age of 14 and the Senior Certificate Examination,
at about the age of 17.
Teachers are appointed by local education authorities or school governing
bodies or managers. In 1962 there was on average one full-time teacher to
25 pupils in publicly maintained primary and secondary schools in the United
Kingdom. The high birth rate after the second world war is the chief of
several factors in the present need for more teachers and, as more teachers
enter the profession, the Government’s first aim in educational improvements
is to reduce the size of over-large classes to the statutory maxima, which in
England and Wales are 40 for a primary and 30 for a secondary school.
There are 165 teacher-training colleges in England and Wales (excluding
the university departments of education); in the academic year 1962-63
there were over 48,000 students in these colleges and the number is expected
to rise to 80,000 by 1970-71; many colleges are being extended and several
new ones are to be built. Until recently the usual training course has lasted
for two years, with three-year courses for women taking housecraft or
physical education, but the ordinary course was extended to three years in
September i960. The courses are generally residential but since i960 eight
colleges have been opened for ‘day’ students only, with the object of attracting
students, often older than average, whose domestic responsibilities would
i68
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Broadcasting
and Visual Aids
prevent their living in college. There are 24 university departments of
education providing a one-year course for graduates. In Scotland all teacher
training is provided in four general colleges of education, two denominational
colleges and a college for training women teachers of physical education.
Courses are normally of one year’s duration for graduates or the equivalent,
and of three years for non-graduates. During 1962-63 there were over 6,100
students in these colleges and a programme of extension and new building
has been started to relieve pressure on accommodation. Northern Ireland
has three general teachers’ training colleges, one university training depart¬
ment and three specialist colleges—one for training teachers of physical
education, one for teachers of domestic science and one for teachers of art.
The basic course in the general training colleges lasts three years. The
education departments, the universities, local education authorities and other
bodies provide a variety of short courses for practising teachers.
There are national salary scales for teachers in schools and other educational
institutions maintained from public funds in England and Wales, in Scotland,
and in Northern Ireland; and these scales influence the salaries paid to
teachers in independent schools. There are also national superannuation
schemes which are administered by the central departments.
In England and Wales agreed salary scales are submitted to the Minister of
Education by joint committees of representatives of local education authorities’
and teachers’ associations. The best known of these committees are the
Burnham Committees1 dealing with the salaries of teachers in primary and
secondary schools and in establishments of further education. The Minister
can accept or reject (but not modify) the committees’ recommendations and
make the approved scales mandatory on local education authorities. The
Secretary of State for Scotland can modify the recommendations he receives
from the Scottish negotiating body.
Over 2,500 teachers leave Britain annually for posts in schools, teacher¬
training colleges, technical colleges and universities in other parts of the
Commonwealth, including 700 who go to serve in the developing countries
of the Commonwealth. Steps taken by the Government to encourage teachers
to serve for a period overseas have included the establishment of a National
Council for the Supply of Teachers Overseas and a Committee for University
Secondment and the introduction of special measures to safeguard teachers’
interests both while abroad and on their return home.
Interchange schemes, under which teachers in Britain exchange posts for
a year with teachers overseas, include one with the United States and another
with Commonwealth countries, whereby each year over 100 British teachers
exchange posts with teachers from Canada, Australia, and New Zealand.
Official exchange schemes also operate between Britain and several European
countries both for teachers and for temporary assistants’ posts for language
specialists.
The School Broadcasting Department of the British Broadcasting Corporation
sends out 60 sound transmissions a week which reach more than 29,000
schools in the United Kingdom, over 70 per cent of the possible total.
Television broadcasts to schools were begun in 1957 by both the British
Broadcasting Corporation and Associated Rediffusion Limited. In June 1963
over 5,000 schools were equipped to receive the television programmes.

The BBC broadcasts 13 television series a week to schools and, with repeat
broadcasts, a total of 30 transmissions each week; programmes are also
produced by four of the independent television companies (Associated
Rediffusion, Granada, Associated Television and Scottish Television) and
broadcast by the others. Neither sound nor television broadcasting attempts
to cover the whole school curriculum or to replace the teacher; the purpose
is to supplement existing work in the schools. Other visual aids to education-
films, film strips, wall charts, pictures, and models—are being used in¬
creasingly in Britain’s schools.
Since the autumn of 1962 the BBC has broadcast special sound and tele¬
vision programmes for students taking general courses at technical colleges and
colleges of further education. Early in 1963 educational programmes for adults
were introduced by the BBC and two of the independent television companies.
In England and Wales all children in county or voluntary schools receive
religious instruction and take part in a daily corporate act of worship unless
their parents object. In county schools, and in certain circumstances in
voluntary schools, religious instruction of an undenominational Christian
character is given. In all kinds of voluntary school there is opportunity for
denominational instruction. In county schools in Northern Ireland clergy
have a right of access to give religious instruction to children of their denom¬
ination for a limited period each week. In Scotland, subject to safeguards
for the individual conscience, matters relating to religious instruction are in
the hands of the school managers, but there are a number of denominational
schools conducted by education authorities.
Services in the school chapel and religious teaching are an essential part
of the life and education of the independent public schools and at most of
these schools conform to the teaching of a particular church (in the majority
of cases, Anglican).
Physical education, including organised games, is a part of the curriculum
of all schools.
The School Health Service provides regular medical examination and
certain free treatment for all children attending schools maintained by local
education authorities. Treatment facilities include dental clinics and child
guidance centres. (There are also child guidance clinics in the National
Health Service.) In Northern Ireland the School Health Service is operated
by the health authorities.
Milk (normally one-third of a pint a day) is given free to all school children
who wish to have it, and the School Meals Service provides a daily dinner at
a subsidised price (remitted where there is need) to just over half the pupils
in county and voluntary schools. Education authorities have power to provide
free transport for children who live more than a reasonable distance from
the schools which they attend; this distance is defined as two miles for those
under eight years and three miles for those over eight years (11 years in
Northern Ireland).
Local education authorities are responsible for providing the schools and
other buildings needed for public education in their areas. The central
departments exercise control by approving annual building programmes,
framing regulations, fixing cost limits and approving or rejecting the authori¬
ties’ plans; they also offer guidance to authorities by means of building
bulletins and in other ways.

An extensive building programme for education has been undertaken in
Britain since 1947. Many war-damaged schools had to be repaired or rebuilt.
Entirely new schools, both primary and secondary, were needed to provide
for the increased number of children of school age, for the many post-war
housing estates and for the new towns; new buildings were also needed to
replace or improve those which were out of date and ill-equipped by modern
standards. In 1959 the Government announced a school building programme
for the five years 1960-65 amounting in value to about £300 million in England
and Wales and £65 million in Scotland. By the spring of 1963 over 6,000
new post-war schools had been completed in England and Wales, over 700
more were under construction, and extensions had been made to a very large
number of existing schools. In Scotland 52 new schools were completed in
1962 and 54 were under construction. In Northern Ireland 389 post-war
schools had been completed by the end of 1962.
To help voluntary schools to keep pace with county schools in the standard
of their buildings, the Education Act, 1959, raised the rate of grant for
alterations, improvements and external repairs to 75 per cent of the approved
cost. With a few exceptions, the schools affected are Church of England or
Roman Catholic aided schools. Grants may also be made for building new
aided secondary schools needed for children from aided primary schools
which existed on 15th June, 1959. Similar provisions for grants of 65 per cent
of the approved costs of voluntary schools’ building and repairs have existed
in Northern Ireland since 1948.
Advantage is being taken of the opportunity afforded by the extensive
school building programme to introduce new ideas and methods in the
design and construction of schools. Several education authorities have
successfully developed systems employing prefabricated structures and
component parts. New schools are light and airy, with an imaginative use
of colour and generous provision of practical rooms and space for outdoor
games.
UNIVERSITIES There are 27 universities in the United Kingdom: 21 in England, four in
Scotland,1 the University of Wales, and the Queen’s University of Belfast in
Northern Ireland.
The English universities are: Birmingham, Bristol, Cambridge, Durham,
Exeter, Hull, Keele, Leeds, Leicester, Liverpool, London, Manchester,
Newcastle upon Tyne, Nottingham, Oxford, Reading, Sheffield, South¬
ampton, and the new Universities of Sussex, at Brighton (opened in October
1961), of York and of East Anglia, at Norwich (both opened in 1963). The
only other degree-giving institution (in Arts and Theology) is St. David’s
College at Lampeter, Wales. Plans have been approved for the establishment
of the Universities of Warwick (at Coventry) Kent (at Canterbury) Essex (at
Colchester) and the North West (at Lancaster); they hope to open in 1964.
The Universities of Oxford and Cambridge date from the twelfth and
thirteenth centuries, and the Scottish Universities of St. Andrews, Glasgow,
Aberdeen and Edinburgh from the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries. All the
other universities were founded in the nineteenth or twentieth centuries.
The Universities of Oxford and Cambridge are each composed of a number
of residential colleges. These colleges are corporate bodies governed by their
own Fellows and distinct from the university. Most of the Fellows of the

Government approval for full university status and is now applying for a Royal Charter.

colleges are university teachers or officers and the majority of university
teachers are also Fellows of colleges. The universities, as distinct from the
colleges, own the main libraries, laboratories, and other buildings used for
teaching and research.
The other universities in Britain are in the main non-residential and most
are non-collegiate. Those composed of groups of largely autonomous colleges
are London, which, with over 20,000 students, is by far the largest of Britain’s
universities, Durham, and St. Andrews, which consists of colleges in
St. Andrews itself and in Dundee. The University of Wales comprises the
University Colleges of Aberystwyth, Bangor, Cardiff and Swansea, and the
Welsh National School of Medicine at Cardiff.
The education departments have no jurisdiction over the universities, and
their relations with them are concerned mainly with the training of school
teachers, the provision of extra-mural education, and the award of scholar¬
ships from public funds. The universities receive aid from the State mainly
in the form of direct grants, in Great Britain from the Treasury and in Northern
Ireland from the Ministry of Finance, made on the advice of the University
Grants Committee, a committee appointed by the Chancellor of the Ex¬
chequer from people with wide experience of schools and universities, or
experience in industry.
The proportion of university income provided by the Exchequer is in¬
creasing and in 1961—62 was 70*5 cent for Great Britain. Another 2-1 per
cent was contributed by local authorities, 9 per cent by fees, and the
balance by endowments and other sources. Expenditure from public funds
on the universities, including capital grants and awards to university students,
has more than doubled in the past five years to over ^121 million in 1962-63.
It is expected to rise to over £165 million in 1966-67.
Admission to the universities is by examination and selection; there is no
religious test and no colour bar. Women are admitted on equal terms with
men, but at Cambridge their numbers are limited by statute. The general
proportion of men to women students is three to one; at Oxford it is six to
one, and at Cambridge ten to one.
Despite recent expansion programmes, applications for places at universities
still exceed the number available. In 1963 a ‘clearing house’ scheme to
simplify university entrance came fully into operation with applications for
admission in October 1964. Prospective candidates apply for places through
the Universities Central Council on Admissions instead of to individual
universities and the ‘clearing house’ automatically passes on rejected appli¬
cations to the next university of the candidate’s choice. The colleges of
Oxford and Cambridge, the medical and dental schools of London University,
and the Universities of St. Andrews, Glasgow, Aberdeen and Belfast are not
participating in the ‘clearing house’; the procedure for entry to Oxford and
Cambridge colleges is, however, being simplified.
At the beginning of the academic year 1962-63 there were 121,000 full-time
university students in the United Kingdom. This total, more than double
the pre-war figure, is to be still further expanded (see p. 172).
Scholarships and other awards are now very widely available, for it is the
national educational policy that no able boy or girl shall be prevented by
lack of means from taking an advanced course at a university or elsewhere.
About 80 per cent of university students in Great Britain are aided from
public or private funds.

Expansion
In England, Wales and Scotland all British students with certain qualifica¬
tions are eligible (since October 1961) for an award from public funds in
order to attend full-time at a university, teacher-training college or other
major further education establishment. Until 1962 a limited number of
awards were offered by local education authorities (about 76,000 a year) and
by the Ministry of Education (2,000 State scholarships a year). As a result
of the recommendations of the Anderson Committee, which reported in
i960, the award system has been simplified and established on a national
basis; the 1962 Education Act abolished State scholarships and made it the
duty of local education authorities to provide all grants for university students
and students taking comparable courses. In Scotland students’ allowances
for such courses are awarded by the Scottish Education Department. An
award depends upon the income of the student or his parents.
A number of studentships for postgraduate study in arts subjects are
offered annually by the Ministry of Education and the Scottish Education
Department. Postgraduate awards to scientists and technologists are made by
the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research and the Agricultural
and Medical Research Councils; there were nearly 4,000 studentships and
fellowships of this type current in 1962-63.
In Northern Ireland university and further education scholarships, which
may supplement grants from other sources, are awarded by the local
education authorities. Postgraduate awards and teacher-training scholarships
are given by the Ministry of Education.
Courses in arts and science are offered by all universities and at nearly all
universities courses are available in one or more applied sciences. At the
beginning of the academic year 1962-63, 43 per cent of full-time university
students in Great Britain were taking arts courses and 57 per cent were
studying science or technology (including medicine).
University degree courses generally extend over three or four years, though
in medicine five or six years are required. The first degree of Bachelor
(Master in Scotland) is awarded on the completion of such a course, depending
on satisfactory examination results. In most universities an ordinary (or pass)
degree or an honours degree can be taken, although the majority of students
in England and Wales take honours courses. Further study or research is
required at the modern universities for the degree of Master and by all
universities for that of Doctor. Actual degree titles vary according to the
practice of each university; some differentiate between the arts and sciences
and some do not. Diplomas and certificates are awarded after shorter courses
in some subjects.
The tutorial system of individual tuition to supplement the lecture system
is a traditional and valued feature of the Universities of Oxford and Cambridge;
it is now being developed in the other universities and colleges of Britain.
Most members of the academic staffs devote time to research and at all
universities there are postgraduate students engaged in research. There has
been an expansion particularly of research in science and technology in
recent years (see p. 208).
The universities of Britain are expanding rapidly to meet the greatly increased
demand for university education and also the need of a modern democracy
for a highly educated population and the particular need, in a technical age,
for scientists and technologists. The number of full-time students in univer¬
sities in Great Britain is being increased from 117,000 in 1962-63 to 150,000

by 1966-67. It is planned to provide another 20,000 places by 1973-74.
About two-thirds of the additional students who are expected to be in the
universities will be students of science or technology. In Northern Ireland
the number of full-time students increased from 2,392 in 1948-49 to over
4,000 in 1962-63.
An extensive building programme is in progress to provide for the increased
number of students. Building projects in Great Britain to the value of
£109 million were begun in the six-year period 1958-63, and universities
have been authorised to make further plans on the basis of projects to the
value of £33 million to start in each of the years 1964 and 1965. These
figures exclude the expansion of the Imperial College of Science and Tech¬
nology in the University of London which is costing over £15 million. These
amounts, together with additional sums for the purchase of sites and
properties, for professional fees and for the provision of equipment for new
buildings, are met from Exchequer funds administered by the University
Grants Committee. Further sums are raised by the universities themselves.
Of the major projects included in the annual programmes for the period
1960-63 about 56 per cent of expenditure is for buildings to accommodate
teaching and research in the various faculties, including about 44 per cent
for science subjects and technology. The remaining 44 per cent is for general
service buildings, such as halls of residence, student unions, refectories and
libraries.
In Northern Ireland over £2 million was spent on building projects
between 1955 and 1962 and further expansion at the rate of £750,000 a year
is planned.
Outside the universities there is a great variety of further education, full-time
and part-time, for those of all ages who have left school. Local education
authorities are required to secure such provision either directly or by aiding
voluntary bodies and institutions. Vocational and non-vocational courses at
all levels and in all subjects are available in technical, commercial and art
colleges1 and in agricultural and evening institutes. These courses may lead
to a wide variety of qualifications ranging from external university degrees
and the highest technological awards to craftsmen’s certificates, or they may
offer opportunities for pursuing leisure-time interests. In the year 1962-63
there were some 158,000 full-time students at the technical and commercial
colleges (excluding art colleges and agricultural institutes) in the United
Kingdom and about i| million part-time students. Nearly a million other
students attend evening institutes.
Within the field of further education, facilities for technical and technological
education have been greatly expanded recently and the Government is
promoting further development. A five-year programme for the expansion
of technical colleges carried out in 1956-61 provided for an increase of about
half as many again in the number of students completing advanced courses
and increased the numbers released by their employers for part-time courses
during the day. The cost of the programme for buildings and equipment
during this period was nearly £100 million, comprising £70 million spent
on buildings and £15 million on equipment in England and Wales, and
£10 million for buildings and £2 million for equipment in Scotland. A further
£15 million a year in England and Wales and £2 million in Scotland is

being spent on buildings for technical education in each of the three years
from 1961 to 1964. The expansion of advanced courses of further education
is being helped by sharing the cost among all local education authorities.
The Government is gradually implementing measures for a major reorganisa¬
tion of education in technical colleges in Great Britain, providing for greater
continuity between school and technical college education, a broadening of
technical education and a closer adaptation of the system to the needs of
industry.
The largest group of students attending technical colleges (537,000 in the
United Kingdom in 1961-62) are young employees and apprentices who are
released by employers for study, usually on one day a week; day release
study is often supplemented by attendance at evening classes. A wide variety
of craft courses is available for young workers in various trades and occupa¬
tions, leading to appropriate qualifications at the end of a course of three to
five years. Courses of a more professional character which are suitable for
technicians or for those who aim ultimately at membership of a professional
institution are also provided, leading to the National Certificates approved
by joint committees representative of the education departments and the
appropriate professional body (for example, the Institution of Mechanical
Engineers). Such courses are normally at two levels, ordinary and higher.
Under schemes now being worked out most courses for the Ordinary Certificate
are to last two years and students usually follow them between the ages of
16 and 19. The Higher Certificate requires a further two years’ part-time
study and is generally considered to reach a level corresponding to a pass
degree in the subject concerned.
Full-time courses are taken by large numbers of younger students who
leave school to enter secretarial or clerical work and also as an introduction
to apprenticeship. But the most important group of full-time students are
those following advanced courses leading to an external degree of the
University of London, to the Higher National Diploma (awarded by joint
committees in the same way as the Higher National Certificates) or to the
Diploma in Technology (a national qualification first awarded in 1958)* The
Diploma in Technology (Dip. Tech.) is granted on the successful completion
of an approved course in a technical college and is equivalent in standard to
a university honours degree. It is administered by the National Council for
Technological Awards, an autonomous body set up by the Minister of
Education in 1955. The council has also instituted an award higher than the
diploma—Membership of the College of Technologists (MCT).
The form of advanced full-time course which is rapidly gaining favour is
the ‘sandwich course’. This lasts from three to five years and consists of
periods usually of three or six months spent alternately in studying full-time
in a technical college and in gaining practical experience in industry; the
majority of Diploma in Technology courses are sandwich courses. In the
academic year 1962-63 there were some 16,000 sandwich course students.
It is through a major increase in the number of students taking sandwich
courses that the technical colleges are expected to achieve a 50 per cent
increase in the output of advanced students.
There is a growing demand in technical colleges for courses of postgraduate
standard, whether in technical subjects or in management studies, for
students who have already obtained a first degree, a diploma, or a Higher
National Certificate. A wide range of advanced short courses of a very
specialised nature is also offered for senior technical staffs engaged in
industry.
EDUCATION
175
There is great flexibility in the arrangement of technical courses. As a
result, young people can start them at various ages on leaving school and can
attain the highest qualification to which their abilities entitle them.
At present, in England and Wales there are 432 technical colleges (other
than art colleges) that provide for full-time students, besides 162 others
which take part-time students only. The colleges vary greatly in size, range
of subjects, level of work and type of course. The largest has a total of some
14,000 students on the roll. The large colleges usually offer a wide variety
of subjects, covering the basic technologies and the fundamental sciences.
Colleges are organised in four broad groups:
(1) Local Colleges (350), providing mainly part-time courses, some (lasting
two to five years) leading directly to craftsman and technician qualifica¬
tions such as Ordinary National Certificates and City and Guilds of
London Institute Certificates;
(2) Area Colleges (165), providing also some advanced courses from two to
four years in duration for students starting at 18 or 19 years of age,
and leading to Higher National Certificates and Diplomas;
(3) Regional Colleges (25), covering wider areas than the local and area
colleges, and doing a substantial amount of advanced work, including
full-time and sandwich courses; and
(4) Colleges of Advanced Technology (10), concentrating entirely on advanced
work, including postgraduate and research work. They comprise the
following: the Birmingham College of Technology; the Bradford
Institute of Technology; the Welsh College of Advanced Technology,
Cardiff; Loughborough College of Technology; the Royal College of
Advanced Technology, Salford; the Bristol College of Technology;
and, in London, the Battersea, Brunei, Chelsea and Northampton
Colleges of Advanced Technology.
There are also six National Colleges, which have been established to provide
advanced courses for the particularly specialised techniques of certain
industries. These include colleges such as those for Rubber Technology and
Food Technology and the National Foundry College; they are managed
by independent bodies and receive grants directly from the Ministry of
Education.
Scotland has 16 Central Institutions for further education, of which seven
are technical colleges. Six of these have full-time courses leading to their
own diploma or associateship and in some the greater part of the work is
full-time. The full-time courses are of three or four years’ duration and
comparable in scope and standard to university degree courses. There are
close ties between the central institutions and the universities. The central
institutions, working on a regional basis, are supported by some 80 local
technical colleges, offering full-time and part-time day courses, and by
evening classes at local centres. Twenty-four new colleges are expected to
open in the early 1960s; of these, six had been opened by July 1963.
In Northern Ireland the system of technical education is similar to that
in England and Wales and includes courses leading to National Certificates.
The Ministry of Education for Northern Ireland awards junior and senior
trade scholarships to apprentices, to enable them to follow full-time courses
of study at the Belfast College of Technology and the Lisburn Technical
College. The junior course lasts five months and the senior course eight
months.
176
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Most of the technical colleges and other further education establishments
in the United Kingdom are either maintained or aided from public funds.
Tuition fees are therefore moderate, and often nominal for young people
under 18 years of age. Many full-time students are helped by awards from
local education authorities. The awards are generally based on the results of
the General Certificate of Education or a corresponding examination; they
are assessed to cover tuition fees and a maintenance grant, but parents who
can afford to contribute towards the cost are required to do so. There are
also some scholarships available from endowments, and others are awarded
under schemes organised by particular industries or companies for the most
promising of their young workers.
Commercial Commercial education is provided in local authority commercial and technical
and colleges, in independent colleges and by bodies organising correspondence
Management courses. More than half the candidates taking professional examinations in
Education commercial subjects do so through correspondence courses.
Until recently provision for commercial education was almost entirely by
part-time evening courses, few of which were above intermediate level. In
line with recent developments in other spheres of technical education, in
1962 new commercial courses were introduced in technical and commercial
colleges in England, Wales and Northern Ireland. These lead to the Ordinary
and Higher National Certificate in Business Studies; a more advanced course
for full-time or sandwich course students leads to a new qualification, the
Higher National Diploma in Business Studies, which is equivalent in standard
to a university pass degree. The Scottish Council for Commercial Education
awards senior and advanced commercial certificates to students aiming at a
professional career in commerce. In 1963 a Certificate in Office Studies for
young entrants to clerical and other non-technical posts was introduced in
England, Wales and Scotland.
Management studies are provided by universities and technical colleges,
by individual companies or by trade and industrial federations. Certain
independent colleges specialise in management training. Several universities
have introduced business studies into the curriculum and throughout the
country over 100 technical colleges provide courses under the schemes
administered jointly by the British Institute of Management and the education
departments. In 1961 a postgraduate Diploma in Management Studies was
introduced into technical colleges. In Scotland courses leading to the
Certificate of Business Administration are provided for students in junior
supervisory positions. In Northern Ireland also there is a Diploma in
Management Studies.
An Advisory Council on Management Education for the United Kingdom
was established in 1961 to keep under review provision for management
education and to advise interested bodies.
Adult Education Adult education (non-vocational study, outside the universities, for those who
have left school) is organised by local education authorities (sometimes in
association with voluntary bodies) in evening institutes, schools of art, adult
education centres, community centres and youth clubs. Many of the classes
are practical, but there are also wide opportunities for academic study at all
levels. Voluntary organisations, such as the National Federation of Women s
Institutes and the National Union of Townswomen’s Guilds, offer courses
in handicrafts and other subjects to their members; the local education
authorities usually supply the teachers.

In general, courses at the highest levels in arts subjects are provided by
the extra-mural departments of the universities, many of which have full¬
time staff appointed for this purpose and can call on the services of other
members of the university staff; by the Workers’ Educational Association,
which also employs organising tutors and in many regions works in close
collaboration with the university extra-mural departments; and by other
voluntary bodies. In 1961-62, 210,000 students in England and Wales
attended such courses, which are grant-aided directly by the Ministry of
Education and, in many cases, are assisted financially and in other ways by
local education authorities; 4,000 students attended similar courses in
Northern Ireland.
Voluntary bodies with a particular viewpoint, such as the National
Council of Labour Colleges and the Co-operative Union, also organise adult
education courses without grant-aid. Six residential colleges (five in England
and Wales and one in Scotland) directly aided by the education departments
offer one-year or two-year cultural, non-vocational courses for adult students.
In addition, there are about 30 other residential colleges where students can
take short courses of a similar kind lasting for a few days or a few weeks.
These are maintained or aided by local education authorities.
The National Institute of Adult Education provides in London a centre
of information and research for adult education, as well as a channel of
co-operation and consultation for the many organisations in England and
Wales which are interested in the subject. It is assisted by a grant from the
Ministry of Education. There is a corresponding body in Scotland, the
Scottish Institute of Adult Education.
Local education authorities can provide community centres for urban areas;
these centres normally supply facilities for both vocational and non-vocational
classes for the further education of young people and adults. The centres
are usually managed by community associations, many of which are affiliated
to the National Federation of Community Associations. Similar classes in
rural areas are held in village halls and a variety of other premises by local
education authorities and voluntary bodies; in Cambridgeshire there are eleven
‘village colleges’, which combine facilities for secondary and adult education,
and similar ‘colleges’ have been opened in Leicestershire, Peterborough and
Derbyshire.
Financial assistance is given by the education departments to local voluntary
organisations towards the capital cost of community centres, village halls,
playing fields and similar facilities for social and physical recreation for adults.
Opportunities for students from overseas to come to Britain to study in
IN universities or other educational institutions have increased greatly during
the last few years. In 1963 there were about 64,000 overseas students in
Britain, of whom about one-quarter were at universities, another quarter
at technical colleges and the remainder training as teachers, doctors and
nurses, for the law, or in industry. Some two-thirds of all overseas students
were from the Commonwealth.
A wide range of public and private fellowships and scholarships for advanced
study in Britain are awarded annually to students and research workers
from other Commonwealth countries. Under the Commonwealth Scholarship
and Fellowship Plan, the Governments of certain Commonwealth countries
have made awards available to men and women from other Commonwealth
countries at universities, colleges and other institutions of higher learning in
the country of offer. The British Government has allocated nearly £3! million
i78

Students
for the five-year period 1960—65 to enable an average of 500 of these scholar¬
ships to be held in Britain at any time; and for some 400 teachers and others
to train in Britain under the Commonwealth Bursary Scheme. An example of
smaller schemes is the Athlone Fellowship Scheme, under which the British
Government awards 41 fellowships a year to engineering graduates in
Canada for up to two years’ further study, training and research in institutions
or industries in Britain.
About 400 British Council1 scholarships, tenable usually for one year in
the United Kingdom, are offered annually to graduates of overseas universities.
Twenty-four Marshall Scholarships for study at any university in Britain are
offered annually by the British Government to graduates from the United
States of America and over 60 Rhodes Scholarships are awarded annually to
Commonwealth and United States graduates for two years of study at the
University of Oxford. Other universities and colleges themselves offer many
scholarships for which graduate students of any nationality are eligible.
Fellowships and training awards for study in British institutions are
available under the Central Treaty Organisation, the Foundation for Mutual
Assistance in Africa (South of the Sahara) and the British Technical Assistance
Programmes for Ghana, Nigeria, Sierra Leone and Tanganyika. Large
numbers of awards for study or training in Britain are made under the
United Nations Programmes of Technical Assistance and the Colombo Plan.
The Commonwealth Education Liaison Unit, set up after the Common¬
wealth Education Conference of 1959, supplements normal direct dealings
on education between the countries of the Commonwealth.
Responsibility for overseas students in Britain rests with the institutions of
higher education to which they are attached and with the students’ own
national representatives in Britain (High Commissions or Embassies). The
British Council, by agreement with various Governments, acts as agent for
the overseas departments of the British Government on matters affecting
students’ welfare.
Students from overseas are given many opportunities to get to know more
of Britain in their leisure time and to make friends with British people. The
British Council offers a wide range of activities. The Council has overseas
students’ centres in London and in other university cities, which organise
a varied programme of lectures, discussions and social and other activities.
Many British people like to invite students to their homes and the British
Council arranges introductions. In the vacations there are courses in many
parts of the country which offer opportunities for getting to know more
about British life in town and country. In term time there are visits to various
places of interest, and theatre and concert parties are arranged. The British
Council assists many students to find accommodation and about 10,000 are
met annually on arrival and helped to settle down quickly in their new
environment. In 1961 the Government allocated ^3 rnillion for the provision

countries. It was founded in 1934 and was granted a Royal Charter in 1940. Nine of the
30 members of its executive committee are nominated by Government departments,
it is financed mainly from public funds. It is usually designated as the Government s
principal instrument for the implementation of cultural conventions to which Britain
is a party. The Council maintains staffs who, in some 80 overseas countries, foster
English studies, provide regular information on British life and thought and promote
knowledge of the educational, scientific, literary, artistic and other British developments
and achievements. It arranges study programmes in Britain for scholars, teachers and
other professional visitors from overseas.

of about 5,000 hostel places and other amenities for overseas students in
Britain.
Among many voluntary organisations which offer a welcome to overseas
students are the East and West Friendship Council, Rotary, Round Table,
the Victoria League, the Royal Over-Seas League, the Royal Commonwealth
Society, the National Union of Students, the English-Speaking Union and
Churches of all denominations. The London Conference on Overseas
Students, for which the British Council provides the secretariat, co-ordinates
their work in the metropolis. In some London boroughs there are committees
which help students to make contact with local residents and organisations.
Similar conferences have come into being in other large cities in Britain.
Under the Commonwealth Scholarship and Fellowship Plan, a number of
scholarships are made available annually to United Kingdom students by the
governments of other Commonwealth countries for study in their universities,
colleges and other institutions of higher learning. At present Commonwealth
Scholarships are being held by United Kingdom students in Australia,
Canada, East Africa, Hong Kong, India, Malaya, New Zealand, Nigeria,
Nyasaland, Northern and Southern Rhodesia and Pakistan.
For many years the United States has offered awards for British students,
the best known being the Fulbright travel grants for postgraduate study at
American universities. Students of British nationality are also offered
scholarships (mostly for one academic year) at institutions of higher education
in 20 European countries including the USSR, and in Brazil, Indonesia,
Iran, Israel and Japan. In 18 countries surveyed by UNESCO {Study
Abroad, 1963) there were some 3,000 students from Britain at institutes of
higher education.
YOUTH SERVICE
The object of the youth service in Britain is to provide for the leisure-time
activities of young people under 21 years of age, and to offer them opportuni¬
ties—complementary to those of home, formal education and work—for
discovering and developing their personal resources, so that they may be
better equipped to be responsible members of the community. Membership
of youth organisations is voluntary and the facilities they offer are sufficiently
varied to appeal to every type of boy and girl.
Responsibility for youth service in the United Kingdom is shared by the
education departments, local education authorities, voluntary organisations
and the Churches. There is no attempt to impose uniformity or to create
any national youth organisation. A number of youth organisations have
spontaneously developed over the last century, mainly by voluntary effort.
Between the two world wars, some of the local education authorities tried
to help and co-ordinate voluntary work in their areas through Juvenile
Organisations Committees; in the 1930s the State also began to promote
social and physical training and recreation and in 1939 brought into being
what is now called the Youth Service as a partnership of voluntary organisa¬
tions, local authorities and central Government.
The status of youth service as an essential part of the educational system
of Great Britain was confirmed by the Education Act of 1944 and the
Education (Scotland) Act of 1945; in Northern Ireland, youth welfare work

BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
is promoted under the Physical Training and Recreation Act of i93^> and
the Youth Welfare, Physical Training and Recreation Act of 1962.
The education departments provide grants in aid of the administrative
and training work of national voluntary youth organisations, towards the
expense of training full-time youth leaders and towards the cost of premises
and equipment of youth clubs provided by voluntary bodies.
Local education authorities co-operate with voluntary organisations in
their areas: most give some financial help and lend premises and equipment;
most also employ youth organisers to help in the promotion and encourage¬
ment of youth work. Where voluntary services are considered inadequate,
local authorities themselves organise youth centres and clubs. Most local
authorities have appointed youth committees on which official and voluntary
bodies are represented.
In addition to grants received from the State and local authorities, voluntary
organisations may receive help for special projects1 from charitable trusts,
notably from the King George’s Jubilee Trust (see p. 182). The greater
part of the funds of the voluntary organisations is, however, raised by their
own efforts.
Since i960 developments in the youth service have been greatly influenced
by the recommendations of a committee set up to examine the service, under
the chairmanship of the Countess of Albemarle.2 On the advice of the newly
formed Youth Service Development Council, the Ministry of Education has
made larger grants towards the headquarters expenses of national voluntary
youth organisations and special grants for voluntary projects, some of which
are experimental; has authorised a building programme for the period 1960-63
at an estimated cost of ^7 million; and, to supplement existing facilities,
has established a national training college at Leicester for youth leaders.
The Albemarle Committee’s inquiry extended only to England and Wales,
youth provision in Scotland having already been the subject of reports by
advisory bodies; but some of its main recommendations applied to Scotland,
while others reflected the existing Scottish position. A Standing Consultative
Council on Youth Service in Scotland, with functions similar to those of the
Youth Service Development Council for England and Wales, was set up by
the Secretary of State for Scotland in December 1959. In 1963 permanent
arrangements for training in youth leadership for full-time youth leaders and
organisers were made. Two types of course are available: a two-year basic
training course and a two-term course for those already having certain
prescribed qualifications for the work. More money is being made available from
central funds to national voluntary organisations in Scotland and, as in England
and Wales, increased expenditure on youth services by Scottish education
authorities is taken into account in calculating the Exchequer general grant.
A White Paper on the development of the Youth Service was presented
to the Northern Ireland Parliament in 1961. This did not propose any change
in the general pattern of the Youth Service but local education authorities
were urged to take a more active part in youth work than they had previously
done. Such changes as required statutory authority were given effect in the
Youth Welfare, Physical Training and Recreation Act (Northern Ireland),
1962. The functions of the Youth Committee, which was set up in Northern
Ireland in 1944, were taken over by the Youth and Sports Council and
1 During the years 1953-60 the King George VI Foundation distributed nearly
£1'2 million for projects from the memorial fund in remembrance of the King.

extended to reflect the larger part to be played in youth welfare by the local
education authorities and sports organisations.
The voluntary organisations vary greatly in character since nearly all of them
were formed to serve specific groups of young people, but most of them
provide educational and religious activities as well as social and recreational
pursuits for their members, and all of them seek to inculcate high ideals of
personal conduct and service to the community.
Twenty-seven national voluntary youth organisations with memberships
of at least 10,000 are constituent members of the Standing Conference of
National Voluntary Youth Organisations, a consultative body which takes
action only in the name of its member bodies and with their consent. A
further 22 bodies are associate or observer members, for example, the Church
of England Youth Council, which represents some 200,000 young people who
are members of clubs sponsored by the Church of England. The corresponding
body in Scotland is the Scottish Standing Conference of Voluntary Youth
Organisations, in Northern Ireland the Standing Conference of Youth Organisa¬
tions, and in Wales the Standing Conference for Wales of Voluntary Youth
Organisations.
These major organisations have a total United Kingdom membership of
nearly 3 million young people under 21.
Among the youth organisations with a mainly religious origin and purpose
are the Young Men’s Christian Association (YMCA) and Young Women’s
Christian Association (YWCA), with approximately 36,000 and 20,500
members under 21 respectively; the Boys’ Brigade (164,000), the Church
Lads’ Brigade (16,000), the Girls’ Life Brigade (64,000), the Girls’ Friendly
Society (23,000), Girls’ Guildry (33,000), the Methodist Association of
Youth Clubs (172,000), the Salvation Army Youth Organisations (67,000),
the Catholic Young Men’s Society of Great Britain (25,000), the National
Federation of Catholic Youth Clubs (35,000). the Young Christian Workers
(17,000), the Grail (13,000). and the Association of Jewish Youth (15,000).
The Boy Scouts Association and Girl Guides Association have world-wide
affiliations; they are undenominational and non-political, and were founded
by Lord Baden-Powell in 1908 and 1910 to develop character and good
citizenship in boys and girls. They have various sections, based on age
groups, but most of their members are under 16 years. Their total United
Kingdom membership is about 518,000 scouts and 530,000 guides.
The National Association of Boys’ Clubs, with over 2,000 affiliated clubs
and 149,000 members, and the National Association of Youth Clubs, with
over 2,500 affiliated clubs and 163,000 members, are concerned mainly with
the 14 to 20 age-group. Each affiliated club has its own rules, but all try to
give their members opportunities to take part in physical, mental and social
activities, to develop their capacities and grow to maturity as individuals and
members of society. Representatives from clubs form local committees and
these send representatives to the national members’ councils.
The National Association of Training Corps for Girls, with about 8,000
members, comprises the Girls’ Training Corps, the Women’s Junior Air
Corps and the Girls’ Nautical Training Corps; all wear uniform and formal
discipline is encouraged. The pre-Service organisations for boys (the Com¬
bined Cadet Force, Sea Cadet Corps, Army Cadet Force and Air Training
Corps), combine social, educational and physical development with training
for possible entry into the armed forces; their combined membership is
about 170,000.
jg2 BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
The National Federation of Young Farmers’ Clubs in England and Wales
has nearly 38,000 members between 10 and 25 years old, the Scottish
Association of Young Farmers’ Clubs has nearly 7,000 and Northern Ireland
Young Farmer Clubs over 5,500 members: in addition to encouraging
interest in agriculture and appreciation of country life, the clubs provide
training in the arts of citizenship and develop ability to serve the community.
The Welsh League of Youth (Urdd Gobaith Cymru) has a membership
of about 48,000; its aim is the ‘development of Christian citizenship among
the youth of Wales’, and its work takes full account of the Welsh background
of its members.
The Youth Hostels Associations in England and Wales, Scotland and
Northern Ireland have a network of hostels for walkers and cyclists, particu¬
larly intended for young people of limited means. They seek to promote
knowledge and love of the countryside, and are closely linked with each other
and with similar organisations in other countries.
Adult organisations with youth sections include the British Red Cross
Society, St. John Ambulance Brigade and the political parties.
Other King George's Jubilee Trust was established in 1935 by King George V, to
Organisations promote the welfare of the younger generation. The trust fund originally
Concerned with consisted of the nation’s gift of approximately million, subscribed to mark
Youth Work the King’s silver jubilee; the income has since been augmented by gifts,
legacies and the Trust’s own appeal in 1960-61 (marking 25 years of its
work). The fund, which now stands at £ 1 -4 million, has disbursed ^1-3 million
to the headquarters of the principal voluntary youth organisations and to
many local projects, particularly those of an experimental nature.
The Duke of Edinburgh's Award is a scheme for young people which is
operated by local authorities, schools, youth organisations, industrial firms
and other bodies, and is designed as a challenge to boys and girls to reach
certain standards of achievement in three progressive stages in leisure-time
activities. The scheme for boys between the ages of 14 and 19 covers sections
on public service, expeditions and pursuits and physical fitness. The scheme
for girls between the ages of 14 and 20 is divided into sections on design for
living, interests, and adventure and service.
The Outward Bound Trust maintains five schools for boys which offer
26-day character-building courses, based on adventure and testing experience.
A similar school for girls, with modified courses, opened in the summer of
1963. About 4,500 boys and 850 girls take part each year.
The aims of the Central Council of Physical Recreation, the Scottish Council
of Physical Recreation and the National Playing Fields Association bring them
into touch with many youth organisations: their activities are described in
Chapter 19: Sport.
In addition to organisations on a nation-wide basis, there are a large
number of town, district or village social clubs run by voluntary groups for
general or particular purposes; photographic societies, folk dance, table
tennis or jazz clubs, for instance. In small communities social clubs may not
be specifically for young people but those with the more strenuous activities
(for example, tennis clubs) usually have a high proportion of young people
as members.

PLANNING AND
HOUSING
TOWN AND COUNTRY PLANNING
Britain is one of the most densely populated areas in the world and it is
essential to plan land use if a satisfactory national distribution of employment
and population is to be secured, agriculture safeguarded, the amenities of
the countryside preserved, and the improvement of the places where people
live and work sustained.
From 1909 onwards, successive Acts of Parliament recognised the principle
of the planned use of land, but because the pattern of development over
much of the country had already hardened into large unplanned urban
concentrations the powers granted to planning authorities were inadequate
for the task in hand.
The twenty years between the two world wars were decades of expansion
in industry, engineering, house-building, and motor transport; the population
was increasing and becoming more mobile; there was a general movement
towards better standards of living, and consequently a greater need for
systematic planning than had hitherto been required. At the beginning of the
nineteen-thirties a major effort was made to consolidate and strengthen
planning law and to extend the planning powers of central and local authorities
to the point at which they could exercise effective control. This resulted in
the Town and Country Planning Acts of 1932 which remained the basis of
planning law for fifteen years.
Although inter-war planning legislation improved sanitary and environ¬
mental conditions and did something to preserve amenities, its general effect
was less satisfactory than might have been expected, mainly because it failed
to deal adequately with the problems involved in the payment of compensation
to land and other property owners who stood to lose by the introduction of
positive planning schemes. Local authorities often hesitated to exercise their
powers effectively for fear of being involved in financial liabilities beyond
their means, and as a result there was still much unregulated urban develop¬
ment and spoliation of the countryside.
Renewed efforts to tackle these problems were made immediately before
and during the second world war. Between 1937 and 1942 three expert com¬
mittees were appointed to study and report upon (1) the unregulated growth
and spread of industry, (2) the hampering of planning by the financial and
administrative difficulties of compensation and betterment and (3) the
encroachment of urban development upon the countryside. After the war
other committees studied the question of new towns and national parks.
Almost all the principal planning recommendations of these committees
have now been incorporated in Acts of Parliament, as follows: the New Towns
Acts, 1946 to 1959; the Town and Country Planning Acts, 1947 to 1963; the
Town and Country Planning (Scotland) Acts, 1947 to 1963; the National
Parks and Access to the Countryside Act, 1949; the Town Development
Act, 1952; the Housing and Town Development (Scotland) Act, 1957; the

Development Plans
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Local Employment Act, i960; and the Caravan Sites and Control of Develop¬
ment Act, i960. Town and country planning in Northern Ireland is governed
by the Planning and Housing Act (Northern Ireland), 1931 ’> Planning
(Interim Development) Act (Northern Ireland), 1944; and the Planning
Acts Amendment Act (Northern Ireland), 1944.
The Town and Country Planning Act, 1962 (which consolidated earlier
planning legislation in England and Wales), and the Town and Country
Planning (Scotland) Act, 1947, are the principal Acts that govern the pattern
of land use in Great Britain. They provide for the co-ordination of planning
by means of development plans drawn up by local planning authorities and
approved by the Minister of Housing and Local Government or the Secretary
of State for Scotland; and they control development by making it subject,
generally, to the permission of a local planning authority or of a central
Government department. They also give extensive powers to public authorities
to acquire and develop land for planning purposes, and deal with certain
questions of amenity, for instance, the preservation of buildings of special
historic or architectural interest, and of trees and woodlands, and the control
of advertisement display.
Compensation for loss of development value through the refusal of planning
permission is paid by the Government according to a formula first laid down
in the 1954 Town and Country Planning Acts. Compensation to owners whose
land is compulsorily purchased is paid by the acquiring authorities, the
amount being based (under the Land Compensation Act, 1961 > and, in
Scotland, the Town and Country Planning Act, 1959) on the price the land
might have fetched if sold in the open market, with safeguards for local
authorities against paying for value brought about by their own activities and
for owners against depreciation which the threat of public acquisition might
cause. In general, expenditure on planning purposes (other than schemes of
major redevelopment) is taken into account in the amount of the general
grant paid to local authorities under the Local Government Act, 1958, and
the Local Government and Miscellaneous Financial Provisions (Scotland)
Act, 1958.
Under the Town and Country Planning Acts, 1947, local planning authorities
(in England and Wales, the councils of counties and county boroughs and,
in some areas, joint planning boards; and in Scotland, councils of counties
and of large burghs, and the councils of the two small burghs of St. Andrews
and Thurso) were required to prepare and submit development plans covering
the whole of their areas to the Minister of Housing and Local Government
and to the Secretary of State for Scotland respectively. Each development
plan includes maps and a written statement describing the major projects
in the plan and is accompanied by a report or survey giving the background
to the plan in terms of existing land use, communications and similar matters.
Plans normally cover a period of about 20 years; they must be reviewed at
least once in every five years, and may be extended and altered at any time
so that they are kept up to date. Development plans for the whole of Great
Britain (except the remoter parts of Scotland) have now been submitted to
the appropriate ministers, and almost all have been appro\ed.
Many local planning authorities have submitted amendments and additions
to their original plans and a number have completed their first five-yearly
reviews. Their proposals for changes in their development plans must be
advertised and the ministers concerned must consider objections and repre-
ireen Belts

sentations from the public. Usually a public local inquiry has to be held before
the proposals are decided. A development plan or its amendment can be
legally challenged only on the ground that it is ultra vires or that statutory
requirements have not been fulfilled, and such a challenge must be made to
the High Court within six weeks of publication of the approval or amendment
of the plan.
In order to restrict the further sprawl of the large built-up areas, to prevent
adjacent towns merging into one another, and in some cases to preserve the
special character of a town, the policy has been adopted of establishing green
belts’ around all or part of certain urban areas. In addition to restricting
undesirable growth, these green belts serve to keep the townsman in reach
of the countryside. Within a green belt there is a general proscription against
any new development except for a limited amount of building in existing
villages, development to serve agriculture, and other special uses of land
appropriate to a rural area.
The Town and Country Planning Acts and the Local Employment Act, i960,
contain provisions relating to the location of industry. General problems of
industrial development are dealt with jointly by a number of Government
departments, but the consent of the local planning authority is, as a rule,
required for any new industrial building, any extension of a building or any
change in the use of an existing building. These powers, together with the
more positive powers of the Board of Trade to inhibit the expansion of
industry in some areas and encourage it in others, have had a considerable
effect on the location of industry; during the past decade new smaller and
more widely dispersed centres have grown up, notably in southern England
(see p. 262).
The New Towns Act, 1946, gives the Minister of Housing and Local
Government and the Secretary of State for Scotland, power to make an
order designating any area of land (which may include any existing town
or other centre of population) as the site of a proposed new town. The
appropriate minister must consult the local authorities concerned on the
proposal and must be satisfied that it is in the national interest that the land
should be developed as a new town. Once the site has been designated, the
minister appoints a development corporation (consisting of a chairman, a
deputy chairman and up to seven other members) to be responsible for the
development of the new town. A master plan showing how the town is to be
built is then prepared, and this becomes the basis for development proposals,
each of which covers a part of the town. Each proposal is submitted to the
responsible minister, who must consult the local planning authority and,
together with the Treasury, be satisfied with the proposal on economic
grounds before giving approval.
The development corporations have powers in general (subject to the
consent of the Minister of Housing and Local Government or the Secretary
of State for Scotland) to acquire, by agreement or compulsory purchase, any
land or property in the designated areas which is necessary for their purposes,
or, in certain circumstances, land adjacent to or outside those areas, and they
may provide houses, flats, commercial and industrial premises, estate roads
and other buildings or services essential for the development of the towns.
In England and Wales the Minister of Housing and Local Government has
made a special development order to exempt the development corporations
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
from having to obtain planning permission from the local planning authorities;
in Scotland the Secretary of State has made a similar order in respect of
Cumbernauld and Livingston new towns.
The capital cost of developing the new towns (many of which are now
making a profit) is advanced to the corporations from public funds and is
repayable over a period out of the income from the property. The corporations
submit annual reports (which include copies of their audited accounts) to
the Minister of Housing and Local Government or to the Secretary of State
for Scotland, who lay them before Parliament.
As each new town in England and Wales is substantially completed the
development corporation is dissolved and, under the terms of the New
Towns Act, 1959, its assets and liabilities are handed over to a central agency
—the Commission for New Towns. The Commission, which came into
being in 1961 and will operate during the whole period of new town con¬
solidation, has already assumed responsibility for Crawley and Kernel
Hempstead. It is responsible for maintaining and enhancing the value of the
land entrusted to it; but in discharging its functions it is required to have
regard to the purpose for which the towns were established, and to the
convenience and welfare of the people working and living in them. No new
towns central authority has been proposed for Scotland, where new town
development is at a less advanced stage.
Eighteen new towns have been, or are being established in Great Britain:
fourteen in England and Wales and four in Scotland. Eight of the new towns
in England and Wales (Basildon and Harlow in Essex; Kernel Hempstead,
Stevenage, Hatfield, and Welwyn in Hertfordshire; Crawley in Sussex; and
Bracknell in Berkshire) are designed to help in absorbing excess population
from the Greater London area; of the six others, Corby in Northamptonshire,
Aycliffe and Peterlee in Durham, and Cwmbran in Monmouthshire are to
serve the special needs of their areas, while Skelmersdale in Lancashire and
Dawley in Shropshire are to meet the overspill needs of Liverpool and
Birmingham respectively. The Scottish new towns (East Kilbride in
Lanarkshire; Glenrothes in Fife; Cumbernauld in Dunbartonshire, and
Livingston in West Lothian) will help in housing the surplus population from
Glasgow. Livingston is also to be a focus for industrial activity in the central
belt of Scotland. Proposals were announced in 1963 for three further new
towns in England—at Runcorn, near Liverpool, at Redditch, near Birmingham,
and on a site to be selected, to take population from Manchester.
In Northern Ireland consideration is being given to the creation of a new
city and the extension of certain existing towns (see p. 190).
The new towns represent a notable achievement in positive land use.
They are generally recognised as one of the most successful post-war experi¬
ments, both socially and industrially, and as a profitable long-term investment.
Many thousands of people have moved into the new towns during the past
decade and to meet their needs an extensive building and civil engineering
programme has provided houses, flats, factories, schools, shops, roads, water
supplies and sewerage on a very large scale. Additional gas and electricity
supplies, more police, fire and bus stations, extra postal, telegraph and
telephone services and new health centres have also been provided and most
of the towns are well equipped with parks and playing fields of various kinds.
All the more important public buildings (the town hall, the central post
office, the public library, the health centre, the college of further education
and the magistrates’ court) are situated in the town centres, where some of
the most recent planning ideas (notably the separation of the pedestrian

from the motorist) are being put into practice. A number of the more
developed towns are becoming regional centres and, as the populations grow
large enough to give the necessary support, full entertainment and recrea¬
tional facilities such as skating rinks, dance halls, bowling alleys, swimming
pools and sports stadiums are gradually being provided.
Under the New Towns Act, 1946, Parliament approved a consolidated
fund of ^50 million to provide for advances to the development corporations
for work on the new towns. This fund was increased by subsequent Acts
and, under the 1959 Act, stands at £400 million. A total of about £330 million
has been advanced to the corporations.
The Town Development Act, 1952, makes provision for the relief of con¬
gestion in large industrial towns in England and Wales by encouraging the
transfer of population and industry from these areas to places suitable for
expansion. Schemes have been approved for moving more than a quarter of
a million people and, so far, twenty-five thousand families have moved
under arrangements of this kind.
The Housing and Town Development (Scotland) Act, 1957, makes
similar provision for Scotland; agreements between Glasgow Corporation and
other authorities provide for the housing of over 15,000 Glasgow families
outside the city.
Redevelopment of outworn and obsolete areas is taking place in many
towns: Glasgow, for example, has started a programme of rebuilding 29 areas,
housing nearly a third of its population and accommodating much of the
industry and commerce of the city. Detailed proposals for three of these
areas have been approved and the work of clearance and rebuilding is well
advanced in one of them—the Gorbals.
The National Parks and Access to the Countryside Act, 1949, provided that
certain areas of beautiful country in England and Wales should become
national parks, where the characteristic landscape would be safeguarded and
facilities for open-air recreation provided or improved.
A National Parks Commission was set up by the Act and its work has
resulted in the establishment of ten national parks: the Peak District, the
Lake District, Snowdonia in North Wales, Dartmoor in Devon, the Pem¬
brokeshire Coast, the North York Moors, the Yorkshire Dales, Exmoor in
Devon and Somerset, Northumberland (comprising most of the upland
country from the Cheviots in the north to the Roman Wall in the south),
and the Brecon Beacons in South Wales. These parks cover a total area of
5,254 square miles, almost one-eleventh of the area of England and Wales.
They have various forms of administration: two of the parks are administered
by joint planning boards, four by special park planning committees of the
four county councils in whose areas they are situated, and four (which fall
within the area of more than one county council) by park planning committees
of each of the constituent county councils, advised by a park joint advisory
committee concerned with the park as a whole. All these authorities control
development in the parks (which are still in private ownership) and take
steps to preserve and enhance the natural beauty of the landscape and to
promote enjoyment of the area by the public. For instance, trees are planted
to screen blemishes on the landscape, unsightly structures are removed, new
building is made to harmonise with the natural surroundings, advertisement
displays are reduced, and car parks and camping sites are provided in
suitable localities. Government grants at the rate of 75 per cent are available

for certain measures designed to enhance natural beauty and improve
recreational facilities.
There are no National Parks in Scotland but the National Parks Working
Party, set up to consider the five areas recommended as national parks by
the National Parks Committee, has submitted a report on each of them.
These are: Loch Lomond—Trossachs; Glen Affric—Glen Cannich—Strath
Farrar; Ben Nevis—Glen Coe—Black Mount; the Cairngorms; and Loch
Torridon—Loch Maree—Little Loch Broom. Close supervision is being
maintained over development in these areas by means of Scottish National
Parks Directions, which require the local planning authorities concerned to
refer proposed developments to the Secretary of State for Scotland for
consideration. Local planning authorities are also encouraged to define areas
of great landscape value in their development plans.
The National Parks Commission also has power to designate areas in
England and Wales outside the national parks as ‘areas of outstanding natural
beauty’. Thirteen of these areas had been designated by March 1963; others
are under consideration. Government grants are also available for certain
measures designed to enhance the natural beauty of these areas.
Designation of a park or area of outstanding natural beauty does not
mean that the general public has right of access. Local planning authorities
must survey the extent to which land is already open to the public, and may
increase it by means of agreements with owners or by access orders. Govern¬
ment grants are available towards the cost of making such agreements or
orders and in the Peak District, particularly, large tracts of moorland have
been opened to the public in this way.
A survey of all footpaths and bridleways in England and Wales is being
made by local authorities as a comprehensive national record of public rights
of way; and in some areas existing footpaths and bridleways are being linked
to form long-distance routes, which will become continuous rights of way.
Responsibility for making proposals for long-distance routes rests with the
National Parks Commission; once the proposals are approved by the Minister
of Housing and Local Government, it falls to the local authorities to give
effect to them. Nine routes—in all over 1,200 miles—had been approved by
April 1963. Large stretches of these paths are already public rights of way
and progress is being made in negotiating the agreements required to complete
them. The establishment of further routes is under discussion.
The Forestry Commission has formed, and opened to the public, seven
National Forest Parks in some of the finest country in Britain: Argyll, Glen
Trool, Glen More, and the Queen Elizabeth Forest Park in Scotland; the
Forest of Dean and the Wye valley woods on the borders of England and
Wales; Snowdonia in Wales; and the Border Forest Park (adjoining the
Northumberland National Park to the westward), which includes forests on
the borders of Northumberland and Cumberland in England and of Roxburgh
in Scotland. The total area of the seven parks approaches half a million acres,
including planted areas and unplantable moorland and mountains. Camping
facilities are provided in all the parks.
The historic New Forest, in Hampshire, although not a National Forest
Park, is also open to the public.
The responsibility for nature conservation rests with the Nature Conservancy,
which derives its powers from the National Parks and Access to the Country¬
side Act, 1949. The object of conservation is to influence soils, water, vegeta¬
tion and animal life by means of research, experiment and control. This

entails the acquisition and management of a representative series of reserves,
as well as the establishment of laboratories for use in long-term research
schemes (see p. 219) and the making of grants-in-aid for specified research.
The Nature Conservancy is responsible for 101 nature reserves in Great
Britain, with a combined area of about 211,000 acres (by April °f
which over 58,800 acres comprise the Cairngorms, the largest reserve in
Britain and one of the largest in Europe. Seven other areas (mostly in the
north) are managed by local authorities, using their powers under the National
Parks Act, in consultation with the Conservancy.
Eleven forest nature reserves have also been set up; of these, seven have
been created by agreement between the Forestry Commission and the
Nature Conservancy and consist of forest land managed under joint super¬
vision ; one is the result of a similar arrangement made with the Crown Estate
Commissioners; two derive from Forest Nature Reserve Agreements made
with the Duchy of Cornwall; and one from an agreement made with the
Department of Agriculture and Fisheries for Scotland.
Responsibility for the preservation of the historic, scenic and architectural
beauties of Great Britain is vested mainly in the Minister of Housing and
Local Government, the Secretary of State for Scotland, and the local planning
authorities. The ministers have the duty of compiling lists of buildings of
special architectural or historic interest and have so far listed more than
103,400 buildings. Local authorities have special powers to prevent the
demolition of such buildings and to control other works that would damage
their character. The Ministry of Public Building and Works is also concerned,
being responsible for the maintenance of royal parks and palaces, for the
protection of ancient monuments (under the Ancient Monuments Acts),
and for making grants (on the recommendation of the appropriate Historic
Buildings Council, see p. 233) for the repair and maintenance of buildings of
outstanding historic or architectural interest or their contents and for the
upkeep of adjoining land. About 600 of the more important protected
monuments in Britain are in the care of the Ministry; and grants totalling
nearly million have been made towards the cost of urgently needed
repairs to nearly 900 historic buildings in England, Scotland and Wales.
Under the Town and Country Planning Acts, i947> local planning
authorities have power (a) to protect trees and woodlands by means of tree
preservation orders (about 3,500 of which are in force throughout Great
Britain); {b) to prevent mineral workings becoming permanent eyesores by
attaching suitable conditions to planning permissions; and (c) to restrict or
regulate the display of advertisements in the interests of amenity or public
safety. Local authorities are also empowered, under the Clean Air Act, 1956,
to declare ‘smoke control areas’, in which the emission of smoke from
chimneys constitutes an offence, and to make grants towards costs incurred
by owners and occupiers of premises in these areas in making the necessary
changes in their appliances.
Voluntary amenity societies, wholly dependent upon the support of their
members, include: the Council for the Preservation of Rural England,
founded in 1926 to organise concerted action to secure the protection of rural
scenery and of town and country amenities from disfigurement or injury; the
Association for the Preservation of Rural Scotland, founded in 1927 for the
protection of rural scenery and of the amenities of country districts and towns
and villages in Scotland; the Council for the Preservation of Rural Wales,
founded in 1928 to organise and advise upon concerted action for the protection

of the beauty of Wales; the Commons, Open Spaces and Footpaths Preser¬
vation Society; the Ramblers’ Association; the Society for the Protection of
Ancient Buildings; the Pilgrim Trust; the National Trust for Places of
Historic Interest or Natural Beauty in England, Wales and Northern Ireland;
and the National Trust for Scotland. The National Trust for England, Wales
and Northern Ireland (which was founded in 1895 and now has some 120,000
members) is (apart from the Crown) the largest land-owner in the United
Kingdom. It has acquired, mainly through gifts, over a thousand properties,
which it holds for the enjoyment of the public; it administers more than
250,000 acres of land of great natural beauty; and it owns many fine gardens.
The National Trust for Scotland, an independent body, founded in 1931 to
promote the preservation of places of historic or architectural interest or of
natural beauty in Scotland for the benefit of the public, now has about
26,000 members and has under its care over 60 properties, covering in all
over 70,000 acres.
The Council for Nature (founded in 1958) is a foundation of about 300
natural history societies and voluntary bodies concerned with nature con¬
servation and represents the interests of some 80,000 naturalists at public
inquiries on developments likely to threaten British flora and fauna. The
Council, which undertakes practical tasks of nature reserve management as
well as information work on all aspects of natural history in the British Isles,
receives grants from the Ministry of Education, the British Broadcasting
Corporation and the Carnegie United Kingdom Trust.
The Planning and Housing Act (Northern Ireland), 1931, which is the main
source from which power to prepare a planning scheme is derived, provides
for the preparation by local authorities of planning schemes for development
or redevelopment of their areas, with the general object of securing proper
sanitary conditions and amenities in connection with the laying out and use
of land. The Interim Development Act of 1944 enables people wishing to
carry out development to do so without delay, while ensuring that such
development shall conform to the provisions likely to be included in the
planning scheme for the area.
The provisions of the Acts brought all land in Northern Ireland under
planning control and required every local authority to prepare a planning
scheme for its area. Interim control is exercised in accordance with the section
of the 1944 Act which requires that, where application is made to an authority
for permission to develop, the authority may grant the application condition¬
ally or unconditionally or may refuse it altogether. In the event of a refusal
or conditional approval, the applicant has a right to appeal to the Ministry of
Health and Local Government for Northern Ireland (which is the depart¬
ment primarily responsible for the administration of the planning Acts) to have
the matter determined by the Ministry or, if the appellant wishes, by an
independent person appointed by the Ministry.
Local planning authorities in Northern Ireland have made appreciable
progress in the preparation of outline plans which indicate broadly the
proposals for their areas. For the Belfast region, a survey was undertaken on
behalf of the Government by Sir Robert Matthew. In a report published in
1963, Belfast Regional Survey and Plan; Recommendations and Conclusions,
Cmd. 451, Belfast HMSO, he recommended limited development in the city
area, together with the expansion of seven outlying towns to relieve congestion
in Belfast, and the expansion of the towns of Lurgan and Portadown into a
new city of about 100,000 people.

HOUSING
Between 1945 and the end of 1962 over 4J million new houses and flats were
built. Despite this achievement much still remains to be done before all the
housing problems facing the country are solved. The nationwide shortage of
housing accommodation which existed in 1945 as the result of enemy action,
the gradual deterioration of old houses and the increase in the number of
households, has been alleviated, but there are still serious shortages to be
overcome in some areas, especially large cities. Other housing targets are the
completion of the slum clearance programme, building more accommodation
suitable for elderly people, eliminating overcrowded living conditions,
providing for the increasing population and number of households and the
modernisation and conversion of older houses.
Responsibility for formulating housing policy and supervising the housing
programme is borne by the Minister of Housing and Local Government in
England and Wales, by the Secretary of State in Scotland and the Minister
of Health and Local Government in Northern Ireland. The actual provision of
housing accommodation in any area is the concern of the local authority,
which is obliged to plan for new housing and slum clearance where necessary,
to see that adequate standards are maintained in newly built and existing
houses and to ensure, as far as possible, that housing conditions are satisfactory
in that area. In selecting tenants for council dwellings local authorities give
preference to families living in overcrowded or unsatisfactory conditions. In
England and Wales and Northern Ireland the local housing authorities are
the councils of county boroughs, boroughs (including metropolitan boroughs),
urban districts and rural districts, the London County Council and the
Common Council of the City of London. In Scotland all town and county
councils are housing authorities.
There are over 17 million houses in Britain, just over 15 million in England
and Wales, 1,670,000 in Scotland and about 395,000 in Northern Ireland.
About 3! million of the houses in England and Wales, about 700,000 in
Scotland and about 80,000 in Northern Ireland are owned by public authori¬
ties, that is about one house in four. Over 6| million houses, more than one
in three, are in owner occupation; most of the remainder (mainly older houses)
are rented from private landlords. Today one family in four lives in a post¬
war dwelling. Of houses and flats built since 1945, over 63 per cent were

The Ministry of Health and Local Government co-operates with the
Ministry of Commerce in the selection of industrial sites in order to secure
the best possible use of the land and to facilitate the efficient provision of
housing and other services in connection with industrial expansion.
The committee on nature conservation in Northern Ireland was appointed
in i960 to consider the protection of the natural flora and fauna and the
physical features of scientific interest in Northern Ireland, and to make
recommendations on measures for their conservation and control, including
the protection of wild life.
Northern Ireland’s first forest park at Tollymore Park, Newcastle, County
Down, was opened to the public in 1955. Situated at the foot of the Mountains
of Mourne, it covers an area of 1,200 acres. It contains an arboretum com¬
prising a wide variety of native and exotic trees, and is rich in mountain,
river and parkland scenery. Caravan facilities and a camping site for youth
organisations are available.

New Building
built by local authorities (that is, generally, by private builders under contract
to local authorities). Since the restrictions on private building which were
necessary during the shortages of the post-war period were abolished, in
1954, the proportion of building undertaken by private enterprise has risen
steadily.1 In 1962 the total number of houses built was 313,643, of which
178,211 were privately sponsored.
The programme of house building is being accelerated to provide more
houses for the increasing population, and the even more rapidly increasing
number of households (see p. 21), and to speed up the rate of slum clearance.
It is estimated that in Great Britain 110,000 additional houses are needed
annually for the increasing population and number of households, and that
over 750,000 slum houses remain to be cleared; houses becoming time-worn
year by year must be added to this total.
Local authorities are being encouraged to use systems of industrialised
housing, with standardised components. These offer the advantages of very
rapid construction on the site, greater independence of weather conditions,
and the use of less skilled labour than traditional building methods require,
an important factor in areas where there is a shortage of skilled building
labour.
The Ministry of Housing and Local Government has set up offices in the
north-east and the north-west of England to advise local authorities on
methods of increasing their rate of house building and slum clearance. As
the slums are dealt with, a policy is being drawn up to renew the decaying
areas in towns and demolish or improve the 4 million old houses, many of
which are obsolescent. The Minister has undertaken to ensure that land for
houses is made available to local authorities, his proposals for more new
towns (see p. 186) being one of several ways in which this is being done. To
help in dealing with long-term problems of land for housing, industry,
agriculture and transport, the Ministry is undertaking regional surveys of
population trends and future needs for land as a basis for regional plans
covering development over a period of twenty years. The plans will be
revised at least every ten years.
Private enterprise is responsible for over half the housing being built today in
Britain (see above); the rest is built by local authorities, new towns develop¬
ment corporations, the Northern Ireland Housing Trust2 and certain
Government departments (for housing families of the armed forces or other
services). Housing associations, which are non-profit-making bodies providing
houses for letting rather than for sale, are increasing in number, as are self-
help groups whose members build houses for their own occupation in their
spare time. Local authority housing is normally built for letting; privately
sponsored dwellings for owner occupation.
Most of the new dwellings in Britain are houses (usually of two storeys);
the remainder are flats or maisonettes, mostly in blocks of from 2 to 16
storeys, although a few blocks may be higher. High blocks are generally
built in central urban areas where they replace old, overcrowded dwellings.
1 The proportion relates to Britain as a whole. In Scotland the proportion of private
building to local authority building is lower than in England and Wales. Out of a total
of 26,761 dwellings built in Scotland in 1962, 7,849 (about 29 per cent) were for
private owners. In Northern Ireland, in the four years 1959-62, out of a total of about
26,600 new houses, 11,900 were built for private owners.
2 The Northern Ireland Housing Trust, a statutory body, was established in 1945 to
erect houses for letting, to supplement building by local authorities. The trust has built
about a quarter of Northern Ireland’s post-war houses.
PLANNING AND HOUSING
193
In the new towns and on new housing estates they provide focal points and
help planners to achieve high density of population per acre while still
providing open spaces.
Accommodation in a house designed for a family of four or five people
includes one or two living rooms, a kitchen, a store, a bathroom and a water
closet and two or three bedrooms. A typical 3-bedroom house built by a local
authority in England and Wales in 1962 had a superficial area of about
906 square feet and cost ^1,984 to build.
Control of building standards is the responsibility of the central depart¬
ments, which issue manuals of guidance on design and layout for different
types of houses and flats provided by local authorities. Research into building
techniques and into new methods of house construction, as well as into the
needs of families, is carried out by the Development Group of the Ministry
of Housing and Local Government, the Building Research Centre, the
architects’ departments of major local authorities and the research groups
in big constructional firms. All Government building research and develop¬
ment is co-ordinated by the Directorate of Research and Development at
the Ministry of Public Building and Works.
Slum Clearance Returns made by local housing authorities in 1955 indicated that there were
about one million slum dwellings in Britain which ought to be cleared. In
England and Wales about 850,000, or 6-5 per cent of all houses, and in
Scotland over 150,000, about 10 per cent, were estimated to be unfit for
human habitation and due for demolition. In Northern Ireland the number
of such houses was estimated in 1959 at about 50,000.
In the six years 1957 to 1962, local authorities in England and Wales
demolished or closed 350,825 unfit houses, involving about 976,042 occupants;
while in Scotland 60,919 houses were demolished or closed during the same
period. In Northern Ireland about 3,600 dwellings were demolished or closed
by local authorities in the four-year period 1959-62.
Well over half the 1,469 housing authorities in England and Wales should
have completed their 1955 programmes by the end of 1965. Many of them,
since the process of replacing unfit houses is a continuous one, have submitted
further proposals for increased programmes. Within the next 10 years the
great majority of them should have succeeded in getting rid of all their
present slums. In certain areas, however, particularly the older industrial
towns, and including Birmingham, Liverpool and Manchester, three of the
biggest cities in the country, the proportion of unfit houses is so high that
clearance will take much longer.
To help in those areas of Britain where the number of slum houses is so
large that it would not be practicable to replace all of them within the next
few years, local authorities can acquire houses unfit for human habitation
and ‘patch’ them in order that they may be occupied for a strictly limited
period pending their demolition. The intention is that these houses should
be demolished as soon as possible: the temporary repairs are not intended
as an alternative to slum clearance. Exchequer contributions are available to
meet part of the costs of acquisition and essential repairs.
Housing authorities are obliged to see that other accommodation exists,
or can be provided by them, for people displaced from slum clearance areas.
Where an unfit house is demolished by order of the local authority and the
owner retains his land, he normally receives no compensation. But if the
local authorities acquire an unfit property in order to demolish it themselves
and to rebuild on the land, the normal basis of compensation is the market

value of the house as it stands or the value of the site after clearance, which¬
ever is the less. In England and Wales there are, however, special provisions
for owner-occupiers who bought between 1939 an<^ I955> an(^ they receive
full compensation regardless of whether the house is being acquired by the
authority or not; similar terms apply to business occupiers. In England,
Wales and Scotland the slum clearance code provides for special payments
for the previous good maintenance of unfit houses which have to be closed
or demolished and business occupiers may receive hardship payments in
certain cases. In Northern Ireland provision is made for payments to owner-
occupiers, business occupiers and for good maintenance of older houses.
Housing
Finance
Building Subsidies
and Improvement
Grants
The initial capital cost of houses built by or for local authorities is met by
raising loans; current expenditure, including loan repayment and interest on
loans, is met from rents, rates and where available Exchequer subsidies.
Local authorities may raise loans for housing either in the open market or,
where borrowing from private sources at normal rates of interest is impossible,
by borrowing from the Public Works Loan Board (see p. 79)* Exchequer
loans of up to a maximum of £25 million in England and Wales and ^3 million
in Scotland are available to approved housing associations in order to finance
the building of houses to let at unsubsidised rents. Government proposals
for encouraging the activities of housing associations were set out in a White
Paper, Housing (Cmnd. 2050), published in May 1963. In Northern Ireland
local authorities, the Housing Trust and housing associations may borrow
from the Government Loans Fund.
Loans to enable people to buy their houses by a system of instalment
purchase are available from various sources, including building societies,
insurance companies, industrial and provident societies and local authorities.
Building societies, of which there are about 730, are the most important
of these agencies. They do not build houses themselves but provide long-term
loans covering, usually, up to about 80 per cent of the value of the houses,
on the security of property bought for owner-occupation. Loans are usually
repayable over periods of 20 or even 30 years, by equal monthly instalments
to cover capital and interest. The societies’ funds are derived mainly from
investment of relatively modest sums by the general public.
Many local authorities operate a scheme whereby, for a house costing up
to £2,500, they guarantee part of the loan made by a building society so that
an advance greater than normal (up to 95 per cent of the value of the house
in some cases) may be made to the purchaser. The Exchequer undertakes
to share any liability local authorities may incur under this scheme. Local
authorities also have power to make loans under the Housing Acts for the
acquisition, conversion, improvement, repair and alteration of houses. Under
the House Purchase and Housing Act, 1959, they may make loans of up to
100 per cent of the house’s value.
Housing subsidies, at varying rates and for varying purposes, have been
provided in Britain since 19195 when they were first introduced to facilitate
the building of houses for letting at moderate rents.
After the second world war subsidies at higher rates, payable annually
for 60 years from the year of building completion, were provided for all new
housing accommodation built with ministerial approval by the local authorities,
by new towns development corporations, or by housing associations under
arrangements with local authorities. In England and Wales a standard rate
of subsidy was paid for ordinary houses or flats built to meet general needs,
PLANNING AND HOUSING
J95
and higher rates of subsidy were provided for certain types of housing (such
as high blocks of flats on expensive sites), housing built for particular pur¬
poses (for instance, for the agricultural population) and housing in special
areas (such as poor areas of low rate-paying capacity).
In recent years various systems of subsidy have been introduced under
successive Housing Acts. The present subsidies in England and Wales
provide for a flexible system of general subsidy on all types of housing. The
level of subsidy depends on the financial need of the housing authority.
Authorities with inadequate resources receive a basic subsidy of £24 a year
for each house built, which may be increased in stages to £40 for authorities
with particularly low reserves. For other authorities the basic rate is £8.
Additional subsidies exist for high flats and expensive sites. These provisions
enable authorities to build where need exists and help to ensure that
Exchequer assistance is available chiefly for those authorities in most need
of help.
Private owners in England and Wales can obtain Exchequer assistance for
the improvement of houses built before 1945 or conversion of large houses
or other buildings for housing. Cash grants may be made by local authorities,
with Exchequer assistance, to people converting or improving existing
buildings for housing at a cost of over £100 per dwelling. The grants may
amount to half the cost, with a maximum grant of £400 for each dwelling.
There are certain technical conditions which the dwellings as improved or
converted must fulfil, to ensure that public money is spent only on property
that will provide satisfactory accommodation for a sufficiently long period.
Grants for similar work in houses owned by local authorities may also be
paid by the Minister of Housing and Local Government, but on an annual
basis over 20 years. In either case, the payment of grant is at the discretion
of the local authority or the Minister, as the case may be.
Local authorities are, however, obliged to make grants called ‘standard
grants’, for the provision in houses built before 1945 of a bath in a bathroom,
hot-water supply, water closet, wash basin, and food store; these cash grants
cover half the cost of the work, subject to a maximum grant of ^155 or smaller
sums if some of the five items already exist. (Proposals to make it compulsory
for landlords to provide these standard amenities in certain cases of rented
housing were put forward in the White Paper, Housing, see p. 194.) Similarly
the Minister is obliged to make standard grants to local authorities, but again
on an annual basis over 20 years. The Acts under which these improvement
grants are available are the Housing (Financial Provisions) Act, 1958, the
House Purchase and Housing Act, 1959, and the Housing Act, 1961. From
1949 to February 1963 over 625,000 grants had been made.
Building subsidies and improvement grants are also provided in Scotland
and Northern Ireland; the amounts of subsidy are generally higher owing to
different circumstances. In Scotland the Housing (Scotland) Act, 1962,
provides for subsidies according to a local authority’s financial needs. The
basic subsidy is £32 per house for authorities with inadequate resources and
£12 per house for the other authorities. There are higher rates of subsidy for
housing for special purposes (such as overspill, multi-storey development,
agricultural workers). Grants are also available to local authorities and private
owners for the improvement or conversion of existing properties, and to
private owners for the provision of new houses for farm workers. In Northern
Ireland annual subsidies are paid to local authorities, the Northern Ireland
Housing Trust and housing associations. Grants for improvements and
conversions are payable both to public authorities and private persons.
196
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Control of
Rents
In addition, ‘lump sum’ subsidies are paid to private persons who build
houses for letting or for owner-occupation. Grants are available for the
provision of new houses and for the reconditioning of existing premises to
accommodate farmers and approved workers.
The average annual cost of housing subsidies in Britain has been over
£100 million since 1954, some three-quarters of the total being paid by the
Exchequer and about a quarter by local authorities.
The first Act of Parliament to restrict rents was passed in 1915, when houses
were in short supply because of war-time movement of population. Rent
control was originally intended as a temporary measure, but was retained by
successive Acts until 1957. During this period nearly all privately owned
houses let unfurnished were subject to a system of rent control which gave
the tenant a fixed rent and security of tenure.
Since 1954 the Government has pursued a policy of progressive abolition
of rent control on the grounds that the previous system was leading to deteri¬
oration and to wasteful use of the nation’s stock of housing. Control of
lettings by local authorities, New Town Development Corporations and
certain housing associations and trusts ceased in that year. The Rent Act,
1957, released from rent control all dwellings with a rateable value over £40
in the London Metropolitan Police District and in Scotland and over £30
elsewhere; it freed from control all new lettings after 6th July, 1957, whatever
the rateable value of the property. This Act also provided for the de-control
from time to time of further categories of houses by order, subject to approval
by Parliament. For those houses remaining within control, it laid down a
maximum rent which was more in keeping with the current value of money
and the costs of maintenance. Security of tenure for controlled tenants is
retained under the Act; a controlled tenant cannot be forced to give up
possession except by a Court order, which will not be granted unless the Court
is satisfied that this is reasonable and, with some exceptions, that suitable
alternative accommodation is available for the tenant.
Where houses or parts of houses within the rateable value limits for rent
control are let with furniture or services provided by the landlord, a different
system of control operates. If the tenant feels he is being overcharged, he
can apply to a rent tribunal to review his rent. These tribunals are appointed
and maintained by the Government (the Minister of Housing and Local
Government and the Secretary of State for Scotland) but are independent,
quasi-judicial bodies, from whose decisions there is no appeal, except on a
point of law. The tribunal decides in each case what is a fair rent to fix for
the accommodation and services provided. The rent so fixed is registered
with the local authority for the district, or, in Scotland, with the tribunal,
and any subsequent overcharging by the landlord is a punishable offence.
Somewhat similar measures of control and de-control apply in Northern
Ireland. In 1951 legislation was passed which permitted prescribed increases
in the rent of controlled houses, provided that they were maintained in good
repair; and the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) and Rent Restriction
Law (Amendment) Act (Northern Ireland), 1956, permitted an increase of
one-third in the rent levels fixed by the 1951 Act where the landlord had
recently incurred expenditure of a certain amount on repairs. The 1956 Act
also released from control houses with a net annual value of over £50 (with
certain safeguards) and houses with a net annual value of over £26 of which
the landlord was in actual possession when the Act came into force, or of
which he subsequently obtained possession.

Every person living in Britain possesses the right of religious freedom as
described in Article 18 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights: he
may change his religion at will, and may manifest his faith in teaching,
worship and observance without interference from the community or the State.
Churches and religious societies of all kinds may own property, conduct
schools, and propagate their beliefs in speech and in writing.
Freedom of conscience in religious matters was achieved gradually from
the seventeenth century onwards; in many cases relaxation in the adminis¬
tration of laws discriminating against minority religious groups preceded the
repeal of the legislation concerned. Heresy ceased to be a civil offence with
the passing of the Ecclesiastical Jurisdiction Act, 1677, and the Toleration
Act of 1688 granted freedom of worship to Protestant dissenters. In 1828
the repeal of the Test and Corporation Acts freed nonconformists from
political disabilities and made it possible for them to be appointed to public
offices; Roman Catholics gained political emancipation under the Roman
Catholic Relief Act, 1829; the Jewish Relief Act, 1858, enabled Jews to become
members of Parliament; while religious tests that had been imposed on
prospective students and members of the academic staff of the universities
of Oxford, Cambridge and Durham were successively abolished by Acts of
1854, 1856 and 1871. Nowadays, there is no religious or denominational bar
to the holding of public office, except that the Lord Chancellor may not be
a Roman Catholic.
In the services administered by the State, such as the armed forces, the
national hospitals and the prisons, the clergy of the established Church of
England or the Church of Scotland provide the principal ministrations and
are paid a salary by the State for this part of their work. Priests of the Roman
Catholic Church and ministers of other denominations may also be appointed
or specially called in as required. Voluntary schools (see p. 163) provided by
churches of any religious denomination may be wholly or partly maintained
from public funds.
There is no precisely accurate or uniform method of assessing the number
of adherents to the various churches in the United Kingdom, since no inquiries
are made about religious beliefs in population censuses or other official
returns, and each church adopts different criteria in counting its members.
The membership figures given in the following sections should therefore be
taken as approximate.
Church of
England
The Church of England is the Established Church, and claims to be the
ancient catholic church of the land. At the Reformation in the sixteenth
century, it repudiated the supremacy of the Pope, but retained the historic
episcopate, and the creeds and sacraments upon which its doctrines are
based; therefore it claims to be both ‘catholic’ and ‘reformed’. Its form of
worship is embodied in the Book of Common Prayer, which was first compiled
in 1549.
The Church is uniquely related to the Crown in that the Sovereign, who
must be a member of the Church of England, is called ‘Defender of the
Faith’ (a statutory title as protector of the Church) and promises on his or
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
her accession to uphold it. The coronation of the Sovereign is performed by
the Archbishop of Canterbury; prayers for the Sovereign and other members
of the royal family are said in all the statutory services of the Church; Church
of England archbishops, bishops and other senior ecclesiastical dignitaries,
as well as incumbents of Crown livings, are appointed by the Sovereign on
the advice of the Prime Minister1; and all clergymen take the oath of
allegiance to the Crown.
The Church is also linked with the State through the House of Lords,
in which the two archbishops of Canterbury and York and the twenty-four
senior diocesan bishops have seats. This makes it possible for the views of
the Church leaders to be expressed freely on any moral issue raised in
connection with the corporate conduct of the State as well as on specifically
ecclesiastical issues—a matter of particular significance in view of the fact
that the clergy of the Church of England (together with those of the Church
of Scotland, the Church of Ireland and the Roman Catholic Church) are
legally disqualified from sitting in the House of Commons.
The Church is not free to change its form of worship, as laid down in the
Book of Common Prayer, without the consent of Parliament2; canons (Church
rules) cannot be made or amended without the consent of the Queen; and
the measures of the Church Assembly (as distinct from its regulations) also
require the Royal Assent.
Church The Church of England is organised by geographical areas into two provinces
Organisation and and 43 dioceses. The Province of Canterbury contains 29 dioceses and that
Government of York 14. Each diocese is subdivided into ecclesiastical parishes, of which
there are about 14,500 in all. The Archbishop of Canterbury is Primate of
All England and bishop of his own diocese of Canterbury; the Archbishop
of York is styled Primate of England and is bishop of his own diocese of
York. The baptised membership of the Church is about 27 million, i.e.
two-thirds of the population born and resident in the two provinces.
Spiritual authority in the Church rests with the bishops. The authoritative
bodies in matters of doctrine, belief and practice are the Convocations of
Canterbury and York, each presided over by its archbishop, and consisting
of an upper house of bishops, and a lower house of representatives of each
cathedral chapter, archdeacons and elected clergy. The Convocations meet
not oftener than three times a year.
The legislative and central administrative body of the Church is the
National Assembly of the Church of England, which is commonly called the
Church Assembly. It was set up in 1919 at the request of the two Convocations,
and was given power to legislate by measure by the Church of England
Assembly (Powers) Act of 1919. It can discuss any matter connected with
the Church of England, but may not make any doctrinal statements, nor
infringe upon the rights of the Convocations. It consists of three houses:
bishops, clergy and laity. The first two houses are composed of the members
of the Convocations; the house of laity consists of men and women elected
every five years by the lay members of diocesan conferences, and the con¬
stitution allows for ten co-opted members.
The Church Assembly usually meets three times a year. Measures, after
passing through various stages in the assembly, are presented to an ecclesias-

the method of Crown appointments to ecclesiastical offices.

worship by experimental stages is to be brought before Parliament during the course

tical committee of both Houses of Parliament, consisting of 30 members,
of whom 15 are appointed by the Lord Chancellor and 15 by the Speaker
of the House of Commons. This committee lays the measures, together with
a report upon them, before both Houses. If both Houses so resolve, the
measure is sent to the Sovereign for Royal Assent, after which it has the
same force and effect as an Act of Parliament. Parliament, though it may
reject a measure, has no power to amend it.
The Church Assembly is the centre of an administrative system consisting
of boards and councils dealing with various aspects of the Church’s work,
such as education, recruitment and training for the ministry, and Church work
at home and overseas. The Church Assembly, through the Schools Council
of its Board of Education, is responsible for some 8,000 Church of England
schools of all types, for approximately half of which the Church bears a
quarter of the cost of improvements, alterations and repairs.
Parochial church councils were set up in 1921 to associate the laity wTith
the government of the Church in the parish. The members of these councils
are appointed by the parochial electors, i.e. persons who are baptised, are
not members of any other church, are 17 years of age and over, and have
applied for membership of the electoral roll of the parish where they habitually
reside or worship. The estimated number on the parish electoral rolls is just
under three million.
The Church of England has its own ecclesiastical courts. Their jurisdiction
today consists largely of faculty cases, with very occasional cases of discipline
against clergy, either for moral or ecclesiastical offences. A faculty is necessary
for any specific alteration or addition to the fabric or ornaments of a church
or to a churchyard.
There are 24 Church of England training colleges for teachers and 26
theological colleges. All these establishments are run by independent bodies
of trustees. The Church Assembly has approved a programme of expansion
of the Church training colleges which should increase the number of students
from under 5,000 to 9,000, and will include the building of two new colleges.
The Church Assembly has also accepted responsibility for considerable
expenditure on the theological colleges and their expansion. In order to
increase intake to the ministry, it has appointed a full-time recruiting officer
to be in touch with all types of school.
Each parish is responsible for its own finances, and also contributes an
annual apportioned quota to diocesan funds, and each diocese similarly
contributes to the Church Assembly. In the diocese, the financial authority
is the diocesan board of finance, which administers the money contributed
by the parishes, and acts as trustee on behalf of the parochial church councils,
which have only limited powers of holding property. The Central Board of
Finance administers the Church Assembly Fund, supported by diocesan
contributions, and devoted to the maintenance of central services, including
capital expenditure on training colleges and theological colleges and the
grants for training candidates for ordination.1
The State makes no payment direct to the Church as such, though it
pays for the services of chaplains in the armed forces and in prisons and
hospitals, and contributes substantially to the maintenance of Church schools
and training colleges.
1 A small standing body has been set up by the Archbishops to bring the needs
and resources of the Church of England under continuous review.

BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
The Anglican
Communion
The Church of
Scotland
The endowment income of the Church is mainly administered by the
Church Commissioners, the body largely responsible for the payment of
clergy stipends and the provision of finance for pensions, new churches,
parsonage houses and church schools. Income from the Commissioners’
investments (some £16 million) has greatly increased during the past ten
years; in broad terms, this has meant a rise in the stipends of the poorer
clergy and that the Commissioners have been able to embark on schemes
of assistance for providing better parsonage houses, for church buildings
in new areas of population, and for better pensions for clergy and their
widows.
The Anglican Communion comprises 17 autonomous churches in the United
Kingdom and overseas, with a total membership of over 40 million.
In the British Isles, in addition to the established Church of England,
there are unestablished Anglican Churches in Ireland, Scotland and Wales:
the Church of Ireland (disestablished in 1869) has 6 dioceses wholly or
partly in Northern Ireland, with 345,000 members in that country; the
Episcopal Church in Scotland, 7 dioceses and some 98,000 members; and
the Church in Wales (disestablished in 1920), 6 dioceses and some 200,000
Easter communicants.
Outside the United Kingdom, the Anglican Communion exists wherever
its members have gone as settlers, traders and missionaries. The Protestant
Episcopal Church in the United States of America (with its missionary
dioceses in Latin America and the Philippines), the Church of India,
Pakistan, Burma and Ceylon, and the Anglican Churches of South Africa,
Canada, Australia, New Zealand, the West Indies, China, Japan, West
Africa and Central Africa are all autonomous members of the Anglican
Communion. In the Middle East, Jerusalem now has the status of an arch¬
bishopric with jurisdiction over five dioceses in the region. A new province
of East Africa includes five dioceses in Kenya and Tanganyika. In Uganda,
Rwanda and Burundi a province has been formed which comprises eight
dioceses. In South East Asia the Anglican dioceses have formed a regional
council which already has a measure of autonomy. In addition, there remain
a number of overseas dioceses under the jurisdiction of the Archbishop of
Canterbury. There is limited intercommunion with the Church of South
India, and between that Church and the Church of India, Pakistan, Burma
and Ceylon.
Since 1867 the Lambeth Conference has met every tenth year (except for
the war years) for unofficial consultation between all Anglican bishops; it is
presided over by the Archbishop of Canterbury. The last meeting, held in
London in 1958, was attended by 310 bishops from all parts of the Anglican
Communion. The conference has no executive authority, but enjoys great
moral prestige, and its findings on doctrine, discipline, relations with other
communions, and on the attitude of the Anglican churches to political and
social questions are widely studied.
An executive officer of the Anglican Communion is the secretary of the
Anglican Advisory Council on Missionary Strategy, and exercises general
supervision on behalf of the consultative body of the Lambeth Conference
over all matters affecting the welfare of the Anglican Communion which
call for attention between the meetings of the conference.
The established church in Scotland is the presbyterian Church of Scotland.
It has been described as ‘the supreme example of a church which is established
THE CHURCHES
201
The Free
Churches
The Methodist
Churches
and yet is free’. Its position, defined in the Treaty of Union, 1707, was
further safeguarded by the Church of Scotland Act, 1921, under which it
has complete internal self-government within the terms of the schedule to
the Act, ‘Articles Declaratory of the Faith of the Church of Scotland’.
Whereas in episcopacy church government is a hierarchy of persons, in
presbyterianism there is a hierarchy of courts. All ministers are of equal
status, and each of the 2,200 churches is governed locally by the Kirk Session,
consisting of the minister and elected elders (of whom there are nearly
47,000 in all); above this is the Court of the Presbytery, then the Court of
the Synod, and finally the General Assembly, which meets annually and
consists of elected ministers and elders presided over by an elected Moderator
who serves for one year. The Sovereign is represented at the General Assembly
by the Lord High Commissioner. The Church of Scotland has fought with
the utmost vigour throughout the years for complete freedom in all spiritual
matters and for the right to appoint its own officers and to decide all matters
of doctrine and discipline. This freedom is recognised by Parliament, and
the decisions of the Church of Scotland are not subject to parliamentary
debate or modification.
The thorough training for the ministry, which lasts at least six years, has
given the church a high reputation for scholarship and has in turn influenced
the standard of education in Scotland. The membership of the Church of
Scotland is estimated at about 1,280,000.
The phrase ‘Free Churches’ is now commonly used to describe those churches
in England which were more generally known in the past as ‘nonconformist’
churches; and protestant churches in Scotland (except the established
Church of Scotland), Wales and Northern Ireland. The main Free Churches
are the Methodist, Baptist and Congregational Churches, and the unestablished
presbyterian churches throughout Britain. In addition, there are a number
of other protestant denominations in the United Kingdom as well as such
religious associations as the Society of Friends and the Salvation Army,
which have certain links with the main Free Churches.
The word ‘nonconformist’ signifies dissent from certain of the formularies
and practices of the established church. The Methodist Church, for example,
originated in the evangelical revival led by John Wesley within the Church
of England during the eighteenth century. In general, the Free Churches
base their reason for existence on their distinctive convictions regarding
organisation and worship.
The largest of the Free Churches is the Methodist Church, formed in 1932
by the union of the majority of separate Methodist Churches. It has over
723,000 adult full members. The supreme authority is the annual conference
and the system of government is in many ways presbyterian, the leaders’
meeting corresponding to the kirk sessions, with circuit meetings and district
synods resembling presbytery and synod. One of the characteristics of
Methodism is its strong emphasis on lay leadership. There are some 22,100
trained lay preachers sharing the work of 4,500 ministers and preaching in
many local churches.
Methodist Churches which did not join the union in 1932 include: the
Independent Methodists, in which ministerial service is on a purely voluntary
basis and women (many of whom are ministers) have full equality with men;
and the Wesleyan Reform Union (with some 5,900 members) which, while
retaining the essential Methodist doctrine, gives autonomy to each of its
160 individual churches.

The Congregationalists are the oldest community of dissenters in Britain.
In 1831 most of their churches were formed into the Congregational Union.
Local churches have formed county and national unions, whose secretariat
and assemblies have much influence, but no compulsive authority over them,
since great importance is attached to the autonomy of local church meetings.
Adult membership is approximately 206,800.
Like the Congregationalists, the Baptists are for the most part grouped
in associations of churches and the majority of these belong to the Baptist
Union formed in 1813. Baptists differ from Congregationalists in that they
practise the baptism of believers only; they do not baptise infants. The
Baptist churches have about 310,000 members.
The Presbyterian Church in Ireland has a total membership in Northern
Ireland of about 413,000. The Presbyterian (or Calvinistic Methodist)
Church of Wales, which arose from the revivalist movement led by Howell
Harris in 1735, numbers some 134,000. The Presbyterian Church of England
has nearly 71,100 members; its highest court is its general assembly; women
are admitted to the eldership and ministry.
Other presbyterian churches in Britain include: the Free Church of Scotland;
the United Free Church of Scotland; the Free Presbyterian Church of Scotland;
the Reformed Presbyterian Church of Scotland; the Reformed Presbyterian
Church of Ireland; and the Non-Subscribing Presbyterian Church of Ireland.
Among other Protestant denominations in the United Kingdom are: the
Unitarian and Free Christian Churches; the Churches of Christ (known also
in the United States of America as Disciples of Christ) which have been an
organised community in Britain since early in the nineteenth century; the
British Province of the Moravian Church, which is an international missionary
church; the Free Church of England (or Reformed Episcopal Church),
which was formed in 1844 as a direct result of the Oxford Movement; the
Society of Friends; and the Salvation Army.
The Society of Friends, or Quakers, came into being in the middle of the
seventeenth century under the leadership of George Fox. A distinctive feature
is the way of worship: outward sacraments are not observed and there is no
separate ministry. Friends place great emphasis on work for peace, and their
influence in many parts of the world, especially in social reform and in the
relief of suffering, is very wide in relation to their numbers. There are 437
Quaker Meetings in Britain and over 21,000 members; and the Society has
nine schools (the pupils and staff of which are not exclusively Quaker).
The Salvation Army, founded in 1878 by a Methodist, William Booth, is a
religious movement, composed of men and women who seek the spiritual
and social betterment of their fellows, primarily by preaching the gospel to
those hitherto untouched by religious effort. The movement, in which
military rather than ecclesiastical terminology is used, has branches all over
the world, and its social work (particularly that connected with the welfare of
members of the British armed forces serving overseas) is well supported.
The Christian Scientists, who are in no way connected with any other
church, have about 340 branch churches and societies in Britain.
The Roman Catholic hierarchy in England and Wales, which became
temporarily extinct during the sixteenth century, was restored in 1850; the
Scottish hierarchy became extinct in the early seventeenth century and was
restored in 1878, while the Irish hierarchy never became completely extinct.
The normal government of the Roman Catholic Church, namely by territorial
THE CHURCHES 203
archbishops and bishops, is once again the rule in the whole of the United
Kingdom.
The central territorial unit of the Roman Catholic hierarchical organisation
is the province or archdiocese under the metropolitan, who is always an
archbishop. The chairman of the bench of bishops in England and Wales is
the Archbishop of Westminster. A province normally comprises several
dioceses, each under a bishop aided by a chapter of canons and others, and
by priests in charge of the parishes into which the diocese is subdivided. In
England and Wales there are four provinces and archdioceses (Westminster,
Liverpool, Birmingham and Cardiff), 14 dioceses, and nearly 2,300parishes;
in Scotland there are two provinces and archdioceses (St. Andrews and
Edinburgh, and Glasgow), six dioceses, and about 400 parishes; in Northern
Ireland there are six dioceses (several of which have territory partly in the
Irish Republic and partly in Northern Ireland since there is one hierarchy
for the whole of Ireland) and about 170 parishes. In the whole of the United
Kingdom there are some five million adherents (including children) to the
Roman Catholic faith.
The Roman Catholic Church attaches great importance to the education
of its children in their own faith, and requires that the children of marriages
between its own members and members of any other denomination should be
brought up as Roman Catholics. Many schools for Roman Catholic children
in the United Kingdom are staffed by members of the Religious Orders for
men and women, who also undertake other social work such as nursing,
child care, and the conduct of homes for the aged.
Jewry Jews first settled in England at the time of the Norman conquest, but were
expelled at the end of the thirteenth century by an edict of Edward I. The
present Anglo-Jewish community dates from 1656, the earliest arrivals being
the Sephardi (from Spain and Portugal). At the end of the seventeenth
century an Ashkenazi community (from Germany and East Europe) was
established, which increased rapidly and spread to the principal provincial
cities. As a result of the virtual destruction of whole Jewish communities on
the Continent during the second world war, the present Anglo-Jewish com¬
munity of some 450,000 is the largest group of Jews in Europe.
The Anglo-Jewish community is divided into two schools of thought,
each of which has its own form of worship and its own services: the Orthodox
(the original groups) and the Reform. The Reform Movement, which attaches
less religious importance to some of the ancient rituals and practices of the
Jewish faith, began in 1840. It was followed in 1901 by the establishment of
the Liberal Jewish Movement which, in addition, lays emphasis on the re¬
interpretation of traditional Judaism in the light of modern thought and
custom. Of the Jews in Great Britain who belong to any kind of synagogue,
about 80 per cent are Orthodox. The Chief Rabbi is the head of the largest
group (Ashkenazi) within Orthodox Jewry; the Haham is the head of the
Sephardi group.
Synagogues in Britain number approximately 450. There has been an
increase in the number of Jewish denominational schools, which are now
attended by about one in seven Jewish children; other Jewish children attend
the ordinary State or independent schools and receive extra-curricular
instruction in the Jewish faith.
Other Religious Many immigrants to Britain from overseas Commonwealth countries and
Communities foreign countries have established centres for worship for their own commun¬
ities in the United Kingdom, and especially in London. The Christian
204
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
communities include the Greek, Russian, Polish and Serb Orthodox, with
some Estonian and Latvian Orthodox, and also the Armenian Church. There
are also churches belonging to the Lutheran Churches of Denmark, Finland,
Germany, Norway and Sweden, and centres where Estonian, Latvian and
Polish Lutherans worship according to their creed. In addition, the French,
Dutch, Swiss, Hungarian and Polish Reformed Churches are represented in
Britain, the first three having their own places of worship.
There are also a number of other religious sects of British or foreign origin;
figures of membership in Britain of most of them are not available.
The principal non-Christian communities in Britain, apart from the Jews, are
the Moslems and the Buddhists. The Moslems are the more widely represented;
it is estimated that the Islamic population of Britain may now number about
200,000, of whom some 2,000 are in the Muslim Society of Great Britain.
Their principal mosque is the Shah Jehan Mosque at Woking, and there are
also mosques in London, Birmingham, Manchester, Cardiff and Glasgow.
The Buddhist temple is in South Kensington, London. There is also a
meeting place and discussion centre for the several thousand adherents of
Buddism in Britain.
Co-operation
between the
Churches
An outstanding feature of recent years has been the growth of co-operation
between the Churches. The British Council of Churches, founded in 1942,
includes official representatives from almost all the churches of the British
Isles, with the exception of the Roman Catholic Church. The Council
facilitates common action between the churches and seeks to further the cause
of Christian unity. The Archbishop of Canterbury is president. In addition,
most, though not all, of the Free Churches in England and Wales are members
of the Free Church Federal Council (formed in 1940 by the amalgamation
of the Federal Council of Evangelical Free Churches with the National Free
Church Council), the aims of which are to promote unity and joint action
between the Free Churches, and to provide a channel through which the
Free Churches can communicate and negotiate with central and local gov¬
ernment authorities as a united body. The report of the conversations held
during the past six years between representatives of the Church of England
and the Methodist Church visualised union between the churches in two
stages: the first to be a period of full communion during which the two
churches remain distinct, and the second to be the achievement of organic
union. Discussions on changes in organisation to allow of closer relations have
also been taking place between the Church of England, the Church of Scotland,
the Episcopal Church in Scotland, and the Presbyterian Church of England.
The Archbishop of Canterbury is advised on these matters, both at home
and abroad, by the Church of England Council on Foreign Relations.
The Anglican, Presbyterian and Free Churches in the British Isles also
participate in the World Council of Churches, which was constituted at
Amsterdam, Netherlands, in 1948; its third assembly was held in the autumn
of 1961 in New Dehli, India. The council links together 171 churches in over
50 countries for co-operation in action and the study of common problems.
Co-operation of other Churches with the Roman Catholic Church takes
place on some specific issues through the Churches’ Main Committee. The
Council of Christians and Jews works for better understanding between
members of the two religions and deals with problems arising in the social field.

PROMOTION OF THE
SCIENCES AND THE ARTS
THE PROMOTION OF THE SCIENCES
Learned societies and independent scientific institutions play a large part in
promoting the sciences in Britain, although they do very little actual research.
Most pure research is conducted in the universities, which also play an
essential part in maintaining the supply of trained scientists. A very large
part of scientific research, especially applied research, has become the concern
of industry and of Government departments and public corporations, a
number of which maintain their own research establishments.
Today it is an acknowledged responsibility of the Government not only
to undertake research directly but also to keep under review facilities for the
training of scientists, to encourage fundamental research, to finance certain
research projects, and to ensure that adequate research is directed to matters
of national interest. As a result, a system of collaboration which leaves the
greatest possible measure of freedom to individual scientists has developed
between the universities, industry and the Government. The learned societies,
members of which work in all three, play an important part in the discussion
and publication of the results of research. Important work is also undertaken
by independent organisations.
THE PATTERN OF According to the most recent official estimate, published in the report of the
EXPENDITURE Advisory Council on Scientific Policy for 1961-62, total expenditure on
research and development in the United Kingdom increased from £300 million
in 1955-56 to £634 million in 1961-62. This represented 2-7 per cent of the
gross national product compared with 1-7 per cent in 1955-56. Of the total
of £634 million, about £67 million was capital expenditure. The cost of
research carried out in 1961-62 and the sources of funds is shown in Table 8.
This shows that in 1961-62 private industry carried out 58 per cent of
all research and development and provided 33-6 per cent of the funds;
whereas Government departments provided over 60 per cent of the funds,
and carried out only 28 per cent of the research. In the last six years expendi¬
ture on research and development (other than defence) has trebled. Proportions
of research falling in the various sectors of private industry are given on p. 213.
THE LEARNED
SOCIETIES
The learned societies have had a profound and lasting influence upon the
development and organisation of science in Britain. They have provided the
background for continuity of research from the seventeenth century onwards,
a forum for scientists to exchange ideas and a reliable source from which
new ideas for the enrichment of knowledge can flow. Although today most
research is conducted under other auspices, the learned societies have retained
their traditional function of facilitating the spread of scientific knowledge.
At present there are oyer 200 learned scientific societies in Britain with
approximately 400 scientific publications. There are also numerous technical
institutions and professional associations, many of which are playing a dis-

in the education and professional well-being of their members. Prominent
examples of these are the British Medical Association, the Institutions of
Civil Engineers, Mechanical Engineers, Electrical Engineers, Chemical
Engineers, Metallurgists; the Royal Institute of Chemistry, the Institute of
Physics and the Physical Society and the Institute of Biology.
The most eminent of the learned societies concerned with science in its
broadest aspects (as distinct from those societies with specialised interests
and activities) are the Royal Society, Royal Society of Arts, Royal Institution
and British Association.
The Royal Society, or more fully, the Royal Society of London for the
Improvement of Natural Knowledge, founded in 1660, occupies a unique
place in the country’s scientific affairs (and corresponds to national academies
of science in other countries). Election to it is regarded by scientists as
a high honour. The Queen is Patron. There are today three main cate¬
gories of Fellowship: Royal Fellows, comprising the Queen Mother and three
Royal Dukes; Foreign Members, of whom there are about 65; and the main
body of Fellows, numbering about 625. Election to the Fellowship, which is
for life, is restricted to 25 persons a year and to foreign membership to four a
year. The Society is governed by a council of 21 members.
Its present activities include the holding of scientific meetings; publication
of research work, mainly in the Philosophical Transactions and the Proceedings;
the presentation of medals; the giving of endowed lectures; and the award of
research appointments and grants. The highest medal awarded is the Copley
Medal, for which scientists from all countries are eligible; there are also two
Royal Medals, and the Rumford, Darwin, Buchanan, Sylvester and Hughes
Medals. There are five lectureships: the Croonian (biology); the Bakerian
(physical sciences); the Ferrier (nervous system); the Wilkins (history of
science); and the Leeuwenhoek (microbiology). Events to mark the ter¬
centenary of the Society in i960 included the foundation of the Wolfson
Research Professorship of the Royal Society and the Leverhulme Tercentenary
Medal for the most important contribution to pure or applied chemistry or
PROMOTION OF THE SCIENCES AND THE ARTS 207
engineering. In 1962 the Henry Dale Research Professorship was instituted
by an endowment from the Wellcome Trustees.
Although an independent private corporation, the Society has always had
a special relationship with the Government, which provides its accommodation
and makes grants for research activities administered by it. The President of
the Society is consulted on some appointments to Government research
councils and Fellows serve on most governmental advisory councils and
committees concerned with research.
The Society represents the United Kingdom in the international unions
comprising the International Council of Scientific Unions (ICSU) and appoints
national committees for each of them.
The Royal Society of Arts (properly, the Royal Society for the Encourage¬
ment of Arts, Manufactures and Commerce) has a character at once scientific,
artistic, technical, industrial and commercial. Since its foundation in 1754,
however, one of the Society’s principal objects has been to promote the progress
and application to the useful ends of all departments of science. Today it fulfils
this purpose chiefly by disseminating new scientific knowledge. The Society
regularly holds meetings for the delivery of lectures, and publishes a monthly
Journal, thus providing effective media for the exposition and assessment by
leading authorities of developments which have a public as well as a specialist
interest.
The Royal Institution was founded in 1799 as a public body for facilitating
the introduction of useful mechanical inventions and improvements, and for
teaching the application of science to everyday life. Later it undertook the
‘promotion of chemical science by experiments and lectures for improving
arts and manufactures’, and ‘the diffusion and extension of useful knowledge’.
Its character, however, was largely determined by the work of Sir Humphry
Davy and Michael Faraday, who established a tradition of research. Today,
the Royal Institution has extensive research laboratories, and lectures are
given on recent developments in science and other branches of knowledge.
Its library of some 60,000 books includes many early scientific works and
manuscripts.
The British Association for the Advancement of Science was founded in 1831
to promote general interest in science and its applications. One of its chief
activities is the Annual Meeting, attended by many young students as well
as by eminent scientists. Its 14 sections cover the whole range of pure and
applied science other than medical science, and there is a division for studying
the social and international relations of science. In addition to the annual
meeting and in order to extend its influence, the Association plans continuous
activities throughout the year, in particular special lectures, exhibitions and
discussions (some designed for young audiences), the publication of pamphlets,
the organisation of conferences, the appointment of study groups and liaison
with the press and with sound and television broadcasting services. The
Association has set up area committees and three lectureships for young
scientists—the Kelvin, the Darwin and the Lister lectureships, dealing
respectively with the physical, biological and sociological sciences—to
encourage scientists to make their activities known to wider audiences.
Collaboration with other scientific organisations has always been an important
function of the British Association, and it has an organised relationship with
over 150 scientific bodies and learned societies. It has also played an im¬
portant part in the development of science by taking or recommending action
to remove obstacles to the discovery and application of scientific knowledge.

Statistics, based on replies to questions put to a 10 per cent sample of the
population at the 1961 census, show that in 1961 there were 287,610 people
in Great Britain with scientific and technological qualifications (136,520
scientists and 151,090 engineers and technologists). On the basis of a survey
made in 1956 the Committee on Scientific Manpower of the Advisory Council
on Scientific Policy estimated that the number of scientists and engineers
qualifying annually would need to be raised from 10,000 in 1956 to 20,000
between 1966 and 1971. The Government accepted this figure as a reasonable
goal and supported measures to ensure that the universities and technical
colleges together would be able to produce at least this number. In 1961
the Committee reported that this target was likely to be reached by 1965
and an output of 30,000 by 1972 was possible. The prospect of an adequate
supply was welcome as it would enable those trained in scientific disciplines
to be available for management, administration and the professions generally.
During recent years there has been a considerable expansion of scientific and
technological training and research facilities within the universities. For
example, the Imperial College of Science and Technology, London, the
Royal College of Science and Technology, Glasgow, and the Manchester
College of Science and Technology provide degree and postgraduate courses
for the universities with which they are associated. At the new Churchill
College, Cambridge, 70 per cent of places are allocated to students of scientific
and technological subjects. More than half of all students at universities are
now studying some branch of science or technology.
Most universities in the United Kingdom have faculties of engineering,
some of them including chemical, aeronautical and production engineering.
Universities in industrial centres have long been renowned for studies relating
to their local industries, such as metallurgy at Birmingham, Sheffield,
Swansea and other centres of the metals and metal-using industries, and
naval architecture and marine engineering at Glasgow, Liverpool and
Newcastle upon Tyne. In the textile areas, Manchester offers courses in
textile chemistry and engineering and Leeds has specialised in courses and
research in connection with the wool textile industry, including colour
chemistry and dyeing. Leeds is the only university in Britain that has a
department devoted to the study of leather manufacture, and Manchester
offers courses in paper and machine tool technology. Sheffield is unique for
its department of glass technology—the pioneer among such departments in
the world. Aeronautical engineering is a main subject for first degree courses
at Bristol, Cambridge, London, Manchester, Southampton, Glasgow and
Belfast. Birmingham and London offer first degree courses in oil technology.
All universities and university colleges in the United Kingdom have
laboratories or research departments.1 The Government research councils
award a substantial number of studentships for postgraduate training in
science and technology, as well as post-doctoral research fellowships; the
National Research Development Corporation (see p. 224) awards development
contracts to university departments; and leading firms in such industries as
chemicals, oil, motor vehicles, textiles, electrical equipment, food, and mining
provide grants for specific research projects or endow research fellowships,
such as the Imperial Chemical Industries and Leverhulme Fellowships, or
1 The many topics under investigation in these laboratories and in those of the major
technical colleges, are listed in Scientific Research in British Universities and Colleges
(see Bibliography).

professorships. Foundations which provide similar benefactions include the
Nuffield Foundation, the Ford Foundation, the Carnegie Trust, the Wellcome
Trust and Courtaulds’ Scientific and Educational Trust Fund. Among
individuals whose major contributions to universities have included provision
for research facilities have been Lord Nuffield, with gifts to the Clarendon
Laboratory, Oxford, Lord Austin, who provided new buildings for the
Cavendish Laboratory, Cambridge, members of the Wills family, who
financed the Physics Laboratory at Bristol, members of the Boot family at
Nottingham and of the Brotherton family at Leeds.
Co-operation between industry and commerce and the universities and
colleges of advanced technology is common. A notable example is the
Manchester Joint Research Council, set up in 1944 by the Manchester
Chamber of Commerce and the University of Manchester, which have equal
representation on it; this body organises lectures and discussion meetings
and conducts investigations into the use made of research by industry.
Another is the Glass Delegation of the University of Sheffield, which directs
the work of the Department of Glass Technology and is composed of members
appointed by the Council of the University and representatives of firms and
companies who subscribe funds for training and research. An example of
co-operation between a Government department, an independent organisation
and a university is the radio telescope at the Nuffield Radio Astronomy
Observatory, Jodrell Bank, Cheshire (see p. 222), financed jointly by the
Department of Scientific and Industrial Research, the Nuffield Foundation,
Lord Nuffield personally and Manchester University, the last having been
responsible for its development.
The Government’s plans for a large-scale and rapid expansion of education
in advanced technology include the increase in advanced work at Colleges
of Advanced Technology (in England and Wales), Central Institutions (in
Scotland) and technical colleges, as well as at the universities (see p. 173).
Most postgraduate studentships and fellowships awarded by the Govern¬
ment research councils may be held at colleges of advanced technology and
technical colleges as well as at universities.
The active participation by the Government in scientific research is for the
most part a development of the twentieth century, though its association with
science dates back to a much earlier period. In 1675, King Charles II
established Britain’s first State-supported research institution—the Royal
Greenwich Observatory (now transferred to Herstmonceux, Sussex)—to
correct the tables of the positions of the moon and fixed stars ‘for the use
of his seamen’. The Geological Survey of Great Britain, the first national
institution of its kind in the world, was founded in 1835. I^42 Board
of Inland Revenue established a chemical laboratory which eventually
developed into the Laboratory of the Government Chemist; and in 1854
the Meteorological Office was established by the Board of Trade. All these
Government departments were using scientific knowledge, but there was
little organised effort towards the application of the discoveries made in pure
science. The research councils were founded at various dates from 1916
onwards. The present organisation of Government research is summarised
in the following pages.
The two main bodies which advise the Government on general scientific
policy are, for civil science, the Advisory Council on Scientific Policy (ACSP)
210
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Ministerial
Re sponsibility

Scientific
Research
The Research
Councils
and, for defence, the Defence Research Policy Committee (DRPC), both
established in 1947.
The present terms of reference of the ACSP are ‘to advise the Minister
for Science in the exercise of his responsibilities for the formulation and
execution of Government scientific policy’. Membership consists mainly of
scientists drawn from the universities, industry and government service; it
includes the chairman of the DRPC, the Secretaries of the four executive
research councils (see below), the chairman of the University Grants
Committee (see p. 171), the deputy chairman of the Atomic Energy Authority
(see p. 219) and a representative of the Treasury, together with about the
same number of distinguished scientists from the universities and industry
appointed by the Minister for Science. The Council has both standing and
ad hoc committees. These generally include distinguished scientists and
industrialists who are not members of the Council. The present standing
committees are those for scientific manpower, overseas scientific relations,
and statistics. The Council considers not only questions on which its advice
is sought by the Minister for Science, but also matters which the Council
itself considers important and timely.
There are also other bodies concerned in an advisory or co-ordinating
capacity with particular aspects of civil research policy, such as the Steering
Group on Space Research, the Natural Resources (Technical) Committee
and the Overseas Research Council.
The DRPC is an inter-departmental body with executive responsibilities,
the members being government officials responsible for the operational and
scientific aspects of research and their development for defence purposes.
Its terms of reference are: {a) to advise the Minister of Defence and the
Chiefs of Staff on all scientific and technical matters which may affect the
formulation and direction of defence policy, and (b) to keep under review
the defence research and development programme so as to ensure that it is
appropriate to current defence policy, having regard to available resources.
Ministerial responsibilities for Government scientific organisation were re¬
arranged in 1959. A Minister for Science was appointed in conjunction with
one of the ancient Offices of State traditionally within the Cabinet (at present
that of Lord President of the Council) to be responsible to Parliament for
the Research Councils (see below) and to exercise ministerial functions
under the Atomic Energy Acts, and general supervision over the programme
of space research.
Other ministers remain responsible for the scientific establishments within
their own departments; but the Minister for Science, advised by the ACSP,
is broadly responsible for civil scientific policy. He has an administrative
staff, known as the Office of the Minister for Science, composed of a general
science division and an atomic energy division.
A Committee on Management and Control of Research and Development,
set up in 1958 by the Lord President of the Council, formulated in its report
in 1961 standards of good practice which have been accepted by the Govern¬
ment as widely applicable to its research and development organisations.
There are five research councils under the Minister for Science: the Agri¬
cultural Research Council, the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research,
the Medical Research Council, the Nature Conservancy, and the Overseas
Research Council. These councils are responsible to their respective Com¬
mittees of the Privy Council, of which the members are the Minister for

Science (chairman) and those ministers whose departments have a special
interest in the work of the particular council. Members of the councils are
appointed by the appropriate Privy Council Committee.
All departments rely on one or other of the Government research councils
for scientific advice. While some use these bodies as their main source of
scientific information, a few have research organisations of their own. Re¬
search and development is undertaken by the Service Departments primarily
to meet the requirements of the armed forces, but a substantial amount of
this work has important civil applications, for instance, in land transport,
aviation, navigation and meteorology. Departmental research concerned with
industry, medicine and agriculture is summarised below.
The Minister of Power is responsible for research on safety in mines. The
nationalised coal, electricity and gas industries are required to submit their
research plans for his concurrence.
The Ministry of Transport is concerned with research into road construction
(see p. 372) and also into aspects of marine navigation and marine propulsion,
most of the basic work being carried out for the Ministry by the Admiralty
and the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research. Research on
radio aids for marine navigation is undertaken by the Admiralty, which is
also responsible for inter-Service electronic valve research, and for the admin¬
istration of the Royal Greenwich Observatory, at Herstmonceux, and the
National Institute of Oceanography. The Government’s programme of
research on marine nuclear propulsion is undertaken by the Atomic Energy
Authority.
The Ministry of Aviation, which carries out most of the research needed
to meet the technical requirements of air defence, is also responsible for some
civil research, for instance, at the Royal Aircraft Establishment and the
National Gas Turbine Establishment at Farnborough, and at the Royal
Radar Establishment, Malvern. Some fundamental research is carried out for
the Ministry by universities and industrial organisations. The Ministry of
Aviation is also responsible for research into airport operations and air
traffic control.
The Air Ministry finances the Meteorological Office, which is responsible
for research in meteorology and geophysics, mainly directed to non-military
ends. The headquarters of the Office and most of its research sections are
at Bracknell, Berkshire. The Forecasting Research Section has been equipped
with a large-capacity electronic computer. Balloon and aircraft soundings and
radar techniques are used to investigate the movement and composition of
the atmosphere, and instruments are being designed which will be used in
rockets and an earth-satellite. The Air Ministry also makes grants for funda¬
mental meteorological research carried out under the auspices of the Royal
Society or in university departments.
The Ministry of Housing and Local Government deals with geographical,
geological, economic and sociological research relating to the use and develop¬
ment of land in England and Wales. Similar arrangements are made in
Scotland by the Scottish Home and Health Department, and in Northern
Ireland by the Ministry of Health and Local Government.
The Post Office undertakes scientific research and development on a wide
range of subjects, ranging from the mechanisation of mail handling to line
and radio systems for telecommunications. When the work reaches the

development stage it is usual to co-operate closely with industry so that the
final product will be jointly engineered. The new electronic telephone
exchange now in service at Highgate Wood is an example (see p. 394)*
Another is the submarine telephone cable system provided to Canada in 1961,
to be followed by a second system due to span the Pacific to Australia by the
end of 1963 (see p. 394). In this instance the research and development was
carried out by a unit run jointly by the Post Office and Cable and Wireless
Limited, a Government-owned company concerned with long distance over¬
seas communications. Experiments with communications satellites are being
conducted in conjunction with various other countries, notably the United
States, and the Ministry of Aviation is conducting a design study for a
communications satellite.
The past ten years have seen appreciable expansion of research in the human
sciences, including anthropology, sociology, psychology and demography.
Government participation in this has been mainly through the Medical
Research Council, in its socio-medical studies, and the Council of Scientific
and Industrial Research, in some applied researches at its establishments.
The Council of Scientific and Industrial Research, advised by its Human
Sciences Committee, awards fellowships and postgraduate studentships at
universities and colleges of advanced technology for research in human
sciences in relation to the needs of industry. Its Warren Spring Laboratory
maintains a register of British research which now lists over 300 projects in
hand in colleges, Government departments, industrial associations and firms.
Other Government departments active in this field include the Home Office,
which has its own research unit, and the Central Office of Information, with
its Social Survey Division which conducts sample survey inquiries at the
request of all Government departments and from time to time also carries
out studies in collaboration with universities and other independent research
organisations. The Government set up in June 1963 an independent Com¬
mittee of Inquiry to review research in social studies in Government depart¬
ments, universities and other institutions, and to advise whether changes
are needed in arrangements for supporting and co-ordinating research.
There are a number of scientific institutions administered by Government
departments which undertake research work in addition to their other scientific
activities. These include the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, founded in 1759
and now administered by the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food,
which has the largest collection of living plants in the world. Its three research
departments are: the Herbarium, concerned primarily with the classification
and accurate determination of plants; the Jodrell Laboratory, for the study
of plant anatomy and plant physiology, cytology and genetics; and the
Museum of Economic Botany, dealing with the economic exploitation of
plants. The library, attached to the herbarium, was founded in 1853; it
consists of more than 55,000 botanical books, about 80,000 reprints and
separately issued items and a collection of over 150,000 drawings and paintings
of plants.
The Parliamentary and Scientific Committee was founded at the end of 1939
by members of the House of Commons and replaced the former Parliamentary
Science Committee. It is one of a number of unofficial, all-party parliamentary
groups which have grown up spontaneously and have varying degrees of
influence. Membership is open to members of Parliament of any party in
both Houses, and also to nominated representatives of such non-profit-

making scientific and technological organisations in Britain as may be affiliated
under its constitution. The committee provides, as far as possible, for a
regular exchange of information between members of Parliament and
scientists.
According to the report of the Advisory Council on Scientific Policy (see
p. 209) total expenditure by the different industrial sectors in 1961-62
(excluding establishments of less than 100 employees) was as follows (in
£ million): aircraft 140-6; electronics 49-9; chemicals and allied industries
39-7; electrical engineering 36-2; mechanical and marine engineering and
shipbuilding 33-7; metal manufacture io-o; motor vehicles, locomotives, etc.,
9-8; scientific instruments 9-2; textiles, leather, etc., 8-7; food, drink and
tobacco 7-1; mineral oil refining 6-o; construction 1-5; other manufacturing
industries 13-5.
The greater part of industrial research in Britain is undertaken in the
research organisations of the larger firms. The other main agencies are
Government laboratories, universities and technical colleges, industrial
research associations, independent institutes for sponsored research and
consultant laboratories.
The need for research in physics and engineering, and particularly into
methods of precise measurement, led to the establishment in 1900 of the
National Physical Laboratory under the control of the Royal Society, with
a small grant from the Treasury towards equipment and a yearly grant
towards upkeep. Government recognition of the importance of scientific re¬
search and its applications was hastened by the first world war, and the
Department of Scientific and Industrial Research (DSIR) was established in
1916 as a separate Government department. In 1918 the DSIR took over
financial responsibility for the National Physical Laboratory from the Royal
Society, but the Society appoints a general board and an executive committee
which supervise scientific policy.
The DSIR is responsible to the Committee of the Privy Council for
Scientific and Industrial Research. It is governed by a Council for Scientific
and Industrial Research, known as the Research Council.
The Research Council consists of as many members as the Minister for
Science may determine; in 1962 it had a chairman and 14 members. It is
entrusted with the organisation, development and encouragement of scientific
and industrial research and with the dissemination of the results. In particular,
it may: (1) encourage and support scientific research in universities, technical
colleges and other institutions; (2) establish or develop institutions or depart¬
ments of institutions for investigation and research relating to the advancement
of trade and industry; and (3) take steps to further the practical application
of the results of scientific and industrial research.
These functions are discharged through the Department’s own 15 research
establishments and through the autonomous industrial research associations.
The Council makes grants to aid researches of timeliness and promise in
universities and colleges and awards postgraduate studentships and post¬
doctoral fellowships to young scientists in training.
The research stations operated by DSIR are as follows: the Building
Research Station near Watford, Hertfordshire, is concerned with the techniques
of building design and construction, and the organisation, productivity, and
economics of building work; the Forest Products Research Laboratory at
Princes Risborough, 36 miles west of London, studies the mechanical,

Geological Survey and Museum, with headquarters in London and branch
offices in Edinburgh and Leeds, maps the geological structure of the United
Kingdom and publishes information on mineral resources of special import¬
ance, including underground water supplies; the Hydraulics Research Station
at Wallingford, on the River Thames, studies problems of water flow in open
channels such as rivers, estuaries and harbours, and coastal erosion; the Joint
Fire Research Organisation, controlled jointly with the Fire Offices’ Com¬
mittee, is concerned with the detection, suppression, and inhibition of fires
and the safety of life in fires; the Laboratory of the Government Chemist in
London has a statutory function as official analyst and as an adjudicator in
cases of disputed analyses and also carries out analytical research and advisory
work for Government departments on request; the National Chemical
Laboratory at Teddington, near London, concentrates on basic chemical
research applicable to a wide variety of industries which is not being done
elsewhere; the National Engineering Laboratory at East Kilbride, south of
Glasgow, carries out basic and applied research in mechanical engineering
to provide industry with information required to solve its own particular
problems and has unique facilities for making precision engineering measure¬
ments and testing hydraulic machinery and heat exchange plant; the National
Physical Laboratory at Teddington conducts research in various branches of
non-nuclear physics and maintains British primary standards and physical
units; the Radio Research Station at Slough, west of London, carries out
research on radio wave propagation and radio noise, taking advantage, in
particular, of the new techniques provided by rockets and artificial satellites,
and its space research programme also includes a tracking and prediction
service and the maintenance of one of the World Data Centres for space
research; the Road Research Laboratory at Harmondsworth, west of London,
does research on road construction, safety and traffic flow; the Torry Research
Station at Aberdeen (with a branch laboratory at Hull) investigates problems
arising in the handling, processing, and transport and storage of fish; the
Tropical Products Institute in London aims at improving the economical
viability of the less-developed countries of the tropics, especially those
within the Commonwealth, by research into new uses for tropical plant and
animal products; the Warren Spring Laboratory near Stevenage, Hertford¬
shire, provides facilities for research and development, including pilot-scale
work on subjects of national importance which cannot be fitted into the
programme of other organisations, undertakes sponsored research and can
accommodate teams from industry; the Water Pollution Research Laboratory
at Stevenage is concerned with the safe disposal of sewage and trade effluents
and with the purity of water supplies.
The net expenditure of DSIR in 1939 was £500,000; in 1958-59 it was
£8-5 million; for 1963-64 it is estimated as likely to be £20-6 million. One
of the larger increases within the whole, in very recent years, has been in
support of postgraduate research students and research in university depart¬
ments. Expansion of staff in DSIR’s own laboratories and increases in grants
to research associations are proceeding steadily and much more attention and
money are being devoted to ensuring that the results of research are known
and applied. To this end the National Lending Library for Science and
Technology was established at Boston Spa in Yorkshire in i960 (see p. 223).

to carry out industrial research co-operatively was started in 1951. At the
end of 1962 there were 53 such associations with a combined income of
£8-8 million (compared with ^5-1 million in 1955), of which a little less than
a quarter was contributed by the Government, advised by the Industrial
Grants Committee of the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research.
Suitably specialised associations are now available for over 60 per cent of
British industry, varying in size from the British Iron and Steel Research
Association (BISRA) with an annual income of over ^1 million, of which
£120,000 is provided by DSIR grant, to the File Research Council with an
income of only £12,000. The largest are those dealing with the metals and
electrical engineering industries, coal utilisation, cotton and man-made fibres,
production engineering, marine engineering and shipbuilding. (Particulars
of these and other associations are given in the relevant sections of Chapter 11,
Industry.) The amounts of the Government grants are related to the con¬
tributions made by the industries concerned.
The research associations are autonomous bodies governed by their own
councils, the members of which are mostly representatives of industry,
although the DSIR is also represented. The councils are advised in preparing
research programmes, for which they have complete responsibility, by
research committees representative of their industrial members, often with the
addition of university or Government scientists. The DSIR appoints two
Visitors for each association: normally, one is a scientist and the other an
industrialist—both of some eminence. A growing number of the research
associations admit to membership Commonwealth and foreign manufacturers.
The associations make the results of their work known to member firms by a
variety of methods, among which are bulletins, technical reports, lectures,
films, training classes, exhibitions and mobile demonstration units.
Public
Corporations
Private
Institutes for
Sponsored
Research
The public corporations which run the nationalised industries have their own
research organisations (see Chapter 11). They also give support to organisations
concerned with research on matters of interest to them.
A number of non-profit making institutes for sponsored research have been
established to extend the facilities for private research for industrial firms by
studying problems which are not within the scope of the average industrial
laboratory. In these institutes research organised by private firms can be
carried out confidentially, so that the results remain the property of the
sponsor.
The principal institutes of this type are: Fulmer Research Institute, Stoke
Poges, Buckinghamshire, which concentrates on metallurgy and allied
subjects; Sondes Place Research Institute, Dorking, Surrey, which is con¬
cerned mainly with chemistry, chemical engineering and mechanical
engineering; Arthur D. Little Research Institute, Musselburgh, near Edinburgh,
a British institute working in close collaboration with a well-known American
institute of the same name, and concentrating on the natural sciences,
especially on those studies which have promise of subsequent developments;
and the International Research and Development Company at Heaton, New¬
castle upon Tyne, formed in 1962 as an independent organisation undertaking
a wide range of scientific and technical operations for industry and
Government agencies both in Britain and overseas.
In addition, the Battelle Institute, London, a British subsidiary of the
international organisation, undertakes research over a wide range of industries.
Although without research facilities of its own in Britain, it can call on the

resources of the two Battelle Laboratories in Germany and Switzerland, in
addition to those in the United States.
A Medical Research Committee was appointed in 1913 to administer the
research funds provided under the National Health Insurance Act of 1911.
In 1920 the committee was superseded by the Medical Research Council
(MRC), established under Royal Charter and supported by a grant-in-aid
provided by Parliament.
In addition to financing the Medical Research Council, the Government
gives substantial support to medical research particularly in the basic sciences,
through block grants to universities distributed through the University Grants
Committee; and to clinical research through the National Health Service.
Important contributions to the support of research are made in addition
by private charities or fund raising organisations, of which the Nuffield
Foundation and the British Empire Cancer Campaign are the largest, and
by the pharmaceutical industry.
The Medical Research Council (MRC) is responsible to the Committee of the
Privy Council for Medical Research, of which the Minister for Science is
chairman and the Secretaries of State for the Home Department, Scotland,
Commonwealth Relations and the Colonies and the Ministers of Health and
of Labour are members.
The members of the council, appointed by the Committee of the Privy
Council for Medical Research for a period of four years, are twelve in number.
Nine members, representing different branches of medical knowledge and the
fundamental sciences on which these are based, are appointed after consulta¬
tion with the President of the Royal Society and with the council itself: on
retirement, these scientific members are not eligible for immediate reappoint¬
ment. There are three lay members of the council, one of whom must be a
member of the House of Lords and one a member of the House of Commons.
The MRC’s chief function is to promote research into all aspects of health
and disease. In planning and carrying out its research programme, the council
is assisted by special committees appointed to advise on particular subjects.
Its arrangements for the support of research fall under four main headings:
(1) investigations by members of the council’s scientific staff, mostly working
in its own research establishments; (2) temporary research grants to indepen¬
dent investigators in universities and elsewhere; (3) long-term research grants
in support of specific research programmes in university medical departments
(‘research groups’); and (4) research fellowships and scholarships for tenure
both at home and abroad.
The National Institute for Medical Research, at Mill Hill and Hampstead,
London, is the council’s main research establishment; in addition, there are
about 80 smaller establishments, generally known as research units, which
are attached in most cases to universities and hospitals in the United Kingdom.
The council also undertakes work overseas and, with additional support from
funds made available through the Department of Technical Co-operation,
maintains laboratories in the Gambia and units in Uganda and Jamaica.
For the financial year 1963-64 the council’s grant-in-aid is ^6-9 million,
compared with £5-8 million for 1962-63.
Agricultural research in its early days was not centrally organised. The first
research institutes were founded and initially maintained by private indi¬
viduals. Rothamsted Experimental Station, for example, the oldest of them,

was founded in 1843 by Sir John Lawes, who personally financed it until,
in 1889, he endowed it and set up the Lawes Agricultural Trust to administer
the endowment; as research became more costly, Government funds were
sought and obtained, though the institute remained independent. The
Development Commission, set up under the Development and Road Improve¬
ment Funds Act, 1909, recommended that financial aid should be made
available from the Development Fund to ‘aid and develop agriculture and
rural industries by promoting scientific research’ and in 1911 this fund was
used to promote a scheme which led to the establishment of many of the
present-day agricultural institutions. In 1931 the Agricultural Research
Council (ARC) was established by Royal Charter to be responsible for the
general organisation and development of agricultural research in Great
Britain. In addition to advising the agricultural departments on the pro¬
grammes of the institutes and, in the early stages, acting as scientific adviser
to the Development Commission, the ARC was given funds to spend at its
own discretion and it gradually took over the Commission’s responsibilities
for agricultural research.
Agricultural research is carried out in universities and colleges, by the
Agricultural Research Council and the Government Agricultural Depart¬
ments, and by private industry.
The Agricultural Research Council (ARC) is responsible to the Committee
of the Privy Council for Agricultural Research (the Minister for Science, the
Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food and the Secretary of State for
Scotland) for the organisation and development of agricultural research and
for research on food other than fish. It collaborates closely with the Ministry
of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, and with the Department of Agriculture
and Fisheries in Scotland.
The council consists of 15 to 18 members, five of whom are appointed by
the Committee of the Privy Council for their general experience of and
interest in agriculture. Others are appointed after consultation with the
President of the Royal Society, on account of their qualifications in one or
other of the sciences relating to agriculture. Included in the council’s member¬
ship are the Chief Scientific Adviser (Agriculture) and the Chief Veterinary
Officer of the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, also one member
appointed by the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food and one by
the Secretary of State for Scotland. Liaison is also maintained with the
Ministry of Agriculture for Northern Ireland and the Royal Society by the
appointment of representatives as assessors to the council.
The council has nine research stations and 14 units under its direct
control in Great Britain, including three laboratories concerned with the
preservation, storage and protection of foodstuffs. It controls the Pirbright
Laboratory which has won an international reputation for its work on foot and
mouth disease and which is a world reference laboratory for foot and mouth
disease viruses. It is also responsible for the financing of the independent
research institutes in England and Wales. The programmes of all these
institutes are co-ordinated and approved by the council and are integrated
with those of the independent research institutes in Scotland, which are
grant-aided by the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries for Scotland.
(For particulars of some of the leading research institutes, see Chapter 12,
Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry.)
The council makes grants to universities and other recognised research
institutions for special investigations, and awards research fellowships and

postgraduate studentships in agricultural and veterinary science, agricultural
and dairy engineering and agricultural statistics.
The greater part of the council’s expenditure is met from the Agricultural
Research Fund, which is financed by parliamentary grant-in-aid. For the
year 1963-64 expenditure is estimated at ^7-4 million, compared with ^6-5
million in 1962-63.
The Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food carries out applied research
in its own veterinary laboratories at Weybridge, Surrey, and at Lasswade,
Midlothian, and also at its plant pathology laboratory at Harpenden, Hertford¬
shire; while at its infestation control laboratory at Tolworth, Surrey (with a
field station at Worplesdon), it co-ordinates work on the control of insect
pests of stored food and conducts research on the control of harmful mammals
and birds. Research into the economic problems of agriculture is undertaken
by the Provincial Agricultural Economics Service. This service is financed by
direct grant aid from the ministry to ten universities in England and Wales.
The agricultural economics departments at these universities are also res¬
ponsible for teaching, some advisory work and the collection of financial
data from farms. The Scientific Services of the Department of Agriculture
and Fisheries for Scotland in Edinburgh undertake a number of statutory
duties and international obligations in regard to animal health, vaccines for
veterinary use, crop improvement and crop protection. Research is carried
out as it arises from this work. The Central Veterinary Laboratory at Wey¬
bridge has been appointed by the World Health Organisation (WHO) as the
third international laboratory for biological students. In Northern Ireland
the Ministry of Agriculture is responsible for the promotion of agricultural
research and research divisions dealing with a variety of aspects have been
established.
The Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food maintains four labora¬
tories for marine, shell-fish and salmon and freshwater fisheries research, and
four research vessels. The Department of Agriculture and Fisheries for
Scotland maintains a marine research laboratory and four research ships at
Aberdeen, and a freshwater research laboratory at Pitlochry.
The Development Commissioners, through their Advisory Committee on
Fishery Research, co-ordinate all fishery research. From the Development
Fund a number of independent institutions receive grants for marine and
freshwater research.
With the guidance of the Chief Scientific Adviser (Food), the Food Science
and Plant Health Division of the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food
is responsible for formulating the Ministry’s general policy on the acquisition
and dissemination of scientific and technical information about food and the
food handling and processing industry; for furnishing scientific advice to the
other divisions of the Ministry; and for sponsoring or carrying out experi¬
mental work. The division has its own experimental laboratories and kitchens
in London. The Food Research Advisory Committee, appointed by the
Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food and the Secretary of State for
Scotland, advises on food problems (other than fish, which is dealt with by
the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research) requiring investigation
or research which should be undertaken with the aid of public funds.
The Forestry Commission undertakes experimental work relating to
silvicultural and allied problems (see p. 355). By means of grants, it also aids
forest research work undertaken by various universities and other institutions,
including the Imperial Forestry Institute, Oxford.

NATURE The Nature Conservancy was set up in 1949 and is responsible to the Privy
CONSERVANCY Council Committee for Nature Conservation. Its functions are to provide
scientific advice on the conservation and control of the natural flora and fauna
of Great Britain; to establish, maintain and manage nature reserves in Great
Britain, including the maintenance of physical features of scientific interest;
and to organise and develop the research and scientific service related thereto.
Research stations have been set up by the Nature Conservancy at Merle-
wood, Grange-over-Sands, in Lancashire; at Furzebrook, Wareham, in
Dorset; at Bangor, Wales; and at Speyside, Inverness. There are field stations
at Moor House, Westmorland, and at Anancaun, Ross, and an experimental
station at Monks’ Wood, Huntingdon, where long-term ecological research
is undertaken into such problems as the relation of vegetation to soils and
climates, peat growth, effects of grazing and of moor burning, coastal erosion
and roadside spraying. Grants are made for research, and the Nature Con¬
servancy awards annually a number of postgraduate studentships. The
grant-in-aid for 1963-64 is estimated at £701,000.
NUCLEAR Since 1959 the Atomic Energy Authority (AEA), set up under the Atomic
ENERGY Energy Authority Act, 1954, has been responsible to the Minister for Science
for research and development in nuclear energy.
The Minister of Aviation is responsible for the development and production
of nuclear weapons for the Services in accordance with agreed defence policy;
in practice, however, the Atomic Energy Authority produces the explosive
nuclear material and assemblies for nuclear weapons under contract and carries
out weapon research. The Minister of Power (in Scotland, the Secretary of
State) has a general responsibility for the civil nuclear power programme; the
power stations are being built for, and will be operated by, the electricity
authorities, although prototypes may be built and operated by the AEA,
which also designs and produces all fuel elements. The Admiralty is concerned
(in close collaboration with the AEA) in the development of nuclear power
for naval propulsion, and a small working group, responsible jointly to the
Minister for Science and the Minister of Transport, has been set up to advise
on the programme of research into economic nuclear propulsion for merchant
ships. This group has proposed that one of two alternative reactor systems
might now be developed for incorporating in a ship. The Authority collaborates
with a number of other Government departments—the Ministries of Health,
Labour, Housing and Local Government, Agriculture, Fisheries and Food,
and Transport, the Post Office, the Scottish Office, and the Home Office—
on various aspects of health and safety in relation to atomic energy.
Expert advice on radiation hazards is provided by the Medical and
Agricultural Research Councils and by the Radioactive Substances Advisory
Committee. This committee advises ministers on the administration of the
Radioactive Substances Acts which deal with the precautions necessary in
the use of radioactive substances and apparatus producing radiation. There
is collaboration between the AEA, the Radiobiological Protection Service and
the Government departments concerned in various aspects of health and
safety in relation to atomic energy.
The Atomic Energy The Atomic Energy Authority, appointed by the Minister for Science, at
Authority present consists of a chairman, a deputy chairman and ten other members,
six of whom are part-time.
The Authority, like other statutory public corporations, is free from day-
to-day Government control (subject to the power given to the responsible
minister to issue directions to the Authority in matters of overriding national

importance), but differs from them in that most of its revenue is derived from
money voted by Parliament, although income from other sources, such as
the sale of radioisotopes and fuel elements, is increasing.
The organisation has a London office, responsible for central financial and
administrative matters and for procuring raw materials. Its establishments
are divided into five groups.
The Research Group's principal establishment is the Atomic Energy
Research Establishment (AERE) at Harwell. Others are the Radiochemical
Centre at Amersham, responsible for the processing and sale of radio¬
isotopes, the Wantage Research Laboratory, which does research into new
and improved uses of radioisotopes and a controlled thermonuclear research
establishment at Culham. Harwell also runs an isotope school, started in
April 1951 and now situated at Wantage, and a reactor school, started
in September 1954, which provide training for home and overseas students.
The Weapons Group, centred on Aldermaston, conducts research on and
development of nuclear weapons and other research work with civil, as well
as defence, applications. It has outstations at Foulness and Orfordness in
eastern England, and Woolwich Common, London.
There are three groups with headquarters at Risley, in north-western
England. The Reactor Group is responsible for the design and development
of reactors. It is responsible for the Advanced Gas Cooled Reactor at Wind-
scale which has recently been completed. The Group includes the Atomic
Energy Establishment at Winfrith, Dorset, which houses among other things
high-temperature gas-cooled reactor experiments such as Zenith and the
Dragon project, the latter a 20 MW reactor financed jointly by a number of
member countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and
Development (OECD), including members of the European Atomic Energy
Community (Euratom). The United Kingdom is providing the largest share
and will retain ownership of the reactor. A prototype steam generating heavy
water reactor is also being built at Winfrith. The Reactor Group also includes
the Dounreay experimental reactor establishment in the north of Scotland,
which houses a materials-testing reactor and a fast-breeder reactor. The
latter has achieved the highest power output of any of its type in the world.
The Group has research laboratories at the main establishments of the
Production Group, which is responsible for the operation of factories pro¬
ducing fissile material at Windscale (Cumberland), Capenhurst (Cheshire) and
Springfields (Lancashire) and the AEA’s nuclear power plants at Calder Hall
(Cumberland) and Chapelcross (Dumfries). The third group with head¬
quarters at Risley is the Engineering Group, responsible for the construction
of plant, works and buildings, and for the design and inspection of fuel
elements for production purposes.
In 1957 the Government set up a National Institute for Research in Nuclear
Science (NIRNS), which provides, for common use by universities and
others, facilities and equipment which are beyond the scope of individual
universities and institutions carrying out research in nuclear energy. The
institute is financed in the main by grants through the Atomic Energy
Authority from the Atomic Energy Vote. Early in 1961 NIRNS took over
from AERE responsibility for the development of particle accelerators. The
Rutherford High Energy Laboratory at Harwell will house the institute’s
proton synchrotron (particle accelerator). This 7,000 million electron volt
(MeV) apparatus, completed in 1963, is one of the largest such machines in
the world. A second laboratory to house a 4,000 MeV synchrotron is to be built

at Danesbury, Cheshire. The NIRNS will also be responsible for the manage¬
ment of a high speed ATLAS computer for use by universities, the AEA,
Government departments and the NIRNS itself.
The Minister for Science, in consultation with other ministers, is responsible
for sponsoring and co-ordinating Britain’s space research programme. He is
advised by a Steering Group on Space Research, representing Government
departments and university scientists and they, in turn, are advised on the
programme’s purely scientific aspects by the British National Committee on
Space Research, which is appointed by the Royal Society. This committee
is also the United Kingdom body adhering to non-governmental international
scientific groups, such as the Committee on Space Research (COSPAR),
established by the International Council of Scientific Unions (ICSU) in
October 1958. The execution of the programme, under the general super¬
vision and management of the Office of the Minister for Science, is in the
hands of scientists in universities and Government research establishments.
DSIR is responsible for channelling and administering grants to universities
provided from Government funds. Private industry is also developing
equipment and materials needed in space research. Identifiable Government
expenditure on the scientific space research programme amounts at present
to over £1 million a year.
A programme involving the firing of Skylark upper atmosphere vertical
sounding rockets from the Woomera range in Australia, in co-operation with
the Australian Government, has been in progress since the end of 1957. The
current programme involves about 20 firings a year for research in upper
atmosphere physics and meteorology. The cost of rockets for this programme
amounts to about £200,000 a year.
Britain was one of the first countries to accept an offer made in 1959 by
the United States to launch into orbit experiments of mutual scientific
interest designed by foreign scientists. As a result the first international
satellite experiment, the S-51 or Ariel, with British instrumentation, was
successfully launched on 26th April, 1962, from Cape Canaveral by the US
National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). Arrangements were
made for launching a second Anglo-American satellite in 1963 an<^ a third
is to be constructed in Britain for launching from the United States in a
few years’ time. Because of the enormous cost involved, only the United
States and the Soviet Union at present possess rockets capable of launching
artificial earth satellites, space probes or manned space vehicles. Two
organisations in which Britain is playing a leading part are, however,
being set up to give European countries the opportunity to participate
more fully in space research and technology—the European Space Research
Organisation (ESRO) and the European Launcher Development Organisation
(ELDO). The first stage of the planned ELDO satellite launcher will be
provided by the British Blue Streak rocket.
The satellite prediction centre at Slough, attached to DSIR’s Radio
Research Station, also the home of one of the three World Data Centres for
space research, co-ordinates optical and radio tracking activities in Britain.
Optical observation of satellites is carried out regularly by many individual
observers in the British Isles and by the Royal Edinburgh Observatory s
outstation (see p. 222); radio tracking is undertaken at the Radio Research
Station itself and by the radio telescopes at Cambridge, Jodrell Bank and
the Royal Radar Establishment at Malvern.
The Royal Aircraft Establishment at Farnborough is carrying out a

programme of basic satellite technology and has undertaken a design study
for a communications satellite.
The General Post Office undertakes research work connected with experi¬
ments in satellite communications. It is co-operating with NASA and the
French telecommunication authorities in a programme for transatlantic
testing of satellite communication systems. The first, known as Telstar, was
launched by NASA on 10th July, 1962. A second, Relay, went into operation
in January 1963. Television pictures, some in colour, and telephone messages
were successfully exchanged, by reflection from them, between the United
States station at Andover, Maine, and the United Kingdom station at
Goonhilly Downs, Cornwall, which uses British equipment.
Large optical telescopes were first constructed in Britain by Herschel and
Rosse in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. At present British optical
observatories are being extensively re-equipped. The Isaac Newton 98-inch
telescope, being constructed for the Royal Greenwich Observatory, Herst-
monceux, will provide additional facilities for optical astronomers in
Britain; and grants to the Radcliffe Observatory in South Africa, with its
existing 74-inch telescope, and the merger of the Royal Observatory, Cape
Town, and the Royal Greenwich Observatory will enable astronomers to
have improved use of large optical telescopes in both hemispheres. The
Royal Edinburgh Observatory has been re-equipped with modern instrument¬
ation for use in stellar spectroscopy and photometry. It is specialising in
the introduction into astronomy of automatic methods of observation and
computation. The Observatory is also engaged in seismology and, at an
outstation in Peeblesshire, on the tracking of artificial satellites. A proposal
for establishing an Institute for Theoretical Astronomy at the University of
Sussex is under consideration.
Radio astronomy, developed since 1931, is carried out mainly at Cambridge,
Jodrell Bank and Malvern. Two large radio telescopes at the Mullard Radio
Astronomy Observatory, Cambridge University, were completed in 1957 and
have made important contributions towards the testing of the various
cosmological theories. The DSIR has made a grant of £534,200 for a new
triple paraboloidal radio telescope at Cambridge. At the Nuffield Radio
Astronomy Laboratories of the University of Manchester at Jodrell Bank,
there is a fully steerable paraboloid radio telescope of 250 feet diameter
which has performed outstanding work since it started in 1957. The DSIR
is granting £301,000 for a new fully steerable radio telescope on this site.
There is also a new radio telescope interferometer at the Ministry of Aviation’s
Royal Radar Establishment near Malvern.
A Radio Astronomy Planning Committee was set up by the Minister for
Science in December 1961 to advise him on the nature and extent of Britain’s
radio astronomy research programme both nationally and internationally.
Zoological research is among the activities of the world-famous Zoological
Gardens, extending over 34 acres in Regent’s Park, London, which were
opened by the Zoological Society of London in 1828. A natural zoo of 500 acres
was opened in 1931 at Whipsnade, in Bedfordshire, by the Society. There
are other well-known zoos at Edinburgh, Bristol and Dudley, and a small,
private, natural zoo at Chessington, Surrey.
SCIENTIFIC

collection of extinct and fossil animals and plants and of minerals, rocks and
meteorites. The Science Museum illustrates the development of pure and
applied science in all countries, but chiefly in Britain, which has always held
a leading place in engineering, agriculture, navigation, mining, aeronautics,
and in the development of industrial machinery and processes, all of which
are represented in the museum’s collections. The geology of Britain is known
in more exact detail than that of any other country in the world, and the
Geological Survey (since 1919 an establishment of DSIR), responsible for
this work, has an outstanding collection of exhibits in its Geological Museum.
These three museums are in South Kensington, London.
Important collections outside London are the Museum of Science and
Industry, in Birmingham, and the Museum of the History of Science, at
Oxford.
The dissemination of the results of research to other research workers and
to ultimate users has become a problem of some magnitude as the volume
of information has grown. The traditional method of scientific publication,
in which results are written up into papers and published in journals, is still
the main means of communication among scientists. The leading learned
societies have for long been important agencies for communicating scientific
information.
Both the DSIR and the AEA devote considerable sums to information
services. Besides its own publications and services, DSIR gives financial
support to ASLIB (the Association of Special Libraries and Information
Bureaux), which runs a technical information department and maintains a
panel of translators and a Commonwealth Index of Translations covering
scientific subjects. The new National Lending Library for Science and
Technology (NLL), set up by the DSIR at Boston Spa, Yorkshire, in 1961,
came into full operation in 1962. It covers all subjects in science and technology
(other than some branches of medicine) and is also responsible for increasing
the number of translations of foreign (especially of Russian and Chinese)
scientific literature, in which work it collaborates with the National Science
Foundation of the United States.
Besides information services provided by its various groups, the AEA has
an information centre and an isotope information bureau at its London head¬
quarters.
In agriculture, the Commonwealth Agricultural Institutes and Bureaux
provide abstracts and an information service in various branches of agricultural
science. The ARC publishes an Index of Agricultural Research in Progress,
and gives an account of current developments in its annual reports. The
advisory services of the agricultural departments bring research results directly
to the farmer.
Medical research results are communicated mainly through journals and
periodicals; but the MRC issues special reports and includes special articles
in its annual reports.
A national Reference Library for Science and Invention is being formed
out of the Patent Office Library; it will be part of the British Museum
Library. Work on a new building for it is expected to begin early in 1964
and should be finished by mid-1967.
Several agencies assist in the commercial development and spread the use
of new inventions.

The National Research Development Corporation (NRDC) was set up by the
Board of Trade in 1949 under the Development of Inventions Act, 1948.
Its primary function is to develop and exploit, in the public interest, inventions
resulting from research carried out by Government departments and other
public bodies. It may also develop and exploit an invention from any other
source where, in the Corporation’s view, the public interest requires it.
Under the Development of Inventions Act, i954> t^le NRDC may promote or
assist research to meet specific practical requirements, or may assist the
continuation of research which may lead to inventions of practical importance.
It is an independent body, subject only to general direction by the Board of
Trade, with powers, under the Development of Inventions Act, 1958, to borrow
from Government funds to a total of £10 million up to 1968. Projects spon¬
sored by the Corporation include, among many others, such varied items as
electronic digital computers, towed flexible barges (known as dracones),
interferon (an anti-viral agent), selective weed-killers, a new form of transport
known as hovercraft, a hydrogen-oxygen fuel cell as a transportable source of
electricity and a group of new antibiotics called cephalosporins. The Corpora¬
tion has a substantial annual income from the exploitation of inventions.
A DSIR/NRDC Joint Development Committee was set up in 1958 to examine
development problems of common interest and to advise DSIR and NRDC
on the way in which proposals for particular development contracts should
be handled.
A new private financial institution, Technical Development Capital Limited,
was formed in January 1962 to help to bring technical developments to the
profitable stage. It has a capital of ^2 million, raised from insurance com¬
panies, merchant banks and other institutions in Britain, Canada and Australia.
Up to the end of March 1963 the new company had already considered 100
out of 250 applications received.
A Medical Engineering Development Trust was formed in June 1963 to
investigate all serious medical inventions submitted to it and, if adjudged
useful, to develop them to the prototype stage and pass them on to manu¬
facturers. Other aims include the maintenance of a library of technical
literature and a register of inventions and the award of prizes.
Britain plays a consideraWe part in overseas scientific collaboration, including
the exchange of scientific information. In areas of non-governmental collabora¬
tion, under the aegis of the International Council of Scientific Unions, the
primary representative of the United Kingdom is the Royal Society. The
Government is concerned with inter-governmental organisations: these include
specialised agencies of the United Nations (the United Nations Educational,
Scientific and Cultural Organisation (UNESCO), the World Health Organisa¬
tion (WHO) and the Food and Agricultural Organisation (FAO) and the
Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission); the organisations concerned
with nuclear energy (the International Atomic Energy Agency, the European
Organisation for Nuclear Research (CERN) and the European Nuclear Energy
Agency); and space research (the European Space Research Organisation
(ESRO)). There are agreements between the United Kingdom AEA and other
atomic energy authorities, including that of the Soviet Union (and there are
permanent representatives of the United States Atomic Energy Commission in
London and of the United Kingdom AEA in Washington). In addition, there
are inter-governmental agreements with the European Atomic Community
PROMOTION OF THE SCIENCES AND THE ARTS

(EURATOM), and bilateral agreements with ten countries, including the
United States.
Britain is also represented on the Committee for Scientific and Technical
Personnel and on the Committee for Scientific Research of the Organisation
for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD).
British The British Commonwealth Scientific Committee (BCSC) consisting of the
Commonwealth heads of the national research organisations of Commonwealth countries,
Scientific Committee formed in 1958 from the previous Standing Committee set up in 1946, meets
biennially. Operating under the BCSC are: the British Commonwealth
Scientific Offices and the various specialist committees on fuel research,
mineral resources and geology (including a Commonwealth Geological
Liaison Office), mineral processing and the collection of micro-organisms.
The secretariat for the Committee is provided by the British Common¬

The Commonwealth Agricultural Bureaux comprise three Institutes and ten
Bureaux, all of which except one bureau are in Britain and each of which is
concerned with a particular branch of agricultural science. Their purpose is
to act as clearing houses for the interchange of information of value to research
workers in agricultural science throughout the Commonwealth. This they
achieve by scanning and indexing journals of scientific repute in all languages,
by keeping in touch with agricultural research in progress and by the dis¬
semination of this information by the periodic issue of Abstract Journals.
Fifteen Abstract Journals are published periodically and have a combined
annual circulation of about 22,500 copies. A list of research workers in agri¬
culture, animal health and forestry in the Commonwealth is published from
time to time, and this list includes an indication of topics under investigation
by the individual workers concerned. The Bureaux also issue monographs
on their own particular subjects and deal with inquiries received from
research workers in all parts of the Commonwealth. In addition, the Institutes
provide taxonomic and identification services.
The Standing Committee on Overseas Scientific Relations is a committee of
the Advisory Council on Scientific Policy which was set up after the second
world war to consider and advise on Government policy on overseas scientific
relations. It was reconstituted in 1958 as a small committee concerned
primarily with questions of policy and scientific co-operation. The chairman
of the Advisory Council on Scientific Policy acts as its chairman, and its
secretariat is provided jointly by the Office of the Minister for Science and
the Overseas Liaison Group of the DSIR.
Overseas
Research
Council
The Overseas Research Council was set up in July 1959, under a Privy
Council Committee consisting of the Minister for Science and the Secretaries
of State for Foreign Affairs, Commonwealth Relations and the Colonies.
Its general function is to advise on how the British scientific effort in and
for overseas countries, particularly in the newly emerging Commonwealth
territories, can be used as advantageously as possible. It acts as an advisory
body to the Department of Technical Co-operation on broad issues relating
to overseas research. The Council does not itself conduct research.

The British
Council
Its membership is somewhat comparable to that of the Advisory Council
on Scientific Policy in that it includes a number of independent members, and
the Secretaries of the Medical and Agricultural Research Councils and DSIR.
Because of its purely advisory role the Overseas Research Council has no
executive staff; its secretariat is provided by the Office of the Minister for
Science.
One of the main aims of the Department of Technical Co-operation (DTC)
is the promotion of scientific research in the interests of developing countries.
The aid given covers specialist advice from Britain, advisory visits, confer¬
ences for exchange of information, training scientists from overseas in
universities and research institutions in Britain, recruiting scientific staff from
Britain, and providing support for existing research services overseas, for
example, in East Africa and the Caribbean. The Department works with the
many specialist bodies concerned, particularly the research councils and DSIR.
It is advised by the Overseas Research Council on matters of general policy.
An example of Britain’s research work on behalf of developing countries is
provided by the Anti-Locust Research Centre in London, internationally
recognised as a world centre for locust research since 1931, and now supported
almost entirely by the Department of Technical Co-operation. This organisa¬
tion receives and co-ordinates information on locust movements and breeding
from some 40 countries, undertakes scientific research into the life history
and habits of the different species of locust, and investigates and develops
methods for their control and destruction. In co-operation with the United
Nations Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO), it provides an information
service on the movements of desert locusts.
This group, which is part of the Information Division of the DSIR, is broadly
responsible for the overseas relations and activities of the department.
Although administratively part of DSIR, the group sometimes acts on
behalf of other research councils and Government departments and national
bodies concerned with civil science and technology. As part of its executive
work for the Standing Committee on Overseas Scientific Relations, the group
administers and develops British scientific representation abroad. It also
maintains liaison with the scientific representatives of foreign countries in
London, and assists sdentific and technological exchanges between the
United Kingdom and other countries.
The aims of the British Council in the sciences (including agriculture, medicine
and technology) are to foster co-operation between British scientists and
scientists of other countries, and to promote among overseas specialists a
better understanding and knowledge of Britain and its scientific achievements.
In co-operation between scientists emphasis is placed on the interchange
of scientists between Britain and other countries. Overseas tours and advisory
visits by British specialists are arranged and scientists recruited for overseas
posts. In the other direction the Council invites senior specialists to Britain
for visits and discussions with British experts, and makes awards to post¬
graduate students; it also administers the programmes of a large number of
senior specialists and students who travel to Britain under the auspices of the
UN specialised agencies, or under various bilateral technical assistance
schemes, or as private individuals. A number of high-level scientific short
courses are organised each year for overseas specialists. The Council is also
PROMOTION OF THE SCIENCES AND THE ARTS 227
responsible for administering travel grants awarded under the Foreign and
Commonwealth University Interchange Schemes.
Information on Britain’s scientific achievements is provided either through
the Council’s overseas libraries or direct from the London headquarters
which includes specialist departments (and libraries) for medicine and science.
Material published or compiled by these London departments include
British Medical Bulletin, British Medical Booklist, the universities section of
Scientific Research in British Universities and Colleges (see Bibliography), and
publications listing certain British training facilities.
THE PROMOTION OF THE ARTS
This section describes the assistance and encouragement given to the arts
by the Government, local authorities, voluntary societies and other
organisations.
There is no equivalent to a Ministry of Fine Arts to formulate and administer
policy in the arts. Government interest is expressed mainly through the
provision of grants to the Arts Council, the British Council (see footnote on
p. 178), the British Film Institute, the Council of Industrial Design and other
organisations, and also to museums and art galleries. Bodies such as the
Standing Commission on Museums and Galleries and the Royal Fine Arts
Commissions for England and Wales and for Scotland act in an advisory
capacity in their respective spheres.
Government expenditure on the arts is now over fin million a year. Of
this total, over million is the cost of upkeep of the national art collections,
nearly ^2| million the amount of the grant to the Arts Council, and nearly
million is expenditure on preserving historic houses and their contents.
Municipalities also play their part in sustaining the arts. Under the Local
Government Act of 1948 they may use part of their revenue from rates
(see p. 78) for this purpose; they also have powers which permit capital
expenditure on new buildings for the arts, and can make grants to schools
of art, music and drama. As a rule local councils refrain from actual manage¬
ment of orchestras and theatre companies (usually having a representative on
the governing boards or trusts concerned), but they often provide the arenas
for the performance of music or drama.
Unofficial institutions concerned with promotion of the arts include many
charitable trusts and foundations, among them the Carnegie United Kingdom
Trust, the Pilgrim Trust, the United Kingdom branch of the Calouste
Gulbenkian Foundation, and a large number of other organisations concerned
with separate aspects of the arts; examples are mentioned later in this chapter.
Industrial patronage, including support from television companies, has
increased considerably in recent years.
The Arts Council of Great Britain was established under a Royal Charter
in 1946. It consists of not more than 16 honorary members appointed by the
Chancellor of the Exchequer in consultation with the Minister of Education
and the Secretary of State for Scotland. Its main duties are to develop a
greater knowledge and understanding of the fine arts by the public, to improve
the standard of execution and to advise and co-operate with Government
departments, local authorities and other organisations on matters connected
with these aims.
The Arts Council of Northern Ireland (formerly the Council for the
Encouragement of Music and the Arts) consists of a president and vice-
228 v BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
president, four members nominated by the Ministry of Education for
Northern Ireland, four by the Senate of Queen’s University and one elected
by the Association of the Council. It receives a grant from the Northern
Ireland Government of £34,000, plus up to a maximum of £10,500 on a
£ for £ basis on contributions from local authorities.
The Carnegie United Kingdom Trust was founded in 1913 by the late
Andrew Carnegie and incorporated under Royal Charter in 1917. The trust,
initially founded for ‘the improvement of the well-being of the masses of the
people of Great Britain and Ireland’, consists of 22 life trustees, six trustees
nominated by the Corporation of Dunfermline and three trustees nominated
by the Fife County Council. Its cultural policies include the support of adult
amateur activities in music, drama and the visual arts. It also assists non¬
national museums. Grants totalling £22,260 were made for these purposes
during 1962.
The Pilgrim Trust which was founded in 1930 by the late Edward Stephen
Harkness, an American citizen, has an income of about £220,000 a year and
is administered by a body of trustees empowered to make grants towards any
legally charitable object within the United Kingdom. In fact, the greater
part of the trust’s income is at present being used to help to preserve the
nation’s heritage of architecture and history, and for the advancement of
learning and the arts. The grants made for these objects during 1962 amounted
to £300,000.
The Calouste Gulbenkian Foundation of Lisbon was established in 1955
under the will of the late Calouste Gulbenkian. A United Kingdom branch
is responsible for the Foundation’s activities in Britain and other Common¬
wealth countries. During 1962 the Foundation made grants totalling £202,600
for the arts in Britain, and continued to implement the policy proposed in
the report, Help for the Arts, prepared for the Foundation in 1959 by a
private committee under the chairmanship of Lord Bridges.
The arts benefit most when the patrons—central and local government,
voluntary bodies, industry, the universities and individuals—combine. The
most outstanding example is the Edinburgh Festival Society; other Arts
Festivals which have developed a similar basis of responsibility are those of
Bath, Cheltenham, King’s Lynn, Leeds, Norwich and York. A notable
example in regional co-operation in arts patronage has been set by the
North Eastern Arts Council: it combines representatives of local councils,
chambers of commerce, Tees and Tyneside Television Co., universities,
industrial firms and trade unions. Trades Councils, the Calouste Gulbenkian
Foundation and others are supporting ‘Centre 42’, an organisation started
in 1962 at the suggestion of the Trades LTnion Congress to help to bring the
arts into the life of the community by means of local festivals.
Special festival celebrations to commemorate the 400th anniversary of
Shakespeare’s birth will be held in Stratford upon Avon, London and many
other parts of the country in 1964. A Commonwealth Festival of the Arts
is to be celebrated simultaneously in London and certain other centres in 1965.
A number of modern British painters and sculptors now have a high inter¬
national reputation; they have received international prizes and commissions
for major works in foreign cities. The growth of interest in the visual arts
at home has been stimulated by an increasingly lively attitude towards display
on the part of museums and galleries, and by exhibition programmes and
the varied activities of many institutions, societies and private galleries.

PROMOTION OF THE SCIENCES AND THE ARTS 22Q
While it would be untrue to say that there is a general appreciation of
contemporary art, interest and curiosity are growing. The art schools are
full and young artists now find it easier to exhibit and sell their work.
Painting and sculpture receive State support by grants to national institu¬
tions and, indirectly, through grants made to the Arts Council, to municipal
art galleries and museums, and to local education authorities for art schools
and other means of promoting education in art.
In the year April 1962 to the end of March 1963 the Arts Council arranged
80 separate art exhibitions in Great Britain; 392 showings of these exhibitions
were given in 142 different centres. The Arts Council of Northern Ireland
arranged 18 exhibitions in Belfast, of which three toured to 72 different centres.
Knowledge of Britain’s fine arts is fostered overseas by the British Council
by means of exhibitions, dissemination of reproductions and photographs,
lectures, and provision of information and advice to inquirers abroad and to
visitors in Britain. In the year ended March 1963, 40 fine art exhibitions
organised by the Council were shown in 45 countries. The Council was also
responsible for British participation in five international exhibitions. Since
1948, 39 international awards have been won by British artists.
There are nearly 900 museums and art galleries open to the public in Britain,
though many are only small collections.
The national museums and art galleries in London probably contain
between them the most comprehensive collection of objects of artistic,
archaeological, scientific, historical and general interest ever to exist within
one city. The British Museum has unparalleled collections of archaeological
and ethnographical material in addition to housing the national library of
printed books, manuscripts, newspapers and periodicals; its Department of
Prints and Drawings also possesses collections of the widest extent and
richness. The British Museum (Natural History)1 was given a separate
constitution in 1963. The Victoria and Albert Museum contains works of fine
and applied art of all countries and periods, arranged mainly according to
material, though primary collections have been arranged to bring together,
by style, period or nationality, masterpieces of all the arts. The National
Gallery houses paintings by almost all the greatest European masters. The
Tate Gallery embodies two collections: the British school from the eighteenth
century onwards, with a few earlier works, and modern foreign schools
(since 1850). Both sections include modern sculpture. Frequent loan exhi¬
bitions are held in the Tate Gallery.
Other important collections in London are at the National Portrait Gallery,
the Imperial War Museum, the National Maritime Museum, the Public
Record Office Museum, which contains Domesday Book and other famous
historical documents, the Guildhall Museum and the London Museum (to be
amalgamated into the Museum of London, with one collection illustrating
the history and archaeology of the capital, which will be housed in the
City), and the Wallace Collection (furniture, armour, objets d’art and paintings,
mainly French works of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries). In 1962
a small but important art gallery was opened in Buckingham Palace for
exhibitions of pictures from the extensive Royal collections.
The Ministry of Education is responsible for the administration of the
Victoria and Albert Museum and the Science Museum. The other national
collections are run by trustee bodies. All are financed from Government

funds. Besides meeting the administrative costs, this finance makes provision
for both annual and special ad hoc purchase grants. The collections may also
receive certain pre-eminent works of art acquired by the Treasury in lieu
of estate duty. The buildings are maintained by the Ministry of Public
Building and Works.
There are six national museums and art galleries in Edinburgh: the National
Museum of Antiquities of Scotland, the National Gallery of Scotland,
the Royal Scottish Museum, the National Portrait Gallery of Scotland, the
Scottish United Services Museum, and the Scottish National Gallery of
Modern Art, which was opened to the public in i960. The National Museum
of Wales, in Cardiff, has a branch at St. Fagan’s Castle where the Welsh
Folk Museum is housed. The Ulster Folk Museum is sited close to Belfast.
The former City of Belfast Museum and Art Gallery, now known as the
Ulster Museum, has been transferred to national control and is administered
by a statutory body receiving financial aid from the Government of Northern
Ireland. In addition, a small Belfast gallery under the control of the Arts
Council of Northern Ireland promotes exhibitions by contemporary painters
and craftsmen.
The Government is advised on questions relating to the development of
the national institutions as a whole, and their co-operation with provincial
institutions, by the Standing Commission on Museums and Galleries, set up
in 1931. The Standing Commission publishes periodic reports; in 1963 it
issued a report on a Survey of Provincial Museums and Galleries, undertaken
at the request of the Government.
Almost every city and large town has a museum devoted to art, archaeology
and natural history, usually owned by the municipal authority but sometimes
by a local learned society or privately by individuals or trustees to whom some
wealthy collector in the past has bequeathed his treasures. Both Oxford and
Cambridge are rich in museums—the Ashmolean Museum in Oxford,
founded in 1683, is the oldest in the country and the Fitzwilliam Museum
in Cambridge has fine art galleries and a notable collection of engravings,
manuscripts and books bequeathed by its founder on his death in 1861.
Other universities have notable collections, primarily for teaching purposes
but also open to the public. Other cities with important museums and art
galleries are Birmingham, Bristol, Glasgow, Leeds, Leicester, Liverpool,
Manchester, Norwich, Southampton, and York. The Herbert Art Gallery
and Museum at Coventry, the first major art gallery to be built in the
provinces since 1939, was opened in i960. In recent years there has been a
notable development of ‘period-house museums’, for which outstanding
private residences of former times have been taken over by national and
municipal authorities, as at Temple Newsam (Leeds), Aston Hall (Birming¬
ham), and the Royal Pavilion (Brighton). Private art collections are to be seen
in the historic family mansions (including many in the ownership of the
National Trust) which are now open to the public at certain times.
In 1959 the first area museum council in Britain was inaugurated for the
south-west, and a similar organisation for the Midlands was started in 1961.
There are now area councils covering nearly the whole country; their aim is
to promote closer co-operation between museums and art galleries in the
region, to improve technical facilities, and to provide financial assistance. In
1963, following a recommendation by the Standing Commission, financial
help from the Government was announced.

The Carnegie United Kingdom Trust has done much to encourage the
growth of the museum movement during the past thirty years, and at present
spends an average of £10,000 a year for this purpose. The Victoria and Albert
Museum also administers an annual Government grant of £25,000 to help
local museums and art galleries to buy works of art for their collections.
The Museums Association is an independent organisation to which mus¬
eums and art galleries and their staffs throughout the country belong;
there are also many overseas members. The Association serves as a central
body for the collection of information and the discussion of matters relating
to museum administration, and as a training and examining body for pro¬
fessional qualifications.
Temporary exhibitions produced by the Arts Council, the Art Exhibitions
Bureau, and the Circulation Department of the Victoria and Albert Museum
are a regular feature of many museums.
The various national art exhibiting societies include the Royal Academy,
which holds summer exhibitions of works by members and non-members and
winter exhibitions usually devoted to national schools of painting or the art
of a particular period; the Royal Scottish Academy; the Society of Scottish
Artists; the Royal Society of British Artists; the Royal Society of Painters
in Water Colours; the Royal Society of Portrait Painters; the Artists’ Inter¬
national Association; the Women’s International Art Club; and the London
Group (all the foregoing are associations of professional painters); and the
Institute of Contemporary Arts. Some of these societies, notably the Royal
Academy at Burlington House, have their own galleries in London. In
Northern Ireland there are the Royal Ulster Academy of Arts, the Ulster
Society of Women Artists and the Ulster Arts Club. Among regional societies
are the Newlyn Society of Artists, the Midland Group of Artists (Nottingham),
the Birmingham Society of Artists and the Penwith Society of Arts, while
an increasing number of amateur art societies throughout the United Kingdom
hold local exhibitions and encourage local interest in the fine arts in various
ways. The Contemporary Art Society uses its members’ subscriptions to
buy modern works which it presents to public galleries.
Exhibitions of works by old masters and living artists are held throughout
the year in the galleries of the art dealers of London (largely in the Bond
Street area). The Whitechapel Art Gallery shows a series of important
exhibitions in the East End of London; and the London County Council
exhibits modern sculpture in one of its parks every third year. John Moore’s
exhibition, held in Liverpool every two years, is open to all British painters
and sculptors and sets a high professional standard; important prizes are
awarded. There are also exhibitions of children’s art, including the National
Exhibition of Children’s Art sponsored annually by the Sunday Mirror.
There are 15 regional colleges of art in the United Kingdom, all of which
offer courses in most branches of art and a varying range of crafts; and there
are schools of art in nearly all the larger towns. In London, the most notable
of these schools and colleges are the Royal College of Art (a national college)
and the Central School of Arts and Crafts of the London County Council,
in both of which the emphasis is on industrial design, and the Slade School
of Fine Arts in the University of London. At the Royal Academy Schools,
founded in 1768, all instruction is provided free by Royal Academicians.
The leading academic institutions for the teaching and study of the history
of art are the Courtauld Institute of the University of London, the Department
232

of Classical Art and Archaeology in University College, London, and the
Warburg Institute (also a part of London University) which provides facilities
for research on the character and history of the classical tradition.
Art has a place in the curriculum of every type of school, and the Society
for Education through Art, among its other activities, encourages the purchase
by schools of original works of art by organising an annual Pictures for
Schools exhibition. The Arts Council operates a loan scheme for reproductions
of works of art which is used extensively by schools.
The Council of Industrial Design (CoID) was set up in 1944 by the President
of the Board of Trade as a grant-aided body with the purpose of promoting
the improvement of design in the products of British industry. The council
has 29 members, a majority being prominent industrialists, and there is a
separate Scottish committee.
The CoID runs a permanent exhibition, The Design Centre, in Haymarket,
London. This is a selective, changing display of well-designed British con¬
sumer goods in current production. Supplementing it, an illustrated record of
good design, known as Design Index, is maintained at the Centre. A maximum
of 20 Design Centre Awards is presented annually to the makers of outstanding
products in the Index. An additional award, the Duke of Edinburgh’s Prize
for Elegant Design, is presented annually to the designer of a single product
chosen from the Index. The Scottish Design Centre opened in Glasgow in
1957. Permanent design exhibitions opened in Bristol in 1958* Nottingham
in i960 and in Manchester in 1963. The last three function independently,
but all have duplicates of Design Index. The CoID organises conferences,
courses and exhibitions in Britain and overseas, and maintains a record of
designers and a photographic and reference library on industrial design. It
has an education section, a retail section and publishes a monthly magazine,
Design.
Other bodies concerned with industrial design include the Royal Society
of Arts (see p. 207), the Society of Industrial Artists, which is the representative
professional body in Great Britain of designers engaged in industry and
commerce, and the Design and Industries Association (DIA), a voluntary
association of industrial companies, designers, and others interested in the
promotion of good design in industry.
Official responsibility towards the nation’s architecture is concerned with
encouraging the best in new building and preserving the best that has been
inherited from the past.
Several Government departments are concerned with domestic architecture.
The Ministry of Housing and Local Government, the Scottish Development
Department, and the Northern Ireland Ministry of Health and Local Govern¬
ment are responsible in their respective countries for approving the layout
and design of local authority housing schemes, and issue reports and
circulars setting standards for local authority housing. The Ministry of
Housing and Local Government has under its chief architect a research and
development group responsible for examining methods of building more
cheaply, and for maintaining a high standard of design. The Ministry of
Public Building and Works is responsible for the design, building and
maintenance work of all Government departments and has a research and
development group under an architect Director-General which co-ordinates
and extends research and development groups throughout the Government
service. It also undertakes the care and maintenance of historic buildings

and ancient monuments in Great Britain; in Northern Ireland this responsi¬
bility is vested in the Ministry of Finance. The Architects and Building
Branch at the Ministry of Education carries out research and development
for the school building programme. The Ministry sponsored the British
School exhibit at the 12th Milan Triennale in i960 which won the highest
award for the best school among exhibiting countries. The Ministry of
Health is carrying out a very large building programme and the Regional
Hospital Boards, through their architectural departments, are responsible
for the design and construction of a large number of hospitals and ancillary
buildings.
A number of professional, advisory and other societies and institutions
exist to further the interests of architecture and the preservation of buildings
of aesthetic value or historic interest.
Several State-sponsored organisations are concerned with special aspects
of architecture. The Royal Fine Art Commission and the Royal Fine Art
Commission for Scotland advise Government departments, planning
authorities, and other public bodies on questions of public amenity or artistic
importance; many large-scale modern buildings have had the approval of
the commissions. The National Buildings Record maintains a library of over
half a million photographs of English and Welsh architecture and an index of
architectural records in public and private possession. The Scottish National
Buildings Record carries out similar functions. The Royal Commissions on
Ancient and Historical Monuments for England, for Wales and Monmouth¬
shire, and for Scotland, record in detail all ancient and historical remains
in their countries and publish a series of surveys, designed ultimately to
cover the whole of Great Britain. The Ancient Monuments Boards for
England, Scotland, and Wales, set up under the Ancient Monuments Acts,
consider which monuments should be listed in accordance with those Acts
and advise the Minister of Public Building and Works on any questions
concerning ancient monuments. In Northern Ireland the Ministry of Finance
administers the Ancient Monuments Acts (Northern Ireland) and is advised
by the Ancient Monuments Advisory Council. The Historic Buildings
Councils for England, Scotland, and Wales, constituted under the Historic
Buildings and Ancient Monuments Act, 1953, advise the Minister of Public
Building and Works on the provision of grants towards the repair and
maintenance of such buildings. The Historic Buildings Council for Scotland
also advises the Secretary of State for Scotland on the exercise of his functions
relating to buildings of architectural or historic interest under the planning
Acts. An Historic Buildings Bureau finds new uses for unoccupied historic
buildings of outstanding interest.
The leading professional architectural institution in the United Kingdom
is the Royal Institute of British Architects (RIBA) to which are allied 48
autonomous architectural societies covering the whole of the United Kingdom
and most of the overseas Commonwealth. The Royal Institute has a member¬
ship of over 21,000, and some 5,000 students. It has one of the largest and
most important architectural libraries in the world, housing over 70,000 books
and periodicals and many thousands of drawings. The RIBA holds an annual
conference and is concerned with a wide range of activities covering profes¬
sional practice, science, technology, statistics, architectural competitions,
professional and public relations. It arranges lectures and discussions on a
variety of subjects, presents exhibitions and through its Board of Archi¬
tectural Education controls the training and examination of architects. The

Royal Gold Medal for Architecture is awarded annually by the Queen on
the recommendation of the RIBA.
Education in architecture in the United Kingdom is given at 29 Schools
of Architecture recognised for exemption from the RIBA Intermediate and
Final examinations and 2 recognised for the Intermediate examination only.
In addition, there are 42 schools of art and technical institutes (ten full-time)
which prepare students for the external examinations of the RIBA.
It is against the law for any person to practise or carry out work under
any name, style or title containing the word ‘architect’ unless he or she is
registered. The statutory body which regulates registration is the Architects’
Registration Council of the United Kingdom. The principal professional
associations of architects are the Incorporated Association of Architects and
Surveyors, the Institute of Registered Architects, the Faculty of Architects
and Surveyors, the Royal Incorporation of Architects in Scotland, and the
Royal Society of Ulster Architects. Other societies include the Architectural
Association, the Architecture Club, and a number of societies interested in
particular aspects of architecture, such as the Modular Society.
The Civic Trust, established in 1957, seeks to promote high standards in
architecture and civic planning and to encourage a wider interest in the
appearance of towns, villages and the countryside. The Trust makes awards
for good architectural design, in two classes; the first for planning develop¬
ments, such as housing estates, the second for smaller projects, for example,
shop fronts.
Among the preservation societies are the Georgian Group, a society de¬
signed to awaken interest in Georgian architecture and to save Georgian
buildings from destruction; the Society for the Protection of Ancient Buildings;
and the National Trust in England, Wales and Northern Ireland and the
National Trust for Scotland, which together own more than a hundred
houses of historic or architectural interest, many of which contain pictures
and other works of art. Most of these houses, and other ancestral homes, are
open to the public at a small charge and attract large numbers of visitors.
The Treasury has powers to accept historic houses and their more important
contents in lieu of death duties; such properties are normally administered
by the National Trust. The Historic Churches Preservation Trust was
formed in 1952 to raise funds to supplement the efforts of parishes to put
their churches into good repair: by the end of 1962, it had made available
sums totalling £925,000 to 1,500 churches and chapels of various religious
denominations.
A knowledge of literature is fostered in Britain by the schools, colleges and
universities of the country, in all of which English literature is taught either
as part of a general course or as a specialist subject. Interest in the subject
is thereafter maintained by the libraries, by the very large number of private
literary societies, by book reviews in the press and on the radio, and by the
numerous periodicals concerned in whole or in part with literature. A limited
measure of State support for literature is given through the Arts Council
and the British Council.
Recognition of outstanding literary merit is given in the form of literary
prizes, a number of which are awarded annually, for instance, the Queen’s
Gold Medal for Poetry, the James Tait Black Memorial prizes for biography
and literature, the John Llewellyn Rhys Memorial prize for young writers of
promise, the Hawthornden prize for imaginative writing, the Library

Kate Greenaway Medal for the best children’s book illustration and the
Somerset Maugham award for young writers. The Arts Council makes
triennial awards for the best books of poetry published; it also encourages
poetry readings and subsidises the Poetry Book Society.
The largest library in Britain is that of the British Museum in London (about
6J million volumes).1 The National Library of Scotland (over 2 million
volumes) is in Edinburgh, and that of Wales in Aberystwyth (nearly 2 million
volumes). Together with the Bodleian Library in Oxford (2^ million volumes)
and the Cambridge University Library (about million volumes) these
comprise the ‘copyright’ libraries of the country and are entitled to receive
a copy of each new book published in Britain: the British Museum Library
must receive a copy, the other libraries may claim one.
Other great libraries include2 : the University of London Library,3 the
libraries of the universities of Edinburgh, Glasgow and St. Andrews, and
Queen’s University Library, Belfast; the London Library (the largest
public subscription library) and the John Rylands Library, Manchester;
the National Lending Library for Science and Technology at Boston Spa,
Yorkshire (see p. 223), the Science Museum Library, the Victoria and Albert
Museum Art Library and the British Museum (Natural History) Library;
the India Office Library and the Public Record Office (which contains the
non-current records of the superior courts of law and of most of the Government
departments); the libraries of the Royal Institute of International Affairs,
the Royal Commonwealth Society, the Commonwealth Institute, the
Royal Geographical Society, the Royal Institute of British Architects and
the British Drama League; the Royal College of Music, Royal Academy of
Music and Central Music Libraries; and the National Library for the Blind.
The Arts Council has founded a reference and lending library of modern
English poetry, which is housed with the National Book League. The National
Register of Archives, maintained by the Historical Manuscripts Commission
in the Public Record Office building, contains particulars of numerous local
and private records.
The public libraries of Britain maintain a service throughout the country,
administered by over 560 public library authorities (county councils, county
borough councils, municipal borough councils, urban district councils and
a few parish councils). Together these authorities provide more than 40,000
service points; they hold about 77 million books and make more than
460 million loans a year. (These figures do not include the use made of libraries
in the publicly maintained schools.) A feature of the service in rural areas is
the travelling van, which is an itinerant library. Over a quarter of the total
population are registered members of public libraries.
In addition to lending books, music scores and gramophone records,
and providing special facilities for, among others, children, patients in hospitals
and prisoners, public libraries engage in many other activities, such as play
readings, lectures, film shows, music circles and co-operation in university
extension education.

A committee set up by the Minister of Education to examine the structure
of the public library service in England and Wales issued its report (known
as the Roberts report) in 1959. Its principal recommendations were that
every public library authority should have a statutory duty to provide an
efficient library service; that the Minister of Education should have general
supervisory responsibilities and be assisted by an advisory body in England
and Wales; and that non-county borough and urban district councils which
cannot satisfy the Minister that they are providing an efficient library service
should have their public library powers withdrawn. Ways of implementing
these recommendations were suggested in the reports of two committees,
Standards of Public Library Service in England and Wales and Inter-Library
Co-operation, both published in 1962.
Co-operation within the network of libraries greatly increases the value of
the service. Library co-operation is organised, in the first instance, through
regional library bureaux, and is finally centralised in the National Central
Library with its widespread system of outlier libraries (public, university
and special), giving access to a total stock of some 100 million books and
many thousand sets of periodicals. The Scottish Central Library carries out,
in Scotland, functions similar to those of the National Central Library. Both
Central Libraries are financed in part by Exchequer grants. In Northern
Ireland there is no regional library bureau but access to the stocks of the
National Central Library, the Scottish Central Library and the Irish Central
Library is available on application to the Belfast public libraries, Queen’s
University Library and the county libraries.
The two principal organisations to which librarians belong are the Library
Association, with the affiliated Scottish Library Association, and the Asso¬
ciation of Special Libraries and Information Bureaux (ASLIB) (see p. 223).
The Library Association endeavours to unite librarians and governors of
libraries throughout the world and through its meetings, personal service
and publications, including its official journal The Library Association Record,
to provide for their general and specialised professional interests.
In addition to the services provided by public libraries, many firms and
institutions (in particular, institutes of higher education, such as technical
colleges) provide library facilities; some bookshops also maintain lending
libraries for their customers.
New books constitute the large majority of all books published annually
in Britain. In 1962 nearly 1,100 British publishers issued 25,079 separate
titles, of which 18,975 were new books and the rest reprints or new editions.
In recent years there has been a great increase in the number of books of
all kinds published with paper covers (‘paper backs’).1
The above figures do not include Government publications by Her Majesty’s
Stationery Office, which is the largest publishing organisation in' Britain;
the great majority of books, however, are produced by some 300 of the
principal commercial publishers, including the university presses, notably
the Oxford University Press (including the Clarendon Press) and the
Cambridge University Press.
Leading organisations representing the interests of those concerned with
book production and distribution are the Publishers’ Association, the
Booksellers’ Association, and the Society of Authors.

Societies for the promotion of literature include: the National Book League,
which encourages the reading of and an interest in books, and which holds
exhibitions, including annual exhibitions of book design, and arranges
exhibitions of books in overseas countries; the English Association, which
aims at upholding the standard of English writing and speech; and the
Royal Society of Literature, which is concerned with the advancement of
literature. The British Academy for the Promotion of Historical, Philosophical
and Philological Studies is the leading society in Britain dealing with human¬
istic studies. It receives a grant from the Treasury.
Interest in poetry is encouraged by the Poetry Society, the Apollo Society,
the Company of Nine, and other societies which sponsor poetry readings
and recitals. Poetry also plays an important part in various annual festivals,
including the National Eisteddfod—the bardic festival held in Wales—the
Stratford upon Avon Festival of Poetry, the Cheltenham Festival of Art and
Literature, and the biennial poetry festival organised by the Poetry Book
Society in London.
Among the specialist societies are the Early English Text Society, the
Bibliographical Society, the Harleian Society, the Saltire Society, and several
societies devoted to particular authors, of which the largest is the Dickens
Fellowship. There are also a number of clubs and societies, such as the
Book Society and the Poetry Book Society, which exist to distribute selected
new books to their members.
State patronage of the drama is expressed through the Arts Councils of
Great Britain and of Northern Ireland, which grant subsidies to certain
theatrical managements operating on a non-profit-distributing basis (i.e. using
profits to finance future productions), provided that such managements have
given evidence of serious aims and of consistently high standards of practical
competence; and through the British Council, which is responsible for making
the British theatre better known abroad by organising and sponsoring
international tours by important companies such as the Royal Shakespeare
Theatre Company, and by sending overseas lecturers on drama and exhibi¬
tions of theatrical design or of books dealing with the British theatre. The
Arts Council also operates a scheme for the promotion of newT drama whereby
guarantees may be offered to managements giving the first professional
production of selected new plays; and promising authors may be awarded
bursaries. Similar schemes have been started to encourage stage designers,
producers and those wishing to take up theatre administration. Subsidies are
also given for parties travelling to the theatre from outlying districts.
There are about 200 professional theatres in Britain. The centre of theatrical
activity is in London, where there are some 30 principal theatres in the
‘West End’ and several more in the suburbs. With the exception of six
theatres—Covent Garden, Sadler’s Wells, the Old Vic, the Royal Court, the
Mermaid and the Aldwych, at present the London home of the Royal
Shakespeare Company—these are let to some 25 producing managements on
a commercial basis for each production. The provincial theatres are served by
productions touring either before or after London presentation, by companies
specially formed for touring, and by local repertory companies. Although
many theatres have been closed in recent years, new ones have been opened
both in London and the provinces. The Mermaid Theatre, the first to be
built in London for 25 years, was opened in 1959, as was the completely
reconstructed Queen’s Theatre; the Royalty Theatre opened in i960 (but
has been used as a cinema since 1961); and another new London theatre,
238
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
the Prince Charles, was opened in 1962. The first full-scale theatre to be
built by a civic authority since 1939, the Belgrade Theatre, was opened in
Coventry in 1958, and smaller theatres have been opened in Middlesbrough
and Whitehaven (Cumberland). New civic theatres have been, or are being,
built in Nottingham, Croydon, Eastbourne, Guildford and Torquay, and
others are planned for Manchester, Birmingham and Leicester; and a festival
theatre with an open stage, opened in 1962 at Chichester (Sussex). In addition
to managements which rent theatres there are a number of companies which
produce plays in theatres of their own. In 1963 a National Theatre Company
was formed which will eventually play in the new National Theatre, to be
built on the south bank of the Thames, London (together with an opera
house which will provide a new home for the Sadler’s Wells Opera Company).
Under the terms of the National Theatre Act, 1949, the Treasury is pro¬
viding £1 million towards the capital cost of the scheme. Any additional
expenditure on the two buildings, up to a limit of £1-3 million, will be met by
the London County Council (LCC). Both the Treasury and the LCC will
provide annual subventions towards the running costs of the theatre and
opera house. The Royal Shakespeare Company presents plays at the Royal
Shakespeare Theatre, Stratford upon Avon, and at the Aldwych Theatre,
London. In 1956 the English Stage Company was established at the Royal
Court Theatre in London, where it presents contemporary plays. Theatre
Workshop, formed in 1945, has since 1953 performed classical and contem¬
porary plays at the Theatre Royal, Stratford, London (except for one year
when the theatre was leased to another company). Provincial theatre com¬
panies (many of which are assisted financially and otherwise by the Arts
Councils in Great Britain and in Northern Ireland) may have the use of their
own theatres (as in Bristol, Lincoln, Liverpool, Nottingham, Salisbury,
Perth, Belfast and Birmingham) or may rent them from a local authority.
A few companies also exist especially to tour the smaller towns and villages,
playing from one to several nights in each place. A large number of organisa¬
tions present children’s plays in London and the provinces. The National
Youth Theatre, consisting of schoolboy actors, has its own centre in London
but also presents Shakespearean productions in the provinces and abroad.
The Open Air Theatre in Regent’s Park, London, has presented many
summer seasons of repertory, mainly plays of Shakespeare and other poetic
drama. The Ulster Group Theatre in Belfast specialises in Ulster comedy;
the Belfast Arts Theatre, specialising in international drama, has now become
the Belfast Arts Theatre Trust and has moved to a new building where
Irish plays will also be presented. As a stimulus to the presentation of good
drama in Northern Ireland, professional theatres are eligible for grants in
respect of specific productions approved by the Arts Council of Northern
Ireland. The Lyric Players Theatre, a non-profit-making organisation, under
a board of trustees, presents Irish and international drama, and plans to
build a small theatre in or near Belfast. Inevitably, the work of provincial
theatre companies varies in quality but, generally speaking, the standard of
both production and acting is high: London managements watch their
activities and may sometimes bring their productions to the West End.
Many of the leading dramatists, producers, designers, actors and actresses
in Britain started their careers in such companies.
Theatre Clubs' and Theatre clubs for regular patrons are run in connection with some of the
Licensing company-owned theatres. Where seats are sold only to theatre club members
(for instance, the Arts Theatre, London), the plays are not subject to the
PROMOTION OF THE SCIENCES AND THE ARTS
239
provisions of the Theatres Act, 1843. This Act deals with the licensing of
theatres and plays and requires all new plays to be approved by the Lord
Chamberlain,1 who may forbid the presentation of any play ‘for the preserva¬
tion of good manners, decorum, or of the public peace’. The Lord Chamber-
lain may require amendments to be made to the text of a play, but the number
of plays for which a licence is refused amounts to under one per cent of the
total submitted.

Most managers and artists are members of professional organisations
which exist to maintain the standards of the professional theatre, to regulate
the industry and to promote and safeguard the welfare of those who work
in it. Organisations of this kind include the Theatres’ Advisory Council,
the London Theatre Council, the Provincial Theatre Council, the Society
of West End Managers, the Theatrical Managers’ Association, the Council of
Repertory Theatres, British Actors’ Equity (the actors’ trade union) and
the League of Dramatists. The trade union of theatre staffs is the National
Association of Theatrical and Kine Employees.
The Society for Theatre Research brings together those interested in the
history and technique of the British theatre. The International Theatre
Institute has a British centre in London. Its headquarters are in Paris and
there are 44 member countries. The main purpose of the institute is to foster
international goodwill and understanding by interchange of students,
theatrical companies, theatre personnel and all theatrical information. The
British centre’s committee is composed of representatives of the Arts Council,
British Council, League of British Dramatists, British Drama League,
Conference of Repertory Theatres and representatives of the theatre.
The Arts Council is co-ordinating plans for the celebration in 1964 of the
quater-centenary of Shakespeare’s birth.
Amateur
Theatre
The amateur dramatic movement is widespread throughout Britain; there
are thousands of amateur dramatic societies, with an active membership of
some half a million. The movement is sponsored and fostered by local
education authorities, by other public bodies, and by five special organisations—
the British Drama League, the Standing Conference of Drama Associations, the
Scottish Community Drama Association, the Ulster Drama League and
the Association of Ulster Drama Festivals. Amateur companies which stage
productions in their own theatres (for instance, the Maddermarket Theatre
in Norwich) belong to the Little Theatre Guild of Great Britain.
The British Drama League, founded in 1919, operates on a basis of
affiliation and individual membership. Its services include the arrangement
of courses, lectures and competitions in dramatic work; the provision of a
library, which has the largest collection in Britain of plays and books on the
theatre, and an information bureau; and advice on such matters as play¬
writing, production, stage management and the organisation of drama
festivals. The Standing Conference co-ordinates the various bodies concerned
in the amateur dramatic movement. Functions similar to those of the league
and the conference in England and Wales are fulfilled in Scotland by the
Scottish Community Drama Association, which receives some financial
assistance from the Scottish Education Department.
The Universities of Oxford and Cambridge have famous dramatic societies,
and there are drama clubs and societies in many other universities and colleges.

Dramatic training is provided mainly in the dramatic schools and institutions
established throughout Britain. Among the most important are the Royal
Academy of Dramatic Art (which is grant-aided by the Treasury, and which
provides a two-year course in all branches of stage work), the Central School
of Speech and Drama, the Rose Bruford Training College, the London
Academy of Music and Dramatic Art, the Webber-Douglas School, the
Guildhall School of Music and Drama and the Arts Educational Schools,
all of which are in or near London; and the Old Vic School in Bristol.
Some form of education in drama is also provided in many schools and
youth clubs in Britain, and a varying degree of recognition is given to the
subject in the universities. The University of London offers a Diploma in
Dramatic Art; and Bristol University has created a department of drama
offering a course which an arts student may take as part of a general degree
course. Since 1962 Manchester University has offered courses in drama
for honours or general arts degree students, and also a diploma course in
Theatrecraft (embracing sound and television broadcasting). In 1959 Bristol
inaugurated the International Festival of University Theatre now held
annually in Britain.
Although cinema attendance has been declining in recent years (attendances
at cinemas in Great Britain dropped from 1,635 million in 1946 to 395 million
in 1962) and the number of cinemas in Great Britain decreased by about
2,290 between 1946 and 1962. In 1963 there were over 2,300 cinemas in
Great Britain (with a total of over 2-3 million seats).
About 10 per cent of British first feature films are made, and between
25 and 35 per cent are distributed, by the two large amalgams, the Rank
Organisation and the Associated British Picture Corporation, which have
companies for production, distribution and exhibition. Most producers who
are independent of either group make films in association with other film
distributors. There are numerous companies (many of them small) which
produce short films.
Cinematograph films were first shown to the public in Britain in 1896, and
within ten years Britain was in the forefront of film production. This early
ascendancy did not survive the impact of the first world war and since 1914
British films have had to contend with keen competition from the United
States.
Feature films in the years after the second world war were influenced by
the highly successful documentary technique which was developed in Britain
during the 1930s, and realistic treatment became a characteristic of British
feature production, both in dramatic films and in the light-hearted satirical
comedies that won international acclaim. In recent years this talent for
realism has been successfully employed in feature films reflecting current
social problems or based on war experiences.
London is one of the most important centres for the making of films for
international markets and export earnings are an important part of total
earnings. British films, actors and creative and technical talent are appreciated
abroad as well as at home and frequently achieve success at international
film events. The British Film Producers Association and the Federation of
British Film Makers are the two trade associations to which many feature
film producers belong.
The documentary tradition in short film production in Britain goes back
to 1929, when a group of directors began making factual films of a distinctive
PROMOTION OF THE SCIENCES AND THE ARTS
241
Foreign Films
Film Institutes,
Councils, and
Societies
and imaginative kind on behalf of the Government, and later for commercial
organisations. The war years saw a big expansion in this field and, since
then, British documentary technicians have continued to produce high
quality factual films which have won numerous international awards. An
interesting development has been the attempt to re-interpret the documentary
tradition in contemporary terms by a group of young technicians—the Free
Cinema movement—and by the television film units of the British Broad¬
casting Corporation and the Independent Television Authority contractors.
The Association of Specialised Film Producers, the trade association of
documentary and specialised film makers, has over 70 members, and there
are many other, non-member, companies.
The Government has continued to sponsor a wide range of information
films and film material. These are produced through the film, television and
newsreel services of the Central Office of Information (COI), which com¬
missions their production by private companies and by the television
and newsreel organisations. Documentary films, television programmes and
newsreels are produced to inform audiences overseas about British life
and achievement. These, together with other films acquired from private
industry and public bodies, are distributed throughout the world, in English
and many foreign languages, by British Information Services.
The films produced by the COI for Government departments have
included many specialised films on science, agriculture, health and industry.
Films for industry, produced by the Government, the British Productivity
Council and private firms, have helped to increase productivity; to the same
end, many hundreds of industrial films from other countries have been
evaluated, and the best of them made available to industrial audiences
through the COTs Central Film Library1 and other agencies.
The Films of Scotland Committee, set up in 1936 and revived in 1954
by the Scottish Council (Development and Industry) in consultation with
the Secretary of State for Scotland, promotes the production of Scottish
films covering the industries and cultural traditions of Scotland.
Films from abroad made in languages other than English often draw large
audiences in London and a few other large cities, but are rarely shown through¬
out the country.
The development of the film as an art is promoted by the British Film
Institute, founded in 1933, which is financed partly by an Exchequer grant.
The Institute encourages the making and showing of good films and helps
the public to appreciate them. Similar work is undertaken in Scotland by
the Scottish Film Council, which is also financed in part by an Exchequer
grant. The British Film Institute administers the National Film Theatre in
London and the National Film Archive, runs an annual summer school, and
maintains a film library from which films may be hired, a library of books on
the film and an information service. The Institute also makes grants to the
Scientific Film Association, the University Film Council and the Society for
Education in Film and Television, and administers a fund for the production
of experimental films.
The National Film Archive contains over 18,000 films, including newsreels
and other miscellaneous items, besides scripts, art designs, posters and
about 500,000 photographic stills, selected to illustrate the history and the
art of the film and as significant social and historical records.
1 The Central Film Library also makes available on hire to schools, colleges and other
institutions films on many specialised subjects.

The National Film Theatre, on the south bank of the Thames, in London,
shows films of outstanding historical, artistic or technical interest; it holds
a unique position as a cinema offering regular programmes unrestricted by
commercial considerations or by the age or nationality of the films shown.
The Society of Film and Television Arts, formed in 1958 by the amalgama¬
tion of the British Film Academy and the Guild of Television Producers and
Directors, has as its aim to improve the standard of film and television
production and to stimulate public appreciation of the arts.
The art of film production is a costly one which depends upon a commercially
prosperous industry for its development and needs adequate financial
backing combined with freedom for the film-maker to experiment and to
express his own ideas. There is no State-owned film production unit in
Britain, but the National Film Finance Corporation, a statutory body set up
in 1949, lends money for film production. Its members—a chairman, a
managing director and three to five others—are appointed by the Board of
Trade. Its funds (limited by statute to £8 million) are provided up to
£6 million by advances from the Board of Trade; the remaining £2 million
may be borrowed from non-Governmental sources. Over the last ten years
the Corporation has been financially concerned with about half the first
feature films made in British studios.
There is a levy on cinema admissions to provide a film production fund.
The money so raised is paid out as a percentage of a film s takings, so that
the more successful a film is at the box-office, the more it receives from the
fund. Started by the industry in 1950 on a voluntary basis, the scheme
became statutory under the Cinematograph Films Act, 1957, which gave the
President of the Board of Trade powers to make regulations governing the
collection, by the Board of Customs and Excise, of a levy from exhibitors,
and the distribution of the proceeds for the benefit of British film production.
The British Film Fund Agency undertakes the distribution.
To help British films meet the keen American competition, legislation
passed in 1927 introduced the quota system (continued by subsequent
legislation), under which a certain proportion of British films must be shown
in British cinemas each year. The proportion is fixed by the Board of Trade
annually after consultation with the Cinematograph Films Council, any
change being effected by statutory instrument approved by both Houses of
Parliament. For first feature films it has stood at 30 per cent since 1950.
The State takes no part in the censorship of films in Britain, but, by virtue
of their power to grant licences, the local licensing authorities act as the final
arbiters of films proposed for showing in their areas. There are over 700
licensing authorities; they are local authorities or, in some areas, magistrates.
In judging the suitability of films the authorities normally rely on the judg¬
ment of an independent body, the British Board of Film Censors, to which
are submitted all films (other than newsreels) intended for public showing.
The British Board of Film Censors was set up in 1912 on the initiative
of the cinema industry, to ensure that a proper standard was maintained in
the films offered to the public. It consists of a president, a secretary, and
five examiners (including two women) appointed by the president who is
elected by a trade committee and is usually a man prominent in public life.
The Board, which does not use any written code of censorship, may require
cuts to be made before it will grant a certificate to a film; very rarely, it will
refuse a certificate. Films passed by the Board are placed in one of three
PROMOTION OF THE SCIENCES AND THE ARTS

categories: ‘U’ (suitable for universal showing); ‘A’ (more suitable for adults
than children) and ‘X’ (suitable only for adults). A child or young person
under 16 years of age may be admitted to a cinema showing an ‘A’ film only
if accompanied by a responsible adult, and may not be admitted on any
condition if an ‘X’ film is being shown.
The Cinematograph Act, 1952, which came into force in January 1956,
provided for the making of regulations by the Home Secretary to protect
the health and welfare of children attending film shows. Cinemas which give
children’s shows require a special licence from the licensing authority,
which may impose special conditions. The British Board of Film Censors
publishes at intervals a list of films particularly suitable for children and for
exhibition at children’s matinees. One of the women examiners is appointed
for her special knowledge of children’s needs.
Children’s cinema clubs, providing special programmes on Saturday
mornings, are widely organised by the cinema groups and have become very
popular. An important contribution to these programmes is made by the
Children’s Film Foundation, which produces and distributes entertainment
films specially designed for children. The foundation is a non-profit-making
body set up by the British film industry in 1951 and under the Cinemato¬
graph Films Act, 1957, it receives grants from the British Film Fund Agency.
In Britain today, music in all its forms is drawing large audiences; and music
festivals, orchestral concerts, choral singing, brass bands, opera and ballet
are important features of British cultural life.
Tours abroad by British orchestras, soloists, and opera and ballet com¬
panies are sometimes assisted financially by the British Council, which
sponsors some recordings of works by British composers, and maintains
libraries of British music (scores and records) in 108 countries overseas. At
the Council’s London headquarters a reference library of records, scores, and
books on music is maintained, and musicians from abroad are sometimes
invited to Britain as the Council’s guests, to gain first-hand experience of
British music-making.
The National Music Council, representative of every aspect of British
musical activity, is affiliated to the International Music Council and UNESCO.
Seasons of orchestral concerts are promoted every year in many of the large
towns and cities of Britain. In London the principal concert halls are the
Royal Festival Hall on the south bank of the Thames, used for both orchestral
concerts and recitals; the Royal Albert Hall, Kensington, where mainly
orchestral concerts, including the annual summer season of Promenade
Concerts are given; and the Wigmore Hall, which is the principal recital
centre. In 1961 the London County Council announced plans for two small
concert halls to be opened on the south bank of the Thames by 1965.
Among the leading British orchestras are the London Philharmonic, the
Royal Philharmonic, the Philharmonia, the Royal Liverpool Philharmonic,
the Halle (Manchester), the London Symphony, the City of Birmingham
Symphony, the Bournemouth Symphony, the Northern Sinfonia (Newcastle
upon Tyne), the Scottish National and the BBC Symphony, Northern and
Scottish orchestras. There are also the specialised string and chamber
orchestras such as the Philomusica of London and the London Mozart
Players; and a number of new orchestras which have been formed during the
past few years. Many of these receive financial aid from the Arts Council

and local authorities to help with the cost of maintaining ensembles, of
presenting new or unfamiliar works, and of improving standards generally;
some of them also receive assistance from commercial television and other
business organisations. The City of Belfast Orchestra is financed jointly by
the Belfast Corporation and the Arts Council of Northern Ireland.
The principal choral societies in Britain are the Royal Choral, the BBC
Choral, the Huddersfield Choral, the Halle Choir, the Liverpool Philharmonic
Choir, the London Philharmonic Choir, the Philharmonia Chorus, the Bach
Choir, the Royal Edinburgh Choral Union and the Belfast Philharmonic
Society. These and many other choral societies are associated with famous
orchestras in major choral works; most of them, together with hundreds of
similar choral and orchestral societies and music clubs, are affiliated to the
National Federation of Music Societies, through which they are supported
with funds provided by the Arts Council. Membership of the National
Federation has risen to over 850 societies. Among societies which specialise
in encouraging the performance of the work of living musicians are the
Society for the Promotion of New Music, the Music Section of the Institute
of Contemporary Arts and Macnaghten Concerts.
Music festivals in Britain, originating with the Three Choirs Festival held
annually in Gloucester, Worcester or Hereford in rotation, have been in
existence for over 200 years. The festival idea has developed considerably
in recent years, and festivals of music and other arts are now held annually in
many cities and towns throughout the United Kingdom. The famous Edin¬
burgh International Festival of Music and Drama lasts three weeks; other
festivals such as at King’s Lynn, last a week or less. Among the better known
are the Royal National Eisteddfod of Wales, the Llangollen International
Eisteddfod; the National Gaelic Mod, held at a different place in Scotland
each year; the Cheltenham Festival, largely devoted to contemporary British
music; the Aldeburgh Festival; the Bath Festival; the Coventry Festival;
the Haslemere Festival; the York Festival; and the Leeds and Norwich
Festivals of choral music, which are held triennially. An annual international
festival of folk song and dancing is held by the English Folk Dance and
Song Society.
Interest in amateur music-making is increasing. It is encouraged by the
work of County Music Committees,1 which are aided by the Carnegie United
Kingdom Trust and united in the Standing Conference for Amateur Music.
The Rural Music Schools Association is concerned with music-making by
amateurs in country districts; it brings together professional musicians,
teachers, administrators and amateurs.
Professional organisations which look after the interests of music and
musicians include the Musicians’ Union, the Incorporated Society of
Musicians, the Composers’ Guild, and the Songwriters’ Guild.
Specialised education in music is given at colleges of music, of which the
most prominent are the Royal Academy of Music and the Royal College of
Music in London, the Royal Manchester College, and the Royal Scottish
Academy in Glasgow, all of which receive grants-in-aid. There are also the
Trinity College of Music and the Guildhall School of Music and Drama,
both in London, and the School of Music in Birmingham. Youth orchestras
are strongly encouraged, and children’s concerts, given by symphony

sub-committees.

orchestras directed by prominent conductors, are a regular feature of the
country’s musical activities and have helped to develop among young people
an appreciation of the world’s greatest music. The National Youth Orchestra
of Great Britain and the National Youth Orchestra of Wales, made up of the
most promising members of school orchestras, are noted for their high
standard of performance, and so is the London Schools’ Symphony Orchestra.
A ‘Youth and Music’ organisation, affiliated to the continental ‘Jeunesses
Musicales’, was established in 1954 to encourage musical education and
performances for young people. The British Students’ Orchestra, specially
formed in 1958, 1959 and 1961 from music students for performances abroad,
has achieved great successes.
In schools, more children are learning to play musical instruments; and
over 120,000 candidates a year (children and other students) take the exam¬
inations of the Associated Board of the Royal Schools of Music, the largest
proportion (about 80,000) choosing the piano as their instrument.
The increase in musical appreciation among the general public during recent
years is shown by the size of the audiences for concerts and for broadcast
music. Of some 77 million gramophone record units sold during 1962, the
proportion of classical music was about one-seventh. The National Federation
of Gramophone Societies has some 350 affiliated societies.
The City of Westminster houses the Central Music Library in its Bucking¬
ham Palace Road library building, and many other public libraries have
collections of music that can be borrowed; some of them also lend gramophone
records.
Regular seasons of opera and ballet are given at the Royal Opera House,
Covent Garden, London, leased by the Government1 to the Royal Opera
House, Covent Garden, Limited, which was formed in 1944 to make the
famous opera house the home of a national opera and ballet, and which
receives a Government grant through the Arts Council. The Royal Opera
House has its own resident opera company and ballet company which give
performances in London and elsewhere. The opera company, which numbers
about 200 and has a permanent orchestra, makes an annual tour of provincial
centres. The ballet company, incorporated in 1957 with the Sadler’s Wells
Theatre Ballet and the Sadler’s Wells School to form the Royal Ballet, has
a high international reputation gained in many overseas tours.
Seasons of opera are also given at the Sadler’s Wells Theatre in London;
with two permanent opera companies, Sadler’s Wells provides a full London
season, and opera and operetta for 42 weeks in other centres.
At Glyndebourne, in Sussex, an opera season, for which an international
cast is specially assembled, is held every summer. Other opera companies
include the English Opera Group, formed in 1947, and noted for its perform¬
ances of operas by Benjamin Britten; the New Opera Company, formed in
I957 by members of the Cambridge Opera Group to produce new operas
in London and give opportunities to promising amateurs and young pro¬
fessionals; the Handel Opera Society; the Intimate Opera Company, which
performs works for very small casts in any hall available; and the Welsh
National Opera Company. Opera in Northern Ireland is promoted by the
Grand Opera Society of Northern Ireland and the Studio Opera Group,
both receiving a subsidy from the Arts Council of Northern Ireland. The

Ballet Companies
Arts Council (Great Britain) manages two small operatic groups (Opera for
All) which specialise in introducing opera to audiences in small towns who
hitherto have been unfamiliar with it. There are also a number of amateur
opera clubs in London and the provinces, in Glasgow and Edinburgh, in
Northern Ireland and in universities.
Among the ballet companies are the Ballet Rambert, Britain’s oldest
ballet company, which has discovered many distinguished dancers and
choreographers, London’s Festival Ballet and an important new group,
Western Theatre Ballet, that includes a large proportion of contemporary
works in its repertoire. The work of the Irish Ballet Company in Northern
Ireland, which is sponsored by the Arts Council of Northern Ireland, com¬
bines traditional music, dancing and mime. The Royal Ballet, the Arts
Educational, and the Rambert Ballet Training Schools and the Royal Academy
of Dancing are among the teaching institutions which have played an im¬
portant part in raising British ballet to its present high standard.

THE NATIONAL
ECONOMY
247
BACKGROUND
Britain ranks about 75th in size among the countries of the world, with
about 0-18 per cent of the world’s land area. In population, with slightly
under 2 per cent of the world’s inhabitants, it ranks tenth. In density of
population it is fourth: of the major countries, only Japan, Belgium and the
Netherlands are more crowded; and there are nine times as many people to
the square mile in the United Kingdom as in the United States. In world
trade, it ranks third, accounting for about one-tenth of the total. It takes
about a fifth of the world’s exports of primary products, and provides about
one-sixth of the world’s exports of manufactured goods.
Britain, from its own soil, provides only about half of the food it needs,
and—apart from coal and low-grade iron ore—it has few natural resources;
thus it is the world’s largest importer of such products as wheat, meat, butter,
fodder grains, citrus fruits, tea, tobacco, wool, and hard timber. In return,
it is one of the world’s largest exporters of aircraft, motor vehicles, electrical
equipment, chemicals, textiles and most types of machinery. No other
country has such a small proportion of the working population engaged in
agriculture (only slightly more than 4 per cent).
The United Kingdom is also the central banker of the sterling area, an
area with a quarter of the world’s population. Many countries outside the
sterling area use sterling in their international transactions, and it is the
currency in which about one-third of the world’s trade is conducted.
During the nineteenth century Britain secured a leading position as world
manufacturer, merchant, carrier, banker, and investor and so was able to
support a rapidly increasing population at a rising standard of living. It was
Britain’s commerce in cotton goods, above all, which gave it the leading
position in world trade; cotton cloth provided 40 per cent of its exports
in 1851. It was in this period also that the country became so largely
dependent on imports of foodstuffs and raw materials.
During the period from 1870 to 1890 British industrial expansion had the
clearest lead over that of other countries. Between 1890 and 1914 growing
industrial competition from Europe and North America began to make
itself felt, but its effects on Britain’s staple export industries, particularly
cotton textiles and coal, were offset by the general rise in world trade, by
the continued demand for British textiles from India and other eastern
countries, and by the continued high level of overseas investment.
The new problems confronting British industry and trade in the twentieth
century became apparent after the first world war. Textiles from India and
Japan, where labour was cheaper, established themselves firmly in the large
eastern markets, to a great extent replacing the more expensive and often
higher quality British products. The extension of the world demand for coal
was slowed down by the increasing use of oil, while coal from the newer
European mines competed keenly with British coal.

Effects of
the Second
World War
Post-war
Developments
In the old-established branches of the vehicles and engineering group of
industries (for instance, locomotives, ships and textile machinery) world
demand fell away after a brief post-war boom, and Britain failed at first to
gain a compensating share of the expanding world trade in the new types of
engineering products (for example, cars and electrical goods). Most countries
were tending towards self-sufficiency, and some sought deliberately to protect
nascent and even established industries by tariffs and (later) quotas and
exchange restrictions.
Income from overseas investments and a substantial improvement in the
terms of trade (the price of exports relative to the price of imports) cushioned
the effect of a fall in the volume of exports, and imports remained high.
The loss of export markets led, however, to a contraction of Britain’s staple
industries—coal, cotton, iron and steel, and the older branches of engineering.
The result was heavy unemployment, the general rate of which averaged
14 per cent of the working population in the years 1921-39, reaching a peak
of 22 per cent in 1932, when the slump in world trade was at its worst. In
districts relying mainly on one or other of the staple industries, the rate was
much higher.
After 1932 an improvement in the levels of production and employment
took place, stimulated by an increase in home investment which was aided
by the policy of cheap money, by some revival in world trade and, after 1935,
by the armament programme. The decade saw a strong expansion in the
vehicles, electrical, chemicals and aircraft industries, while the construction
of 3 million houses brought about a large growth in the building and ancillary
industries. By 1937 average real income per head was about 14 per cent
higher than in 1929.
The second world war is estimated to have run down British domestic
capital by about £3,000 million, through shipping losses, bomb damage, and
arrears of industrial maintenance and replacements. It also resulted in con¬
siderable alterations in Britain’s financial and trading position. These included
the sale of £1,000 million worth of overseas investments, nearly half in
North America, and the accumulation of new external debts of £3,000 million.
Exports had fallen by 1944 as a result of the war effort to less than one-third
of their 1938 volume while there had been a sharp adverse movement in the
terms of trade as a result of the world shortage of raw materials and other primary
products. On the credit side, there was the large volume of fixed investment
in the munitions industries, a greatly increased skilled labour force in the
engineering trades, and a prosperous and well-equipped agricultural industry.
Britain has since 1945 experienced, with few interruptions, a steady growth
in output of goods and services and a high level of employment. New inven¬
tions and technological advance and shifts in world demand have helped to
produce some radical changes in the British industrial scene. Industries in
which new techniques have predominated, notably the electrical engineering,
aircraft, motor and chemicals industries, and new branches of machinerv
construction, are contributing a significantly larger share of the total output
and of total exports and providing wider employment opportunities for an
increasingly skilled labour force. Expenditure on industrial and scientific
research has increased steadily and facilities for technological education have
been greatly enlarged, and these trends are gathering momentum.
At the same time, the United Kingdom has had to deal with some persistent
economic problems; in particular, to fulfil its overseas obligations and to

maintain its traditional role in world commerce and finance it has needed to
achieve and maintain a substantial balance of payments surplus. In the initial
post-war years Marshall Aid and loans from the United States and Canada
helped to overcome the serious deficit in the balance of payments pending
the full recovery of exports. Exports of both goods and services have main¬
tained the upward trend, but in some years the rate of increase has been
insufficient to pay for a rising volume of imports (almost all restrictions on
imports having been removed) and to provide for overseas investment and
economic assistance to developing countries.
The persistent rise in prices, a continuing problem shared with most other
countries, has not yet been fully checked. During some periods it stemmed
from an excessive pressure of demand—exports, investment at home and
abroad, personal consumption, defence and other public expenditure both at
home and overseas—on the nation’s resources, but more recently the tendency
for money incomes to rise faster than production, thus raising costs, has been
a more dominant influence. The Government has found it necessary to take
strong short-term measures designed to curb inflationary tendencies without
impairing a high level of employment and to protect the balance of payments;
but it is also increasingly concerned with working out policies to relate
increases in incomes to the rate of economic growth and to evolve machinery
for longer-term planning of the economy.
THE STRUCTURE OF THE ECONOMY
The following sections sketch briefly the salient features of the national
income and expenditure of Britain in recent years. The source of Tables 9 to
13 is Preliminary Estimates of National Income and Balance of Payments 1962
(Cmnd. 1984).
In 1962 Britain’s gross national product (the measure of total goods and
services produced at home and net income from abroad) is estimated to have
totalled £24,826 million. In real terms, that is after allowing for price changes,
the increase over the ten-year period to 1962 has amounted to about 28J per
cent; this is equivalent to an average annual advance of nearly 2| per cent.
In terms of national income per head the United Kingdom ranks appreciably
below the United States and Canada and slightly below Australia, New
Zealand, Sweden and Switzerland, and about on a par with France and the
German Federal Republic.
The working population has been rising relatively slowly; in the ten years
to the middle of 1963 it increased by slightly over 1^ million (or some 7 per
cent) to about 25J million, of which slightly more than two-thirds are males,
while the total population rose by only 5 per cent. (There has been a higher
rate of increase, however, in the number of women in employment.) The
expansion of the national income over the same period has, therefore, been
mainly the result of higher productivity. Unemployment over the past two
decades remained very low, on average less than 2 per cent of the working
population being out of work, compared with 14 per cent between the two
world wars. During the severe winter of 1962-63 it rose to over 950,000,
and, except for a brief spell in 1958, this has been the only period during
which the total has exceeded 500,000.
A decline in some of the staple industries, notably coalmining and ship¬
building, has given rise in some areas to a rate of unemployment considerably
above that for the country as a whole. As part of its policy of maintaining
250

TABLE 9

Services
full employment, the Government has taken a number of measures, both
fiscal and administrative, to steer additional employment to those districts—
mainly in Scotland, north-east England and Northern Ireland—where new
opportunities for work are needed.
From 1955 to 1962 there was an annual average increase of about 2^ per cent
in the output of goods and services per head of the labour force, the chief
factor in the growth of the gross national product. From 195° t° I954 ^ was
under 2 per cent. The evidence points to the current rate of increase being
about 3 per cent per annum. The high volume of investment in i960 and
1961 is likely to stimulate further the underlying rate of growth, when its
full effects on productive capacity are felt. Likewise, the steady increase in
expenditure on civil research and development will tend to raise further the
level of productivity.
Table 9 shows the distribution of total supplies of goods and services
since 1950, at 1958 prices, divided into consumers, public authorities,
investment and exports, while the diagrams on page 251 show changes in
national expenditure between 1952 and 1962 and production and national
income trends since 1900.

Manufacturing industry contributes about 36^ per cent to the total output
of goods and services, and together with mining and quarrying, construction
and public utilities (gas, electricity and water) makes up just under half of
the total; agriculture, forestry and fisheries account for slightly over 4 per cent;
transport and communications, together with the distributive trades, for more
than 20 per cent. The remainder, just over one-quarter of total output,
includes public administration, education, health and financial services. Over
the past ten years the only marked change has been the decline in the proportion
contributed by agriculture (though agricultural output is actually rising).
Industrial production as a whole has risen since 1951 by just over one-
third, and in the eight years from 1954 to 1962 by about one-quarter in
manufacturing industry. Rising output has made possible an appreciable
advance in living standards, the raising of investment progressively to the
present record levels, and a notable but not fully adequate expansion in
exports.
Defence expenditure has made heavy calls upon resources at certain periods;
in peak years in the early 1950s it absorbed over 10 per cent of the gross
national product, but more recently the proportion has been about per
cent. In real terms, between 1954 and 1962 gross fixed capital formation
rose by 48 per cent; exports of goods and services went up by over a quarter
and consumers’ expenditure by just under a quarter; public authorities
current expenditure was up by only 5 per cent, and the increase has been
concentrated in the period since 1959.

BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Gross fixed investment has risen markedly in relation to pre-war levels. In
1938 fixed investment in the United Kingdom was about i2| per cent of
the gross national product; in 1948, 14 per cent. It reached 18J per cent in
i960 and 19 per cent in 1961, falling back to just under 19 per cent in 1962.
In some years, such as 1951 and i960, the level of economic activity has been
influenced by a high and rising investment in stocks and in work in progress.
Investment in manufacturing reached a peak of £1,239 ndllion in an
increase of about one-third (at current prices) on the 1958 level; steel,
chemicals, motor vehicles and electronics are manufacturing industries in
which investment has been especially high. Housing received a substantial
share of capital resources in the early part of the 1950s, but tended to decline
until 1958; since then it has risen in real terms by 40 per cent and is likely
to expand further. Transport and communications and electricity generation
and distribution are other sectors in which investment has grown strongly
in recent years.
Except in 1961, more than 40 per cent of total fixed investment over the
years 1951 to 1962 has been carried out by the central Government, the local
authorities and the public corporations, the last accounting for half of public
investment, and the central Government for about one-tenth. Each year the
Government considers, in the light of the overall position of the economy,
proposals put forward by the authorities concerned for capital expenditure
in the following financial year. Public investment in 1962 amounted to about
£1,966 million, an increase of £165 million over 1961, reflecting increased
expenditure on education, hospitals, roads, electricity generation and other
services. It is expected to rise more quickly in 1963. The diagram below
shows the division between public and private investment and the pattern
of investment according to type of asset in 1958 and 1962. Table 10 shows
the division into industrial groups of gross fixed investment in the same
years.

The marked growth of investment since 1954 has been greatly facilitated by
a substantial increase in personal savings (see Table 11).
Personal savings in 1961 reached a record total but fell back in 1962 by
about £130 million to £1,810 million, although this was 80 per cent higher
than the average for 1958-60 and three times as great as in 1955; it is equiva¬
lent to nearly two-fifths of total savings. In the period 1948-51, on average
only about 2 per cent of disposable personal income was saved; by 1957 the
proportion had risen to nearly 6| per cent and in 1962 it slightly exceeded
9 per cent.

a Gross saving, i.e. before providing for depreciation and stock appreciation and for
tax, dividend and interest reserves.
The rise in personal savings has taken various forms. There has been
increased investment by the personal sector itself in new dwellings and fixed
assets. Life assurance premiums and other forms of contractual savings, such
as superannuation funds, have grown almost without interruption since 1948
and in 1962 contributed nearly half the total. National Savings have also
increased since the early 1950s, although there has been a marked drop from
the record peace-time total of £390 million in 1959, and building societies
are attracting considerable sums of personal savings, reaching a peak of
£372 million in 1962.
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
The largest sector contribution to savings comes from companies, which
up to 1959 provided about half the total, but the fall in company profits and
other factors since i960 have led to a marked drop in their savings. The
proportion allocated to savings of gross trading profits of companies has
tended to fall since 1959 to under half the total, with an increasing share
being taken by dividends and interest payments.
Public corporations, as part of the policy of financing a larger share of their
investment needs from their own resources, have raised their savings total
considerably since 1959; and in 1962 the Budget surplus on Government
account raised the central Government’s share of total savings to nearly
one-eighth.

Expenditure
Expenditure by the central Government (including the national insurance
funds) and the local authorities on revenue account, i.e. excluding public
investment but including interest paid on debt, has for some years been
about one-third of the gross national product, though after reaching a
relatively low level in the mid-1950s the proportion has been tending to rise
again. It amounted to about 39 per cent in 1962. The main causes of this
rise have been the continuing growth of the social services, and especially
education, and (since i960) the upturn in defence expenditure, which absorbed
i8| per cent of the total current expenditure of the public authorities in 1962
(compared with a peak of 27 per cent in ipSS)- Total expenditure by the
public authorities rose by nearly one-quarter between 1959 and 1962.
The expansion of the national income has enabled central Government tax
revenue to increase by about 30 per cent since 1957, despite several reductions
in taxation rates. Revenue from taxes on expenditure, and especially from
purchase tax on cars and durable goods, rose slightly faster from 1958 to
i960 than that from taxes on income, partly because of tax reductions, but
since then the growth of personal incomes has provided an increase of one
quarter in two years in the yield from the taxes on incomes. Increases in the
rates of contributions for the national insurance and health schemes have
increased revenues between i960 and 1962 by ^289 million to ,£1,201 million.
Revenues from rates imposed by local authorities rose by one-third in the
four years from 1958 to 1962.
Table 12 shows how the public authorities collected and spent their
revenue, including national insurance and health contributions, in 1957 an(^
1962.
Incomes from employment in 1962 totalled ,£17,000 million, having increased
by nearly one-third in five years, and accounted for slightly over 71^ per cent
of total personal incomes (against 59^ per cent in 1938); for rent dividends
and interest the corresponding percentages were just under 11 and 22|. The
diagram on p. 255 shows the composition of personal incomes and expenditure
in 1962.
After payment of income tax and surtax, income is fairly evenly distributed.
Of a total of 26-9 million incomes in 1961, there were only about 15,000
incomes of more than £6.000 a year. About one-quarter (6-9 million) of
incomes after tax were in the ,£250-500 range and somewhat fewer (6-i
million) in the next range of £501-750. The number of incomes of £1,000
a year and above has risen from o-86 million in 1954 to 3-76 million in 1961.
About 63 per cent of the yield from income tax and surtax came from persons
with annual incomes in this latter category, although the total incomes before
tax of this group accounted for only 30 per cent of all personal income.

The ownership of property and personal assets tends to be more concen¬
trated than income after tax. It is estimated that in 1961 73 per cent of net
personal wealth (including landed property) was owned by 3,176,000 indi¬
viduals, 6 per cent of the population.
While consumer expenditure rose by 45 per cent between 1955 and 1962
to reach a total of £18,370 million, in real terms (i.e. after discounting the
effect of price changes) the increase has been about 18 per cent. In the four
years between 1958 and 1962 it rose by 11^ per cent. The proportion of this
larger expenditure devoted to food has been falling slightly each year and
now accounts for about 28^ per cent; outlay on manufactured foods and on
beverages, however, has risen appreciably. Housing absorbs over 9J per cent
of total expenditure. Spending on motor cars and other personal transport
has shown a steep rise for several years, and there has also been a substantial
growth in spending on household electrical equipment. Outlays on cinema¬
going have dropped by half since 1957, while those on running costs of vehicles
have risen by about two-thirds to over £500 million annually.

Between 1945 and the middle of 1958, the cost of living in the United
Kingdom rose almost without interruption, though at varying rates of increase.
The most rapid rise in retail prices, roughly 10 per cent, was between 1950
and 1951; the lowest, about 2 per cent, between 1953 and 1954- After two
years of stability, retail prices advanced by about 8 per cent between mid-1960
and the end of 1962. The increase in incomes has, however, been at a con¬
siderably faster rate than that of prices. From 1955 to 1962, retail prices
increased by 23 per cent; hourly wage rates by 41 per cent; and personal incomes
as a whole by about 48 per cent. The annual rate of increases of incomes has
been some 6 per cent (but about 5^ per cent since 1957), while the corre¬
sponding rise in the gross domestic product per head has been only about
2| per cent. It is clear that the main immediate cause of the rise in prices has
been the tendency of money incomes to rise faster than production.
Steps have been taken by the Government throughout the period to check
gradual inflation. The main weapons used since 1955 have been the prevention
of excessive demand by monetary and fiscal measures—bank rate, bank
advances, hire purchase controls, taxation changes—and efforts to promote
voluntary restraint in increases in wages and profits.
In November 1962 the Government set up a National Incomes Commission
to provide impartial and authoritative advice on important claims for income
increases both in industry and in public and other services. The Commission
publishes its findings and recommendations on matters referred to it.
In 1959 and the early months of i960 there was a rapid growth in demand
and output. It became necessary to restrain the pressure of demand by a series
of moderate disinflationary measures, and balance of payments difficulties
made more stringent measures necessary in the summer of 1961, including
a ‘pause’ in wages, salaries and other incomes. A general levelling off in world
business activity during 1962 meant that a further Government stimulus to
the economy was desirable. Reductions in taxation and the easing of credit
restrictions were introduced during the autumn, while the 1963 Budget was
framed so as to promote a growth of internal demand without inflation. The
Budget statement made it clear that if the national target of expansion at
the rate of 4 per cent per annum were to be achieved without inflation,
the annual rise in money incomes should be no more than 3 to 3! per cent
a year.

Policies
Balance of
Payments
Long-term planning of public expenditure, with regular surveys for periods
of years ahead, has been much developed by the Government in recent
years.
As part of the Government’s plans to secure economic stability and
sustained growth, the National Economic Development Council (NEDC)
was set up in February 1962. The task of the NEDC, of which the Chancellor
of the Exchequer is chairman, is to examine the economic performance of
the nation with particular concern for plans for the future in both the private
and the public sector, to consider use of resources and to seek agreement
upon ways of increasing the rate of sound growth. The Council has its own
staff. Up to August 1963 it had published three reports. The first, issued in
February 1963, considered the possibility of an annual average growth in the
gross national product of 4 per cent between 1961 and 1966 (see also p. 273).
In its analysis the Council is assisted by detailed inquiries into a cross-section
of industry.
A strong balance of payments is vital to Britain because of its exceptionally
high degree of dependence on international trade, its many overseas com¬
mitments, and its position as banker to the sterling area: therefore, one of
the foremost objectives of the Government’s economic policy must always
be to preserve this strength.
Britain’s net overseas short-term liabilities in the form of sterling balances
held by other countries and non-territorial organisations are substantial,
amounting to £3,543 million at the end of 1962. Gold and foreign currency
reserves at the end of July 1963 stood at £976 million. As a second line
of reserves, the United Kingdom has drawing rights on the International
Monetary Fund (IMF) which it can exercise with the permission of the Fund,
and indeed has done so on three occasions, in 1947, 1956, and 1961. The
1962 one-year stand-by arrangement with the Fund, which authorised
drawings up to the equivalent of $1,000 million, was renewed in August 1963
for a further year. Taking into account external assets and liabilities as a
whole, the United Kingdom is probably a net creditor country.
In normal times it is necessary to earn a substantial surplus on current
account in order to finance a capital outflow in the form of private investment
and Government grants and loans. There are also, however, important
commitments which Britain has to meet within the current account. The
most important of these are the costs of overseas military expenditure, which
rose from £181 million in 1958 to £249 million in 1962, and grant assistance
to less developed territories, mainly the United Kingdom dependent terri¬
tories. Total bilateral grant aid of this kind exceeded £75 million in 1962;
in addition, there is multilateral assistance, in the form of contributions to
international agencies such as the International Development Association.
On capital account, the largest component is generally private investment
abroad (net of disinvestment) and over the last few years the outflow has
been within a range of £260 million to £330 million a year. A considerable
proportion of this outflow has been to the less developed countries and has
thus maintained the traditional role of Britain as a source of finance for
overseas development. At the same time there is a steady flow of private
capital to Britain from overseas, mainly from the United States.
The United Kingdom also has to make repayments of capital and interest
on post-war loans from the United States and Canada, the servicing of
which requires about £67 million a year. In addition, there has been a sub¬
stantial increase in recent years in Government loans to developing countries.

(Total aid from Britain to overseas countries, including grants as well as
loans, rose to about £153 million in 1962 from ^81 million in 1957-58.)
Excluding the special factors of Britain’s subscriptions to the IMF and
the acquisition by the Ford Motor Company of America in 1961 of out¬
standing shareholdings in its British subsidiary, in recent years the net
capital movement has been outward, averaging about ^210 million a year
from 1958 to i960 and £90 million in 1961 and 1962.

Region
ORGANISATION AND PRODUCTION
The United Kingdom was the first country in the world to become highly
industrialised. Thirteen people work in mining, manufacturing and building
for every one in agriculture. It is the world’s third largest exporter of
manufactured goods and the range of its industrial manufactures reflects its
position as one of the most important workshops of the world.
The factors that have influenced the location of industry in Britain are many
and various. During the rapid industrialisation of the nineteenth century
one of the most important influences was the proximity of coal, the major
source of power, particularly when it was associated with ease of access to
other raw materials such as iron ore in the West Midlands and salt (for
chemicals) in Cheshire, and to the coast, which in turn offered easy access
to imported raw materials and a quick outlet for exports. In the course of
the past hundred years, the pull exercised by coal has been progressively
weakened as improved means of communication and an alternative source of
power in electricity have been developed and have enabled advantage to be
taken of other sites—for example, those near to big consumer markets and
plentiful supplies of labour. The main areas of industrial concentration are
still, with one exception (London), the areas which saw the beginning of
Britain’s industrial greatness and which, with two exceptions (London and
Belfast), are on or near coalfields; but many smaller and more widely dispersed
centres of industry have grown up, notably in southern England.
During the inter-war period there was a tendency for the ‘new’ industries,
such as those manufacturing motor vehicles, electrical goods and rubber
products, to develop rapidly in the south (especially in and around Greater
London) and in the Midlands. On the other hand, this period was one of
acute depression and mass unemployment for the older industrial areas which
specialised in the great staple industries—coalmining, steel, shipbuilding,
marine engineering and cotton manufacture. These conditions prompted
official action aimed at encouraging the development and diversification of
industry in the areas where labour and other unused resources are to be found
and discouraging further industrialisation in congested areas.
A brief description follows of the location of British industry, grouped
according to broad geographical areas.
London, situated at the head of ocean navigation on the Thames estuary,
is Britain’s capital and main communication centre, probably still the world’s
most important financial centre, one of the world’s three largest cities (with
Tokyo and New York) and one of the world’s three largest ports (with New
York and Rotterdam). Greater London (see p. 18), including the urbanised
fringe areas within 40 to 45 miles of Charing Cross, has a working population
of over five million, of whom nearly a half are in manufacturing industry.
London is the main centre in Britain of the clothing and food and drink
industries, of printing, of cinema film production, and of the manufacture
26o BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
of furniture, materials for the arts, precision instruments and many other
specialised products. Small firms predominate in many of these industries
and the average size of manufacturing firms (particularly in the County of
London) is well below the national average. London, especially its outer ring,
is also an important area for light engineering, chemicals and consumer
goods and has some heavy engineering plants and a number of impoitant
research establishments. Towards the periphery of the London conurbation
and in the new urban development outside it, industry, particularly the
electronics and a variety of consumer goods industries, has been expanding
rapidly; some of the largest aircraft plants are in this area, as well as the
factories, at Dagenham, Luton and Dunstable, of two of the five main motor
vehicle manufacturers. Along the lower Thames and Medway estuaries there
are large oil refineries as well as shipyards and a variety of other engineering
works.
West and The largest city, Bristol, is both a leading port and an industrial centre with
South-west England aircraft, tobacco, food processing, paper, paint and other industries. Gloucester
has engineering plants; Swindon has railway and engineering works, and
Bath is also a growing manufacturing centre. The port of Southampton is
served by the largest passenger liners and has ship-repair yards, oil refineries,
synthetic rubber and other industries. Plymouth has an important naval dock¬
yard and several light industries. The noted West of England woollen and
worsted cloths come from factories in the Cotswold valleys.
East Anglia and Besides being one of the most productive agricultural regions, the eastern
Lincolnshire counties possess some sizeable towns. Ipswich and Grantham are renowned
for agricultural machinery and implements, and Norwich for footwear and
food manufacture. Food canning and freezing, based mainly on locally grown
produce, have developed rapidly. Scunthorpe, in Lincolnshire, is an im¬
portant steel-making centre, and the ports of Grimsby and Yarmouth have
extensive fish processing plants.
Midlands The main industrial area of the Midlands consists of the great conurbation
centred on Birmingham and Wolverhampton (which includes portions of
Staffordshire, Worcestershire and Warwickshire) wdiere there is a wide variety
of industry, including notably the manufacture of metals, electrical and
engineering products of all kinds, and also jewellery, rubber products and
domestic metalware. The smaller conurbation of North Staffordshire,
centred on Stoke-on-Trent, is devoted chiefly to the manufacture of pottery
and china and to coalmining. The largest concentration of motor vehicle
manufacture in the United Kingdom is situated in the Midlands, at Coventry
and Birmingham and, further to the south, near Oxford.
Industrial cities and towns lying outside the main industrial area include
Leicester (hosiery, clothing, footwear and footwear machinery), Derby (general
engineering, locomotives, aero-engines), Nottingham (light engineering, lace,
pharmaceutical products, tobacco), Rugby (electrical engineering), Northamp¬
ton (footwear, engineering) and Kidderminster (carpets). Corby, in
Northamptonshire, has a steel industry originally based on local deposits of
iron ore, and at Peterborough there are several large engineering works.
The richest coalfield in Britain, with the highest output per man, lies in
the north-west of the area and continues into Yorkshire.
Lancashire Besides being the commercial hub of the cotton and, to an increasing extent,
the man-made fibres textiles industry, Manchester is one of the chief centres
of electrical and heavy engineering, machine tools and dyestuffs in Britain.
Most of the cotton and other yarns are spun in Bolton, Oldham, and Rochdale,

and at Stockport (in Cheshire); further to the north lie the weaving towns of
Burnley, Nelson, Blackburn, Colne, Accrington and Darwen; Preston and
Bury both have spinning and weaving plants. Engineering industries, notably
the manufacture of printing, paper making, textile and electrical machinery
and commercial vehicles, are, however, more important to the area than
cotton, which has been declining for some years. The Lancashire coalfield
also lies in the Manchester-Wigan area.
The Manchester Ship Canal, which carries a substantial volume of overseas
trade, links Manchester with Merseyside. It passes through the important
industrial towns of Warrington with its metal industries (such as wire-drawing),
Widnes with its chemicals, and Ellesmere Port with its oil refinery installations,
before reaching the Mersey estuary. St. Helens, to the north of the canal, is
famous for glass manufacture. Liverpool is the second port of Britain, a great
commercial and insurance centre and, after London, the greatest centre for
processing imported foodstuffs and raw materials, being noted especially for
flour milling, soap manufacture, sugar refining and rubber products. Among
its older industries is ship repairing; shipbuilding is a major industry across
the river at Birkenhead. Many new industries, including electrical engineering,
the manufacture of other heavy industrial equipment and, more recently,
motor car manufacture, have been established in the Liverpool area, particularly
on industrial estates. Barrow, in the north-west of the county, is a well-known
shipbuilding and marine engineering area.
Most of the county’s industry is located in the West Riding, where about
90 per cent of the United Kingdom’s worsted industry and the greater pro¬
portion of its woollen industry are found. Bradford is the commercial centre
of the wool trade and an important city for worsted; Morley and Leeds have
specialised in cheaper cloths, and Batley, Dewsbury and Cleckheaton in
heavy cloth, but their production is becoming more diversified. Huddersfield
has a reputation for fine woollens and worsteds and Halifax for carpets. In
most of the larger centres of the wool industry a variety of engineering products
are manufactured. Leeds, the commercial capital of the area, has a large
ready-made clothing industry and important engineering plants. Further
south is the heavy engineering centre of Sheffield, famous for its high quality
steels, cutlery and tools. The area’s extensive coalfields provide about one-
fifth of Britain’s coal. York, noted for chocolates and confectionery manufacture
and with important railway workshops, and Hull, one of the world’s largest
fishing ports and with many manufacturing industries, including engineering,
vegetable oil processing, paints and sawmilling, are other important industrial
towns in Yorkshire.
North-east England The coal industry is of great importance in Northumberland and Durham.
Tyneside and Wearside together are second only to Clydeside for shipbuilding
and ship repairing, and ships are also built at the Hartlepools and on Tees-side.
Iron and steel plants are situated at Consett, in County Durham, and on
Tees-side, which is also the most important centre for chemicals in Britain.
Tyneside is particularly noted for the manufacture of heavy electrical
equipment. Other industries of the north-east, whose manufactures have
been greatly diversified since 1937 as a result of the establishment of large
industrial estates, are mining and other machinery, rolling mill plant,
earth-moving equipment, machine tools, ropes, glass, clothing and scientific
instruments.
Wales Although coalmining, including the extraction of special coals such as steam
coal and anthracite, remains the largest single source of employment in
262

Policy
South Wales, the area today produces many categories of capital and con¬
sumer goods and more than twice as many people work in general manu¬
facturing as in coalmining. Its steel industry, with some of the most modern
plants in Europe, supplies almost all Britain’s output of tinplate and a large
proportion of sheet steel. In the past 25 years a number of new industries
have been established, including plastics, synthetic fibres, clothing, electronics
and light engineering; many of the new factories are on industrial estates.
The largest cities are Cardiff and Swansea. In North Wales a number of light
industries are located in the seaside resorts and other towns, particularly
Wrexham.
In Scotland coalmining, iron and steel and shipbuilding remain of great
importance but there is now a wide range of modern manufacturing industries.
Clydeside, which includes the city of Glasgow, remains Britain’s largest
shipbuilding and marine engineering centre but has also a wide variety of
engineering firms and is a centre for the paint, furniture and other industries.
The steel industry, sited mainly in north Lanarkshire, provides a full range of
products. The Scottish coalfields, principally in the Lothians, Ayr and Fife,
mine about one-eleventh of Britain’s coal. Among other industries with a
notable history are jute, concentrated in Dundee, and the high quality tweed
and knitwear industries of the Highlands and Islands and the Border towns
of the south.
Industrial concentration is at its greatest in the Central Lowland belt, in
the vicinity of Dundee and in Aberdeen, though in recent years towns outside
these areas have been attracting light industries. In Edinburgh, the capital,
the engineering, printing and brewing industries have been joined by
electronic equipment. Newer industries in Dundee include office machinery,
clocks and watches, refrigerators and washing machines. The thiee new towns
of East Kilbride, Cumbernauld and Glenrothes have growing concentrations
of modern industry, while during the last two years the motor vehicle industry
has been established in West Lothian and Renfrewshire.
The north of Scotland possesses Britain’s only significant resources of
hydro-electric power. In north-east Scotland is the largest concentration of
whisky distilleries.
Although the area is relatively small and lacking in minerals, there is sub¬
stantial and growing industrialisation, particularly in and around the capital
city of Belfast. The largest single shipyard in the United Kingdom is sited
in Belfast and, in addition to other long-established engineering activities,
including the manufacture of marine engines and textile machinery, Northern
Ireland has long been an important centre for textiles (particularly linen),
clothing, and tobacco manufacture. Long-established industries outside
Belfast are mainly connected with textiles or clothing but rapid diversification
has brought new industries to many areas. A newer industry is aircraft
construction, which is important in Belfast. Northern Ireland has become
one of the most important areas for man-made fibres, and there have been
extensive developments in carpets, synthetic rubber, oil-well equipment,
and a wide range of electrical and mechanical engineering, both light
and heavy.
While the Government has no power to direct an individual firm to set up
a new factory or plant in any particular area or site, it has sought, on both
economic and social grounds, to control the expansion of industry in some
areas and to encourage it in others.

263
Under the Town and Country Planning Acts, the consent of the local
planning authority is, in general, necessary for any new building, any extension
of a building or any change in the use of an existing building. Where industrial
floor space of more than 5,000 square feet is to be created, such consent
cannot be sought without a certificate from the Board of Trade that the
development is consistent with the proper distribution of industry. One
object has been to try to limit the expansion of industry in congested areas,
such as Greater London or Birmingham.
The main aim of the Government’s positive measures has been the
alleviation of local unemployment. The first Act dealing with this problem,
the Special Areas (Development and Improvement) Act, was passed in 1934,
a time of acute economic depression; its aim was to help certain large industrial
regions, in which over a third of the working population were unemployed.
Under this Act and amending Acts of 1936 and 1937, these regions—West
Cumberland, the north-east coast of England, South Wales and the Clyde
Valley—were designated ‘special areas’ and special commissioners were made
responsible for their development and improvement. Industry was attracted
to the areas by various inducements, mainly the lease of factories built by
Government-financed non-profit-making estate companies and also certain
loan facilities and Government grants.
Under the Distribution of Industry Acts, 1945 and 1950, the original
special areas were renamed ‘development areas’ and enlarged, and the
Government’s powers of assistance were strengthened. The Board of Trade
took over the special commissioners’ powers to build and let factories in
these areas and, in addition, could and did designate additional areas, while
the Treasury had powers to make loans or grants to undertakings unable to
secure finance through normal channels.
Partly as a result of this Government action the special problems of some
parts of the development areas were greatly reduced; and the general employ¬
ment position remained much better than it was before the war. Employment
problems emerged in a number of new, and often small and isolated districts
and the Treasury was empowered to help firms in such areas.
The principal legislative basis of the Government’s powers to alleviate
local unemployment was simplified and strengthened by the passing of the
Local Employment Act, i960. Under this Act, the Government’s powers of
assistance are centred in one department, the Board of Trade, which can
name as ‘development districts’ places where high and persistent unemploy¬
ment exists or is expected, and can offer a number of inducements to
industrialists to settle or expand there. Specifically, the Board can build
factories for leasing at favourable rents or sale on deferred terms; make a
capital grant towards the cost of an industrialist’s own factory or for unusual
initial expenses arising solely from the choice of a development district; and
make loans towards working capital or for acquiring premises or equipment.
The appropriate Government departments can also make grants to local
authorities for clearing derelict or neglected sites and for improving basic
services.
Under the Act, the Government-controlled industrial estate companies,
which under the Distribution of Industry Acts had run the industrial estates
in the development areas, have been replaced by three Industrial Estate
Management Corporations, one for England, one for Wales and one for
Scotland. These corporations are controlled and financed by the Board of
Trade.
During the winter of 1962-63 the further decline in some basic industries,
264
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Northern Ireland
Rural Industries
such as coal and shipbuilding, combined with some general falling off in the
demand for labour (see p. 450), led to higher than average rates of unemploy¬
ment in Scotland, Merseyside, north-east England and Northern Ireland.
The Government introduced special measures to promote employment in
these districts, for example, by providing additional funds for public invest¬
ment in roads and other building and by special tax concessions available
to firms in productive industry undertaking new development. It also made
more use of its powers under the Local Employment Act, i960, and has
assisted or approved a number of major projects. Altogether, in the first
three years of the operation of the Act the Board of Trade undertook to
provide total assistance of ^81 million, of which ^29 million was to provide
Board of Trade factories. Under the Local Employment Act, 1963, the rates
of assistance to firms moving to a development district were made more
definite and generous. The building grant payable towards the cost of
providing premises to create employment was fixed at 25 per cent, while a
new grant of 10 per cent was available towards the cost of installing plant
and machinery for industrial undertakings.
The Local Employment Act does not apply to Northern Ireland. The matters
with which the Act deals are the concern of the Northern Ireland Parliament.
Under the Industries Development Acts (Northern Ireland), 1945 to 1953,
a comprehensive and flexible scheme of assistance (which can include the
tenancy or purchase on favourable terms of a Government-built factory,
together with a grant towards the cost of plant and machinery and the cost
of transferring equipment from a factory outside Northern Ireland) can be
offered to projects which appear likely to make a desirable contribution to
the economy of Northern Ireland. Grants and loans can also be offered to
the appropriate authorities for the improvement of basic services if these
should be considered inadequate for a given development. Firms which are
assisted under the Industries Development legislation are expected to under¬
take a specific development which will employ an agreed number of persons
within a given period. Under the Capital Grants to Industry Acts (Northern
Ireland), 1954 to 1962, manufacturing enterprises in Northern Ireland are
entitled to claim outright grants of 33-j per cent of their annual expenditure
on plant and machinery and industrial building, subject, in the case of firms
new to Northern Ireland, to a maximum grant of £200,000 in any one year.
This assistance, which is largely unconditional, is intended primarily to
encourage modernisation and capital investment.
Since 1945, 168 new firms have been established in Northern Ireland and
133 schemes of expansion carried out with Government assistance, develop¬
ments which at present are employing some 46,000 persons. The Ministry
of Commerce is the Northern Ireland Government department concerned
with the administration of the Industries Development and Capital Grants
legislation.
Encouragement is given to the development of rural industries. In England
and Wales there is the Rural Industries Bureau, which, on the recommenda¬
tion of Rural Community Councils, provides technical advice and instruction
to craftsmen and small rural businesses; it also provides loans from the Rural
Industries Loan Fund, started in 1940, for the acquisition of equipment and
the purchase or improvement of workshops. In Scotland the corresponding
body is the Scottish Country Industries Development Trust, founded in
I935> which exercises local and national responsibilities for the development
of rural industries.

INDUSTRY 265
In Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales there are national organisations
devoted to encouraging the expansion and diversification of industry. The
Northern Ireland Development Council, established in 1955, makes more
widely known in Great Britain and elsewhere the facilities offered by Northern
Ireland to new undertakings; and advises the Northern Ireland Government
on matters connected with industrial development. The chairman of the
council is appointed by the Prime Minister of Northern Ireland and the other
members are appointed by the Prime Minister in consultation with the
chairman. The Scottish Council (Development and Industry), with a wide
membership including local authorities, trade associations, trade unions,
chambers of commerce, co-operative societies and banks, is concerned with
the economic development of Scotland. It assists the expansion of existing
industry, fosters the growth of new industries, especially in areas requiring
development, encourages exports, organises exhibitions and publicises
Scottish trade and industry. There are several voluntary associations concerned
with the needs of Welsh industry as a whole, but the most similar in aims
and constitution to the Scottish Council is the Development Corporation for
Wales, founded in 1959.
In England certain regions and cities have established industrial develop¬
ment associations which are concerned with studying local industrial needs
and with trying to attract suitable industry. These associations are sponsored
mainly by local authorities and trade associations, but may also include
firms, financial and commercial interests, and individuals in their membership.
The pattern of ownership and organisation in industry is varied. Personal,
corporate, co-operative and public enterprise all assume a number of different
forms, and all are important in the economy. Industrial enterprises vary
from the many small workshops to vast organisations such as the National
Coal Board, a public corporation with about 550,000 employees; Imperial
Chemical Industries Ltd., a limited liability company which, with its sub¬
sidiaries, employs about 114,000 persons in the United Kingdom; and the
Co-operative Wholesale Society Ltd., a co-operative society with about
50,000 employees.
Throughout the first half of the twentieth century, the growth of the social
services, especially health, education and housing, led to the progressively
greater influence of the public sector of the economy. There was also an
increase in the State’s direct participation in productive economic activities,
particularly in the decade 1940-50. State participation is effected mainly
through special statutory bodies set up to deal with a particular activity.
Such bodies, though not part of a Government department, are under a
considerable but varying degree of public control (see p. 271). The most
important of these statutory bodies are the public corporations which operate
major industries and services in the public interest.
The public corporation today is, generally speaking, a public body having
a clearly defined and specific task. Its managing board and its staff are chosen
for their experience and competence in a particular field; they are not civil
servants, and although they are accountable to Parliament for their actions
in a variety of ways, it is they and not the ministers of the sponsoring
departments who are responsible for the management of the corporations.
Certain of the corporations are self-supporting; others receive Exchequer
grants to help them in carrying out the duties with which they have been
charged.

Mining and

Before the second world war, a number of public corporations were
established1 in those industries and services where it was considered that the
national interest required co-ordination or control by a public authority.
Their constitutions had no standard pattern and their governing bodies
differed in the method of appointment and in composition.
Immediately after the second world war, the nationalisation Acts set up
public corporations to run certain major industries and services, including
coalmining, inland transport, gas supply, electricity generation and supply,
and civil air transport. These post-war corporations are less varied in the
structure of their governing bodies, which are appointed by the responsible
minister.
The following corporations, the organisation and functions of which are
described in later chapters, are now operating or controlling large-scale
industries or services:
Atomic Energy: The United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority.
Aviation: The British Overseas Airways Corporation, British European
Airways.
Banking: The Bank of England.
Broadcasting: The British Broadcasting Corporation, the Independent
Television Authority.
Coal: The National Coal Board.
Electric Power: The Electricity Council, the Central Electricity Generating
Board, the Area Electricity Boards, the North of Scotland Hydro-
Electric Board, the South of Scotland Electricity Board, the Electricity
Board for Northern Ireland.
Gas: The Gas Council, the Area Gas Boards.
Transport: The British Railways Board, the British Transport Docks
Board, the British Waterways Board, the London Transport Board, the
Transport Holding Company, the Ulster Transport Authority.
Much the most important of the British extractive industries is coalmining.
The coalmining industry of Great Britain (see p. 278) is operated as a single
co-ordinated enterprise under the direction of the National Coal Board.
Nearly all other mining and quarrying (iron ore, sand, gravel, chalk,
limestone, salt, tin, slate, oil shale and china clay) is undertaken by private
enterprises, usually owned and operated by limited liability companies. About
70,000 workers are employed in mining and quarrying, excluding coalmining.
Most manufacturing is in the hands of private enterprise. Exceptions include
fissile materials and radioactive isotopes made by the Atomic Energy
Authority, locomotives and rolling-stock built for the Railways Board in its
1 The principal corporations appointed before the second world war were: (1) the
Central Electricity Board, established by the Electricity Supply Act, 1926, to rationalise
electricity generation and build and operate a main transmission system; (2) the
British Broadcasting Corporation, established in 1927 by Royal Charter to provide a
national broadcasting service; (3) the Electricity Board for Northern Ireland, estab¬
lished by the Electricity (Supply) Act (Northern Ireland), 1931, to develop electricity
supplies in Northern Ireland outside the two county boroughs, Belfast and London¬
derry; (4) the London Passenger Transport Board, established by Act of Parliament
in 1933, to operate the public transport system of the London metropolitan area;
(5) the Northern Ireland Road Transport Board, established by the Road and Rail
Transport Act (Northern Ireland), 1935, to acquire public road transport services in
Northern Ireland outside the county boroughs; (6) the British Overseas Airways
Corporation, established by the British Overseas Airways Act, 1939, to take over the
operation of the two main existing air transport companies—Imperial Airways and
British Airways.

own workshops, a considerable quantity of arms and military equipment
made in Royal Ordnance factories and other factories operated by the War
Office and the Ministry of Aviation, and some fighting ships built in naval
dockyards operated by the Admiralty. The staff of the Stationery Office do
some printing and bookbinding, while the repair, and to a limited extent the
construction, of post office equipment is carried on in factories run by the
Post Office. Certain factories giving employment to the severely disabled
are operated by Remploy Ltd., a non-profit-making public company financed
on the Vote of the Ministry of Labour, which appoints the directors (see
p. 457). The equity of one large iron and steel company, Richard Thomas
and Baldwins, is still held by a Government agency, the Iron and Steel
Holding and Realisation Agency (see p. 300). The Government also holds
51 per cent of the equity of one major oil company and has a controlling
interest in a few other companies.
Surveys of the size of all manufacturing establishments employing more
than 10 persons are made periodically by the Ministry of Labour; the results
of the most recent of these surveys, based on returns rendered by employers
in June 1961, show that nearly a third of all employees in such establishments
are in those employing from 100 to 499 persons, while slightly over a third
are in establishments employing 1,000 or more persons. A high proportion
of the biggest establishments are in the heavy industries, while the average
size of establishments in industries making consumer goods is smaller than
in manufacturing industries as a whole. Comparisons with results obtained
in earlier surveys on similar lines suggest that there is a slow but significant
trend towards an increase in the average size of manufacturing establishments:
in 1961, establishments with 1,000 or more employees were found to employ
2,821,000 persons, over 25 per cent more than in 1953 and more than 2J times
as many as in 1935. In addition, there are estimated to be some 140,000
manufacturing establishments with fewer than 11 employees and in these a
total of about 750,000 workers are employed.
The size of establishments is not in itself an indication of the size of
manufacturing enterprises, as a single enterprise may own several establish¬
ments, not all of them necessarily engaged in the same or similar activities.
The most recent analysis of manufacturing enterprises by size (employment)
is provided by the Report of the Census of Production for 1958. An enter¬
prise, as defined in the Census, normally consists of either a single firm or a
holding company together with its subsidiaries. Just over half of all employ¬
ment in British manufacturing industries in 1958 was accounted for by about
950 large private enterprises employing 1,000 or more people, the largest
70 or so accounting roughly for a quarter. A further indication of the size
of companies is the value of net assets. Those of the largest, Imperial
Chemical Industries, exceed £700 million, while there are about twenty
companies registered in Britain with assets of over £100 million.
In some industries a small number of big companies and their subsidiaries
are responsible for most of the total production. Examples are oil refining,
steel making, the manufacture of motor vehicles and components, aircraft
and aero-engines, heavy electrical equipment, bicycles, cement, and basic
chemicals. Shares in these companies are usually distributed among a great
number of holders and it is rare for a few large holders to have a controlling
interest. For example, five of the largest public companies each have more
than 100,000 shareholders. The trend is towards merging into larger units
of control; and especially in brewing, pharmaceuticals, aircraft, electrical
products and newspaper and magazine publishing there have been several

movements in this direction in recent years. There has also been a growth
of large industrial holding companies, controlling a wide range of subsidiary
companies with a diversity of industrial interests.
The way in which the work of production is divided within and between
different firms varies from industry to industry and is determined by the
most economic methods of production and distribution. In the cotton
industry, for example, it is usual for different firms to undertake the various
main processes of production (spinning, weaving, finishing), while in the
woollen section of the wool textile industry all these processes are commonly
undertaken within the same firm. Some of the leading establishments in the
vehicles group of industries are primarily engaged on the assembly of parts,
many of which have been manufactured for them under contract by specialist
firms.
An account of some of the principal manufacturing industries is given on
pp. 298-322.
In building and civil engineering, large-scale work is usually carried out by
private contractors. From the end of the second world war to 1958 most new
houses were built by firms under contract to local authorities, but the majority
are now built on private orders, or for sale (see p. 192).
Building firms may be divided into those undertaking general building and
civil engineering work and those concerned with highly specialised work,
many of which operate outside as well as inside the building industry.
Building is an industry of small firms; more than three-quarters of the firms
employ fewer than 20 employees. For a fuller account of the building and
civil engineering industries see p. 295.
From the middle of the nineteenth century, private industrial undertakings
have increasingly entered into voluntary association for a number of different
purposes. Some of the more important of these purposes may be classified
as follows:
1. The provision of common services, the exchange of information, liaison
with the Government, and representation of their members’ point of view.
2. The regulation of trading practices, sometimes including the regulation
of prices (see p. 275).
3. Negotiation with trade unions on wages and conditions of work.
Associations for the first and third of these purposes cover, with varying
completeness, most of British industry, but there are wide sectors of industry
where there are no collective agreements to regulate trading practices.
Associations which deal with labour matters usually consist of firms engaged
in the same type of operation or manufacturing process. Organisations
mainly concerned with representations to the Government, provision of
common services or the regulation of trading practices are built up round a
product or an allied group of products. In an industrial sector concerned
wholly with an allied group of products, a single association may undertake
all the required functions.
There are about 80 national federations and probably altogether about
1,500 employers’ organisations (mostly regional or local, and members or
branches of the national federations) all concerned with negotiation of wages
and conditions of work. Most of the national federations are in turn affiliated
to the British Employers' Confederation, the national body representing
employers on labour questions affecting industry generally (see p. 470).
INDUSTRY
269
The number of manufacturers’ associations concerned with providing
common services is not known precisely, but according to a survey carried
out by Political and Economic Planning (an independent research organisa¬
tion) between 1953 and 1956, some 1,300 were in existence, varying greatly
in importance, structure and activities. Membership of the Federation of
British Industries (FBI), the national body recognised as a principal spokesman
for British industry on economic, commercial and production (as distinct from
labour) matters, consists of some 8,500 individual firms and about 280
national trade organisations, with a total affiliated membership of over
40,000 firms. The FBI has offices in the main industrial centres in the United
Kingdom and is widely represented abroad.
A number of the organisations affiliated to the FBI also deal with labour
matters and are affiliated to the British Employers’ Confederation. The two
organisations work closely together on matters of common interest.
Other important national associations of employers are the National
Association of British Manufacturers (NABM) and the Association of British
Chambers of Commerce. The NABM is the largest organisation of individual
manufacturing firms (over 5,000, mainly small or medium sized), with the
requirements of which its ten regional branches are particularly concerned.
Some sixty trade associations are affiliated to it. The Association of British
Chambers of Commerce is the central organisation to which 98 local
chambers of commerce (together with 15 British Chambers of Commerce
operating in foreign countries) are affiliated. The Association celebrated its
centenary in i960. In Scotland there is also a central organisation, the Council
of Scottish Chambers of Commerce. These bodies are open to all kinds of
producers and traders and exist to promote the interests of local industry
and commerce. The FBI, the NABM and the Chambers of Commerce
often act jointly in matters of common concern.
It was announced in July 1963 that the governing councils of the BEC
and the FBI and the regional chairmen of the NABM were to take steps to
define the shape of a single new National Industrial Organisation to take the
place of these three existing organisations.
Relations with
Government
The Government is able to influence industry in a number of ways—through
fiscal and monetary policy, by means of physical controls and inducements,
as well as by providing information and advice.
A system has grown up whereby a particular Government department acts
as the main point of contact, or ‘production department’, for each major
industry.
The department through which the Government’s relations with trade and
industry are chiefly conducted is the Board of Trade (which has regional
offices in the principal industrial centres) and its responsibilities cover a
wide range of industries and materials. Certain industries and services,
however, are the responsibility of other departments, as production depart¬
ments :

Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries
and Food
Ministry of Power
Aircraft, aero-engines and electronics
industries and civil aviation.

The Treasury is responsible for economic policy, and specifically for fiscal
and monetary policy, through which it is able to influence the level of
economic activity and the utilisation of the nation’s resources. The Ministry
of Labour is the channel through which manpower policy is conducted. The
Department of Scientific and Industrial Research (DSIR) undertakes research
with broad industrial applications in its own establishments and encourages
and assists industrial research in general and the widest possible dissemination
of results (see p. 213).
There are separate departments of the Northern Ireland Government for
matters within the competence of the Northern Ireland Parliament. The
Ministry of Commerce deals with industry, including the encouragement of
industrial development.
Probably the most important of the few controls in force is the power of
the Board of Trade to influence the location of industry. The housing
departments, acting through local planning authorities, have powers to control
the use of land. The export and import of a small range of products still
require Board of Trade approval.
The Central Statistical Office, which is attached to the Cabinet Office, was
established in 1940 to provide a comprehensive statistical service to assist the
authorities in framing economic and financial policy. Although departments
themselves compile statistics relating to their particular responsibilities, and
may publish them in their own standard publications, the comprehensive
statistical publications are prepared by the Central Statistical Office, which
collects the main departmental statistics and compiles its own series from
departmental and other information. Statistics relating to economic affairs may
be found in its regular publications: the Monthly Digest of Statistics, Economic
Trends (which provides a quarterly summary of the balance of payments),
Financial Statistics (monthly), the Annual Abstract of Statistics, the Preliminary
Estimates of National Income and Balance of Payments (published annually
before the Budget) and the fuller National Income and Expenditure Blue Book
issued later in the year. Statistics on Incomes, Prices, Employment and Production,
compiled by the Ministry of Labour to provide factual information for those
engaged in wage negotiations, is published quarterly. The Digest of Scottish
Statistics is published half-yearly by the Scottish Statistical Office, a Digest of

To ensure that industry is aware of Government policy and that policy is
framed with a knowledge of industry’s needs and difficulties, a number of
consultative bodies have been set up representing Government, employers’
associations and trade unions. Among these are the National Production
Advisory Council on Industry (NPACI) and the National Joint Advisory
Council (NJAC). The NPACI, which covers the wider problems of industrial
production, is under the chairmanship of the Chancellor of the Exchequer
and includes representatives of the Regional Boards for Industry (see below)
and of certain Government departments as well as of employers and workers.
Northern Ireland sends two representatives to meetings of the NPACI as
observers. The NJAC consists of representatives of private employers, the
nationalised industries and trade unions, under the chairmanship of the
Minister of Labour, and is concerned with matters affecting the relations
between employers and workers.
These consultative bodies approach the study of problems from a broad
national point of view. There are, in addition, bodies concerned with the
special problems of Scotland and Wales and of the English regions. The most
important of these are the nine Regional Boards for Industry and the corre¬
sponding Scottish and Welsh Boards for Industry, whose main functions are
to keep the Government informed on industrial conditions in the English
regions and in Wales and Scotland either by direct reference to Government
departments or through representation on the NPACI, and to provide a
link between central Government and local industry. The regional boards
have set up district advisory committees wherever they considered that the
geographical grouping of industry justified such a step.
A body of somewhat different character and function, the National Economic
Development Council (NEDC), was established in February 1962 to examine
plans for the future in both the private and public sectors of industry, to
consider obstacles to quicker economic growth and to seek agreement upon
ways to increase the rate of sound growth. The Chancellor of the Exchequer
is chairman of the Council and appoints its members, who are industrial
and trade union leaders, the Minister of Labour, the President of the Board
of Trade and well-known economists. The Council, which meets at frequent
intervals, has its own permanent staff (not members of the Civil Service)
under a Director General. By mid-1963 it had published two reports on the
growth of the economy and one on export trends.
The extent to which the responsible minister has power over the working
of the boards which have been set up to run the nationalised industries varies
from industry to industry, but two features are common to almost all of them.
First, the minister appoints (and may dismiss) the chairman and members
of each board, and secondly, he has power to give general directions as to
how the industry should be run, but does not interfere in day-to-day manage¬
ment. It is usually also laid down that the board shall give to the minister
any information, statistics and financial accounts which he may require. In
practice, as the responsible minister is kept fully informed and major policy
decisions are reached in consultation with him, there is very seldom occasion
for him to issue a formal directive.
The minister also has financial powers and responsibilities. The usual
statutory requirement is that the board is required to conduct its business so
272
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Production and
Productivity
Production Trends
that receipts at least balance outgoings taking one year with another. The
responsible minister is usually empowered (subject to Treasury approval) to
say what shall be done with any surplus revenues which may accrue. As
regards finance of capital expenditure, the present system is that such finance
as cannot be met from internal sources is mainly provided, in the form of
interest-earning loans, by the minister from the Exchequer, bank advances
being used only for normal requirements of short-term capital.
The minister responsible for each nationalised industry must take steps to
see that the interests of the industry’s customers are protected. This is usually
done by the establishment of representative consumers’ councils to consider
complaints and suggestions made to them, and to advise the board or the
minister on the changes they think desirable.
Government policy towards these industries is subject to the approval of
Parliament. Opportunities for parliamentary discussion are afforded by
debates, including debates on their annual reports and accounts, and by
answers to parliamentary questions, which, in principle, are admissible only
if concerned with policy rather than details of administration.
In a White Paper (Cmnd. 1337) issued in April 1961 the Government out¬
lined certain general principles which it believed had to be applied for the
administration of the nationalised industries to be efficient. Among them were
a balancing of revenue accounts over a five-year period, a closer definition of
the financial and economic obligations of the industries, and greater freedom
in price policies. In accordance with these principles, financial objectives for
the nationalised fuel and power industries were announced in 1962.
In order to ensure that parliamentary discussion of the nationalised industries
is informed and effective, a House of Commons Select Committee on the
Nationalised Industries was established in 1957 to examine the reports and
accounts of the nationalised industries and to report to Parliament. Reports
issued by the committee have so far dealt specifically with the two Scottish
electricity boards, the National Coal Board, the airways corporations,
British Railways, the gas industry and the electricity supply industry. These
reports have discussed problems of ministerial control, organisation, finance
and general policies. A report published in February 1962 reviewed the action
taken by the corporations and the Government in the light of the committee’s
recommendations.
Industrial production (mining and quarrying, manufacturing, construction,
and gas, electricity and water) increased rapidly in the immediate post-war
years as industry was turned over from war production and manpower was
released from the armed forces. It had regained the pre-war level by 1946,
was 15 per cent greater by 1948, and by 1955 had exceeded the 1948 level by
a further 33 per cent. Between 1955 and 1958 it was almost static; from 1958
to i960 it increased by 12^ per cent, and since i960 has risen more slowly, by
about 3 per cent. The course of production and employment from 1958 to
1962 is shown in Table 14.
Between 1958 and 1962 output in the chemicals industry rose by 29 per cent
and in engineering and electrical goods by 23 per cent. Other industries
which expanded considerably were clothing and footwear (18 per cent);
bricks, pottery and glass (26 per cent); paper, printing and publishing (22 per
cent); and construction (21 per cent). Consumption of electric power over
the period rose by over 40 per cent.
The increases in production since 1958 have been due partly to an increase
in the labour force but mainly to a variety of factors influencing productivity,

including technical advances in products, machinery and processes; the high
and increasing rate of fixed capital formation; more intensive sales promotion
and improvements in the management of particular undertakings.
Gross fixed capital formation at home has continued to increase steadily
even in periods when demand as a whole was slowing down. In 1962 it
amounted to about 19 per cent of the gross domestic product and was estimated
to be over 26 per cent greater than in 1958. Part of this rising investment is
linked with the introduction of new techniques and equipment and in
particular of machines and instruments which lessen the demand for human
skill and supervision though they may require more skill from fewer people.
All of this is part of the process known as automation, which is giving rise to
far-reaching changes in the pattern of industry and in the internal organisation
and labour requirements of business enterprises and has already been
responsible for consequential increases in production and efficiency, which in
the long run, are likely to be very large. Much investment, however, still
consists of replacements, additions and improvements of a more traditional
kind. In the short run, very large increases in output per man are sometimes
achieved by such investment or simply by changes of policy, organisation
or methods.
Both the long term and the short term growth of productivity thus depend
most directly on the decisions of individual undertakings, and the promotion
of productivity is regarded as primarily a matter for industry though Govern¬
ment departments and educational and research establishments also have their
contribution to make. Government budgeting and financial policies also have
a strong influence on the extent and direction of demand. These, therefore,
are framed to a large degree on a realistic assessment of the possibilities of
sustained economic growth.
According to the first report of the NEDC (see p. 271) technical advance
and the high level of investment which has been maintained are expected to
yield early benefits in higher productivity. Their objective for 1961 to 1966
is a rate of increase of 3-3 per cent a year, which, together with an annual
increase of 0-7 per cent in the numbers in employment, would give an average
increase in national production of 4 per cent a year over the period.
Employers’ associations and trade unions are engaged in activities to raise
industrial productivity. The former often provide technical assistance, conduct
market surveys, and support schemes of vocational education and training.
The National Association of British Manufacturers has established an advisory
service to enable small firms to obtain advice on production problems. The
trade unions in many industries organise special schemes for training young
people, and also a variety of courses designed to give trade unionists an under¬
standing of modern management techniques. Private consultants specialising
in management and work study are available to give advice to firms on
274
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
measures to increase their productive efficiency; there are also many
specialist institutions, both public and private, concerned with various aspects
of productivity.
The British Productivity Council (BPC) was established by both sides of
industry to stimulate interest in methods of raising productivity. It was set
up in 1952 to continue and develop the work of the Anglo-American Pro¬
ductivity Council which, between 1948 and 1952, sent productivity teams
from many British industries to study progress and techniques in the United
States. It is an independent body on which are represented the British
Employers’ Confederation, the Federation of British Industries, the Trades
Union Congress, the Association of British Chambers of Commerce, the
National Association of British Manufacturers and the nationalised industries;
its work is financed by contributions from these bodies and by a Government
grant-in-aid. Advisory committees have been set up to promote productivity
in the building trades, in agriculture and in retailing. Much of the BPC’s
work is done through over 100 local productivity committees and associations
throughout the country. These local organisations arrange meetings, inter¬
factory visits, courses, conferences, film shows and exhibitions. To assist
them, and the many other national and industrial bodies with which it co¬
operates, the BPC produces booklets, pamphlets, case studies, films and a
monthly bulletin, and arranges work study demonstrations.
A National Productivity Year, initiated by the British Productivity Council
(BPC), opened in November 1962. Its aim has been to focus attention on
every possible means that lie within the capacity of management and workers
to raise efficiency and lower costs, and it has been supported by employers,
professional organisations, trade unions, research bodies, universities and
technical colleges.
The British Standards Institution (BSI), is a voluntary non-profit-making
body incorporated by Royal Charter. It prepares and promulgates standards
in respect of, inter alia, quality, performance, dimensions, testing methods
and codes of practice. Voluntary acceptance of such standards by manufac¬
turers, buyers and sellers reduces unnecessary variety and simplifies the
specification of requirements, thus promoting industrial efficiency. The BSI
is governed by a council consisting of representatives of the main organisations
of employers and workers, professional institutions and the larger Government
departments.
The Board of Trade is the department responsible for general aspects of
the promotion of productivity and it administers the Government grants to
the BPC, the BSI, and the Council of Industrial Design.
A number of other departments have responsibilities which bear on pro¬
ductivity. The Ministry of Labour has an Industrial Relations Service, which
advises firms on personnel management and industrial relations. The Depart¬
ment of Scientific and Industrial Research is also concerned directly with
research into such factors as productivity measurement techniques, production
engineering and fatigue among operators; and it provides technical advisory
services. The Ministry of Education and the Scottish Education Department
are responsible for the technical colleges, at which courses are available in
such subjects as work study and industrial engineering. The Ministry of
Public Building and Works provides a Technical Information Service for
the building industry; and the Ministry of Power and the British Productivity
Council sponsor the National Industrial Fuel Efficiency Service. The Ministry
of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food provides a number of advisory services
which aim at encouraging the efficiency of the farming industry in England
INDUSTRY 275
and Wales; similar services are provided by the three Scottish agricultural
colleges.
Management During the present century and particularly during and since the second
world war, the increasing pace of technical, organisational and social change
has made the successful conduct of enterprises dependent on knowledge of,
and practice in, a complex of managerial techniques for dealing with technical
and human problems. In Britain, as elsewhere, there is a growing awareness
of the importance of management as a subject requiring special skills and
knowledge. This has been reflected both in a change in the general educational
qualifications of recruits to management and in the spread of systematic
education and training for management.
The British Institute of Management (BIM) was founded in 1947, with
Government support, to study and promote improved standards of management
throughout industry, commerce, and public administration. It is now entirely
financed from industrial and professional subscriptions. The main objects
of the BIM, which combined in 1957 with the Institute of Industrial Admin¬
istration, are to provide information on, and undertake research into,
management practices and techniques, and to encourage the development of
education and training for management on a national scale.
Management studies and education for management are expanding rapidly
in Britain and have become a recognised feature of higher education and
postgraduate work, mainly, as yet, as part-time day or evening studies. At the
university level (twelve universities at present offer courses in management)
the studies are principally for postgraduates and practising managers, and
include full one-year courses as well as teacher training and research into
methods of widening understanding of management problems.
By far the largest volume of work is carried on at Colleges of Advanced
Technology and technical colleges. The highest award is the Diploma of
Management Studies, instituted in 1961, for which nearly 2,500 people are
studying. Below this level there are a variety of courses concerned with
business schemes. The national schemes are administered by the BIM in
co-operation with the Ministry of Education and the Scottish and Northern
Ireland Education Departments.
Training courses for higher management are held at a few universities,
notably Bristol; by some firms of management consultants; and at the
Administrative Staff College at Henley-on-Thames (normally of somewhat
longer duration) and Ashridge, Berkhamsted. The larger firms, especially
those with wide-ranging responsibilities, often provide general management
courses for the training of senior executives, and systems of informal training
within an organisation are numerous. There are also various bodies concerned
with specialised branches of management, for example, the Institute of
Personnel Management, the Institution of Works Managers and, on the
sales side, the Institute of Marketing and Sales Management.
The growing number of professional personnel working as management
consultants—probably about 2,000 in 1963—and the use of the services of
independent management selection firms in the appointment of senior staff
are indications of the interest in the science of management in Britain.
Monopolies and Competition in trade and industry is sometimes restricted either by agree-
Restrictive ments (formal or informal) between suppliers, or by monopolies which dominate
Practices the market; legislation in force in the United Kingdom for dealing with
these problems is described below.
276
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
The Restrictive Trade Practices Act, 1956, provides for the registration
and judicial examination of restrictive agreements. It requires the entry in a
public register of the particulars of a wide range of restrictive agreements
(including those relating to common prices, approved lists of dealers and the
limitation of production) which affect the supply or processing of goods for
the United Kingdom market. The Registrar of Restrictive Trading Agree¬
ments is responsible for keeping the register and for bringing the agreements
before the Restrictive Practices Court set up under the Act. The Court, which
includes laymen but is presided over by one of Her Majesty’s judges, is, in
effect, responsible for deciding whether or not an agreement is in the public
interest. If the parties to an agreement fail to satisfy the Court that any
restriction in their agreement produces one or more of seven beneficial
effects set out in the Act, and that the restriction is not unreasonable, having
regard to the balance between the benefit it confers and any public detriment
likely to result from its operation, that restriction must be found contrary to
the public interest. Agreements are void in respect of restrictions so found.
The Court can make orders preventing the parties from operating their
agreement, or from making new arrangements having the same effect. Agree¬
ments relating exclusively to exports are not subject to this procedure but
have to be notified to the Board of Trade.
One form of restrictive practice, the collective enforcement of resale price
maintenance by the use of stoplists or boycotts, was prohibited outright by
the 1956 Act. On the other hand, the Act strengthened the powers of individual
suppliers to enforce their resale prices through the civil courts.
Monopolies and kindred arrangements (except those within the scope of
the Restrictive Practices Court) in the circumstances indicated in the Mono¬
polies and Restrictive Practices (Inquiry and Control) Act, 1948, may be
referred by the Board of Trade to the Monopolies Commission for investigation
and report. Production departments take appropriate action on the basis of
these reports but no order can be made without the approval of Parliament.
Prior to the passing of the 1956 Act the Commission had investigated a number
of industries, several of which modified their practices in accordance with
its recommendations. The 1956 Act excluded from the scope of the Com¬
mission’s work agreements which had to be registered under the new legislation.
It is now mainly concerned with the investigation of monopolies. Since 1948
the Commission has presented some 24 reports.
The Board of Trade is carrying out a review of the legislation on monopolies
and restrictive practices.
FUEL AND POWER
The main primary sources of energy currently used in Britain are coal,
petroleum and, to a small extent, water power, nuclear energy and colliery
methane; secondary sources produced from these are electricity, gas and coke.
Coal, mined within the country, supplies nearly three-quarters of primary
energy and it will remain the principal source for many years to come. For
supplies of crude petroleum Britain is virtually dependent on imports. Water
power resources are small. A large-scale programme is in hand for the con¬
struction of nuclear power stations.
The pattern of primary energy consumption has changed appreciably in
recent years, as shown in Table 15. While consumption of coal has tended
to fall, that of oil has risen considerably—from 15 per cent of total inland
energy consumption in 1957 to nearly 29 per cent in 1962. Of the primary

fuels consumed, more than half the coal and one-sixth of the oil are converted
into secondary fuels.
The fuel and power industries, with the exception of petroleum, are under
public ownership. General responsibility for ensuring the effective and co¬
ordinated development of fuel and power resources lies with the Minister
of Power. Fuel research is undertaken by the fuel and fuel-using
industries. The Minister of Power has an Advisory Council on Research and
Development.
In general, fuel and power industries require heavy capital investment in
long-term projects and both internal resources and borrowing are used to
raise the large sums needed. Until 1956 long-term borrowing by the cor¬
porations was mainly through the issue of stock, except in the case of the
coal industry, which borrowed direct from the Exchequer. Under the
Finance Act, 1956, all the corporations were given power to raise money by
means of Exchequer advances from the responsible minister with the approval
of the Treasury. These powers were extended and amended by the Finance
Act, 1958, and by other Acts. Since 1956 all the corporations have obtained
their long-term capital by loans from the Exchequer and issues of stock have
been suspended.
Investment by the nationalised fuel and power industries in 1963-64 is
expected to amount to £672-5 million,1 excluding the initial costs of nuclear
fuel. In 1962 it accounted for over one-quarter of public investment and
over one-ninth of all fixed investment.

The responsible ministers—the Minister of Power in England and Wales
and the Secretary of State in Scotland—are required by statute to set up
consultative councils to ensure the protection of the interests of consumers
of fuel. Councils were established for coal in 1947, for electricity in 1948 and
for gas in 1949. The councils each consist of a chairman and from 20 to 30
unpaid members. These are appointed by the minister from nominations
put forward by interested bodies selected by the minister as representing
consumers. In the electricity and gas supply industries councils and com¬
mittees have been formed on an area and district basis; for coal there are
councils at national level only.
Coal has been worked in Britain for over 700 years and an organised coal¬
mining industry has been in existence for over 300 years, some 200 years
longer than in any other European country. British coal exports dominated
the world market until about 1910. By 1913—the peak production year—the

industry was producing 287 million tons of coal, exporting 94 million tons
and employing over a million workers.
The very fact that the British industry was developed so early has meant
that many of the best seams of coal are now worked out; every year coal has
to be mined from deeper and thinner seams and productivity can be main¬
tained only by a high level of investment.
Attempts to secure economies through amalgamation date from the Sankey
Commission of 1919. In 1930 a Coal Mines Act established commissioners to
bring about the formation of larger and more efficient units. The Coal Act of
1938 transferred ownership of royalties from mineral coal to the State. During
the second world war the industry was under Government control.
The Coal Industry Nationalisation Act, 1946, brought the industry under
public ownership; by this Act, all its assets—coal mines, mineral rights and
ancillary undertakings—were vested on 1st January, 1947, in the National
Coal Board (NCB), which became responsible for the industry’s management,
compensation being paid to the former owners. Under the Coal Industry
Act, 1949, the board, which is appointed by the Minister of Power and is
responsible through him to Parliament, consists of a chairman and not fewer
than eight or more than 11 other members.
The National Coal Board has the exclusive monopoly to mine coal in
Great Britain, though it may license privately owned undertakings to work small
mines not employing more than 30 underground workers, and also to work
open-cast sites where the total output is not expected to exceed 25,000 tons.
The NCB is responsible for its own regional organisation. The main collieries,
numbering about 616, are grouped into 43 areas which are the basic units
for commercial management; their size varies according to geological, geo¬
graphical and other technical considerations. The areas are grouped into nine
divisions which roughly correspond to the main coal-bearing regions. A
divisional board for each division supervises and co-ordinates the work of
the areas (except in the small south-eastern division, which is administered by
a general manager), formulates divisional policy, and is answerable to the
NCB, which is responsible for questions of national policy, finance and the
co-ordinating of major schemes of development. The day-to-day work of
running the collieries is under the direction of colliery managers. The NCB,
however, has no monopoly of sales or distribution. It makes some direct sales
to large consumers and also retail sales in a few areas. Most retail distribution
is in the hands of private firms.
The NCB has made surpluses in some years and deficits in others. In
certain areas, such as Scotland, Lancashire and South Wales, deficits have
been persistent, and profits from areas of high productivity, for instance the
East Midlands, have not been sufficient to cover the losses. The Board made
a surplus of £1 million in 1962, although the cumulative deficit at the end of
the year amounted to £91 million. The Board’s aim is to break even, after
paying interest and making provision for depreciation, in the five years
from 1963.
It has been estimated that Britain’s workable reserves of coal will last for
about 400 to 500 years at current rates of consumption. But certain types
such as high-quality coking coal will be exhausted long before then unless
they are eked out by blending with other types of coal.
The main coal-bearing areas are: (1) the Yorkshire, Derbyshire and
Nottinghamshire field, which produces about 45 per cent of the total output,

(2) the Durham and Northumberland field, (3) the South Wales field, and
(4) the Scottish field. Other important coal-bearing areas are those of Lanca¬
shire and the West Midlands (Staffordshire and Warwickshire). Prospecting
for coal continues both inland and off the north-east coast of England.

« Output per manshift for 1961 onwards for NCB deep-mined revenue working only.
Previous years’ rates are for all deep mines.
* Figures for 1961 onwards relate to NCB mines only; those for previous years included
all deep mines.
Future plans are directed towards bringing efficient new mines into
production, developing machines for power-loading the coal at the face on to
face-conveyor belts, and reorganising the haulage systems. The NCB is
engaged on a programme of major reconstruction and new sinkings.
The great progress made in mechanisation has been mainly responsible for
the increase in productivity of 25 per cent between 1957 and 1962. A record
output per manshift was achieved in December 1962, of 1-67 tons overall and
4-83 tons for face workers. Productivity was nearly 8 per cent higher than in
1961, resulting in nearly 8 million more tons of coal being produced by
20,000 fewer men. All but a small proportion of coal output is now mechanic¬
ally cut and conveyed. In 1962, 61-4 per cent was mechanically cleaned. For
the year as a whole 59-6 per cent, and in the month of February 1963,
65 per cent, was power-loaded; the eventual target is 100 per cent.
Coal consumption in Britain increased by an average annual rate of nearly
4 million tons between 1947 and 1956 and, to cover requirements in certain
years, supplies had to be imported from the United States. Inland sales fell
sharply between 1956 and 1959 and large stocks of coal accumulated at pit
heads; in 1960-61, by reducing output, these stocks were drawn upon but
production again exceeded consumption in 1962. Growing competition from
Capital

INDUSTRY 28l
oil, increasing efficiency in the use of coal and reduced requirements by the
iron and steel industry have largely contributed to the fall in demand for coal.
Over 30 per cent of total output is consumed by the electricity authorities
and a similar proportion by domestic and industrial users together. Coke ovens
and the gas industry are other large users. Consumption by the electricity
industry has increased by 31 per cent since 1958, whereas the requirements
of all the other main classes of consumer have declined. For domestic users
this fall has been slightly offset by increased purchases of solid smokeless fuels.
Coal exports have fallen heavily in relation to pre-war levels, due, at first,
partly to increased internal consumption and, more recently, to keener
competition in a diminishing market. In 1962 exports of coal, coke and
briquettes amounted to 4-8 million tons, valued at ^31-2 million, the principal
markets being France, Denmark, the Irish Republic, the Netherlands, Norway
and Sweden.
The National Coal Board raises capital by borrowing direct from the
Exchequer. There is a statutory limit of £750 million at present on such
borrowing and borrowing above £700 million must be authorised by Order
in Council. In addition, the board may, with the permission of the Minister
of Power, borrow temporarily, by way of overdraft or otherwise, up to
£20 million. The greater proportion of investment, however, is financed
from internal resources. Capital expenditure by the industry totalled £462
million from 194? to i955> and about ^54° million in the six years 1956 to
1961. A review of its plans by the board in 1959 led to a reduction in the rate
of investment from the peak levels of 1957-59. In J962 fixed investment
amounted to £90 million and it is expected to be about £83 million in 1963.
Present long-term plans provide for about three-quarters of coal output to
come from new and reconstructed collieries by 1965; many will have a daily
output of up to 6,000 tons while a few will be capable of up to 8,000 tons.
Horizon mining methods will be extended, layouts for pit-bottoms, new
designs for loading stations and mechanical handling methods will be intro¬
duced. Exploration of coal reserves is being intensified and the first boring
for coal under the sea has been completed in the Firth of Forth and is in
progress off the Durham coast.
The NCB has three research organisations: a Coal Research Establishment,
at Stoke Orchard, near Cheltenham, Gloucestershire, providing facilities for
fundamental research; a Mining Research Establishment, for the investigation
of underground problems, at Isleworth, Middlesex; and a Central Engineering
Establishment for developing new machines and testing equipment, near
Bretby, Derbyshire. In 1959 the Board set up a new department concerned
primarily with the further development of new processes for making smokeless
fuels.
A number of autonomous research associations receiving grants from the
NCB and DSIR include the British Coal Utilisation Research Association,
the British Coke Research Association and the Coal Tar Research Association.
Much of the work of other bodies, such as the Safety in Mines Research
Establishment (SMRE), is closely related to the Board’s problems; the
SMRE carries out research on explosions and fires, pneumoconiosis, engineer¬
ing and metallurgy. In 1947 the NCB took over, with other assets, the Coal
Survey, a national organisation for surveying coal resources within Britain,
and 70 laboratories (in the various coalfields), which it has since extended
and modernised.

BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
The petroleum industry in Britain dates back to 1850, when Dr. James Young,
a Glasgow chemist, succeeded in obtaining lamp oil and lubricants from
natural mineral oil occurring in the Derbyshire coal measures. The Scottish
shale deposits, yielding similar products, were first worked in 1858 and ceased
production in 1962.
Sources of crude oil within Britain meet only 1 ton in every 500 of total
United Kingdom requirements, the remainder being imported from overseas.
Annual production of crude oil from indigenous oilfields totals about
100,000 tons.
Prospecting for crude petroleum has so far led to the establishment of
several small oilfields, notably in Nottinghamshire (Eakring, Egmanton and
Bothamsell), in Leicestershire (Plungar), in Lincolnshire (Gainsborough), in
Lancashire (Formby) and in Dorset (Kimmeridge). Prospecting by seismic
methods in the North Sea started in 1962.
British and British-Dutch oil companies have been responsible for developing
the oil resources of many countries to mutual advantage, especially in the
Middle East, Far East and Caribbean areas.
Today these companies produce about one-third of all oil entering into
international trade, with a tanker fleet (partly owned by them and partly on
charter) amounting to nearly one-third of the world s tanker tonnage.
(United Kingdom registered tanker tonnage is nearly one-sixth of the
world’s total.)
In 1962 the United Kingdom imported 52-5 million tons of crude oil
valued at £373 million; nearly half came from Kuwait, the other largest
suppliers being Venezuela, Iraq and Iran in that order.
Deliveries of petroleum products for inland consumption, apart from a
slight drop in 1957, have been expanding rapidly and in 1962 reached over
47 million tons. An outstanding feature has been the continued rapid advance
in use of black oils. Fuel oil consumption rose from 6-9 million tons in 1957
to 21-3 million tons in 1962. The introduction of a duty on heavy oils in the
1961 Budget retarded the rate of growth slightly. Nevertheless the demand
for gas and diesel oils (excluding that used in road vehicles) rose to 4-6 million
tons in 1962. Sales of motor spirit in recent years have been rising by about
half a million tons a year and reached 8-6 million tons in 1962.
A more detailed analysis of deliveries of gas and diesel oils for 1962 shows
that their most important uses were for non-industrial central heating, agri¬
cultural tractors and the railways. Electricity generation accounted for about
28 per cent of total fuel oil consumption, excluding that used in oil refineries;
steel used 14 per cent and non-industrial central heating a further 10 per cent.
Among the remainder the largest users were the cement, paper-making,
general chemical and fishing industries. Use of most other products increased
in 1962 but the use of aviation spirit, low grade gasoline and certain minor
products decreased.
Before 1939 three-quarters of the United Kingdom’s supply of petroleum
products was refined overseas, as it was considered more economical to refine
at the source of production. Since the second world war, however, the
industry has come to favour the siting of refineries in the consuming areas.
By the end of 1962 rated refinery capacity in the United Kingdom amounted
officially to nearly 52 million tons a year, but in practice the refineries handled

nearly half a million tons more than the rated capacity. Of the 16 refineries in
operation, six have a capacity of under 0-2 million tons. The largest, all of
which have been considerably extended, are situated at Fawley, near South¬
ampton (12 million tons), Shellhaven (8 million tons), Isle of Grain (9-5
million tons), both on the Thames Estuary, Stanlow (5 million tons), in
Cheshire, which is to be considerably expanded, and Milford Haven, in
Pembrokeshire (4-8 million tons). A second refinery, of 4-6 million tons a
year capacity, is to be built at Milford Haven and others, at Belfast and on
Tees-side, are under construction.
Output of refined products (excluding refineries’ own consumption) rose
from 4 million tons in 1948 to the record total of 48 million tons in 1962.
There is a substantial external trade in refined products which tends to follow
trading and seasonal requirements and the commercial arrangements of the
oil companies. United Kingdom exports, mainly in the form of heavier
products to European countries, were valued at £114 million in 1962;
imports of refined products amounted to ^160 million.
Three major oil pipelines are at present in operation in Britain. Two of these—
one in Scotland (from Finnart on Loch Long to Grangemouth) and one in
South Wales (from Angle Bay, Milford Haven, to Llandarcy)—carry crude
oil from harbours capable of berthing very large tankers to refineries; and one,
from Walton-on-Thames to London Airport, carries aviation fuel. The
major oil companies are planning pipelines to take refined products from
refineries to major marketing areas, where the volume transported is sufficient
to justify the capital cost. A pipeline has been constructed to carry refined
products between Stanlow, Cheshire, and Urmston, near Manchester;
another, 78 miles long, has been built to take petroleum feedstock from
Fawley refinery to the ^100 million petroleum chemicals project at Severn-
side, near Bristol; and another is to transport aviation fuels from Fawley to
London Airport. Plans are in hand for the construction of a system of pipe¬
lines linking the Midlands with refineries and installations on the Thames and
Mersey and with a connection to the pipeline being built by Esso from its
Fawley refinery. Meanwhile, parts of the system of pipelines laid during the
second world war are being used by the petroleum distributing companies.
In 1962 the Pipe-lines Act was passed to secure the orderly development
of privately owned industrial pipelines.
Research into problems of petroleum technology is carried out mainly by the
leading oil companies, which have also endowed research at the universities
on a substantial scale. Research centres are situated at Sunbury-on-Thames
(the British Petroleum Company), Thornton, in Cheshire, and Woodstock,
in Kent (Shell), and Abingdon, in Berkshire (Esso). Research covers the
evolution of new and improved lubricants and the development of new uses
for oil and of new products based on oil, especially chemicals.
A public supply of electricity was first provided in 1881, at Godaiming,
Surrey, though there were earlier demonstrations of its use to consumers,
such as the lighting of the Thames Embankment by the former Metropolitan
Board of Works. From its earliest days a measure of public control has been
a feature of the industry, and the Electric Lighting Act, 1882, authorised the
Board of Trade to grant licences for the establishment of electricity under¬
takings by local authorities or by companies (which the local authorities
might compulsorily purchase after a given period of time) to supply consumers

in given areas. By the turn of the century, technical developments, including
the introduction of the electric motor as a source of motive power, had led
to a large increase in the scale of distribution of electricity, and a variety of
independent supply systems had grown up all over the country.
After the first world war steps were taken to reorganise the industry on a
national scale. In 1919 the Electricity Commissioners were set up as a
supervisory body and to promote reorganisation through voluntary agreement.
Then, in 1926, the Central Electricity Board was established to co-ordinate
more efficiently the generation of electricity.
Organisation Under the Electricity Act of 1947, a central authority, then known as the
under Public British Electricity Authority, and 14 Area Electricity Boards took over in
Ownership April 1948 the assets of former municipal and private electricity supply
undertakings throughout Great Britain, except in the area already served by
the North of Scotland Hydro-Electric Board (see p. 285). Under the Electricity
Reorganisation (Scotland) Act of I954> authority s functions in Scotland
were taken over in April 1955 South of Scotland Electricity Board
(see p. 285). The name of the authority was changed from British Electricity
Authority to Central Electricity Authority and the number of area boards was
reduced to 12.
On 1st January, 1958, under the Electricity Act, i957> Ceutral
Electricity Authority was dissolved and replaced by two new bodies, the
Electricity Council and the Central Electricity Generating Board.
The present organisation of the electricity supply industry, in which more
than 220,000 people are employed, is described below.
England and Wales The Electricity Council, the central body of the industry, is composed of a
chairman, two deputy chairmen, not more than three other persons, and the
chairman and two other members of the Central Electricity Generating
Board, and the 12 chairmen of the Area Electricity Boards. The main
functions of the council are to advise the Minister of Power on matters
relating to the electricity supply industry. The council is responsible for a
number of common services, including capital financing and research.
The Central Electricity Generating Board consists of a chairman and not
fewer than seven, nor more than nine, other members. The board’s primary
functions are to generate or acquire supplies of electricity and to provide
bulk supplies to the area boards.
The Area Boards (of which there are at present 12) are responsible for
the distribution and sale of electricity. Each consists of a full-time chairman
and deputy chairman and five to seven members (mostly part-time).
Area Consultative Councils were set up under the Electricity Act, i947>
the area of each board to represent the interests of consumers; their chairmen
are ex officio members of their respective Area Boards.
The Minister of Power in England and Wales appoints the chairmen,
deputy chairmen and members of the Electricity Council, the Central
Electricity Generating Board and the Area Boards; approves each Area
Board’s capital development programmes and the industry’s research pro¬
gramme; and approves, in consultation with the Treasury, the boards
borrowing requirements.
The Central Electricity Authority (and its successors the Electricity Council
and the Central Electricity Generating Board) together with the Area Boards,
have made a consolidated net surplus on their operations in each of the years
since they were established. Up to and including the financial year 1962—63,
INDUSTRY

these surpluses amounted in the aggregate to over £196 million. Under the
1957 Act, each electricity board, not merely the industry as a whole, must
pay its way, taking one year with another.
The North of Scotland Hydro-Electric Board (NSHEB) was set up in 1943
as a public corporation to develop the water-power resources of the Highlands
and Islands and to distribute electricity in the more sparsely populated parts
of Scotland not covered by existing undertakings. The Board consists of a
chairman, and not less than four nor more than eight other members, of
whom one or more may be appointed deputy chairman. The Board is solely
responsible for all generation and distribution in the area, which covers that
part of Scotland north and west of a line running roughly from Dumbarton
on the Firth of Clyde to Newburgh on the Firth of Tay.
On 1 st April, i955> the South of Scotland Electricity Board, answerable to
the Secretary of State for Scotland, took over the then British Electricity
Authority’s functions in Scotland, and also the functions of the two area
boards in the south of Scotland, which were dissolved. The Board consists
of a chairman, and not less than four nor more than eight other members,
of whom one or more may be deputy chairmen.
A consultative council to represent the interests of consumers has been
appointed for the district of each board by the Secretary of State. The Secre¬
tary of State appoints the chairmen, deputy chairmen and members of the
Scottish Electricity Boards; approves their capital development and research
programmes; and, in consultation with the Treasury, their borrowing require¬
ments.
In Northern Ireland electricity is generated at power stations in Belfast and
Londonderry and at Ballylumford and Coolkeeragh. Those in Belfast and
Londonderry are owned and operated by the city corporations and the
remainder by the Electricity Board for Northern Ireland. Generation at these
stations is co-ordinated by the Northern Ireland Joint Electricity Committee,
set up by statute in 1948, which purchases their output and resells it to
distributors—the Belfast Corporation, for Belfast and district, the London¬
derry Corporation for the City of Londonderry, and the Electricity Board
for the rest of Northern Ireland.
Most of Britain’s electricity is produced in coal-fired steam generating
stations. The country has abundant supplies of coal, together with good rail
and water transport for moving it, while water-power resources are relatively
small and in remote areas. The development of hydro-electricity on any scale
is comparatively recent.
The installed generating capacity of the electricity authorities (including
the North of Scotland Hydro-Electric Board) in Great Britain at the end of
1962 totalled 37,207 megawatts (MW), an increase of about 50 per cent
since 1956. In recent years about 2,000 MW of new plant has been com¬
missioned each year but in the period up to 1966 this will be increased to
over 3,000 MW a year.
Sales of electricity in Northern Ireland (where of the total installed
generating capacity of 738 MW, 120 MW is in oil-fired and the remainder in
coal-fired thermal stations) amounted to 1,734 million kilowatt-hours in 1962.
In 1962 over 138,000 million kilowatt-hours, or 98 per cent of the public
supply in Great Britain, was generated at conventional thermal stations, and
almost all the remainder from water-power. The high rate of expansion of
output, which has been a feature of the industry since its earliest years, has
286
Conventional
Thermal

been maintained since the war. Total production in 1962 had increased by
over 60 per cent since 1956, while during the winter of 1962-63 peak demand
reached 3,900 million units a week, compared with 3,290 million units in
the first week of 1962.
An analysis of electricity generation in Great Britain is given in Table 17.
In the mid-1950s, when a coal shortage seemed likely, programmes for oil¬
firing at conventional thermal stations and for generating from nuclear energy
were introduced. There are thirteen oil-burning power stations, or parts of
stations, operating in Great Britain. They are mainly situated on river
estuaries and thus able to be fed conveniently from oil refineries.
The electricity authorities are the largest consumers of primary fuel in
Britain, and although most of their electricity generation is based on coal,
oil consumption rose from a negligible quantity in 1955 over 5i milfi°n tons
in 1962. Average thermal efficiency of conventional steam stations in England
and Wales (i.e. the ratio of power output to the fuel consumed) rose from
20-75 per cent in 1947 to 27-55 Per cent x9^2 as new P^ant was brought
into use. The twenty most efficient stations, containing much of the newest
plant, had an average efficiency of 32-63 per cent in that year.
The largest generating sets in operation are the 550 MW set at Thorpe
Marsh, near Doncaster, which came into operation in 1963, and a set of
275 MW capacity at Blyth ‘B’ station in Northumberland. These large
machines will show substantial economies in capital cost, in fuel consumption
and in operational costs. Station capacities are also increasing: the largest
stations under construction are the West Burton station, near Gainsborough,
Lincolnshire, due for completion in 1967, and one at Fawley, Hampshire,
due for completion in 1969, both of which will have an installed capacity of
2,000 MW; and two further stations of similar size to be built in Yorkshire,
namely Ferrybridge ‘C’ and Eggborough. A station at Cockenzie, in Scotland,
will have four 300 MW generating sets. In addition, application has been
made to the Minister of Power for consent to build three further stations
of 2,000 MW.

Hydro-Electric The setting up of the North of Scotland Hydro-Electric Board in 1943
marked the beginning of an era of intensive water-power development in the
Highlands of Scotland. A development scheme drawn up by the board in 1944,
showing the water-power resources which it proposed to examine, listed 102
hydro-electric projects with an estimated annual output of 6,274 million
units of electricity. In 1962, 2,625 million units were generated by the
North of Scotland Board from water-power, compared with 322 million in

1949. At the end of 1962 there were 50 main hydro-electric stations in operation
in the north of Scotland with a total installed capacity of 958 MW and the
largest—the Loch Sloy station—had a capacity of 130 MW; further hydro¬
electric schemes with a total installed capacity of 489 MW were under con¬
struction, including 400 MW of pumped storage in the Loch Awe scheme,
and a further 641 MW were under consideration. The board also had 177 MW
of coal and diesel-fired capacity. In addition, there are stations generating
electricity by water-power in the south of Scotland (123 MW) and in Wales
(428 MW, including the 320 MW of pumped storage at Ffestiniog).
As an extension of its experimental work and to produce plutonium, the
Atomic Energy Authority (AEA) has two stations also producing electricity,
of which the output capacity has been raised to over 200 MW each—Calder
Hall, Cumberland, began operating in May 1956 and Chapelcross, Dumfries¬
shire, in February 1959. These two nuclear power stations are supplying
2,700 million units of electricity annually for the national grid.
The main commercial stations under the Government’s nuclear power
programme are being built for the electricity authorities by groups of engineer¬
ing firms specially organised for the construction of nuclear power plants.
Special factors have to be taken into account in the siting of the nuclear
power stations, notably the need for firm rock foundations to bear the weight
of the reactors and their supporting structure, a location distant from heavily
built-up areas, and plentiful supplies of water for cooling. Great care is
taken to preserve amenity and landscape beauty.
Two commercial stations are in operation, seven more are under con¬
struction and ministerial consent for a tenth has been obtained. The stations
at Bradwell (300 MW output capacity), in Essex, and at Berkeley (275 MW),
in Gloucestershire, begun in January 1957, came into full operation in the
summer of 1962. Hinkley Point (500 MW), in Somerset, is to be commissioned
in 1963, while Hunterston (300 MW), in Ayrshire, Trawsfynydd (500 MW),
in North Wales, and Dungeness (550 MW), in Kent, are expected to be in
operation in 1964. Others are under construction at Sizewell (580 MW),
in Suffolk, Oldbury (560 MW), in Gloucestershire, and Wylfa (1,000 MW), in
Anglesey. Approval has been given for a second station (of 1,000 MW) at
Hinkley Point. The Wylfa station is at present the most powerful nuclear
power station under construction in the world.
The present British nuclear power programme provides for a total output
capacity of about 5,000 MW by 1968. By the mid-1970s the latest stations
should be generating on base load1 at least as cheaply as the best coal-fired
stations.
To provide a type of energy storage to even out the variation of demand, the
Generating Board has built a pumped storage scheme which is now in full
operation, and others are contemplated.
In these schemes, electricity generated in off-peak periods is used to pump
water to higher levels from which it descends at peak periods to operate
turbo-generators. The CEGB’s 320 MW pumped storage station at Blaenau
Ffestiniog, near Trawsfynydd, in North Wales started operating in 1961
and was completed in 1963; suitable sites for other schemes are being investi¬
gated. The first large-scale pumped storage works in Scotland, comprising
a 400 MW combined pumping and generating plant, forms part of the
Loch Awe project and is expected to come into operation in 1965.
1 Base load stations are those which operate most cheaply and efficiently and are kept
in service at the lower load periods.

Main electricity transmission lines—the National Grid—supply most of the
country. By March 1962 those of the Central Electricity Generating Board
totalled some 7,894 route miles (13,271 circuit miles), of which 1,687 miles
were operated at 275,000 volts, 5,878 miles were operated at 132,000 volts and
the remainder at 66,000 volts and below. In Scotland there were 3,100 circuit
miles of main transmission lines at the end of 1962, of which 289 circuit miles
operated at 275,000 volts and the remainder at 132,000 volts. Energy move¬
ments on the grid in England and Wales are controlled through the seven
operational areas, set up for that purpose and distinct from the divisions
in which the generating side of the industry is organised; each area has a
separate control, and the operations are co-ordinated by a National Control
in London. The grid in Scotland is operated from the control centres
at Tummel Bridge (North of Scotland) and at Kirkintilloch (South of
Scotland).
Most of the new ‘supergrid’ of main transmission lines now operating at
275,000 volts is to be up-rated to operate at 400,000 volts, starting in 1966.
This is being done to reduce the number of transmission lines needed to meet
the country’s increasing power demands. The development of the grid system
has made the British system the most closely integrated power network in the
world. A link interchange of energy by direct current by means of twin cross-
Channel cables laid between Dungeness and Boulogne, costing £4^ million,
and capable of transmitting up to 160 MW at 200,000 volts (direct current)
came into operation in 1961 and is able to take advantage of the differences
between France and Britain in the timing of peak loads.
In England and Wales the Area Electricity Boards distribute to consumers
electricity acquired mainly from the Central Electricity Generating Board,
but in part from other sources, such as collieries and the nuclear power
stations of the AEA. There are i6-|- million consumers, an increase of about
7 million on those supplied in December 1939. Industrial concerns are the
biggest users of electricity and their demands are increasing rapidly, as are
those of domestic consumers; the principal domestic uses of electricity are for
lighting, cooking, and for space and water heating, but the demand for
numerous other domestic purposes is rising steadily.
The North of Scotland Hydro-Electric Board has also pressed ahead with
the distribution of electricity to consumers in the north of Scotland. At the
end of 1962 it had over 400,000 consumers of electricity, many of them in
remote areas, and over four-fifths of the farms and crofts had a supply of
electricity. At the same date the South of Scotland Electricity Board sup¬
plied 1-4 million consumers, including about 96 per cent of the farmers
in the area.
Nearly 8 per cent of the annual gross fixed capital formation of the United
Kingdom in 1962 was attributable to the electricity supply industry. Although
the industry has based its capital needs for five years ahead on an increase
in consumption averaging about 7 8 Per cent a year, it is now planning on
an annual average growth of more than 9 per cent.
Capital expenditure of the electricity supply industry has been expanding
very rapidly. It totalled £262 million in 195^ an^ risen to ^4I3 million
in 1962. About two-fifths of the industry’s capital requirements have been
financed from internal resources and the proportion is tending to increase.
The aggregate outstanding borrowing of the industry in Great Britain is
limited to £2,715 million. The industry (other than the NSHEB) is required
to aim at a gross return of 12^ per cent on its net assets.

The Electricity Council, in consultation with the Minister of Power, is
responsible for drawing up a general programme of research, comprising:
direct research carried out by the Electricity Boards themselves; sponsored
research undertaken for the supply industry by universities and colleges;
and co-operative research with other organisations, in particular the industrial
research associations, such as the British Electrical and Allied Industries
Research Association, to which the supply industries subscribe. The council
itself is empowered to conduct research. It is advised by the Electricity
Supply Research Council.
The main research establishments of the industry are the Central Electricity
Research Laboratories at Leatherhead, Surrey, the Berkeley laboratories,
which are concerned with nuclear problems, and engineering laboratories at
Marchwood on Southampton Water.
The Atomic Energy Authority’s research into improved types of nuclear
power reactors includes work on fast breeder reactors at Dounreay, Caithness;
on advanced gas-cooled reactors at Windscale, Cumberland; and on high-
temperature gas-cooled reactors at Winfrith, Dorset.
Both Scottish electricity boards are empowered to carry out research and
experimental work either on their own or in co-operation with other electricity
authorities. The North of Scotland Hydro-Electric Board undertakes a wide
range of research and development work, both independently and in con¬
junction with the British Electrical and Allied Industries Research Associa¬
tion, colleges of science and technology, universities and manufacturers.
The South of Scotland Electricity Board has recently extended its own
research activities and is associated fully with those of the Electricity Council
and Central Electricity Generating Board in England.
Public supply of gas in Britain dates from 1807, when Pall Mall, London,
was first lighted with gas. In 1812 the London and Westminster Gas Light
and Coke Company received a Royal Charter to supply gaslight in London.
In the early years of the industry gas was used almost exclusively for lighting
and was provided by a growing number of company and municipal under¬
takings. After the invention of the Bunsen burner in 1855 §as was used
increasingly as a source of heat for many purposes, such as domestic cooking
and space and water heating, in addition to a number of industrial uses. In
the last 20 years of the nineteenth century, however, gas for lighting purposes
was subjected to competition from the new electricity supply industry; but
the invention of the Welsbach incandescent mantle in 1887, which raised the
efficiency of gas lighting very considerably, enabled the industry to hold its
own, while the use of gas for purposes other than lighting increased.
The gas industry in its present form developed in the main during the
period between the two world wars when increasing competition from
electricity had to be met and when changes in social habits and outlook
were taking place. The industry undertook a large-scale programme of
modernisation of production and distribution and launched widespread sales
promotion campaigns, especially for the numerous uses of gas in the home.
By 1939 the industry had become mainly a supplier of heating instead of
lighting.
The Gas Act of 1948 brought the industry in Great Britain, in which about
125,000 persons are at present employed, under public ownership and control
on 1st May, 1949. The assets of 991 undertakings, of which 269 belonged to
local authorities, were vested in 12 Area Gas Boards. The central body is
290

the Gas Council, appointed by the Minister of Power. It is a co-ordinating
council, not a trading body, consisting of a full-time chairman and deputy
chairman and the 12 chairmen of the area boards. Its general duties are to
advise the Minister on questions affecting the industry and promote the
efficient performance of their duties by the area boards. It has also specific
duties relating to finance, labour relations and research.
The Area Gas Boards, which have a large measure of financial and opera¬
tional responsibility and are similar in most respects to the central bodies
of the other publicly owned corporations, are responsible for manufacturing
gas and distributing it to consumers. Each of the Area Gas Boards, appointed
by the Minister of Power, consists of a full-time chairman and deputy chair¬
man, in some cases one or more full-time members, and usually five or six
part-time members, including the chairman of the Area Consultative Council.
There is no common pattern of organisation; each board is fully independent
and has devised its own subordinate structure. Each is required to pay its
way, taking one year with another. The operations of the area boards have
resulted, in the 13 years up to 31st March, 1962, in an aggregate disposable
surplus of approximately ^28 million, before taxation.
When the industry came under public ownership, a link between it and
the consuming public was established by the creation of a Consultative
Council in each board area. These councils consist of not fewer than 20 and
not more than 30 members, of whom between 50 and 75 Per cen^ are chosen
from panels of persons nominated by the local authority associations.
In Northern Ireland the gas supply industry remains in the hands of a
number of municipal undertakings and statutory and non-statutory companies.
In 1962, in Great Britain, 22 million tons of coal were carbonised by gas
undertakings and 23-5 million tons by coke ovens operated outside the gas
industry. Nearly one-third of the output of gas from coke ovens is sold to
gas undertakings for general distribution; the remainder is mainly consumed
at the ovens or at steelworks. There are about 13 million consumers, the
total having shown no significant change since 195 5- ^as rnanufactured and
acquired from coke ovens and other sources for distribution exceeds 600,000
million cubic feet.
In 1962 the quantity of gas produced in Northern Ireland was about
7,000 million cubic feet, most of it for household use.
Half of all gas is sold by gas boards for household use and the remainder for
industrial and commercial purposes. Total consumption, about 2,680 million
therms annually, has been rising at an average rate of about 3 per cent
per annum since i960; during the very cold winter of 1962—63 the rate was
even higher.
About 70 per cent of the domestic load is used for cooking, the remaining
30 per cent being spread over space heating, water heating and other instal¬
lations. Most homes in Britain are now supplied with gas, except in some
rural areas where, owing to difficulties in storage and transmission, gas is
not economic. Bottled gas, derived from petroleum, is widely used in rural
areas.
Gas is used extensively in industries which require the control of temperatures
to a fine degree of accuracy, for example, in the pottery industry and in
certain processes in the manufacture of iron and steel products. In 1962 sales
of gas to industry totalled 857 million therms.

Production of coke at gas works in 1962 was 9-7 million tons, and at coke
ovens 15-5 million tons. The gas industry and coke ovens jointly produce
about 3 million tons of crude coal tar and over 100 million gallons of crude
benzole a year. These latter by-products yield materials widely employed in
the newer branches of the chemical industry and also in other industries.
Under the Gas Act, 1948, borrowing by the Gas Council and the Area Gas
Boards was limited to £250 million. In 1954 the industry’s borrowing powers
were increased to £450 million, and in i960 to £500 million (or up to £525
million if authorised by Order in Council) in the period up to 31st March,
1966.
The industry in recent years has been spending about ^50 million a year
on capital investment. Between vesting day (1st May, 1949) and March 1963,
about £630 million had been invested in fixed assets. Expenditure of ^64
million is approved for 1963-64.
The post-war structure of the industry has already permitted considerable
integration by the linking of undertakings for the transmission of gas (through
gas grids and long-distance mains), enabling production to be concentrated
in the most efficient units.
In order to compete fully with other fuels, the gas industry is seeking ways
of reducing costs of production. Processes for gasifying coal of inferior
quality are being investigated. At Westfield, in Fife, Scotland, a gas plant
using the Lurgi process for gasifying low grade coal was completed in 1962
and produces 30 million cubic feet of gas a day, about one-fifth of the total
gas requirements of Scotland. The plant marks a change from conventional
carbonisation of coal to the use of chemical processes. Because the gas will be
made at high pressure, it will be possible to pipe it through a 133-mile
grid-main covering industrial Scotland. Further advantages of this method are
low costs and the production of by-products such as tar, ammonia and benzole.
A similar plant at Coleshill, near Birmingham, started operating in 1963.
Alternative sources of gas are being developed by the Gas Council. Many
oil gasification plants have been built, including one, adjacent to the refinery
at the Isle of Grain, constructed by the South Eastern Gas Board; this
converts some 70,000 tons of petroleum products a year and has a daily
output of 45 million cubic feet of gas. Gas manufactured directly from oil now
accounts for nearly 5 per cent of total supply, while purchases of rich gas
from oil refineries and of liquefied petroleum gases account for more than
7 per cent. Small quantities of methane are purchased from mines or in the
form of sewage gas and in two areas small quantities of natural gas have
provided supplies.
As a result of successful trial shipments of liquid natural gas in 1958 and
1959, the Gas Council in 1961 signed a 15-year contract for the purchase of
natural gas from the Sahara in specially constructed refrigerated tankers.
Deliveries are to start in 1964 and will rise to about 35,000 million cubic feet
of gas annually, equivalent to some 10 per cent of total consumption. A
pipeline system is under construction to distribute the gas from the Canvey
Island, Essex, terminal to the eight Area Boards that are to receive supplies
of liquefied gas.
The Gas Council has a research committee which advises on the initiation
and implementation of research policy. Research organisations comprise three
stations (two in London and one at Solihull) and a ‘basic’ research group,

testing and development of appliances. Research is also carried out on behalf
of the Gas Council at Leeds University and at other universities and
colleges.
Efficiency in the use of fuel, among both industrial and domestic users, has
been assisted by various bodies representing producers and consumers and
by the technical advisory services of the fuel and power industries.
The Coal Utilisation Council consists of representatives of the National
Coal Board, solid fuel distributors and appliance manufacturers and dis¬
tributors. Originally formed in 1932, it informs and advises domestic users
on the best use of solid fuel, including the choice of installation and the
operation of solid fuel appliances.
A non-profit-making company, the National Industrial Fuel Efficiency
Service, was formed in 1954 by the fuel and power industries to promote
fuel saving in industry. It provides advice and services to all non-domestic
fuel users in a variety of forms, from ‘spot’ inspection to full-scale heat and
power surveys and regular visits on a contract basis.
WATER SUPPLY
Britain’s water resources are, in general, sufficient for domestic and industrial
requirements. The sources of water are often distant from the areas where
supplies are needed, however, and water undertakings are therefore mainly
concerned with abstraction, storage, treatment and distribution. Supplies
are obtained partly from surface sources such as mountain lakes, streams
impounded in upland gathering grounds and river intakes, and partly from
underground sources by means of wells, adits and boreholes. Unlike other
public services in Great Britain, such as electricity and gas, water supply
remains in the hands of a large number of undertakings of different kinds.
Ministerial responsibility for national water policy rests with the Minister
of Housing and Local Government in England and Wales, with the Secretary
of State for Scotland in Scotland and with the Minister of Health and Local
Government in Northern Ireland.
It was not until the nineteenth century that the provision of water supplies
became a general public service and then only after long and bitter con¬
troversy. It was largely due to the efforts of Edwin Chadwick and his
colleagues, who demonstrated the dangers arising from inadequate water
supply and sanitation, that the Public Health Act, 1848, became law in
England and Wales and laid the basis for a long series of statutes dealing
with public health.
From the middle of the nineteenth century onwards a number of water
undertakings were set up to provide water to the expanding urban population,
and the water supply system developed rapidly, although in piecemeal fashion
and with some overlapping and waste.
Local authorities have a duty as sanitary authorities to ensure that water
supplies are adequate for the needs of their areas, and they may do this
either by operating water undertakings themselves or by ensuring that other
bodies are providing adequate supplies. The householder receives his
domestic water supply at a comparatively small charge, varying in different
areas, which he usually pays by way of a water rate levied, like other rates,

on the value of his house. Industrial users are charged according to con¬
sumption as recorded by meter.
Under the Water Act, 1945, the Minister of Housing and Local Government
has a duty to promote the conservation and proper use of water supplies in
England and Wales. A statutory Central Advisory Water Committee advises
the Minister on general questions relating to water and organisation of
supplies. Since the passing of the Act, some 698 smaller water authorities
in England and Wales have been absorbed by larger authorities or by the
creation of joint boards in order to improve the efficiency of the water supply
industry. In March 1963 there were in England and Wales 344 local authority
water undertakings, 100 joint water boards (including bulk supply boards)
and 6 joint water committees, 57 statutory water companies, 10 non-statutory
water companies, and 2 private proprietors with statutory powers. A con¬
siderable number of private proprietors without statutory powers also
provide small supplies.
The Metropolitan Water Board, which is probably the largest single water
undertaking in the world, supplies about 360 million gallons daily to about
million people in the London area. It consists of 88 part-time members
who are the elected representatives of the various local authorities within the
board’s area of operations, together with one representative each from the
Thames and Lee Conservancies. Under the plans for the reorganisation of
local government in London (see p. 80), the functions of the board are to be
transferred to the Greater London Council.
Today, piped water reaches over 95 per cent of the total population of England
and Wales and about 90 per cent of the rural population.
Capital expenditure by water undertakers amounts to between £40 million
and £50 million a year. Interest, together with running costs, is largely met
from annual income.
The provision of piped supplies for rural districts has been assisted by
grants under the Rural Water Supplies Act, 1934, and under the Rural
Water Supplies and Sewerage Acts, 1944 to 1961. By March 1963 schemes
costing £101 million had been completed or were in progress with the aid
of grants under these Acts.
The steady growth of towns in England and Wales has meant increased
demands for water, the needs of industry having grown so much that in
many areas they now exceed domestic demand. The use of water in irrigation
of farm land is also growing; it is estimated that the area of land under
irrigation is increasing by 15 per cent a year. In order that the country’s
water resources should be developed to meet these growing requirements the
Water Resources Act, 1963, has provided for a new administrative structure
consisting of river authorities and a Central Water Resources Board; it is
hoped to bring this into effect in 1965. The river authorities will manage the
water resources of river basins, taking over the functions of the former river
boards (see p. 343) in respect of land drainage, flood control, administration
of fisheries and prevention of pollution. They will be responsible for assessing
water resources and requirements, controlling and developing resources and
allocating water between users by a system of licensing. Special arrangements,
based on existing authorities, are being made for the Greater London area,
which is not considered suitable for administration by a self-contained river
authority. The work of the river authorities is to be co-ordinated by the
Water Resources Board, an expert advisory body accountable to the Ministry
of Housing and Local Government. Its duties will include the review of
294

national water resources and requirements, the encouragement of the transfer
of water between areas according to need, the co-ordination of proposals of
river authorities for capital investment and the initiation of research. Water
conservation is to be financially self-supporting after an initial period of
about five years, the cost being met from charges made to abstractors and
users of water.
In Scotland public water undertakings are carried on entirely by local
authorities, either separately or in combination with each other; they supply
about 97 per cent of the total population. The water problem in Scotland is
broadly similar to that in England and Wales except that there is not the
same need to allocate water between competing interests and less reliance
needs to be placed on underground sources. The Water (Scotland) Acts,
1946 and 1949, among other provisions, impose a general duty on the
Secretary of State to promote the conservation of water resources in Scotland;
require local authorities to provide supplies of wholesome water everywhere
in their districts, where this can be done at reasonable cost; and provide for
a uniform system of rating for water throughout the country. The Scottish
Water Advisory Committee advises the Secretary of State on general questions
relating to resources and supplies. The Rural Water Supplies and Sewerage
Act, 1944, as amended, makes available to Scottish local authorities grant
assistance up to a maximum of £45 million towards the cost of water supplies
and sewerage schemes in rural areas. By December 1962 the total value of
work done on new and improved water supplies since 1945 amounted to
£65 million, of which £31-8 million represents works aided by grants under
these Acts.
Northern Ireland has abundant supplies of water for both domestic and
industrial consumption. The Water Supplies and Sewerage Act (Northern
Ireland), 1945, made it obligatory for water supply authorities to provide a
supply of wholesome water to houses and schools in their areas where this
could be done at reasonable cost, and also empowered the Ministry of Health
and Local Government to make grants towards the costs of schemes under¬
taken by these authorities. Before 1945 only the more densely populated areas
had a piped supply, but progress has been such that even in the thinly
populated rural districts most households have now been, or soon will be,
connected to a piped supply. By 31st March, 1963, £33 million had been
expended, including grants totalling ^14-5 million.
In October 1961 the Minister of Health and Local Government appointed
a Water Resources Committee which is making a detailed study of water
supplies in the area.
Information on the yield, behaviour and quantity of the nation’s surface
water resources is provided in the Surface Water Year Book of Great Britain,
published annually by H.M. Stationery Office. This publication contains
particulars of the run-off and related rainfall from a large number of rivers,
streams and reservoired areas. The Surface Water Survey Centre of the
Ministry of Housing and Local Government is responsible for the promotion
of gauging, the collection of hydrological information, and the publication
of the year book. The field work of surface water measurement is carried
out by river boards, water undertakings and other bodies. General information
on rainfall, published annually in British Rainfall, is the responsibility of the
Meteorological Office, while the subject of ground water is dealt with by
the Geological Survey and Museum. In special cases the Hydraulics Research

Station of the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research carries out
research into problems of the design and calibration of gauging weirs and
flumes for the measurement of surface water.
Each river authority is responsible for the prevention in each river basin of
pollution into rivers and certain tidal waters. Control of pollution in the tidal
Thames is exercised by the Port of London Authority (see p. 364). In Scotland
nine river purification boards have been set up; north and west of the Cale¬
donian Canal and in parts of the counties of Angus and Kincardine the
county councils and town councils of large burghs are the river purification
authorities.
The Water Pollution Research Laboratory of the Department of Scientific
and Industrial Research is engaged in investigating problems connected with
the treatment of water for domestic and industrial supply, the treatment and
disposal of sewage and industrial waste water, and the effects and prevention
of pollution of surface water and underground water. Research is carried out
with general supervision and advice from the Water Pollution Research
Board of the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research.
CONSTRUCTION
The construction industries comprise firms engaged wholly or mainly on
construction, alteration, repair and maintenance of buildings, highways,
airfields, sewers, waterworks, harbours and canals, electric wiring, heating and
other installation work, open-cast coal prospecting and mining, non-electrical
work at power stations and structural work connected with telecommunica¬
tions. The industries employ about 1^ million persons and provide about
6 per cent of the gross national product. They also make an important
contribution to overseas development.
Over four-fifths of all constructional work is done by private concerns. The
majority of firms are small or medium sized. Nearly 27 per cent of the firms
in the industry are one-man businesses engaged in such trades as house
painting or plumbing, and about 82 per cent employ fewer than 10 persons.
At the other end of the scale there are only about 80 firms of building and
civil engineering contractors employing more than 1,000 persons each. Some
of these are integrated concerns owning quarries as well as workshops,
extensive stocks of mechanical plant, and the standard stores and tackle of
builders’ yards; they also undertake large-scale constructional contracts
overseas. Some firms are prepared to offer a ‘package’ service comprising
complete responsibility for projects from design to finished building.
A growing proportion of construction work, in Britain and overseas, is
being undertaken by ‘consortia’, i.e. organisations in which several firms
group together to secure large contracts—such as the building of nuclear
power stations—which are beyond the technical or financial resources of a
single firm.
All but the smallest construction activities in Britain are carried out under
professional direction provided, as a rule, by an architect for smaller works
and by a team of consulting engineers and architects for larger works. There
are over 250 firms of consulting engineers which undertake detailed investi¬
gations of constructional projects, report on the type of work recommended
and materials required, provide estimates of the time and cost of construction,

obtain competitive tenders from contracting firms and supervise the carrying
out of the work by the contractor.
The value of the annual output of the industry has been rising fairly steadily
in recent years; the total for Great Britain in 1962 is estimated to amount
to ^3,011 million, compared with ^2,581 million in i960. Of the 1962 total,
£457 million represents work carried out by the staffs employed directly by
the public authorities (including Government departments, local authorities
and certain public utilities), while the balance of £2,554 million represents
the output of private firms (new work, £2,006 million, and other
work, £548 million). According to the index of industrial production
the output of the construction industry rose by 21 per cent between 1958
and 1962.
In the post-war period most new houses in Britain have been built by private
firms working under contract to local authorities, but the proportion built
by private firms for private owners has increased appreciably since 1954
(see p. 192). About 9 per cent of local authorities in England and Wales
employ direct labour in housing construction. In 1962 the value of new
housing built in Great Britain by private firms was £738 million, of which
£445 million was for private developers and £293 million for public authori¬
ties. The total number of houses and flats completed in the United Kingdom
in 1962 by all agencies was 313,600, of which 178,000 were built for private
owners and the remainder for local and other authorities, such as housing
associations and Government departments. Over 3 million dwellings were
built in the ten years 1953-62.
Britain was the first country to develop civil engineering as a large-scale
modern industry and the first to provide techniques, finance and equipment
to carry out major civil engineering projects throughout the world. Prominent
figures in the early development of civil engineering included: James Brindley
(1716-1772), builder of canals; John Loudon McAdam (1756-1836), pioneer
in road construction; Thomas Telford (1757-1834), builder of roads, docks
and bridges; and George Stephenson (1781-1848), Robert Stephenson
(1803-1859), Joseph Locke (1805-1860), Isambard Kingdom Brunei (1806-
1859) and Thomas Brassey (1805-1870), builders of railways.
The principal professional body in the civil engineering industry is the
Institution of Civil Engineers, incorporated by Royal Charter in 1828.
Within Britain the industry has been occupied since the war with large-
scale reconstruction and development schemes. These have included work
on the repair, modernisation and electrification of railways, road and dock
development schemes, airports, sea defence works, thermo-electric and
hydro-electric power stations, improved water supplies, and drainage and
sewerage systems.
Among important construction projects in hand in the United Kingdom
in 1963 were a flood protection scheme costing £2-2 million on the Great
Ouse River; and seven nuclear power stations, including the one at Sizewell
in Suffolk with a net output of 580 MW, costing £55 million and due for
completion in 1966. Large-scale projects for building of roads, bridges and
tunnels were in hand (see pp. 373-4). A £9 million pipeline, 825 miles long
and 18 inches in diameter was being constructed to bring natural gas from
the tanker terminal at Canvey Island, Essex, to supply gas to inland areas.
The main pipeline from Canvey to Leeds will be 200 miles long.

In Great Britain 2,106 industrial buildings were completed in 1961, with
a total floor area of 52 million square feet.
Developments in the building and civil engineering industries in Northern
Ireland have followed much the same pattern as in Great Britain.
During the five years from 1957 to 1961, 95,000 new permanent dwellings
were provided, the annual increase in output rising from 6,500 in 1957 to 7,100
in 1961. In addition to continued progress with hospitals and schools, water
supply and sewerage, roads, sea defence works, arterial drainage and harbours,
there have been considerable new developments in university building, in
offices (both private and government) and in motorways. The extensive
government factory programme (see p. 264) has also continued.
Constructional work carried out overseas by British firms has included
railways in most parts of the world; large-scale irrigation works in India,
Pakistan, Egypt, and Greece; and canals, roads, docks, harbours, power
stations, airfields, hydro-electric schemes and industrial and housing estates
in several countries. British conditions of contract for international civil
engineering work have been widely adopted as standard throughout the world.
British consulting engineers have built up a tradition of knowledge and
integrity, which has caused their services to be in demand throughout the
world. On 1st January, 1962, they had in hand building and civil engineering
projects in all five continents costing over £750 million. Important overseas
projects in which the consulting engineers and holders of the main construc¬
tion contract are all British are the new deep water harbour at Barbados,
which cost £3-7 million and was completed in 1961, and Tema Harbour in
Ghana, which was opened in 1962 and, when completed, will have cost over
£21 million, including preliminary work which was also done by a British
firm. Similar examples are the drainage and irrigation schemes at Black Bush
Polder and Tapakuma in British Guiana, costing together over £4 million.
In the Sudan British construction, textile machinery and electrical firms
co-operated in the construction and equipment of a textile mill which cost
£5’5 million and was completed in 1962. Recent awards include a ^13 million
contract to build a complete new township in the Sudan, and one of the
largest hydro-electric schemes in Latin America, at Mantaro in Peru.
It has been estimated that the value of work done during the year ended
March 1963 by over 60 principal British building and civil engineering firms,
operating in 67 countries, was £110 million, compared with £113 million
in the previous year; the value of contracts obtained rose from £122 million
in 1961-62 to £133 million in 1962-63. Just over half of the work was done
in the sterling area.
The two Government departments mainly concerned with research and
development in the construction industries are the Ministry of Public
Building and Works and the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research
(DSIR). Other Government departments have development groups studying
buildings of particular concern to the department, such as hospitals in the
case of the Ministry of Health.
In 1962 the Ministry of Public Building and Works set up a Directorate
General of Research and Development, to be responsible for economic
studies, development, building management and research, and information.
It also has the general task of co-ordinating the work of the research and
development groups in other departments and supervising the progress of
298
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
the public authorities’ building programme (which accounts for 44 per cent
of total construction work in Britain).
Several of the research establishments of DSIR (see p. 213) deal with
subjects relating to the construction industries. The Building Research Station
which was set up in 1921, thus making Britain the pioneer of organised
building research, is concerned with research in all aspects of building. The
Hydraulics Research Station studies such subjects as hydraulic structures for
hydro-electric projects. Research on timber is carried out at the Forest
Products Research Laboratory. The Heating and Ventilating Research Associa¬
tion, an industrial organisation, deals with problems of heating and ventilation
of large buildings. Large manufacturing firms have laboratories, some of the
work of which is concerned with construction, and the major construction
firms have research departments working on plant, materials and methods.
Other bodies concerned with such research include the Admiralty, universities
and colleges of technology. Most of the producers of primary building materials
have trade associations which maintain research institutions chiefly devoted
to seeking new and more efficient uses for their materials: the Brick Develop¬
ment Association and the Cement and Concrete Association are examples.
In i960 a Civil Engineering Research Council was set up on the initiative
of associations of civil engineering contractors and consulting and civil
engineers in consultation with representatives of private firms in the industry.
The Civil Engineering Research Council is financed by grants from DSIR
and contributions from the industry and its function is to promote the
carrying out of research on appropriate problems in civil engineering, making
use of existing research facilities of all types. Up to March 1963 the Civil
Engineering Research Council had initiated or given financial support to
15 projects.
MANUFACTURING INDUSTRIES
Britain’s manufacturing industries provide a wide range of products, many
of which are of major importance in world trade. Output has increased by
over 15 per cent since 1958, though there were only marginal increases
between i960 and 1961, and 1961 and 1962. In 1962 this sector spent £1,126
million on fixed capital equipment, including £306 million on building work
and £761 million on plant and machinery. The number of employees in
manufacturing industry (including the unemployed and those absent from
work through sickness and other causes, but excluding employers and the
self-employed) was 9 million at June 1962, 39 per cent of the total number
of employees.
Manufacturers’ prices, which had risen by more than 3 per cent a year
from 1954 to early 1957, increased very little from then until the end of 1959;
by i960 the average price of manufactured products had begun to rise again,
and at the end of 1961 prices were 3 per cent higher than a year earlier.
The increase throughout 1962 was under 2 per cent.
The employment and sales figures listed in Table 18 give an indication
of the relative importance of broad sectors of manufacturing industry.
Expansion has been particularly rapid in electronics, most sections of electrical
engineering, most branches of the chemical industry and man-made fibres.
In the subsequent sections, statistics relating to firms are those of enter¬
prises given in the Censuses of Production for 195^ an<^ I9^I> statistics of

and any new building work, machinery or other capital items produced within the firm
for its own use.
The metal manufacturing industries employed 605,000 persons in June 1962.
Of these, 332,000 were in the iron and steel industry, 124,000 in the manu¬
facture of iron castings, 55,000 in the manufacture of light metals, and 84,000
in the copper, brass and other base metal industries. Exports in 1962 had
an aggregate value of ^310-8 million.
Britain pioneered the application of coal to the smelting of iron ore from the
seventeenth century onwards and British inventors were responsible for the
discovery of the processes which led to the great expansion of steelmaking
in the second half of the nineteenth century. Today Britain is the world’s
fifth largest steel producing nation. Output of crude steel in 1962 totalled
20-5 million ingot tons, 7 per cent below the 1961 total and appreciably
below the record level of 24-3 million tons in i960, but well above the 1946
level of 12-7 million tons; 12-7 million tons of pig iron and 10-5 million tons
of scrap were also consumed. Pig iron production amounted to 13-7 million
tons. Capacity utilisation in 1962 was 74 per cent, compared with a peak of
94 per cent in i960.
Net deliveries of finished steel amounted to 15-7 million tons in 1962 and
the 3-3 million tons of iron and steel products which were exported had a value
of ,£200-4 million; the United States (^13-6 million), Sweden (^10-2 million),
the Soviet Union (^io-i million), and India were the main overseas buyers.

BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Iron Castings
The main producing districts are: South Wales (25 per cent of total crude
steel output); the north-east of England (17 per cent); Lincolnshire (12 per
cent); Sheffield and district (12 per cent); Lancashire (11 per cent) and
Scotland (9 per cent). Other important areas are Yorkshire, Staffordshire,
Northamptonshire, and the north-west coast of England. South Wales con¬
centrates mainly on the manufacture of flat products, especially sheet steel
and tinplate; the output of the north-east coast and Scotland is predominantly
of heavy steel products (plates, sections and rails); Sheffield is responsible
for 66 per cent of the United Kingdom alloy steel production.
During the period 1946-62 about ^1,270 million was spent on capital
development, including £199 million in 1961 and ^170 million in 1962. As a
result, Britain has some of the most modern plant in Europe. One effect of
the programme will be the comparative decline in the proportion of steel
produced by the traditional open-hearth method: it is estimated that by 1965
open-hearth steel will have declined from 85 per cent (in i960) to about
67 per cent of total output; converter steel will have increased from 8 per cent
to 21 per cent, and electric steel from 7 per cent to 12 per cent. Total capacity
in 1965 may exceed 33 million tons.
Larger and more efficient blast furnaces (in some cases exceeding 30 ft.
hearth diameter) have been installed and coke consumption has been reduced
by improvements in the preparation of raw materials. Extensive experiments
are taking place on the use of fuel injection and oxygen-enriched blast. The
industry controls a fleet of 73 special ore carriers.
Many companies have developments to improve the quality and range of
finished products, including continuous mills to roll rods, strip bars and
other items. Outstanding projects completed in 1962 and early 1963 included
new strip mills at Newport (Monmouthshire) and at Ravenscraig (Scotland)
for the production of sheet.
The iron and steel industry has been subject to some form of public
supervision since 1932, when a Government-appointed body, the Import
Duties Advisory Committee, gave special attention to the reorganisation of
the industry. In February 1951 the greater part of the industry came under
public ownership by virtue of the Iron and Steel Act, 1949. The 1949 Act
was repealed by the Iron and Steel Act, 1953, which established an Iron and
Steel Holding and Realisation Agency with the duty of returning the companies
to private ownership. The number of companies in which the Agency has a
controlling shareholding has been reduced from 81 in July 1953 to a single
large company in the first half of 1963.
The 1953 Act also provided for the establishment of the Iron and Steel
Board to exercise a general supervision over the iron and steel industry.
Members of the Board are appointed by the Government and it is financed
by levies which it has power to make on firms in the industry. The major
trade association in the iron and steel industry, excluding iron and steel
founding, is the British Iron and Steel Federation.
Output of iron castings was 3-5 million tons in 1962, compared with 3-8
million tons in 1961 and 2-54 million tons in 1946. The main users of iron
castings are the general engineering industry, the motor vehicle industry, the
building and associated industries, manufacturers of pressure pipes and
fittings, and the steel industry. An important part of total output consists of
grey and malleable iron castings for use in motor vehicles, tractors, machine
tools, engines and all kinds of power units.
There are about 1,400 firms in the iron founding industry and the number
INDUSTRY 301
of employees is about 124,000. Exports are included in the total of steel
exports in the previous section.

The non-ferrous metals industry is the largest in Europe and as a consumer
of aluminium, copper and lead Britain is second only to the United Stales
among western countries. Output in 1962 included: aluminium, 34,000 tons
of virgin metal and 13,000 tons of secondary metal; refined copper, 117,000
tons of virgin copper and 111,000 tons of secondary metal; lead, 89,000 tons
of refined metal; zinc 97,000 tons of slab metal; and tin, 20,000 tons. Mining
in Britain is confined to the working of lead and tin ores on a small scale.
In 1962 exports of non-ferrous base metals were valued at ,£110-4 million.
The main products exported, including semi-finished products, were copper
and copper alloys (£55-5 million), aluminium and its alloys (£19 million),
nickel and its alloys (^19-2 million), and tin and its alloys (£8-4 million).
The German Federal Republic (j£i2-8 million), Belgium (^11-7 million), Italy
(^7-4 million) and the United States (,£7-2 million) were the largest pur¬
chasing countries. There were also substantial exports of finished products
incorporating non-ferrous semi-finished products and non-ferrous metals in
many finished forms.
Nearly half of the industry is situated in the Midlands; other centres include
South Wales, London, Tyneside and Avonmouth. It consists of over 900
firms engaged in smelting, casting and fabrication by rolling, extrusion and
drawing. The techniques of powder metallurgy and pressure diecasting are
also employed. Some non-ferrous metals, such as nickel, molybdenum,
tungsten and vanadium, are largely used in the making of high speed and
tool steels. New uses for non-ferrous metals with special properties have
emerged with the growth of new industries having particular requirements,
as, for example, production of nuclear energy (uranium, zirconium), jet
aircraft (niobium, magnesium, titanium) and electronic apparatus (selenium,
silicon, germanium, tantalum). The British industry has some of the most
advanced plant in the world for the preparation of zirconium.
Mechanical engineering comprises a wide range of industries, including all
types of machinery, machine tools, engineers’ small tools, small arms,
mechanical handling equipment, construction equipment, industrial plant,
watches and clocks, and scientific instruments. Vehicle engines are included
in the section on vehicles (p. 308). The volume of deliveries from these
industries rose by 22 per cent between 1954 and 1962, in which latter year
j£i,68i million was the aggregate value of the main products of all sections
other than small arms, scientific instruments and watches and clocks. Exports
of the groups of products below had a total value of over £700 million. The
number of employees was over 1-45 million.
In 1962 output of agricultural machinery other than tractors was valued at
£49-5 million, and included: 17,000 mould-board ploughs, 7,500 disc harrows,
3,300 corn drills, 7,300 farmyard manure spreaders, 12,200 mowers, 15,700
pick-up balers, 2,800 combine harvesters, 1,900 grain and grass driers, and
7,200 milking machines. Exports in 1962 had a value of £20-7 million;
the German Federal Republic, the Irish Republic, France and the Netherlands
were the main markets. Though there are over 300 firms in the industry,
three enterprises employing over a thousand workers account for over half
the net output of larger firms1. About 36,000 persons are employed.

The bulk of British tractor output and exports consists of agricultural tractors.
Some 202,000 agricultural and industrial (wheeled and half track) tractors
were produced in 1962, about 163,000 (81 per cent) for export. Output also
included 4,200 track laying tractors (3,100 for export) and 37,000 small
market garden tractors of less than 10 belt-horse-power. In addition, British
firms produced 9,000 powered industrial trucks, including 5,700 of the
fork-lift variety. Exports of tractors had a value of £97-1 million in 1962; of
industrial and works trucks, £4-2 million. Agricultural tractor production is
dominated by five large organisations, two of them producing about 80 per
cent of output. Tractors are exhibited at the Royal Smithfield Show
and Agricultural Machinery Exhibition in London.
Britain was the birthplace of the modern machine tool industry, and by the
early 1830s had developed to an advanced stage the boring machine and
screw-cutting lathe, as well as other machine tools. The industry’s output
today ranges from watchmakers’ lathes weighing a few pounds to machines
weighing hundreds of tons, including transfer lines for motor vehicle manu¬
facture and electronically controlled machine tools giving accuracies of one
ten-thousandth part of an inch.
A substantial expansion in output and exports took place in 1962. The
value of deliveries of metal-working machine tools rose to £127-2 million,
the highest ever recorded. Exports in 1962 had a value of ^43-5 million; of
the orders on hand at the end of December 1962, valued at ^88-3 million,
39 per cent was for export. India (^5-1 million), the German Federal Republic
(£3-5 million), France {£y$ million), Australia and Italy were the main
markets.
There are about 350 separate firms making machine tools (including
welding machinery), but over 40 per cent of net output is produced by
11 enterprises, each employing over 1,000 persons. The high degree of
specialisation makes it possible for the small firm to flourish. The industry is
centred mainly in the Midlands, Yorkshire and Lancashire, and to a lesser
extent near London and Glasgow. About 98,000 persons are employed.
The Machine Tool Trades Association of Great Britain is the representative
body of most manufacturers and importers, and is responsible for the Inter¬
national Machine Tool Exhibitions held in Britain every four years; the next
exhibition will take place in 1964. The industry is served by its own research
body, the Machine Tool Industry Research Association.
Britain manufactures a wide range of industrial engines other than those for
the vehicle construction industries (see p. 308). Deliveries of complete engines
had a value of £80 million in 1962 and exports (including marine and rail
traction engines) were worth £2.2-\ million; in addition, parts exported were
valued at £15-8 million. The total brake-horse-power of the 360,000 internal
combustion engines delivered was 7 million.
There are about 70 firms for whom industrial engines are their chief product.
Production is concentrated among the large firms, and 10 of these, each
employing over 1,500 persons, account for over 86 per cent of the net output
of larger firms. About 42,000 employees work in the industry.
One of the oldest of Britain’s mechanical engineering industries is the textile
machinery industry, which developed rapidly after the introduction of
mechanical spinning and weaving towards the end of the eighteenth century.
It enjoys a world-wide reputation and offers a complete range of modern

equipment for all stages in textile manufacturing processes. Deliveries in 1962
were valued at j£86-8 million and exports reached their highest-ever value of
^62-5 million. Principal markets were India (^6 million), the Soviet Union
(^4-3 million), Pakistan (^4-1 million), the United States (£3-5 million),
France, Italy and Australia.
The industry, which has about 61,000 employees, comprises over 600 firms,
situated mainly in Lancashire, Yorkshire, Northern Ireland, Dundee,
Leicester and Nottingham, making a wide range of machines and accessories
for the manufacture and processing of yarns and fabrics from all types of
natural and man-made fibres, including bast and leaf fibre machinery of
which the United Kingdom is still by far the world’s largest supplier. Five
enterprises with over 2,000 employees produce over half of the output of
the 158 larger firms.
Almost every industry makes use of mechanical handling equipment; the
products of the industry range from individual units and accessories to
complete operating systems but are usually taken to exclude colliery gear and
conveyors for underground mines. The value of deliveries in 1962 was some
£104-8 million, the main constituents being: cranes and bridge transporters
(about 28 per cent of the total value), lifts, escalators, conveyors, elevators
and hoists. Exports of mechanical handling equipment (including industrial
and works trucks) in 1962 were valued at £21-2 million, 9 per cent higher
than in 1961. There are about 270 firms in the industry but only 170 of these
employ over 25 persons.
Production of equipment extends to almost the whole range of plant required
by the construction industry, including crawler tractors, motor graders,
scrapers, trenchers, dozer equipment, dumpers, rippers, rooters, and crushing,
pulverising and screening plant.
The value of deliveries from the industry was about £100 million in
1962; by far the most important single item was earth-moving machinery
with a value of £64-4 million. Exports of excavating and earth-moving
machinery and road-rollers in 1962 totalled £45 million; the German Federal
Republic, France, Spain, Italy, Belgium, Australia, Switzerland and the
Netherlands were important markets.
Contractors plant and quarrying machinery is manufactured by over 120
firms, and of the larger enterprises, 8 with over 1,000 employees account for
47 per cent of net output. The labour force numbers about 26,500.
The office machinery industry has been expanding rapidly and is now second
in size only to that of the United States. In 1962 the value of deliveries of
office machinery (such as accounting machinery, punched-card machinery,
typewriters, dictating machines, and duplicating machinery) was £75-2
million. Deliveries in 1962 included 184,000 standard typewriters and
228,500 portable typewriters. The value of deliveries of accounting machinery
was £42-4 million, of which £18-1 million was for export, and of other office
machinery £19-7 million, of which £8-2 million was for export. Exports of
all office machinery were valued at £33-9 million and the most important
overseas purchasers were France, the United States, Australia and the German
Federal Republic. British subsidiaries or associates of United States firms are
prominent in the office machinery industry, in which there about 80 firms.
About 66,000 persons are employed.

The manufacture of engineers’ small tools and gauges is an expanding
industry and is the main branch of production for over 1,100 firms, of which
4 have over 1,000 employees. Deliveries increased in value from ^52-1 million
in 1959 to £75-i million in 1961, but fell slightly to £73-1 million in 1962.
The industry has a labour force of about 58,000 persons.
British industry manufactures almost every type of industrial plant and
steelwork, and about 160,000 are employed in this branch. Of particular
importance are steam-raising boilers, lime and cement kilns, gas and coke
oven plant, sintering plant, metallurgical furnaces and plant, chemical and
mineral oil refining plant, nuclear reactors, water and sewage treatment
plant, and steelwork for bridges, buildings, etc. The industry is composed
of over 800 firms, including several large-scale enterprises. Almost 60 per
cent of the net output of larger firms comes from 29 firms with over 1,000
employees, and nearly one-third is accounted for by 7 firms with a labour
force of over 3,000. In 1962 the aggregate value of deliveries was £350-1
million.
British companies delivered water tube boilers to the value of £63-4 million
in 1962; shell boilers and other boilerhouse plant accounted for a further
£31-2 million. Water tube boilers of advanced design and of large steam¬
raising capacity are produced for power stations, whereas shell boilers are
used for steam-raising and heating in factories and buildings. Exports in
1962 amounted to £18-8 million.
The modernisation and expansion of the British steel industry has led to the
rapid development of the steelworks plant industry, which today provides,
in association with firms producing rolling mills, almost all Britain’s require¬
ments, and also supplies plant for export. The value of deliveries in 1962
was £31-1 million; rolling mills and ancillary equipment accounted for an
additional £38-1 million. Exports of steel works and non-ferrous machinery
and equipment (including rolling mills) were worth £14-2 million in 1962.
This industry consists of a small number of firms, most of which are
business associates or members of a consortium. They are capable of supplying
the plant and equipment for steel and non-ferrous metal works, and are in
the position to undertake the planning, erection and supply of complete
plants in any part of the world; the Durgapur Steel Works in India is an
outstanding example.
The manufacture of specialised equipment for the chemical and ore refining
industries has expanded rapidly in the last 15 years. Deliveries of chemical
plant had a value of £71-1 million in 1962 compared with £37-3 million in
1959. Exports of chemical plant (including some gas machinery) amounted to
£11-3 million in 1962, and exports of mineral ore refining machinery came to
a further £1-5 million. If the whole range of equipment manufactured by
British firms for the petroleum industry is aggregated, Britain ranks second
to the United States as a supplier. The range of chemical plant produced
includes distillation columns, heat exchangers, high vacuum drying equipment,
and plant for the manufacture of chemicals from all feedstocks including
petroleum.
The design and construction of nuclear power stations is one of the out¬
standing present-day enterprises of British industry. Three major groups of
firms, consisting of leading firms in the heavy electrical engineering, civil
engineering, boiler, instrument, and associated industries, build nuclear
power stations for the United Kingdom electricity authorities, and have built
INDUSTRY
3°5
stations in Italy and Japan. The Atomic Energy Authority grants them non¬
exclusive manufacturing licences and is working in close collaboration with
them in research and development.
Several companies have designed, or have designs under study for, small
nuclear power stations to be used for electricity generation. Companies have
also been established for the manufacture of graphite for use in reactors.
The Nuclear Energy Trade Associations’ Conference (NETAC) was
formed towards the end of 1956 to establish a permanent means of liaison
and to pool experience among the firms and trade associations concerned in
nuclear development.

In addition to the mechanical engineering firms described in preceding
sections, there are about 1,750 enterprises whose principal product is a type of
machinery not so far mentioned; about 900 of these firms have over 25 em¬
ployees and some 60 have more than 1,000. Four firms have a labour force
of over 4,000. The main products include: mining machinery, printing and
book-binding machinery, refrigeration appliances, space heating, ventilation
and air conditioning equipment, pumps and pumping machinery, industrial
valves and cocks, compressors, scales and weighing machinery, portable
power tools, food preparing machinery and many other types of equipment.
The total value of deliveries in 1962 was some £619-4 million. Exports of
the industry’s main products were valued at about £245 million. About
354,000 workers are employed in these industries.
This industry makes a wide range of equipment and appliances, extending
from refrigerators of varying sizes suitable for domestic and commercial use
to industrial refrigeration equipment for cold stores, manufacture of chemicals
and other products, ice-making plant and refrigeration plant for ships.
Important advances have recently been made in the development of acceler¬
ated freeze-drying equipment for the food industry and of refrigerated
transport vehicles. Production of commercial and industrial refrigeration
machinery was well established before the second world war, but the present
large production of domestic refrigerators has been built up since 1946.
Deliveries in 1962 had a value of £47-9 million.
Space heating and ventilation equipment includes sectional boilers for
central heating; hot air, water and steam radiators; and fan and air filters.
The value of deliveries has been rising in recent years and in 1962 reached
£54-4 million.
Exports of air conditioning equipment, refrigerators and fans in 1962 had
a value of £8-7 million; the German Federal Republic (£o-8 million) was the
largest overseas buyer.
Industrial valves controlling the movement of liquids and gases are a vital
component in many industrial processes, particularly in the chemicals, oil
and electric power industries. The value of deliveries of pumps and valves
in 1962 was estimated at £98-5 million. Exports of pumps were valued at
£19-2 million and exports of industrial valves at £15 ’4 million.
The value of deliveries of other major products in 1962 was: mining machinery,
£49-7 million; air and gas compressors and exhausters, £30 million; food
and drink machinery £42-3 million; packaging machinery £22-2 million;
and other machinery £233-6 million. Exports of mining machinery had a
value of £7-3 million, those of air and gas compressors, £12-2 million,
and of food and drink preparation and sterilising machinery, £12-1
million.

The industry comprises about 1,300 enterprises engaged in the manufacture
of photographic, scientific, surgical and industrial instruments. A rapidly
expanding sector is that making industrial and process measuring and control
instruments—an essential element of automation in industry—deliveries of
which amounted to £47-6 million in 1962. The value of deliveries of other
broad categories was: optical instruments £7-75 million; electric, electronic,
and nucleonic instruments ^16-7 million; and nautical and gunnery control
instruments £19-8 million. The total deliveries for 1962 amounted to ^133
million.
The industry has a labour force of 136,000 perons. About 54 per cent of
the net output of larger firms is accounted for by 21 large enterprises, each
employing over 1,000 persons.
Exports of scientific instruments have been rising sharply, amounting to
about £50 million in 1962, 76 per cent higher than the 1958 total. Australia,
the United States, the German Federal Republic, France, India and Canada
were the most important markets.
Britain was at one time the world’s leading producer of clocks and watches
but by the end of the nineteenth century production had virtually died out.
The present industry is largely a post-war development. It employs about
14,800 people, the great majority skilled craftsmen, and many of its factories
are located on new industrial estates in the older industrial areas, particularly
in Scotland. Deliveries in 1962 included clocks to a value of £6-9 million
and watches worth £4 million; exports were valued at about -£2-9 million.
Behind the firms manufacturing the major products outlined in this section
are nearly 4,000 enterprises employing about 210,000 whose main functions
are to supply parts and components, to conduct research and development
work, and to undertake general sub-contracting and repair work. (Some enter¬
prises are included because the mixed character of their work makes it
impossible to classify them under any other industries.) They include several
very large undertakings: 23 have over 1,000 employees each and 7 have over
5,000 employees. Ball and roller bearings, and chains are particularly im¬
portant products; exports of the former were valued at £9-3 million in 1962,
and of chains at £4-9 million.
The electrical engineering industry is engaged in the manufacture and
installation of a wide variety of electrical equipment, including all types of
generating, transmission and distribution equipment; motors; telecommunica¬
tions apparatus; domestic appliances; and specialised laboratory and electronic
equipment. Exports (other than record players, etc.) in 1962 reached their
highest ever value of £273 million. Products are exported to all parts of the
world; in 1962, Australia (£24-2 million), South Africa (£17-5 million),
India (£12-9 million), Canada (£12-6 million), New Zealand (£12-5 million)
and the United States (£12-4 million) were the main markets.
Altogether the industry employs a labour force of almost 836,000. The
leading organisation of the industry is the British Electrical and Allied
Manufacturers’ Association.
British scientists and engineers have been responsible for many of the basic
advances in the generation and transmission of electric power. The experi¬
ments of Michael Faraday pointed the way to the production of electricity
as a source of cheap and abundant power; Sir Charles Parsons produced and

patented the first turbo-dynamo, the forerunner of the giant turbo-generating
sets of today. The industry has provided the plant required for the large-
scale expansion programme of the United Kingdom electricity authorities,
and has built all types of equipment for overseas countries.
In 1962 the output of electrical machinery was valued at ^351-8 million,
including ^141-6 million worth of rotating electrical machinery (motors,
generators and rotary converters), £53-9 million worth of transformers for
lighting, heating and power, £134-1 million worth of switchgear and control
gear and £22-2 million worth of other electrical machinery.
Exports of electrical machinery in 1962 had a value of £66-9 million;
Australia, South Africa and India were the main markets. Generators,
generating sets and motors accounted for £37-6 million and converting
machinery, rectifiers, transformers and other machinery for the remainder.
About 670 firms manufacture electrical machinery, including 27 with over
1,000 employees and five with over 7,500. The total labour force numbers
221,000. Manufacture takes place in many areas; among the most important
are Manchester, Rugby, Tyneside, Stafford and Larne (Northern
Ireland).
Production of electronic equipment is one of the most rapidly expanding of
British industries. United Kingdom scientists and inventors have made many
basic contributions to electronics—the thermionic valve, the development of
radar (a British firm has fitted over half the world’s radar-equipped ocean¬
going ships), the first public transmission television service, and the ‘printed
circuit’, which has led to far-reaching changes in methods of production in
the radio industry. Its wide range of products includes radio and television
receivers and electronic capital goods.
Production of consumer goods in 1962 included 3-1 million radios and
radiograms, of which home sales were worth £25 million, and 1-5 million
television sets worth £50-8 million. Output of capital goods included electronic
control equipment (£15-4 million), computers (£13-4 million), electronic
measuring and testing equipment (£11 -6 million), transmitters (£6-4) million),
radar and navigational aids (£18 million), radio communication equipment
(£15-7 million) and other electronic apparatus (£9-1 million). Exports of
electronic and nucleonic valves and tubes, and radio and television capital
equipment, sound reproducing apparatus and components in 1962 were
worth £76-9 million.
Among the most important overseas markets are the United States, Canada,
the Netherlands, Sweden and Australia. Indirect exports of equipment in
other products, such as ships, aircraft and machinery, are considerable.
There are some 500 enterprises in the industry including 3 with over
10,000 employees. Firms employing over 1,000 persons account for 79 per
cent of net output of larger firms. The industry has a labour force of about
262,000.
There are about 70 firms whose main products are cables and wires for the
distribution of electric power, for telegraph and telephone networks and for
many other purposes; they include submarine cables and those insulated by
a great variety of materials. The value of deliveries in 1962 was £152-9 million
and exports of electric cables, wires, etc., were worth £24-8 million.
The industry has a labour force of 64,500 persons. Three firms
with over 5,000 employees account for about 60 per cent of net output of
larger firms.

Britain is the largest exporter of telegraph and telephone equipment. Shipment
overseas (including signalling apparatus and parts) had a value of £25-8
million in 1962. Research and development work is done by firms in the
industry in co-operation with the Post Office (see p. 211). The industry,
employing 70,000 persons, is organised for large-scale operations. Three
enterprises have over 10,000 employees and ten firms with over 1,000
employees produce over 75 per cent of the output of the larger firms.
Deliveries of electrical goods in 1962 included: domestic electrical appliances,
£144 million; electrical equipment for motor vehicles, cycles and aircraft,
^65-9 million; batteries and accumulators, £43 million; electric lamps, £25-6
million; and other electrical goods, £84-6 million. By number, deliveries
included: 1 -4 million electric blankets, 1 -4 million vacuum cleaners, 1 • 1 million
domestic washing machines and 2-05 million electric irons. The industry has
a labour force of 208,000.
The industries which manufacture vehicles, aircraft and ships are among the
largest exporters; overseas deliveries in 1962 of railway and road vehicles,
aircraft, ships and boats had a value of over £540 million, accounting for
17 per cent of exports of manufactured goods. The labour force numbers
1-15 million and includes: 430,000 in motor vehicle manufacture, 274,000
in aircraft construction and repairing, 264,000 in shipbuilding and marine
engineering, 130,000 in the manufacture of railway vehicles and carriages,
30,000 in cycle and motor cycle manufacturing, and 6,500 in the making of
perambulators and hand trucks.
In both size and value the largest section of the vehicle industry comprises
the manufacture of cars and commercial vehicles. In the last five years
development schemes costing some £200 million have been undertaken and,
whereas the industry had previously been located mainly in the Midlands
and London areas, new manufacturing plants are now in operation on
Merseyside, in Wales and in Scotland. Total annual capacity of the five
largest manufacturers by the end of 1963 will be about 2-3 million cars and
700,000 commercial vehicles and tractors.
Car and commercial vehicle output is dominated by the five largest firms
(British Motor Corporation, Ford, Rootes, Leyland Motor Corporation and
Vauxhall) who account for about 90 per cent of complete vehicle production
other than tractors; the balance is in the hands of specialist producers of
heavy commercial vehicles, omnibuses, coaches, trolleybuses, limousines and
sports cars. The principal trade association is the Society of Motor Manu¬
facturers and Traders (SMMT), which holds a motor show annually in
London and a Commercial Motor Exhibition every two years.
Car output expanded almost without interruption to a record of 1-35 million
units in i960, falling back to 1 million in 1961 and increasing to 1-25 million
in 1962. Exports in 1962 amounted to 545,000 cars and chassis with a value
of £215-4 million. The United States (£40-8 million compared with the peak
total of £86-7 million in 1959) was the largest single purchaser. Canada
(£17-7 million), France, South Africa, Australia and New Zealand were the
other largest markets.
Production of commercial vehicles including omnibuses has increased from
146,000 in 1946 to the record total of 460,000 in 1961. In 1962 production
fell to 425,000. Although exports in 1962 were in numbers below the record

level of 1961—148,000, compared with 167,000—their value at £111 million
was the highest total in any year. Australia (-£10-3 million), South Africa
(;£7-2 million), Turkey, Finland and Denmark were the main markets.
It has been estimated that in some cases up to 70 per cent of the final cost of
a car is represented by bought-out components. Exports of parts and access¬
ories for cars and commercial vehicles in 1962 had a value of £90-4 million;
engines and parts were valued at a further ^36-1 million. Caravan and trailer
exports were valued at £4-2 million, and exports of used vehicles (not included
above) had a value of ,£750,000.
Deliveries of bicycles declined from the post-war peak of over 4 million in
1951 to i g million in 1962. Over 80 per cent of British cycle capacity is
concentrated in the hands of a single group of companies, and output is
becoming increasingly concentrated in the Nottingham area. Some 1-3 million
cycles worth £11-4 million were sent overseas in 1962; the United States
(-£4-6 million) was much the largest single market. Parts and accessories
exported amounted to a further -£4-3 million.
Deliveries of all types of motor cycle were 109,000 in 1962, 27 per cent below
the 1961 total and 56 per cent below the 1959 peak of 249,000. Output has
been increasingly diversified during the 1950s, and the 1962 total of deliveries
included 16,100 mopeds, 28,200 motor scooters and 9,200 three-wheeled
vehicles. Manufacture of motor cycles is dominated by two large groups.
Some 30,000 units with a value of ,£4-1 million were exported in 1962, the
United States being the biggest buyer; parts and accessories came to an
additional ^1-3 million.
Britain was the first country to build railways and British engineers pioneered
railway development in most parts of the world. The industry is organised
to meet the conditions resulting from the replacement of steam locomotives
by other forms of traction on most of the world’s railways.
Production in 1962 included 20 electric locomotives, 506 diesel and diesel-
electric locomotives, 1,264 coaching vehicles and 8,729 wagons. Deliveries of
locomotives in 1962 were valued at £20-4 million. The total value of exports
in 1962 was £20-1 million; South Africa (£2-6 million) and Pakistan (,£2-5
million) were the largest purchasers.
There are over 50 establishments making locomotives and railway track
equipment in Britain. British Railways have their own workshops; private
firms build locomotives, carriages and wagons for British Railways, for
industrial users and for export.
Since the second world war the British aircraft industry has concentrated on
the development of civil and military applications of the gas-turbine aero¬
engine first developed by Sir Frank Whittle. This propulsion was first used
in scheduled airline services by the turbo-jet Comet and the turbo-prop
Viscount, the latter probably the most successful post-war civil aircraft. The
Comet 4 jet airliner went into service in 1958. Other gas-turbine aircraft in
production and operation include the Argosy, the Herald, and the Hawker
Siddeley 748. A second generation of jet airliners made maiden flights in 1962
and 1963: the medium-haul Trident, the longer-haul Vickers VC 10 and the
BAG One-Eleven, the world’s first short-haul jet transport, all with rear-
mounted engines. The Trident is due to go into service with BEA before the
end of 1963; the BAG One-Eleven and the Vickers VC 10 will be in airline
service in 1964.

The industry also produces a wide range of military aircraft and air missiles,
its size being strongly influenced by defence requirements. At the peak of
war-time activity the number of those actually working in the industry rose
to nearly 2 million, compared with 35,000 in 1935. In March 1963 the industry
had a labour force of about 274,000.
Exports of aircraft and parts in 1962 had a value of £43-i million. Leading
buyers (who vary considerably from year to year) included Canada (£5-3
million), United States (£3-1 million), German Federal Republic (^3-1
million), Argentina (£3 million), Egypt and India. In addition, exports of
electrical appliances for use in aircraft had a value of ^3-7 million, aeronautical
instruments of £3-1 million, and tyres of over £1 million.
Resulting from a series of mergers in 1959 and i960, the construction of
aircraft is dominated by two large airframe manufacturers and one helicopter
concern, though there are a few important smaller companies outside these
groups. Main centres of the industry are the home counties (i.e. counties
around London), Coventry, Bristol and the west of England, Lancashire,
Northern Ireland and Scotland.
Besides extensive research work by the industry, research on a substantial
scale on problems of aircraft and their engines is carried out by the Ministry
of Aviation, chiefly at the Royal Aircraft Establishment and the National
Gas Turbine Establishment, both at Farnborough, and the Royal Aircraft
Establishment at Bedford. This work is done in collaboration with the
industry and results are made known to manufacturers. In addition, the
National Physical Laboratory undertakes research on aerodynamics.
Aero-engines provided over £506 million in export earnings from 1946 to
1962; in 1961 exports reached the record total of ^83 million, including parts
worth £26 million. In 1962 the figures were £66 million and £25 million
respectively. Licence arrangements have been made for about twenty types
of British engines to be made abroad, and in 1963, 57 per cent of the world
total of jet and turbo-prop airliners on order or in service had British power
plants. Famous engines at present in production include the economical
Dart turbo-prop, the Avon, Conway and Spey turbo-jets and the revolutionary
Pegasus lift-thrust engine for vertical take off and landing (VTOL) aircraft.
Two companies are responsible for almost all aero-engine production.
The shipbuilding industry is concentrated in four main areas: the river Clyde
in Scotland, the north-east coast of England, the north-west coast of England,
and Belfast in Northern Ireland. Ships are also built in the Southampton
area, in the Isle of Wight, and along the estuaries of the rivers Forth and
Tay in Scotland; while numerous yards along the coast build fishing vessels,
yachts, harbour craft and barges. Repair yards and dry docks are situated in
all the large ports. The shipbuilding, ship repairing and marine engineering
industries employed 246,000 persons in August 1962.
During the seventeen years from 1946 to 1962, ships totalling over
22 million gross tons were delivered from British yards, including 689 tankers,
1,345 dry cargo ships, 219 passenger and passenger-cargo ships, 88 ore
carriers, 508 coasters and colliers and 2,789 miscellaneous craft. The total
value of this output was about £2,500 million. In addition, there was £350
million as the estimated shipbuilding value of new naval construction and over
£1,000 million of merchant and naval repair work.
Co-operative research into shipbuilding and marine engineering is under¬
taken by the British Ship Research Association with its headquarters in
London and a research station on the river Tyne. A separate organisation,

Tonnage launched has gradually decreased from a peak of 1-5 million tons
in 1955 to 11 million tons in 1962. This is 13 per cent of the world total,
compared with 15 per cent in 1961. In both years Britain launched (after
Japan) the largest quantity of shipping. At the end of 1962 orders on hand
of merchant vessels of 100 gross tons and over were 259, totalling 2-1 million
gross tons and valued at £250 million. Of these vessels, 51 were for export.
Completions in 1962 numbered 249 (1 million gross tons) 44 of which were
for export. The 1962 total included oil tankers amounting to 342,000 gross
tons and bulk carriers totalling 129,000 tons. The oil tankers include ten of
between 30,000 and 33,000 tons, which were the largest ships built in the
United Kingdom in 1962.
Modernisation in British shipyards involved the replanning of yards, the
erection of large prefabrication shops for welding massive sections under
cover, the installation of heavy-lift travelling cranes, and much other recon¬
struction. Facilities are available for building tankers of more than 100,000
(deadweight) tons carrying capacity.
Although there are many specialist ship repairing establishments, most of
the largest firms also carry on shipbuilding work; about one-quarter of ship
repairing activity is concentrated in the north-east coast of England area.
Most of the larger shipbuilding yards maintain their own engine building
works; often they manufacture several types of diesel engine under licence.
Steam turbines of the highest powers are available, many designed by
Pametrada.
The group of industries manufacturing metal products not described above
consists of a large number of companies with a total labour force of 561,000
in 1962; the main groups were tools and implements (25,050), cutlery (11,600),
bolts, nuts and screws (46,000), wire and wire manufactures (43,400), cans
and metal boxes (36,800), jewellery, plate, and refining of precious metals
(29,000), also other metal industries (368,800). The total value of exports in
1962 was about £157 million.
The production of cutlery and flatware is centred mainly in the city of
Sheffield. The industry has been built up on the skill of its craftsmen; while
mass production methods are used today by some firms, the highest quality
wares are still produced by skilled craftsmen. Firms remain mainly small and,
of some 290 enterprises manufacturing cutlery, over 225 still employ fewer
than 25 persons.
The value of sales of all cutlery products in 1962 was £13-8 million.
Exports of spoons, forks and cutlery had a value of £10-7 million.
This industry, located mainly in the Midlands, Lancashire, Yorkshire, South
Wales and London, produces a wide range of domestic utensils, such as
saucepans, buckets and dustbins, mainly from wrought steel and aluminium.
Increasing quantities of plastic hollow-ware are being produced, though
aluminium manufacturers comprise the largest single group, both in the
value of total production and in exports. The value of sales (including some
industrial hollow-ware) in 1962 was £29 million, of which ^4 million were
sales for export.

Tools and The manufacture of hand tools is one of the oldest British industries. Some
Implements 680 firms manufacture tools such as files, saws, hammers, axes and spades;
Sheffield, Birmingham and other Midland towns are the most important
centres.
The value of sales of implements and tools, other than machine tools and
portable power tools, was ^34 million in 1962, of which j£ii million worth
were exported. Sales of hand tools, at home and for export, were valued at
3^ 10-7 million and ^19-3 million respectively.
Jewellery, Gold The making of jewellery, gold and silver ware and the refining of precious
and Silver Ware metals is an industry in which British craftsmen are heirs to a long tradition.
Some 625 of the 885 firms in the industry have fewer than 25 employees.
The law requires that gold and silver plate shall not be sold until it has been
hall-marked at one of the Assay Offices situated in London, Birmingham,
Sheffield, Edinburgh, and Glasgow. The Birmingham office, located in the
main centre of the jewellery industry, probably hall-marks as much gold and
silver as the rest together.
The total value of sales of jewellery, goldsmiths and silversmiths wares
and electro-plated nickel silver wares in 1962 was ^19-4 million, of which
£2-6 million was for export.
CHEMICALS The chemical industry, with a labour force of about 525,000, comprises the
manufacture of: chemicals and dyes (219,600 employees), pharmaceutical
and toilet preparations (74,100 employees), explosives and fireworks (30,800
employees), paint and printing ink (48,800 employees), oils, fats, soap and
detergents (44,100 employees), synthetic resins and plastics (33,850 em¬
ployees), polishes and gelatines (13,900 employees). The industry is capital
intensive: during the decade 1951-61 some ^1,000 million was spent on
fixed assets and in 1962 capital expenditure amounted to £185 million. The
value of exports in 1962 was ^34I milli011; Australia (£25‘7 million), the
Netherlands (£16-9 million), Italy, the German Federal Republic, the United
States and India were the most important markets.
Chemical The inorganic chemicals industry dates back to the middle of the nineteenth
Elements and. century, when sulphuric acid and alkali were in increasing demand for the
Compounds growing heavy industries. Over 2-7 million tons of sulphuric acid were
produced in Britain in 1962. Large quantities of ammonia, ammonia salts,
chlorine and alkali are manufactured and about 70 per cent of the ammonia is
made into nitrogenous fertilisers. The most rapidly growing outlets for
chlorine are in the manufacture of solvents and the plastics material polyvinyl
chloride (PVC). Production of inorganic chemicals increased by about one-
third between 1954 and 1962.
The earliest organic chemicals were dyestuffs and explosives. Almost
29,000 tons of dyestuffs were produced in 1962. Newer chemicals with
organic structures which are manufactured in bulk by modern synthesis from
organic chemicals include plastics, synthetic rubber and synthetic fibres.
These are among the most rapidly expanding sections of the industry.
Exports of organic and inorganic chemicals and compounds amounted to
£83 million in 1962; organic chemicals, other than radioactive products,
accounted for £18 million. Exports go to a large number of countries
including, in 1962, Italy (^6-5 million), the Netherlands (^5’^ million),
Australia (^5 million), India (j£4'^ million) and the United States (^4‘5
million).

Since 1949 output of petroleum chemicals in Britain has increased by an
average of 37 per cent each year; their share of total organic chemical output
has risen from about one-fifth in 1953 to over 50 per cent at the present day,
and is expected to reach 70 per cent by 1965. It is estimated that by the end
of 1962 total investment in petroleum chemicals had reached £200 million.
Most of the important plants are adjacent to the oil refineries. Deliveries of
feedstock for the petroleum chemicals plants totalled 1-9 million tons in 1962.
(In addition, consumption of tar distillation products such as phenol, used
in the manufacture of organic chemicals, has also increased in recent years.)
Large quantities of industrial ethyl alcohol, which was formerly produced
from molasses, are now manufactured from petroleum.
The first plastic, Parkesine (later called Celluloid), was produced and
patented in Britain in 1865 by Alexander Parkes; other British discoveries
include polyethylene. Manufacture of plastics is one of the most rapidly
growing sections of the economy. Output has doubled since 1955 and
total production of synthetic resins in 1962 was 654,000 tons (an increase
of 15 per cent over 1961), of which 424,000 tons consisted of thermoplastic
resins.
Expansion in recent years has mainly been in thermoplastic materials, of
which the most important are polyethylene (used in coverings, packaging—
notably for foodstuffs—and domestic mouldings), polyvinyl chloride (known
as PVC and used for industrial conveyor belting and a wide range of consumer
goods) and polystyrene (a cheap non-inflammable material used for toys,
light mouldings and many consumer goods). Capacity for the production of
polypropylene (a versatile material for use mainly in electrical components,
mouldings, and domestic appliances) is being expanded substantially. Demand
from the building industry is also increasing markedly. Exports of plastics
materials amounted to 246,000 tons in 1962, valued at about ^54 million.
The first general purpose synthetic rubber to be manufactured on a com¬
mercial scale in the United Kingdom was marketed in 1958. Since then
capacity for production of this and other rubbers has increased rapidly.
Types of specialised synthetic rubber already in production include high
styrene rubbers for shoe soles and flooring, and nitrile rubbers for use where
oil resistance is required. Production in 1962 amounted to 117,000 tons, by
far the greater part of which came from the styrene-butadiene plant at Hythe,
near Southampton. Exports of synthetic rubber were valued at £6-4 million
in 1962, with France as the largest market.
The production of fertilisers owes much to the pioneer work of the British
scientists, Sir John Lawes and Sir Joseph Gilbert, and the research now
carried on at Rothamsted, Hertfordshire, and at the Macaulay Institute,
Aberdeen, is of world-wide importance. Two firms predominate in the
production of fertilisers, and both have established new large-scale manu¬
facturing facilities in recent years. In addition, there are about one hundred
firms marketing compound fertilisers from the principal constituents—
nitrogen, phosphates and potash. To encourage use, sales on the home
market are assisted by Government subsidies paid to the farmer (see p. 340).
Output of nitrogenous fertilisers (in terms of nitrogen content) in 1962
totalled 460,000 tons, and 396,000 tons (in terms of phosphate content) of
phosphatic fertilisers were produced; sales of compound fertilisers in granulated
form are increasing and amounted to 2-7 million tons in 1962. The use of

ammonium, nitrate (35 P^r cent nitrogen) and, to a limited extent, urea
(mostly 45 per cent nitrogen) is resulting in more concentrated fertilisers.
The value of exports of manufactured fertilisers, almost all in the form
of ammonium sulphate, totalled ^4-8 million in 1962.
Sales of paint and varnish during 1962 amounted to some 88 million gallons;
exports accounted for one-tenth of sales, the remainder being almost equally
divided between the domestic and industrial markets. Sales have risen
from about 72 million gallons in 1954. Exports of pigments, paints, varnishes
and related materials in 1962 amounted in value to ^29-9 million; nearly
one-third are in the form of ready-mixed paints, which command a growing
market overseas. The industry’s indirect contribution to exports in the form
of surface coatings for finished goods is also considerable.
In recent years the application of improved techniques has resulted in
rapid development, in particular the use of important new ranges of synthetic
resins and various types of titanium oxide pigment.
The pharmaceutical industry has expanded greatly since the second world
war: the value of output has doubled in a decade to nearly ^250 million.
The whole range of drugs is produced in the United Kingdom, including
sulphonamides, anti-malarial drugs, anti-histamine products, anaesthetics,
vaccines, sera, and naturally occurring drugs. About £9 million per annum is
currently being spent on research; most of the major firms have large
projects in hand to expand production.
Notable British contributors to the development of new products include:
the discovery of penicillin by Sir Alexander Fleming, its evaluation by Sir
Howard Florey and E. B. Chain; the evaluation of sulphapyridine (M & B 693)
by Sir Lionel Whitby; the introduction of the anti-malarial drug proguanil;
the discovery of griseofulvin; and more recently, the isolation of the penicillin
nucleus. A promising development is the Medical Research Council s dis¬
covery of ‘interferon’ for the treatment of virus diseases. Several of the larger
pharmaceutical companies in Britain are subsidiaries of overseas firms.
In 1962 exports were valued at £50-2 million, the highest total recorded
in any year. Commonwealth countries were the largest purchasers.

The market for detergents has grown rapidly since the war. Petroleum is the
source of the principal raw material used in the manufacture of organic
surface-active agents in detergents; the other main constituent, polyphosphates,
is derived from inorganic sources. Sales of detergents amounted to 336,000
tons in 1962. Production of soap was some 426,000 tons. Exports of perfumery
and toilet preparations, soap and cleansing and polishing preparations were
valued at ^27-9 million in 1962.
The textile industries in 1962 had a labour force of about 865,000 persons,
including employees engaged in the production of man-made fibres. Some
123,200 were in the spinning and doubling of cotton, flax and man-made
fibres, 112,700 in the weaving of cotton, linen and man-made fibres, 193,400
in the woollen and worsted trades, about 127,900 in hosiery and knitted goods,
79,900 in textile finishing and 39,200 in carpets. Over half the employees
are women. The total value of textile exports in 1962 was almost £247-5
million. From 1951 to 1961 production in the textile sector of industry fell
by 7 per cent compared with a 33 per cent increase in the output of productive
industry as a whole.
Cotton
Wool
INDUSTRY 315
The invention of mechanical spinning and weaving in the second half of the
eighteenth century led to cotton becoming Britain’s chief consumer goods
industry and cotton piece-goods its largest export during the nineteenth
century. Increasing foreign competition and the tendency of many countries
to set up their own textile industry have cut progressively into British
markets and especially since 1952. Agreements have been negotiated with
certain countries to fix temporary ceilings on their exports to the United
Kingdom.
Though it remains one of the largest consumer goods industries, the cotton
industry has continued to decline in employment and output in recent years.
Output in 1962 consisted of: 392 million lb. of single cotton yarn, 113 million
lb. of spun man-made fibre and mixture single yarn, 130 million lb. of doubled
yarn, 1,047 million linear yards of woven cotton cloth, and 566 million linear
yards of man-made fibres and mixture cloth. In 1962 exports of cotton yarn
and woven fabrics (excluding man-made fibres) amounted in value to
£46-5 million, including woven fabrics worth £33 million. Australia, South
Africa, New Zealand and the Irish Republic were the most important markets.
Most of the industry is located in Lancashire, the north-east of the county
being mainly concerned with weaving and the south-east with spinning.
Manchester is the commercial centre. Liverpool is the chief port of entry
for raw cotton and the Liverpool Cotton Exchange is the main market for
raw cotton dealings.
Legislation to assist the reorganisation of the industry was introduced in
1959. Exchequer funds have paid for two-thirds of the cost of removing surplus
capacity, and also provide grants of about one-quarter towards the cost of
approved re-equipment and modernisation. The reorganisation schemes are
administered by the Cotton Board, a development council, i.e. a statutory
body with constitution and powers laid down under the authority of an Act
of Parliament.
Scientific and technical research for the industry is carried out by the
Cotton, Silk and Man-made Fibres Research Association.
The United Kingdom wool textile industry, the largest in the world, is the
most ancient of Britain’s staple industries and has been important since
medieval times. There are two main branches—woollen and worsted. While
about 85 per cent of woollens and 95 per cent of worsteds are made in the
West Riding of Yorkshire, Scotland and the West of England have retained
their importance as specialised producers of high quality woollen cloth. In
recent years an increasing amount of man-made fibres has been blended
with wool.
In 1962 output included 295 million lb. of tops and 290 million lb. of
woollen yarn. Deliveries of worsted yarn amounted to 229 million lb. and
total deliveries of woven fabrics were almost 328 million square yards. In
addition, large quantities of raw wool are scoured and cleaned in the United
Kingdom. Consumption of raw wool in 1962 was 465 million lb. Exports of
wool yarns and woven fabrics in 1962 were valued at £80-4 million. Raw
wool (cleaned or scoured in Britain) and tops exported had a value of ^61-4
million. Canada, the United States and the German Federal Republic were
the chief buyers of fabrics. There are considerable indirect wool exports in
the form of blankets, carpets and clothing (see pp. 317-8). Research is carried
on mainly by the Wool Industries Research Association, and the National
Wool Textile Export Corporation is responsible for assistance to exporters and
the development of new markets.
3l6
BRITAIN! AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
About 40 per cent of the net output of larger firms is accounted for by over
600 enterprises with fewer than 300 employees. There are over 1,400 firms
in the industry. In recent years on the worsted side there has been a tendency
towards the formation of holding companies controlling a number of sub¬
sidiaries which combine all the worsted processes within one organisation.
Firms on the woollen side are normally organised to include the full process
of manufacture from raw material to finished article.
Man-made
Fibres
Hosiery and
Knitwear
Man-made fibres produced from cellulose were first made commercially
available in the United Kingdom in 1905, and much of the early development
of viscose rayon and acetate took place in Britain. Large quantities of chemicals
are consumed in their production, which is spread throughout the Midlands
and Lancashire, with outposts in other areas. Nine enterprises manufacture
man-made fibres in Britain; three of these, each with over 3,000 employees,
account for over 90 per cent of net output. In 1962 total output of man-made
fibres reached the record level of 627 million lb., made up of 336 million lb.
of staple fibre and 291 million lb. of filament yarn. Of the staple fibre,
69 million lb., and of the continuous filament, 114 million lb., were of fully
synthetic material. Total output of synthetic fibres was 25 per cent higher
than in 1961.
Since the second world war, output of a variety of the fully synthetic fibres,
derived predominantly from mineral rather than vegetable sources, has been
expanding at a rate previously unattained in a major chemical product.
Production of nylon, the first fully synthetic fibre, started in Britain in 1941;
large-scale production began at Pontypool, in Wales, in 1948, and new
factories were opened in 1955 an(^ i9^°- Another type of nylon (nylon 6) is
to be produced at Antrim, Northern Ireland. Nylon is used extensively in
the manufacture of clothing, fabrics and stockings, and has many industrial uses.
‘Terylene', a polyester fibre, was discovered in the United Kingdom during
the second world war. It is resistant to fading and is particularly suited to
blending with wool. Annual manufacturing capacity now exceeds 50 million
lb. Firms in several overseas countries undertake its manufacture under
licence.
A group of fibres of growing importance are known as acrylic or poly¬
acrylonitrile fibres: ‘Courtelle’ (a British discovery) and A-crilcin are examples.
Polypropylene fibre was introduced in 1962. These fibres are soft and warm and
have particular applications in the wool textile industry. Polyethylene has
been developed as a monofilament yarn for industrial uses. In 1962 Teklan ,
a new British modacrylic fibre, quick-drying and flameproof, was first
marketed.
Since the advent of rayon and the newer man-made fibres, British textile
manufacturers have been developing a number of ways of blending these
with natural fibres and with each other in order to produce fabrics with new
combinations of texture, colour and finish, and with moisture-absorbent,
hard-wearing, drip-dry and crease-resisting properties.
Exports of man-made fibre yarns and woven fabrics had a value of ^39'1
million in 1962. Australia (£4-2 million), Sweden (^3-6 million), South Africa
(£3.4 million), the Irish Republic, New Zealand and Switzerland were the
most important purchasers.
The hosiery and knitwear industry is predominantly one of small scale
enterprises. Over 60 per cent of the 1,100 firms in the industry employ fewer
than 50 workers, and only 4 enterprises have more than 2,000 employees. The

industry is widely distributed, with Scotland and the east Midlands as the
two most important centres. The proportion of fully synthetic fibres used
in the industry is growing: between 1951 and 1962 the amount increased
from 5-5 million lb. to 52-8 million lb. Exports of stockings and socks in
1962 were worth £2-5 million, and those of knitted underwear and outer¬
wear totalled j£8-9 million; the largest buyers were the United States and
Canada. Exports of knitted fabrics amounted to £4-1 million, mainly to
Commonwealth countries. Exports of knitted goods in 1962 (other than those
sent by parcel post) amounted to £15-9 million.
The Hosiery and Allied Trades Research Association, with laboratories at
Nottingham, undertakes collective research, and is particularly concerned
with the improvement of quality.
Linen has been made in Britain for more than a thousand years and it is
believed that the art of linen weaving was being practised during the seventh
century. Today it is an industry mainly of comparatively small firms, chiefly
in Northern Ireland (the greatest linen manufacturing region in the world),
with most of the remainder in Scotland. The principal raw material of the
industry is flax, which is almost wholly imported (the chief supplier is
Belgium), but considerable quantities of man-made fibres and cotton are also
used, and a certain amount of soft hemp and jute, particularly in Scotland.
Broadly speaking, the Northern Ireland industry concentrates on the lighter
types of fabrics, while in Scotland production is largely, but not exclusively,
of coarse linens and canvas. In the 1950s the industry’s investments in new
plant and machinery amounted to £12 million. The Northern Ireland
Government has given financial aid for re-equipment. Exports in 1962
included ^8-i million worth of linen fabrics and £3 million worth of flax
yarns and linen thread. Technical problems are investigated by the Research
Institute of the Linen Industry Research Association, formed in 1919.
Jute is manufactured on a large scale in Dundee—the centre of the world’s
oldest jute industry. About 40 per cent of jute yarn production is utilised in
the manufacture of carpets, cordage, ropes and other products. The balance
is woven into fabrics for a wide range of uses in the carpet, upholstery,
building and motor car industries, as well as its traditional use as a packaging
material. Production of jute cloth in 1962 came to about 77,000 tons. The
value of exports of jute fabrics in 1962 was £2-’] million. Research facilities
are concentrated at the laboratories of the British Jute Trade Research
Association. Over £14 million has been spent on a post-war modernisation
programme.
Sales of finished lace goods amounted to £17 million in 1962. The most
important lace product is from the warp knitting machines, with sales valued
at over £7 million. Direct exports of lace products were worth £4-4 million
in 1962.
In addition to the products mentioned specifically in this section, British
textile firms manufacture a wide range of other goods, including many special
yarns and fabrics, net, household textiles such as blankets, tablecloths and
curtains, and floor coverings other than carpets.
In 1962 manufacturers’ sales of tufted carpets, wool carpets and rugs in
Britain amounted to 57 million square yards. The carpets industry accounts
for about 5 per cent of the output of the textiles sector, and since 1951 the

average increase in production has been 2-3 per cent a year. Exports had a
value of £9-8 million, including processed imported oriental carpets worth
£1-65 million; Australia is the largest single market.
There are about 130 enterprises engaged in the manufacture of carpets,
though only 71 have over 25 employees and 9 firms each employing over
1,000 persons account for 58 per cent of net output of larger firms. In addition
to the manufacture of woven carpets such as Axminster and Wilton, there is
an expanding branch of the industry engaged in making tufted carpets, a form
of carpeting in which the pile, usually containing a high proportion of artificial
fibres, is inserted into a pre-woven backing. Axminster-type carpets account
for nearly half of exports. There are over 39,000 employees, and the principal
manufacturing centres include Kidderminster (in Worcestershire), Halifax
and Dewsbury (in the West Riding of Yorkshire), Durham (in north-east
England), Glasgow and Kilmarnock (in Scotland). Wool accounts for about
90 per cent of the raw materials used in the surface yarns in carpet manu¬
facture and more than two-thirds of the traditional carpets produced are of
a pure woollen or worsted pile.
There are over 659,000 employees in the clothing, leather and footwear
industries. Some 464,000 are in the clothing industry, 116,000 in the leather
footwear trade, 64,000 in leather, leather goods and fur manufacture, and
14,700 in the hats, caps and millinery trades. The aggregate value of their
exports in 1962 was £61-2 million.
The British clothing industry is the largest in Europe and total production
has increased by 25 per cent since 1958. Exports in 1962 were valued at
£21-3 million and, in addition, substantial quantities are sent by parcel post.
Although there are some large firms employing mass production methods
on an increasing scale, the typical firm is small. Unofficial estimates suggest
that five-sixths of the concerns in the industry employ fewer than 100 workers.
The principal manufacturing centres are London, Leeds and Manchester,
but several firms are also situated on industrial trading estates.
Fashion is important in the production of haute couture models and through¬
out the ready-to-wear industry. Fashion shows are arranged by the Apparel
and Fashion Industry’s Association and the Fashion House Group of
London.
Leather tanning is one of Britain’s oldest industries. In 1962, 19,000 tons of
sole and other heavy leather and 391 million square feet of upper, lining and
other light leathers were produced. Britain is the world’s leading exporter,
with exports in 1962 valued at ^18-3 million. The United States is the largest
single market (£4-1 million in 1962), followed by Canada (£1-8 million) and
the German Federal Republic (^1-7 million). Exports to the European
Economic Community countries amounted to £5-2 million.
Tanneries are situated in most parts of Britain, but there are important
concentrations in Lancashire, Cheshire, Yorkshire, the north Midlands and
the London area. Many different types of leather are produced, ranging
from the heavy types for industrial uses such as machinery belting and car
upholstery, to high quality leather for footwear and for leather goods, and to
gloving and clothing leather.
Research into tanning processes and the improvement of the quality of
finished leather is undertaken by the British Leather Manufacturers’ Research
Association, the foremost association of this type in the world.

The British footwear industry is the third largest in the world. In 1962
manufacturers’ sales of footwear totalled 179-5 million pairs. Exports of all
types had a value of ^12-5 million; the United States and Canada were the
largest markets.
Factories are located throughout Britain. Some areas concentrate on
production of particular types; for example, the Rossendale Valley region
of Lancashire on slippers, and Leicester and Norwich on women’s and
girls’ shoes. There are about 800 firms in the industry, producing foot¬
wear of all types. The British Boot, Shoe and Allied Trades Research
Association enjoys a world-wide reputation in all matters connected with
shoemaking.
The food, drink and tobacco industries employ about 860,000 persons in the
production of a great variety of goods. The value of their combined exports
in 1962 was ^214 million, of which exports of alcoholic and other beverages
accounted for ^92-2 million, sugar, sugar preparations and honey for £20
million, coffee, cocoa, tea and spices for ^11-5 million. Capital expenditure
on fixed assets amounted to £140-2 million in 1962.
The average weekly household consumption of bread per head of population
in Great Britain in 1962 was about 2f lb., about f lb. less than in 1954. In
England and Wales particularly, the small ‘family’ type of baker, producing
bread with some mechanical aids, is still numerous, but the trend towards
concentrating production in large mechanical bakeries has become more pro¬
nounced; at least two-thirds of the bread is made in these bakeries, which
specialise in sliced and wrapped loaves; 4 firms have a dominant position.
In the smaller bakeries production of cake and other flour confectionery is
usually allied to bread production. There are about 2,000 firms and 150,000
employees in the bread and flour confectionery industry; a further 540 firms
and 42,600 employees are employed in grain-milling.
Production of biscuits, of which there are over 100 manufacturers
with some 54,000 employees, is estimated to be about 90 per cent higher
than in the immediate pre-war period. Annual output has been well
over half a million tons in recent years. Weekly consumption of cakes and
biscuits per head in Britain was about I2j oz. in 1962. British biscuits
have gained a world-wide reputation, and despite the problem of import
restrictions in several overseas markets, exports in 1962 were valued at
£6-i million.
The chocolate and sugar confectionery industry, which has some 102,000
employees, is composed of a small number of very large manufacturers and
many hundreds of medium-sized and small manufacturers. Though there are
some 660 firms in the industry, about half the output is produced by 8 firms
with over 2,000 employees.
The main ingredients used by the industry are sugar, cocoa beans, glucose,
milk, nuts and fats. Production of chocolate and sugar confectionery was
660,000 tons in 1962. Consumption of chocolate and sugar confectionery in
the United Kingdom is far higher than in any other country, being equivalent
to about 8 oz. per head per week.
The value of exports in 1962 of cocoa preparations (including chocolate)
was £9-6 million and of sugar confectionery, £8-2 million. Canada, the United
States, the Netherlands and the German Federal Republic were the main
markets.

Fruit and vegetable products are manufactured in Britain by about 375
enterprises, including 11 with over 1,000 employees who account for 65 per
cent of net output. Among the products manufactured are jam, marmalade,
sauces and vinegar. The labour force numbers about 77,000.
The three largest manufacturers account for nearly two-thirds of total
output of jams and marmalade, which has fallen from 329,000 tons in 1949
to 212,000 tons in 1962. Strawberry, raspberry and blackcurrant jams are
the most popular. Exports of jams and marmalade in 1962 were valued at
about £2 million.
In 1962, 596,000 tons of canned vegetables were produced. The British
Navy was using canned foods in 1813, but rapid development in the industry
did not take place until after 1935. Processed peas (188,000 tons) and beans
in tomato sauce (207,000 tons) are the vegetables most preserved in cans.
In addition, output in 1962 included 103,000 tons of canned and bottled
fruit, and 248,000 tons of canned soup. Plums are the most important single
fruit used for canning, but the largest tonnage canned is fruit salad, mainly
from imported fruit.
The quick freezing of foods has been expanding rapidly in Britain since
1954. Some 79,800 tons of vegetables (17 per cent more than in 1961) and
1,300 tons of fruit were preserved by this method in 1962; peas account for
three-quarters of all quick-frozen vegetables.
There are some 980 enterprises, whose principal activities are: the curing
of bacon and ham, the canning and preserving of meat and fish, the manu¬
facture of sausages and pies or the preparation of extracts and pastes. The
labour force numbers over 79,000. Output in 1962 included 74,000 tons of
canned meat and meat products and 222,000 tons of bacon. There has been
a rapid expansion of frozen fish output, and some 58,000 tons were produced
in 1962; small quantities (8,600 tons in 1962) are also canned. Exports of fish
and fish preparations had a value of ^7'1 million in 1962, and meat products
were worth an additional £6 million.
The industries which manufacture beer, spirits, wines, cider and soft drinks
had a labour force of 165,000 in 1962, and exported products with a value
of £92-2 million.
Exports of whisky (almost all Scotch whisky) reached 30 million proof
gallons with a value of j^So-p million in 1962; over half went to the United
States (£43-4 million or 16-25 million proof gallons). Scotch whisky, which
makes up most of this total, was first distilled in the fifteenth century. It is
blended from 20 or more different types, some from malted barley and some
from other grains. Whisky requires several years to mature, and the 81-5
million proof gallons (a record) produced in 1962 will not be on sale for some
years. Stocks of whisky amount to about 327 million proof gallons, of which
one-third has been in stock for more than three years. Nearly three-quarters
of annual sales are to overseas buyers.
Production of gin in Britain has risen steadily since the early 1950s. The
main distillers are in London and one company accounts for about half
the total output. Although the larger manufacturers also own distilleries
abroad, exports (3-2 million proof gallons) had a value of £5-7 million in
1962.
There are 300 enterprises in the brewing and malting industry, with a labour
force of 101,000. In recent years there has been a strong tendency towards
INDUSTRY
321
the creation of larger brewery units, partly to secure wide distributive outlets
for the products of the large brewing groups, many of which market beer
throughout the country. Bottled beer consumption increased in recent years
to nearly two-fifths of total consumption, but has since dropped to about
one-third; draught beer, in which is included keg beer (about 5 per cent of
total output), accounts for the remainder, apart from a small output in
canned form. In 1962, 28 million bulk barrels of beer were produced and
consumers’ expenditure on beer amounted to £663 million. Exports in 1962
of all types of beer were 383,000 bulk barrels, worth £2-7 million. The
industry’s investment in fixed assets (including bottling equipment) is about
£16 million a year. Firms are experimenting with new methods, including
continuous brewing processes.
The main raw materials used in brewing are malt, hops and some sugar.
Malt is made almost entirely from home-grown barley. Some brewers make all
or part of their own malt, others purchase it from independent maltsters who
also supply distillers, vinegar brewers, and malt extract manufacturers.
British malt is used by brewers throughout the world, and exports in 1962
amounted to over 42,000 tons worth £2 million.
Soft Drinks The soft drinks industry has expanded markedly since 1954, although
demand in some years has been limited by weather conditions. Output in
1962 included 39-8 million gallons of concentrated liquid and 209 million
gallons of unconcentrated drinks. The post-war trend has been towards
increasing consumption of concentrated squashes, sales of which are eight
times greater than in 1939.
Though there has been some amalgamation in recent years, there are still
several hundred firms supplying regional markets. There are three very large
firms among the twenty producing widely advertised brands which are
marketed on a national scale. There is also some degree of specialisation by
firms in the production of various types, such as carbonated drinks, cola-based
drinks, squashes and cordials, tonic waters and ‘mixers’, and comminuted
drinks (in which the whole fruit is used).
Tobacco The tobacco industry manufactures almost all the cigarettes and other
tobacco goods sold in the country. In 1962 personal expenditure on these
goods amounted to £1,242 million (of which over two-thirds was tax revenue)
and, in addition, exports worth £16-9 million (over 90 per cent of which
were cigarettes) were shipped to a large number of overseas markets, of
which Singapore, Aden and the Sudan were the most important. The main
centres of production are in and around Bristol, Liverpool, London, Man¬
chester, Newcastle, Nottingham, Glasgow and Belfast. The two largest
manufacturing groups now account for about 90 per cent of output. The
industry has 47,500 employees.
The tobacco industry used over 280 million lb. of unmanufactured tobacco
in 1962 (about 12 per cent less than in 1961), all of which was imported.
The main sources are the United States, Rhodesia and Nyasaland, India and
Canada. Most of this tobacco goes to make cigarettes (nearly seven-eighths)
and pipe and cigarette tobaccos. Consumption of cigarettes showed a decline
of 4 per cent below the 1961 figure and that of tobacco and cigars a slight
rise. Of the tobacco consumed, 86 per cent was in the form of cigarettes, of
which filter-tipped brands now account for about one-quarter of output.
Total consumption of tobacco in 1962 fell back to the 1959 total of 266 million
lb. (of this, 1-9 million lb. was in the form of cigars and o-8 million lb.
was snuff).

This group comprises the manufacture of bricks, fireclay, refractory goods,
pottery, glass, cement, abrasives, asbestos and other building materials. The
industries have a combined labour force of 357,000, which includes 78,400
in the bricks, fireclay and refractory goods trades.
About 700 firms manufacture items such as bricks, roofing tiles, chimney
pots, fireclay ware and heat-resisting products including furnace and kiln
linings. Brickmaking, one of Britain’s oldest industries, was introduced by
the Romans, and manufacturing methods vary from traditional hand fabri¬
cation to highly mechanised systems. In 1962 about 7,300 million building
bricks were produced, 42 per cent of which were of the Fletton type, made
mainly in the Bedford and Peterborough areas. Refractory goods (firebricks,
silica bricks, magnesite bricks and chrome-magnesite bricks) are manufactured
mainly for home use. Exports of refractory construction materials in 1962
were worth £3-8 million.
The pottery industry is a long-established and complex industry, largely
located in the Stoke-on-Trent area of Staffordshire. Its raw materials are
indigenous, being mainly china clay, ball clay, and china stone from Devon
and Cornwall. It supplies nearly all home needs for domestic and industrial
pottery and its exports have recently been at the annual rate of about £20
million. Canada, the United States and Australia are important markets.
The largest section of the industry, about half, makes domestic pottery,
sub-divided into china, earthenware, stoneware, jet and Rockingham; the
other main divisions are glazed tiles, sanitary ware and electrical ware, but
other specialised industrial products such as acid-proof stoneware, porous
ceramics and laboratory porcelain are also manufactured. Among famous
makes of British pottery are Wedgwood, Spode, Royal Worcester, Royal
Doulton and Royal Crown Derby. In i960 the industry started production of
felspathic-type pottery under the name of English Translucent China.
The 350 firms in the industry employ about 69,000 people, of whom
some 39,000 are women. Since 1956 nearly ^12 million has been spent on
modernisation and re-equipment with new kilns, drying stoves and semi¬
automatic ‘making’ machinery.
Britain’s glass industry, the third largest in the world, has some 70,000
employees. The section of the industry devoted to the manufacture of plate
and sheet glass in their various forms is organised for quantity production.
Glass can now be supplied in sheets of great size and can be made almost
unbreakable. Its use for internal decoration and as a finish for internal and
external walls has greatly increased in recent years. Large quantities of safety
glass are produced for the motor industry. Other products include glass
bricks, tubular glass (produced on a large scale), mirrors, lamp and bulb
glass, scientific and medical glassware, glass fibres, and all types of glass
container (often made by fully automatic machinery). A traditional product
is hand-made lead crystal glassware of very high quality, much of which is
exported.
The advance of the industry is shown by the increase in direct exports of
glassware from a negligible level in 193^ a va^ue jC20'1 rnillion in 1962,
this total included j£io-2 million worth of plate and sheet glass which was
exported mainly to Australia, the United States and Canada.
Collective research is undertaken by the British Glass Industry Research
Association, and much research work is also carried on by the Department

A British firm has developed a revolutionary glass-making process for pro¬
ducing ‘float glass’ and in 1962 opened a £5 million ‘float tank’ at St. Helens.
Agreements have now been signed for the manufacture by licence of float
glass in the United States and Europe. Float glass exports in 1962 amounted
to 12 million sq. ft.
The cement industry of the United Kingdom is chiefly concerned with the
manufacture of Portland cement. Invented by Joseph Aspdin and patented
in 1824, this material and the methods of its production have been the subject
of continuous technical improvement and intensive research. The capacity
of the industry, which has some 17,700 employees, has increased substantially
since the war to meet the growing demands of the building industry. About
one-third of production comes from plants situated in the Dartford-Gravesend
district of Kent. Annual output, which reached 7-7 million tons in 1938 had
risen to 14 million tons in 1962. One group of companies is responsible for
about two-thirds of total output. In 1962 direct exports of cement, which
have been falling in value, were worth ^3-1 million (£5-3 million in 1961).
The paper, printing and publishing industries have a labour force of over
630,000 including 96,000 in the manufacture of paper and board, 71,000 in
the production of cardboard boxes and packing cases, 139,500 in the publishing
of newspapers and periodicals and 254,000 in other types of printing and
publishing. Fixed capital expenditure came to an aggregate £74-4 million
in 1962.
The manufacture of paper in Great Britain was not firmly established until
1678, but records show that some paper was produced as far back as the year
1492. Total production in 1962 of all types of paper and board amounted
to nearly 4 million tons, double the pre-war figure of 2 million tons but
below the i960 peak of 4-1 million tons. Of this, newsprint accounted for
655>00° tons, against 800,000 tons pre-war; since 1953 output of wrapping
and packaging paper and board has risen by nearly two-thirds, mainly as a
result of its growing use as packaging material. Exports of paper, board and
manufactured paper items were valued at £42-4 million in 1962. The bulk
of the export trade is to sterling area countries, mainly Australia, South
Africa and New Zealand.
Nearly three-quarters of the many different materials used by the industry
comes from abroad. The balance consists mainly of waste paper recovered
from domestic sources.
The industry comprises over 200 enterprises engaged in the manufacture
of paper and board, nearly 500 enterprises which make cardboard boxes,
cartons and packing cases and some 600 firms who manufacture miscellaneous
items such as wallpaper and paper bags. Considerable interests are held
abroad, including pulp and paper producing mills in the United States,
Canada and other parts of the Commonwealth and Europe.
The printing industry produces an immense range of goods from national
newspapers and periodicals to books, catalogues and greetings cards. The
industry includes many very small enterprises. Mergers in recent years have
led to the formation of large groups in the newspaper, magazine and book
publishing sections. Of the 630 enterprises in the printing and publishing of
newspapers and periodicals, about half have over 25 employees and 22 of

these over 1,000 employees; 4 large firms employ more than 7>500 persons.
General printing, publishing, engraving and bookbinding remains essentially
an industry of small firms with over 75 per cent of the 6,500 firms having
fewer than 25 employees.
Total sales of books in 1962 amounted to £81 million, of which some
^34 million worth were exported. Popularity of paper-backed books has
increased rapidly and the value of sales has increased by over 3°° Per cent
since 1953. According to official figures, exports of printed matter, manu¬
scripts and typescripts were valued at £37 million in 1962, including books
(^17-5 million), and newspapers and periodicals (^6-3 million); but since these
figures do not include parcel post shipments, exports are considerably higher.
The United States, Australia and South Africa are the most important
overseas markets. A shortage of skilled workers has led many firms to intro¬
duce the latest developments in high-speed printing equipment, including
electronic engraving machines and advanced processes of photographic
reproduction.
Other manufacturing industries include the timber and furniture group, with
about 294,000 employees, rubber manufacture, with 126,000 employees, and
a group of miscellaneous manufactures which together embrace some 186,000
employees.
The United Kingdom rubber manufacturing industry is the oldest in the
world, dating from 1819 when Hancock, the inventor of the first method of
processing raw rubber on a commercial scale, set up a factory in London.
He afterwards collaborated with Macintosh, the inventor of waterproof
garments, and it was another Scotsman, Dunlop, who in 1888 devised the
pneumatic tyre. At the present day, tyres and tubes represent more than
half the total output of the industry. More recently, British firms have
pioneered cellular rubber and latex foam products, and they also make a
great variety of other rubber manufactures, the most important being rubber
footwear, conveyor belting, cables, hose and thread.
The British industry is the third largest in the world, coming after those
of the United States and Russia. There are 470 firms located throughout the
country, and the industry has a labour force of 126,000. In 1962 their con¬
sumption of rubber totalled 327,000 tons, including 162,000 tons of natural
rubber, 128,000 tons of synthetic rubber and 36,000 tons of reclaimed rubber;
the proportion of synthetic rubber used is increasing. There are 14 tyre
manufacturers, including several subsidiaries of United States companies. In
1962 158,000 tons of rubber (natural and synthetic) were consumed for the
production of tyres and tyre products. Tyres and tubes exported were
valued at ^28-9 million; this figure excludes large indirect exports on vehicles.
Exports of all rubber manufactures in 1962 were worth £48-4 million, with
Denmark, Australia and Sweden as the main markets.
London is the largest centre for furniture manufacturing, but High Wycombe,
in Buckinghamshire, is an important centre for domestic furniture.
Deliveries of domestic furniture had a value of £126 million in 1962
and exports of furniture of wood and metal were worth £9-85 million. There
are some 2,400 enterprises engaged in the manufacture of wooden furniture
in Britain (including domestic, upholstered, office, school and other furniture)
with a total labour force of 102,000. Many firms are small and of the 600
larger enterprises, 8 with over 1,000 employees account for 25 per cent of
INDUSTRY 325
net output. In recent years there has been a tendency towards increased
concentration.
A Furniture Development Council was established in 1949; it undertakes
research, training and study in technical and artistic subjects and design,
provides a technical information service and publishes statistics.
Toys, Games
and Sports
Equipment
There are over 500 enterprises manufacturing toys and sports equipment in
Britain, though three large firms with over 1,500 employees account for
nearly a third of net output. The total number of persons employed is about
34,000. The British toy industry is today the largest in Europe; deliveries in
1962 were worth £39 million, and exports had a value of ^9-6 million.
Australia, the United States and Canada were the main overseas markets.
The industry estimates that current annual expenditure in Britain on toys
amounts to over ^5^ per child; current trends are towards increased pro¬
duction of small-scale precision models of vehicles and equipment and greater
use of plastics materials; interest in construction kits is also growing.

AGRICULTURE
Although Britain is a densely populated, industrialised country relying on
imports for half its food supply, agriculture remains one of its largest and
most important industries. It occupies nearly one million people, or just under
4 per cent of those in civil employment, provides about 4 per cent of the
gross national product, and uses 49 million of the 60 million acres of land.
Land used for farming is conventionally divided into improved land suitable
for cultivation (crops and grass) and rough grazing, nearly all of which is
hill or mountain land with a native herbage of coarse grasses, rushes, bracken,
heather or scrub trees. Rough grazing has a low potential output—usually
assessed at about one-sixth of that of agricultural land—but is valuable for
sheep. In England and Wales only about one-sixth of the 29-4 million acres
of farming land is classified as rough grazing. In Northern Ireland the propor¬
tion is about one-quarter of a total of 2-7 million acres but in Scotland it is
about three-quarters (12-4 million out of 16-7 million acres). In the United
Kingdom as a whole there are 30-7 million acres under crops and grass.
Improved land and rough grazing together represent 82 per cent of the land
area. The rest is mountain and forest, or put to urban and kindred uses.
The area available for farming is being gradually reduced to meet the needs
of housing and industry; however, the loss is outweighed by the increase in
output from what remains.
The soils of the country are extremely varied. Many of those in the west
and north, overlying hard rocks, are poor and thin. The lowlands and river
valleys are usually fertile, varying in texture from clay to sandy loam, silt
and peat. Clay soils everywhere necessitate under-drainage, and as all are
constantly leached by rainwater, lime has to be applied at regular intervals.
In hill country the area of improved land is often small, but is usually supple¬
mented by grazing on a comparatively large area of hill land.
For many centuries the bulk of land in Britain lay in estates ranging in size
from a few hundred acres upwards, comprising farms of varying sizes let to
tenants. At all times the tenanted holdings were interspersed with some owned
by the farmers who occupied them, and with some peasant or cottage holdings.
Social changes of the past half-century have completely changed the pattern
of rural life in England and Scotland. Estate duties have been a principal
factor in the breaking up of estates. Most surviving estates are still owned by
private individuals or family trusts, but the Crown, the Church Commissioners,
local authorities, the National Coal Board, and other corporate bodies hold
considerable areas. Of the farms sold, many have been bought by the tenants
already in occupation. About half the farms in Great Britain today are
owner-occupied.

Although the average size of all agricultural holdings in Britain is about
70 acres of crops and grass, many of them are small holdings which do not
provide a full livelihood for their occupiers. In England and Wales, for
instance, nearly half the 345,000 holdings are of this type, the occupiers
generally having another source of livelihood in addition to farming. Taking
full-time holdings only, the average size of holding in England and Wales
is about 115 acres of crops and grass. In Scotland the crops and grass area
of the 23,000 farms worked part-time average only 10 acres, but for the
31,000 full-time farms the average is 128 acres.
Scotland has two distinct farming zones: most of the good land lies in the
east and south of the country, while in the Highlands and Western Islands
agriculture is quite distinct from that of the rest of Britain, there being an
exceptionally high proportion of rough grazing to improved land. Numerous
small occupiers are grouped in scattered villages, each with a tiny area of
enclosed land and rights of grazing on an adjoining hill. The Highlands are
thus divided between a few large holdings and a great many very small crofts.
In Northern Ireland there are only a few large estates. Almost all the land
is divided into about 70,000 holdings varying from a few acres to 300-400
acres. Most of these holdings are occupied by the owner. Some 20,000 are
either re-let in conacre (seasonal lettings for crops or grazing) or owned by
people who do practically no farming. Of the remaining 50,000 farms, with
an average size of 40 acres of crops and grass, about half can be said to
provide a full-time occupation for the owner.
Most British farms produce a variety of products; the pattern varies from
farm to farm. In many districts the mosaic of farms is dominated by one type
and the bias towards one product or group of products is so marked that the
whole area takes on a distinctive character. In England the farms devoted
primarily to arable crops for sale are in the eastern part of the country, in
East Anglia, Kent, Lincolnshire, and the East Riding of Yorkshire. Potato
and vegetable growing on a substantial scale marks the farming of the Fens
(south Lincolnshire and Cambridgeshire), the alluvial areas around the
rivers Thames and Humber and the peaty lands in south Lancashire. Else¬
where, horticultural crops are widely dispersed amongst agricultural crops.
In Scotland, the rich lowlands of the east coast, the Lothians and a fringe of
land around the Moray Firth are also primarily arable.
Interspersed between these arable areas, and also in the Midlands and the
south-east of England, there are large tracts where, although much of the
land is kept under the plough, the rearing and fattening of cattle is an im¬
portant enterprise. In the south-west of Scotland dairying is extensively
practised, but most of the north-west is devoted to rearing sheep on rough
hill land. The parts of England bordering the Pennine hills and most of
Wales are also sheep-rearing areas, though a good deal of dairying, based on
purchased feedingstuffs, is also done there. Dairy farming is widely practised
throughout much of the rest of Britain. In Northern Ireland mixed farming
is practised, the most important products being milk, fat and store cattle,
pigs and eggs, with sheep and stock raising in the hill areas. Oats and barley
are widely grown, mainly for livestock feeding, and the only important cash
crop is potatoes, both ware and seed.
Traditionally, in England and Wales old grass is regarded as the property of
the landlord; many leases still specify the fields which may not be ploughed,
except under penalty. But the tenant is free to sow other fields to grass if he
328
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
wishes and to plough them out whenever he wishes; so two types of grass
came into existence—old or permanent grass, the property of the owner, and
temporary grass or ley, a rotational crop of the tenant, its lease of life de¬
pending on the system of farming. The ley farming system had its origin
in the use of grass in the cereal rotation to restore soil fertility and structure.
In Scotland, which has never had the same tradition, the tenant is free to
plough as he chooses, although in practice very high-lying fields are ploughed
with the main object of renewal of the grass. The area under temporary
grass has always been high.
The situation during the 1939-45 war called for a widespread ploughing
out of grass. Since the end of the war, in all parts of the United Kingdom
there has been a slow return to permanent grass; but not all of the gain in
tillage has been lost and there has been an increase of 2-8 million acres in
the area of temporary grass, so that the total arable area remains about
5 million acres more than it was pre-war. On the arable land of England and
Wales the old-style rotations have been abandoned, and a cropping system
has been adopted which allows a high proportion of cereals, sugar beet and
potatoes, with short or medium term leys. The western counties of England
and Wales show a heavy bias towards cereal crops with longer leys, and over
the country as a whole there has been a tendency for leys to lengthen with
improved management of grass. In Northern Ireland, while the greater
proportion of the grassland is under permanent grass, medium length leys
are a common feature. Scotland, with its choice of crops restricted by soil
and climate, has returned to its pre-war pattern of rotational cropping, in
which leys occupy more than half the arable ground. Thus, in England and
Wales nearly one-half of the 24 million acres of arable and grassland is under
permanent grass, about one-quarter under cereals and one-sixth under tem¬
porary grass; of the 4-3 million acres in Scotland, only just over one-fifth
is in grass seven years old or over, against about two-fifths in grass under
seven years old; while in Northern Ireland over a half is permanent grass
and about one-quarter temporary grass.

Farmers everywhere are exposed to the vagaries of the weather, of pests and
diseases, and of the market; but during the present generation much has
been done in Britain to mitigate the risks. In part this has been effected
through the advance of science, in part through self-help by farmers’
organisations, but in greatest measure by Government action. The role of
the Government, successively as financial supporter, as war-time controller,
and as guarantor and provider of technical and advisory services, is described
on pp. 336-47-
Between the two world wars British agriculture suffered a long depression
which reached its lowest point about 1930. Yet already the industry was
becoming organised: separate National Farmers’ Unions had been set up in
England and Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland to give farmers a collective
voice; breed societies had been established to watch over the interests of
stock breeders; young farmers’ clubs were becoming numerous; a chain
of research stations had been constituted; and a comprehensive system of
university, college and farm institute education was in being.
The extent to which agricultural activity had declined became more
apparent with the outbreak of war in 1939. Much land once in arable cultivation
had been allowed to revert to permanent grass. During the war 7 million
acres of the permanent grass were ploughed, the area under potatoes was
doubled, and that under wheat and barley nearly doubled. The total number

of cattle increased slightly, chiefly owing to larger dairy herds; sheep and
poultry stocks declined; and the number of pigs fell by more than half.
Since the end of the war, and particularly since the easing of the balance
of payments position permitted freer importation of feedingstuffs, the general
trend has been towards the building up of cattle and sheep stocks; the number
of pigs and poultry has also greatly increased (see Table 19).
The effect of these changes may be judged by reference to the total production
of the major agricultural commodities, shown in Table 20.
The general pattern since the end of the war shows a very large increase
in all the main crop products (except oats and potatoes), and in mutton and
330 BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
lamb, beef and milk. Compared with pre-war, the 1962-63 output of pigmeat
and of eggs had increased by about 75 and 100 per cent respectively, this
increase, and also the increase of 65 per cent in sales of milk off farms, being
partially attributable to heavier imports of feedingstuffs in recent years. It
was estimated that about 6-4 million tons of concentrates were imported in
1962-63, nearly 2| times the volume in 1952-53, and a further 1-9 million
tons were available as by-products of imported grain and oil-seeds.
In terms of a new index of agricultural net output (average of 1954-55 to
1956-57 — 100) introduced at the i960 annual review, the forecast for
1962-63 was 122, representing an increase of about 9 per cent in three years.
On the old index (pre-war average = 100) the forecast figure for 1962-63
was 186.
Food Supplies Since 1939 the population of the United Kingdom has increased by about
5-5 million, or slightly more than 10 per cent. Britain now produces about
half of its food requirements or two-thirds of all that can be grown in temper¬
ate climates. The percentages by weight of total supplies of the principal
foods provided by home production in relation to the pre-war average are
shown in Table 21.

Table 22 shows how, for selected items, total food supplies have changed
since before the second world war and since food rationing ended (in I954)-
It reflects certain well-known trends. In general, consumption of bulky
foods (carbohydrates), such as flour and potatoes, has been declining, while
that of high-protein foods, such as meat and eggs, has increased with greater
availability and rising living standards.
Crops The possibilities of wheat growing, which is mainly confined to England,
\Yhccit have been changed out of all recognition by the advent of new strong strawed
and heavy yielding varieties, mainly from the continent of Europe but some
home-bred. These permit the liberal use of fertilisers, and spring dressings
of nitrogen have become accepted practice. Crop yields of 2 tons per acre
are no longer unusual. About 3-6 million tons were harvested in 1962, the
largest crop yet, with yields averaging 32 cwt. per acre.

brewing.
The widespread use of combine harvesters has necessitated the installation
of drying and storage facilities on many farms. Such equipment is also used
on a co-operative basis or by contractors.
There are two distinct markets for barley—for malting and for feeding to
stock. Malting barley has in the past commanded a much higher price than
feeding grain, but the disparity has now decreased. New varieties have
greatly enlarged yields. Since 1956 the acreage under barley has risen by over
58 per cent and production has doubled.
There has been a decline of almost a half in the total area under oats since
1953, and particularly since i960; even in Scotland, where it is by far the
most extensively grown cereal, the area has decreased by over one-third.
No longer needed for horses, oats cannot compete in yield of grain with
modern barleys. The crop thrives on acid and high-lying soils and endures
damp harvests; and no other can equal it in the fodder value of the straw.
In England the turnip crop is giving way to kale and cabbage. The total
acreage of fodder crops (except kale) has, however, been declining steadily
since 1953 because in many cases farmers can provide winter feed more
economically by increased grass production and improved methods of con¬
servation. In Scotland the decline in turnips has been less rapid and the
acreage under this crop is now greater than in England. The area under
mangolds (grown almost entirely in England) has been falling sharply—by
30 per cent since 1958—while fodder beet is grown on only a small scale.
Rape retains a modest place as sheep fodder.
Beet is grown mainly in East Anglia and Lincolnshire where most of the beet
sugar factories are situated. The crop is grown under contract to the British
Sugar Corporation, which takes the entire output at guaranteed prices and
also provides technical advice and assistance. Yields per acre are increasing

and in 1962 a crop of 5-3 million tons was harvested, with a yield of 13-0 tons
per acre. Precision drilling is the usual method and more than half the crop
is mechanically harvested.
Early potatoes are grown in England and Wales in numerous, widely scattered
districts with favourable soils and climate. The crop is marketed during the
summer months and reaches the consumer within a fewT days of lifting.
Main crop varieties, which are normally stored before sale, are grown chiefly
in the Fen counties, Essex, Lincolnshire and Yorkshire. In Scotland early
potatoes are grown in coastal areas of Ayrshire and Wigtownshire, but a
substantial part of the industry is concerned with supplying seed potatoes
to English and foreign growers. In Northern Ireland both main crop and
seed potatoes are produced, and a large part of the crop is shipped to Great
Britain and abroad.
Cultivation and raising of the crop is almost entirely mechanical, picking
(and some setting) being done by hand.
Milk is much more valuable when sold on the liquid milk market than when
converted into cheese, butter or other milk products. In Great Britain milk
is produced primarily for liquid consumption, but in Northern Ireland the
greater part of the milk is used for manufactured products. Production and
liquid sales are now much greater than before the war. Sales promotion by
the industry is helping to maintain these higher liquid sales. The average
consumption per head is now about 5 pints per week.
Average yields per dairy cow are still rising steadily; in England and Wales
they have increased during the last decade by about 23 per cent and now
average about 790 gallons a year. Freedom from tuberculosis has reduced
herd wastage, and through the artificial insemination (AI) centres, operated
by the Milk Marketing Boards and other organisations, the influence of a
small number of high-potential bulls is widely disseminated. The Friesian
breed now dominates both AI centres and farms on which bulls are main¬
tained in England and Wales; the Ayrshire breed is still most in demand in
Scotland; and in Northern Ireland the Dairy Shorthorn still predominates
although Friesians are on the increase. Milk production has also been stimu¬
lated by advances in grassland management, intensive grazing techniques and
new methods of making high quality hay; new methods of conversion into
silage are being exploited. Most dairy farmers practise some degree of
intensive grass management, but hay of the traditional type remains the basic
winter feedingstuff; it is supplemented with purchased concentrates.
Clean dairy farming methods and hygienic standards for equipment and
buildings used in milk production are enforced by regulations. The Ministry
of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food’s Milk Service has a general responsibility
for enforcing the regulations and for advising farmers in England and Wales
on clean milk production. In Scotland these functions are performed by local
authorities but central supervision is exercised by the Scottish Home and
Health Department. In Northern Ireland all farmers producing milk for sale
must hold a Ministry of Agriculture licence.
A great number of specialised breeds of livestock have been developed over
the centuries in Britain. It has been found that they meet the needs of breeders
in most countries and substantial export sales are made to buyers seeking
to replenish and improve their herds with British animals. Exports of live¬
stock other than horses were valued at over £9-6 million in 1962 and exports
of horses at £7-9 million.

Although home production of beef is considerably greater than it was before
the war, imports are lower and consumption per head has not yet overtaken
the pre-war level. Taste is changing and the public no longer wants joints
from fully fattened beasts. The average age of slaughter is below two years
and systems of early beef production, such as that involving large daily
quantities of cereals and correspondingly little roughage, are being increasingly
adopted. In upland regions herds of pure-bred, nearly pure-bred, or cross¬
bred beef stock are kept on ‘natural’ lines, the cows calving in early spring
and grazing with their calves through the summer. Usually the calves are
sold at weaning to farmers with arable fodder and good grazing for fattening.
Nowadays much beef derives from the dairy herds, some females (usually
the first calf heifers) being mated to beef sires, the majority by AI. The
cross-bred calves make useful beef animals; so too do the pure-bred male
calves from Friesian, Shorthorn and some other types of herds. There is a
large and complex trade in store cattle, increased by young animals imported
from the Irish Republic, whose general movement is from the upland west
to grazing areas in the Midlands and arable areas of the east.
Britain has outstandingly good pastures for sheep. Moreover, veterinary
researches have provided vaccine and sera protection against nearly all the
epidemic diseases to which sheep are subject. More than thirty breeds and
innumerable crosses are to be found in Britain, each breed having originated
within a circumscribed area. The basic stocks are everywhere maintained by
local selection, but lowland flocks are continually reinforced by fresh blood
from the hills.
In the hills, and especially in the Highlands, winter conditions are usually
severe. Draft ewes and lambs are brought from the hill areas ever}" autumn
to swell the lowland flocks, usually in two stages: firstly, to farms at inter¬
mediate altitudes, where they are mated with rams of a larger and more
rapidly maturing breed; then, the cross-bred progeny pass on in due course
to the more genial lowland conditions and especially to the Midlands and the
south and east of England, where they become crossed again with Down
rams for fat lamb production. The hill breeds bring in hardiness and the
first-cross sires fecundity and early maturity.
Wool, at one time of relatively little value, is now of importance to the
sheep farmer; research into breeding for wool is being undertaken, notable
among Welsh flocks. But the prime purpose of British sheep farming today
is the production of fat lambs, in response to the change in the preference
of consumers away from mature sheep. Leys are largely relied on for fodder,
although in Scotland the turnip crop is still of considerable importance.
Pig production is a complex enterprise, owing to the varying uses to which
the carcase is put. In Britain the carcase has always been used in three different
ways: for curing as bacon, for sale in fresh condition as pork, and for sausages
or other processed forms. For the several trades, pigs of three different
weight ranges seem to be called for but leanness is desirable in all three.
Breeders, in the main, aim at the long type required by bacon curers, for
which there is a grading system based on weight, carcase measurements of
length and back-fat. The native Large White and the Landrace breeds
imported from Sweden yield carcases conforming closely to these require¬
ments. For the trade in pork and meat for processing, the Large White boar
is generally used.
Apart from type, breeders’ attention is now focused on utility qualities,
such as size and weight of litters, and on food consumed per pound of

providing basic data. This authority, set up under the Agriculture Act, 1957,
promotes improvements in the production of pigs and in the processing
and distribution of pigmeat.
Most farmers keep some poultry but a considerable number of the birds in
the country are kept on non-agricultural holdings, whether in backyards or
on a commercial scale. In the past 20 or 30 years specialist techniques have
been used increasingly and the industry has become more intensive. In
consequence, by 1962 nearly 40 per cent of laying birds on farms were in
flocks or 1,000 or more. With the rise in the poultry population and in the
yield of eggs per bird, the estimated production of eggs has reached double
the pre-war level and for several years nearly all eggs consumed in Britain
have been home-produced.
Within the industry the trend is towards specialisation in the breeding and
supply of stock and in the production of eggs and table poultry. The mass
production of special table chickens, or ‘broilers’, has now become a major
industry; it is estimated that about 150 million birds were produced in 1962.
Horticultural crops occupy only a tiny fraction of the cultivated land of the
country—less than 2.\ per cent of the area under crops and grass—but their
value in terms of output per acre is very high. The total value of horticultural
crops sold in 1962-63 is estimated at about ^165 million, compared with some
£308 million for farm crops. About 380,000 acres are under vegetables and
about 270,000 acres under fruit.
Market gardening has grown up around all the large centres of population,
and in the Lea Valley, near London, for example, some very large capital
investments have been made. It has also flourished in more rural areas with
favourable soil or climatic conditions—in Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire,
Hampshire and Kent, and in a concentration of smallholdings around
Evesham, in the Avon valley. Districts with mild climates, such as the
Penzance region of Cornwall, have been favoured for the production of selected
early crops. More recently, selected vegetable crops have been grown in increa¬
sing quantities by farmers as an alternative to potatoes: this applies particularly
to brassicas and to peas for canning, drying and quick-freezing.
Specialised horticultural holdings range from a few acres up to about
300 acres, and many have glasshouses, frames or forcing houses. Use of
fertilisers, particularly of an organic nature, is very heavy, and much of the
field work is mechanised. The larger holdings normally have specialised
packing sheds, with washing and grading machinery, and irrigation plants.
More and more growers, however, are coming together in co-operatives for
marketing their produce and many of these co-operatives provide grading
and packing facilities for members.
Britain has over 5,000 acres of glasshouses, more than half of the area
being used primarily for the cultivation of tomatoes, the main centres of which
are the Lea Valley in Essex and Hertfordshire, and the Worthing district
in Sussex. In the Lea Valley, on a narrow belt of gravel and brick earth,
about 700 acres are covered with glass. Total production of tomatoes in the
country is estimated at about 85,000 tons annually and the value of all glass¬
house crops at about ^29 million per year.
Hard fruits grow well in many parts of England and Wales, the chief risk
associated with their culture being late frosts. The main centres are in the
south, south-west and east of England, and Kent in particular. Production

of apples has been about equally divided between cooking and dessert varieties,
with Cox’s orange pippin heading the latter group, but production of cooking
apples is now declining. About 40,000 acres of varieties of cider apple are
grown mainly in Devon, Herefordshire and Somerset for the cider-making
industry. In Northern Ireland there are 8,000 acres of cooking apples—
Bramley Seedlings—mostly concentrated in County Armagh. Plums and soft
fruits are grown in many counties; concentrations of plums are found in
Kent and Worcestershire, of blackcurrants in Norfolk, Kent and Hereford,
of cherries in Kent and of strawberries in Norfolk, Kent and Hampshire.
Raspberries are exceptional in that of some 9,000 acres grown in Britain nearly
three-quarters are in Scotland, mainly in the Blairgowrie district of Perthshire
and in Angus.
Hop-growing for the brewing industry is confined to two main areas, in
Kent and Sussex and in Herefordshire and Worcestershire. Capital outlay
and cultivation costs are very high, but crops per acre average about 12 cwt.,
worth some ^360. The total annual value of the crop is about £7^ million.
Estimates of farm expenses and sales and the aggregate net income of agri¬
cultural producers are prepared annually by the agricultural departments.
The estimates show that Britain’s farming is based on livestock; fully
two-thirds of farmers’ income in Britain is derived from the sale of animals or
their products. The aggregate net income of farmers, after fluctuating around
j£35° million for some years, now exceeds £400 million. The annual cost of
Government support to the industry has ranged between approximately
.£240 million and £360 million.
Until the early 1950s labour costs were the largest item in farm expenses,
but in recent years feedingstuffs have accounted for the highest proportion.
Although the number of farm workers has dropped by nearly a third since
1949, the responsibilities of those remaining have correspondingly increased
and rising wages have caused labour costs to increase by about a quarter in
the same period.
Until 1958 rents tended to lag behind other costs. This was due partly to
the reluctance of landlords to put up the rents of satisfactory tenants, and
partly to the terms of reference given to arbitrators. These terms were
modified in the 1958 Agriculture Act and since 1959-60 average rents in
England and Wales have gone up by more than one-third and many farms
are being let by tender at highly competitive rates—often £5 to £6 per acre.
The capital required for land and buildings may be provided by the farmer,
if he is an owner-occupier, or by the landlord, if the farm is let to a tenant.
Each year ‘fixed capital’ totalling some £50 million is added to the value of
land and buildings. The bulk of the capital required to stock and run the
farms is provided by the occupiers. Bank advances are an increasingly
important source of outside capital, both fixed and working; about half the
total bank advances to agriculture are believed to be for short-term purposes.
Agricultural merchants are also an important source of short-term credit.
Accounts of some 2,200 farms in England and Wales, analysed by university
agricultural economists, show average valuations of occupiers’ capital ranging
from £20 to £50 per acre. In Scotland a similar sample of 850 accounts shows
a wide range in tenants’ capital per acre, from about £3 on hill sheep farms
with extensive rough grazings to between £50 and £60 per acre on lower
ground farms. In Northern Ireland, on the small intensive farms, occupiers’
capital ranges from £50 to £70 an acre. Dairy farms are usually more heavily

capitalised than other types of stock farms. On all types of farms machinery
is a heavy item; on dairy farms it is often £15 per acre and on arable farms
up to £20 per acre; even on stock rearing farms it may amount to £5 per acre.
The best single measure of mechanisation is perhaps the rate at which horses
have been replaced by tractors. In Great Britain the number of farm horses
fell from about 649,000 in 1939 to 54,000 in i960; tractor numbers rose from
117,000 in 1942 to 480,000 in 1962. In Northern Ireland farm horses declined
from 77,000 to less than 8,000 between 1940 and 1961 while tractors increased
from 1,260 to 31,700. Britain now has one of the heaviest tractor densities
in the world: one to every 36 acres of arable land. Power-take-off implements
now characterise arable farming; and some 56,000 combine harvesters were
in use in the 1962 harvest. A wide variety of machines for harvesting and
preservation of grass are employed. Milking machines are installed on all
except the smallest farms, many with mechanical means of handling milk.
About 90 per cent of the farms in Great Britain have an electricity supply
and accompanying equipment. There are nearly 300 farmers’ machinery
syndicates through which farmers have the use of expensive equipment
without tying up their own capital (see p. 341).
Research, development and testing of farm machinery are carried out at
the National Institute of Agricultural Engineering in Bedfordshire. This
Institute developed the first farm tractor in the world employing hydrostatic
transmission and also one of the most effective complete potato-harvesters
now in production.
The range of profits between individual farms is very wide, varying with the
size of farm, quality of land, and managerial ability of the occupier. Farms
do not lend themselves readily to exact classification by type, so even averages
must be treated with caution. Nearly all group averages of recent years,
however, show profits of £5 to £10 per acre: there is a marked tendency for
small farms to show higher profits per acre than large ones, owing principally
to the higher proportion of profit represented by personal work on the small
farm.
Profits per acre on arable farms have, with occasional seasonal exceptions,
been maintained at a higher level than on other types; dairy farming has
shown consistent but moderate profits, while those on stock-raising farms
have usually been low, except where arable sale crops are also grown or
pedigree stock is bred. The profitability of pedigree stock breeding can be
assumed from the rise in prices for breeding animals throughout the period.
During the last hundred years the Government has played an ever-increasing
part in British agriculture. Since the opening up of the great primary-
producing countries of the New World and the Antipodes in the latter part
of the nineteenth century, producers of food had been at a disadvantage
because supplies tended to exceed effective demand. By the beginning of the
1930s the need for some form of State assistance to agriculture had become
pressing; during the following decade and subsequently, the main object of
the Government’s agricultural policy was to find methods of supporting
domestic agriculture without prejudice to Britain’s position as a world trading
nation; thus during the 1930s the Government initiated various forms of
protection and financial assistance for agriculture.
During the second world war and the immediate post-war years, agri¬
cultural production was closely controlled by the State, with County War
AGRICULTURE, FISHERIES AND FORESTRY
337
Agricultural Executive Committees, composed of landowners, farmers and
farm workers, acting as the Government’s local agents. To ensure a reasonable
standard of living for farmers and farm workers, while at the same time
keeping the cost of living steady, most of the basic farm products were
purchased at fixed prices on Government account and sold at controlled
prices, often below the cost of procurement; the difference in price was
borne by public funds. This practice continued as long as rationing lasted.
Post-war Policy Government policy today is founded on the Agriculture Act of 1947. The
main objective, as set out in Section 1 of the Act, continues to be ‘a stable
and efficient agricultural industry capable of producing such part of the
nation’s food and other agricultural produce as in the national interest it is
desirable to produce in the United Kingdom, and of producing it at minimum
prices consistent with proper remuneration and living conditions for farmers
and workers in agriculture and an adequate return on capital invested in
the industry’. To this end, the Government is empowered to provide, for
the main agricultural products, guaranteed prices determined in the light of
annual reviews (see p. 338).
Post-war policy falls broadly into two periods, with the dividing line about
1954. During the first, the chief aim was to encourage expansion and a return
to something like the traditional pattern of British farming. ‘Production
objectives’ were set for each of the main commodities, as they had been
during the war, though the Government gradually ceased to direct farmers
what to grow. By means of additions to the prices fixed at annual reviews,
^40 million per annum were injected into farm incomes to provide additional
working capital for expansion. The Hill Farming Act of 1946 offered grants
for the rehabilitation of hill farms and, by encouraging investment in fixed
equipment, set the pattern for later legislation.
As world supplies of food and Britain’s own agricultural production and
trading position improved, the Government gradually restored to private
business both the importing of food and domestic trading in food. Since the
ending of the period of scarcity, policy objectives have changed: stress has
been laid on more economic production of food of the kinds and qualities
demanded by the market, rather than on indiscriminate expansion of pro¬
duction. By 1957 the immediate objective of a 60 per cent increase in
production had been achieved, and attention was turned to long-term
measures. The Agriculture Act of that year assured farmers that the prices
guaranteed under the Act of 1947 would not be steeply reduced, and at the
same time provided grants towards the cost of bringing fixed equipment up
to date.
The functions of Government in relation to agriculture are mostly exercised
by the agricultural ministers, that is to say, for England and Wales the Minister
of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, for Scotland the Secretary of State for
Scotland, and for Northern Ireland the Home Secretary, who is the minister
responsible for United Kingdom aspects of Northern Ireland agriculture,
local aspects being the responsibility of the Northern Ireland Minister of
Agriculture. The agricultural ministers are assisted by a number of advisory
committees composed of general agriculturists and specialists.
The headquarters of the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food is
divided functionally, each division being responsible for a particular subject
or service. Its relations with individual farmers are conducted mainly through
its local offices, grouped in England in regions, each administered by a

regional controller working in close collaboration with the regional heads of
the technical services. Local offices in Wales are grouped under a Welsh
Secretary, with similar functions and with special responsibility for Welsh
affairs. County Agricultural Executive Committees have a number of duties,
including those of promoting technical development and advising the minister
on local aspects of policy.
In Scotland most of the agricultural functions of the Secretary of State are
discharged through the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries, which has
its headquarters in Edinburgh, with the help and advice of n Agricultural
Executive Committees.
The Secretary of State also appoints the members of the Crofters Com¬
mission, which has powers to deal with the unique and difficult circumstances
of crofting in the Highlands and Islands, and the Red Deer Commission,
which deals with the conservation and control of red deer.
In England and Wales two councils, the Agricultural Advisory Council
and the Horticultural Advisory Council, advise the Minister on the problems
of the industry that require research and on the dissemination of research
results to working farmers. In Scotland this function is exercised by the
Agricultural Improvement Council.
The Northern Ireland Ministry of Agriculture is responsible for imple¬
menting agricultural policy inaugurated by the Northern Ireland Government.
It is organised on similar lines to the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and
Food, for which it acts as agent in the administration in Northern Ireland
of United Kingdom agricultural schemes. Its administrative headquarters are
in Belfast and each of the six counties has an Agricultural Executive Officer.
In February each year, in accordance with the Act of i947> agricultural
ministers review the economic condition and prospects of the industry.
Between annual reviews, a special review may be held if the ministers consider
it warranted, but this has seldom been necessary. In holding reviews, the
ministers are required to consult with representatives of agricultural pro¬
ducers—in practice, the three farmers’ unions in the United Kingdom. The
ministers consider such factors as production trends and market requirements,
world market prospects, the cost of subsidies, the trend of profits in the
industry as a whole, the increasing efficiency of the industry and changes in
production costs, trading relations (especially with the Commonwealth) and
the national economic situation. In the light of their conclusions, they
determine guaranteed prices for fat cattle, fat sheep, fat pigs, eggs, wool,
milk, cereals, potatoes and sugar beet. These guarantees apply to livestock
and livestock products for the ensuing twelve months, and to crops to be
harvested in the current year. Various grants in aid of particular kinds of
production or farming practice (known as ‘production grants’) are also
considered. Any changes in ‘relevant’ production grants (broadly, those
payable to occupiers rather than landowners) are taken into account. The
Government’s conclusions and its decisions on changes in guaranteed prices
and relevant production grants are published as a White Paper.
The long-term assurances provided for in the 1957 -^ct require the total
value of the guaranteed prices and relevant production grants in any year to be
maintained at not less than 97^ per cent of their value in the preceding year,
after allowing for changes in costs. In addition, the guaranteed price (adjusted
for any change in the basis of the guarantee) for each commodity must be
not less than 96 per cent of that of the previous year. For livestock and live¬
stock products—where farmers’ decisions need time to take effect—there is
Price
Guarantees
AGRICULTURE, FISHERIES AND FORESTRY 339
a further provision that reductions in the guaranteed price for any product
must not total more than 9 per cent in any period of three years. The cost
of Government support to the industry in 1962-63 was ^321 million but
the estimated cost of support for 1963-64 shows an increase to £364 million,
the highest total to date.
The Government is considering methods of bringing the Exchequer’s
commitments under greater control while adhering to the principles of the
Acts of 1947 and 1957. The Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food
stated in May 1963 that the Government intended to secure greater stability
for cereals and meat by a system of controls of imports or import prices,
combined with the extension of the standard quantity concept (see below)
to these commodities. In working out the proper balance between home¬
grown and imported food, the Government will start from broadly the
present level of supplies, and the intention is that the arrangements should
provide full opportunities for home farmers to secure a proper share of the
growth of demand for food in Britain.
The general policy of the Government is to use methods of agricultural
support that allow the ordinary channels of trade to flow freely. The form of
guarantee most generally used is the deficiency payment, which means that
the Government makes payments to producers, related to the differences
between the average market price realised and the guaranteed price, for
output eligible for the guarantee.
The deficiency payments schemes for cereals and fatstock are administered
directly by the agricultural departments. Payments for wheat and rye are
made on the quantity of millable grain or, in the case of wheat, potentially
millable grain sold and delivered by the grower. For barley and oats, much
of which is consumed on farms, payments are made on the acreage grown.
New arrangements, first introduced for the 1961-62 season, provided growers
with an incentive to hold barley until later in the season. Deficiency payments
for fatstock are made weekly to individual producers on certified sales on a
liveweight or deadweight basis. The weekly standard prices for fat cattle and
fat sheep vary on a seasonal scale; for pigs there is no seasonal scale but the
weekly prices are adjusted for changes in feed costs and, under a flexible
guarantee arrangement designed to stabilise pigmeat production, adjustments
may also be made quarterly by reference to a forecast of the number of pigs
likely to receive the guarantee payment during a period of 12 months. In
Northern Ireland guarantee payments are administered through the prices
paid to producers by the Pig Marketing Board.
For most of the remaining commodities the Government operates the
guarantee through the appropriate marketing board, which takes account of
any payments from or to the Government in deciding what to pay producers
for their produce. In the case of milk there are five such boards, and the full
guaranteed price is paid only on a ‘standard quantity’ which relates to the
volume of liquid milk sales plus a substantial reserve. Milk produced in
excess of the standard quantity is sold for manufacturing considerably below
the full guaranteed price. The retail price of liquid milk is determined by
the Government so as to cover the full cost of the guarantee and, taking one
year with another, there is no Exchequer subsidy. For eggs, a subsidy is paid
to the British Egg Marketing Board on all first quality eggs sold to the board
through packing stations. So far as potatoes are concerned, a deficiency
payment is made in years in which the average British growers’ price for
potatoes for human consumption (excluding new potatoes) is less than the

guaranteed price. Payment is made to the Potato Marketing Board (see p. 345)
for the benefit of growers in Great Britain and to the Ministry of Agriculture,
Northern Ireland, for the benefit of growers there.
For wool a fixed price is guaranteed to the British Wool Marketing Board
for every pound of fleece wool it buys from producers. This enables it to
fix in advance a schedule of producers’ prices, based on types and quality,
after making allowance for its marketing costs.
Under the Sugar Act, 1956, and the Agriculture Act, 1957, the British
Sugar Corporation contracts to buy the whole of the sugar beet crop produced
from a specified acreage (at present 408,400 acres) at a scale of fixed prices,
determined as a result of the annual review and related to sugar content.
Refined sugar produced by the corporation is sold, under market-sharing
agreements with the refiners, at a price based on the world price.
The Sugar Board buys Commonwealth sugar under the Commonwealth
Sugar Agreement and sells it commercially. The deficits or surpluses which
result from the transactions of both the corporation and the board are
ultimately reflected in the board’s accounts. When these accounts show a
deficit a levy is charged on all sugar, imported or home-produced, entering
the United Kingdom market, including the sugar content of composite sugar
imports, and when there is a surplus a distribution payment is made corre¬
spondingly, so that taking one year with another the board balances its account.
The following are the main grants and subsidies which are ‘relevant production
grants’ for the purposes of the Agriculture Act, 1957, and the annual review.
Schemes under the Agriculture (Fertilisers) Act, 1952, provide grants to
assist farmers in the purchase of nitrogenous and phosphatic fertilisers.
Farmers can also obtain a refund of more than half their costs of liming
the land to improve soil fertility.
Ploughing grants are available for land that has been continuously under
grass for not less than three years, to encourage the regular ploughing up
and extended use of leys. Schemes for winter-keep grants (in hill and upland
areas) and grassland renovation grants were introduced in the Agriculture
(Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1963.
Grants amounting to about half the cost of approved projects, up to a maxi¬
mum of £250 a farm, are available under the Agriculture (Silo Subsidies) Act,
1956, for constructing and improving silos for conserving grass and fodder.
To stimulate the breeding and rearing of calves suitable for beef production,
a subsidy is paid to the rearer of suitable calves at the rate of £9 5s. a head
for steers and .£7 10s. a head for heifers.
Powers for a subsidised scheme, encouraging the establishment on hill and
upland farms of regular breeding herds for the production of store cattle
for sale, have been provided by the Agriculture (Miscellaneous Provisions)
Act, 1963.
To establish on a firm economic basis small farm businesses whose main
handicap is lack of working capital, grants are offered to small farmers who
carry out improvement plans lasting at least three years which are approved
by the agricultural departments. The limit is £1,000 for any one business.
The principal mammals and birds in Great Britain harmful to farming are
rabbits, wood pigeons, rats, mice, moles and, in the north, carrion crows.
Occupiers are responsible for dealing with pests on their land and for seeing
that they do not spread to neighbouring properties. To encourage co-ordinated

action, the Government pays a grant of half the expenditure incurred by
rabbit clearance societies in the systematic destruction of rabbits and wood
pigeons; over 800 rabbit clearance societies have been registered in Great
Britain. A similar grant is paid for the control of coypu, which have been
spreading in East Anglia. Contributions are paid to fox destruction societies
to encourage organised control of foxes in open country where there is no
hunting.
In addition there are several types of grants for long-term improvements
which are not ‘relevant production grants’. Among them are the following:
Under the Agriculture Act, 1957, grants are available to the owners and
occupiers of agricultural land towards the cost of improving certain kinds
of fixed equipment, including farm buildings, roads and fences, and the
supply of electricity. The rate of grant is one-third of the cost. Grants are
also available towards the incidental costs of amalgamating uneconomic hold¬
ings. Some 200,000 schemes have been approved and, taking into account a
further £35 million made available under the 1963 Act, bring the total
Exchequer contribution to £90 million.
Powers for a subsidised scheme, to help maintain the foundation flocks of
hardy hill sheep, were provided by the Agriculture (Miscellaneous Provisions)
Act, 1963.
Under the Horticulture Act, i960, grants are available to horticulturists, to
the landlords of land used for horticulture and, in some cases, to horticultural
marketing co-operatives. The range of improvements towards the cost of
which grants of one-third may be made includes plant and equipment
designed to improve the storage or preparation of produce for the
market.
The State contributes towards the cost of land drainage and water supply.
In England and Wales, for example, grants for farm drainage may be up to
50 per cent of the approved cost. Farm water supply grants are at the rate of
25 per cent of the approved cost where the connection is to a public main,
and 40 per cent where a private source is utilised. Grants of up to 50 per cent
are available in Scotland and Northern Ireland for farm drainage and towards
the cost of installing and improving farm water supplies. Separate legislation
provides grants for these services in Northern Ireland.
One-third capital grants are made under the Agriculture (Miscellaneous
Provisions) Act, 1963, towards expenditure incurred by landowners or
syndicates of farmers in erecting buildings to house machinery or grain
drying and storage facilities for use by farmers’ machinery syndicates (see
P- 336).
Horticultural produce, because it is perishable and is liable to great variations
in quantity and quality from season to season, does not lend itself to a system
of guaranteed prices. Instead, horticulture enjoys through import duties a
measure of protection comparable to that afforded to agriculture by the
guarantee system. Where appropriate, different tariffs on horticultural produce
apply at different times of the year so as to allow imports to enter more
freely at times when they do not compete with the home crop. Certain of
the production grants are available to growers on the same terms as to
farmers.

It is an integral part of the Government’s planning policy (which is adminis¬
tered in England and Wales by the Ministry of Housing and Local Govern¬
ment, and in Scotland by the Scottish Development Department) that the
better agricultural land should not be taken for other use if there is less
valuable land that would serve the purpose. The Ministry of Agriculture,
Fisheries and Food assists in carrying out this policy in England and Wales by
providing expert advice to planning authorities and other departments on the
implications, from the standpoint of the public agricultural interest, of all
substantial proposals to take agricultural land for other purposes. Appropriate
arrangements exist for the Ministry to be consulted about such proposals. In
Scotland similar arrangements exist for the Department of Agriculture and
Fisheries to give advice.
The Government has never pursued a general policy of making credit
available to agriculture on easy terms. Nevertheless, a number of facilities
for specific purposes enjoy government encouragement and support.
In England and Wales finance for the purchase or improvement of agri¬
cultural property is available from the Agricultural Mortgage Corporation
Ltd. and takes the form of a loan on the security of a first mortgage on freehold
agricultural land and buildings or of an improvement loan against the security
of a terminable rent charge created on the land improved. The corporation’s
funds are derived mainly from public issues of stock, but it receives a measure
of government support. In Scotland, loans for agricultural purposes secured on
agricultural land in Scotland are granted by the Scottish Agricultural Securities
Corporation Ltd.; this corporation also receives support from the Government.
Improvement loans for carrying out improvements to agricultural land and
buildings are also available to landowners from the Lands Improvement
Company, whose funds are provided privately. The amount of such loans is
charged on the land and buildings in the form of a terminable rent charge.
Improvement loans require the sanction of the agricultural ministers.
In Northern Ireland loans are available to farmers from the Agricultural
Loans Fund, administered by the Ministry of Agriculture and financed out
of public funds. The bulk of the loans issued are short-term for agricultural
machinery, but loans for other purposes are for medium terms, usually up to
ten years and occasionally for longer periods.
Since 1892 county councils and county borough councils in England and
Wales have had powers to provide smallholdings. Legislation imposes on
county councils an obligation to provide smallholdings and enables the
Minister of Agriculture to contribute towards their losses. The aim was at
first to foster a peasant economy, but later to provide holdings for ex-Service-
men of the 1914-18 war, and then for the unemployed. Now, under the
Agriculture Act, 1947, the object is to give opportunities for persons with
agricultural experience, particularly agricultural workers, to become farmers
on their own account. In England and Wales, about 16,000 smallholdings
are provided by local authorities and about 1,300 by the Ministry. Of the
smallholdings provided by the Ministry, approximately 1,000, situated on
18 different estates, are managed by the Land Settlement Association Limited,
which was originally formed in 1934 for the purpose of developing small¬
holdings for unemployed men from industrial areas. The association provides
centrally on each estate various services for the tenants’ use, including the
supply of agricultural stores and requisites, the operation of a machinery
pool, and facilities for the packing and marketing of produce.

capital to tenants of statutory smallholdings. In this way they can be helped
to obtain livestock, machinery, implements and other necessary items;
tenants must, however, have available at least 25 per cent of the capital
required.
Land settlement in Scotland has always been carried out by the central
Government, which now owns and maintains about 430,000 acres of land
settlement estates, with some 4,000 holdings, mainly in the crofting counties.
In the seven Scottish counties known as crofting counties—Argyll, Caithness,
Inverness, Orkney, Ross and Cromarty, Sutherland, and Shetland—much
of the land is farmed by crofters, tenant farmers whose holdings are generally
either rented at a cost of not more than £50 a year or have an area not exceeding
75 acres.
In these counties there are about 20,000 crofts, which produce about
one-quarter of the total agricultural output of the area. The special problems
of the crofting counties which had for some time been suffering from a
declining population and falling agricultural production, led to the setting
up, in 1955, of a Crofters Commission whose functions are to reorganise,
develop and regulate crofting in the crofting counties, to promote the interests
of crofters and to keep under review matters relating to crofting. The com¬
mission’s powers, embodied in the Crofters (Scotland) Acts of 1955 and 1961,
include that of carrying out reorganisation schemes in ‘townships’ (crofting
communities) if a majority of the crofters agree, by reallocating the land in
a way which, in the commission’s opinion, would lead to the proper and
efficient use of the land and the general benefit of the township. The com¬
mission has also powers over the letting and sub-letting of crofts and it is
responsible for approving regulations governing the use of common grazings.
It acts as agent for the Secretary of State for Scotland in the administration
of schemes of loans and grants for the development of agricultural production
on crofts, and collaborates with other bodies in carrying out measures for
economic development and social improvement in crofting areas.
Land drainage in England and Wales is administered by 32 river authorities,
two catchment and 400 internal drainage boards. Each river authority area
comprises a major river system. They cover the whole of England and
Wales, apart from the London area. There are no comparable authorities in
Scotland, where drainage is the responsibility of owners and occupiers of land.
River authorities have powers to maintain and improve watercourses scheduled
as main rivers. Their work is concerned with the improvement of land drainage
by increasing the capacity of rivers and erecting pumping stations, the
prevention of inland flooding—both urban and agricultural—and the erection
of defences to protect low-lying areas from coastal flooding. River authorities
also have powers relating to freshwater fisheries and river pollution.
Internal drainage boards are concerned with very much smaller areas and
their work is chiefly in low-lying agricultural areas. Their main function is
to keep the land drained in their area by improving the main drains and,
where necessary, by pumping from low-lying land.
The authorities derive their income directly or indirectly from rate-payers.
The Government pays grants towards the cost of the improvement schemes
carried out by both types of organisation. Grants to river authorities vary
from 20 per cent to 80 per cent according to the financial position of the
authority. Internal drainage boards receive grants at a flat rate of 50 per cent.

BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
The gross capital expenditure of drainage authorities on new and improved
works is now nearly £8 million a year. Government grants, including grants
towards the repayment of loans raised in previous years, amount to nearly
£5 million. Drainage authorities’ expenditure on maintenance is estimated
at over £2% million a year and is rising steadily.
The Land Drainage Act, 1961, extended the powers of river boards to
deal with arterial watercourses. The Act also improved the administrative
provisions of the Land Drainage Act, i93°> an^ extended the land drainage
powers of local authorities.
In Northern Ireland the Ministry of Agriculture is the drainage authority
in respect of determined main watercourses, with the exception of the Erne
and Lower Bann which are the responsibility of the Ministry of Finance.
The cost is met by the Exchequer in the first place, offset by contributions
from the county and county borough councils. Joint land improvement
schemes on smaller watercourses may be promoted by the riparian owners
and receive Government assistance. Urban drainage schemes, towards which
an Exchequer grant is available, can be promoted by local sanitary authorities.
Responsibility for the work of the National Stud was transferred from the
Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food to the Horserace Betting Levy
Board in April 1963. The purpose of the stud is to maintain a high standard
of breeding for thoroughbred racehorses in England.
In Great Britain about half, and in Northern Ireland all farms are owner-
occupied. The traditional form of tenancy in England and Wales runs from
year to year; in Scotland leases for terms of 10 to 14 years are more common.
The tenancy agreement may be either written or verbal and may (but need
not) include provisions about such matters as rights of cropping, liability for
repair and maintenance, and compensation for tenant’s improvements.
In order to protect the respective interests of landlords and tenants and to
eliminate uncertainty as to their rights and liabilities, a code of landlord and
tenant relationships has been written into legislation. The Agriculture Acts
of 1947 and, for Scotland, 1948, lay down the basic rules of good estate
management and good husbandry for owners and occupiers respectively.
The Agricultural Holdings Acts of 1948 and 1949 contain more detailed
provisions, some of which apply to all tenancy agreements (i.e. the parties
may not contract out of them) and some of which apply only in the absence
of specific provision in the tenancy agreement.
Among the compulsory provisions are those relating to security of tenure.
The Acts provide for any tenancy of agricultural land, with the exception
of certain short-term lettings to which exemption can be given by the Minister
or Secretary of State, to continue in force from year to year until determined
by a valid notice to quit. With certain exceptions, such as where the notice
to quit is given on account of a breach of contract by the tenant (for instance,
failure to pay rent or carry out repairs), the tenant can contest it by serving
a counter-notice; the notice to quit then becomes inoperative unless the
landlord can satisfy an independent body (in England and Wales the Agri¬
cultural Land Tribunal and in Scotland the Scottish Land Court) that his
claim for possession is in the interests of sound estate management or good
husbandry or that the land is required for certain purposes specified in the Acts.
The Acts lay down a code of compensation to which the tenant is entitled
on termination of the tenancy. Compensation is normally payable both for
disturbance (between one and two years’ rent) and for improvements which

the tenant has carried out during the tenancy. The landlord is normally
entitled to counter-claim for dilapidations, and machinery is provided for
the settlement of claims by arbitration in default of agreement between the
parties. Rent is a matter for negotiation between landlord and tenant and
may be varied by agreement at any time or, failing agreement, by arbitration
at intervals of not less than three years in England and Wales and five years
in Scotland. A landlord is entitled to claim additional rent for improvements
carried out at his expense. The Acts also forbid provisions in tenancy agree¬
ments which would unduly restrict the tenant’s farming operations.
Agricultural products are now marketed mainly through private trade channels
such as corn merchants, livestock auctions and markets, and bacon factories;
or through producers’ co-operative organisations. For certain commodities,
however, marketing arrangements are influenced by boards operating under
the Agricultural Marketing Act, 1958 (which consolidated earlier legislation).
These marketing boards are producers’ organisations with statutory powers
to regulate the marketing of particular products. The schemes under which
they are constituted and operate must be approved by Parliament and
confirmed by a poll of the producers. Most of the members of the board are
elected by the producers but a minority are appointed by the minister or
ministers concerned. Further safeguards serve to protect consumers and other
interests affected by schemes and the public interest generally.
Marketing boards fall into two broad categories: first, those which have
powers to trade as the first selling agency for all producers not specially
exempted or, alternatively, to exercise a comparable influence by controlling
all contracts between producers and first buyers; and secondly, boards
which maintain only a broad control over marketing conditions leaving
producers free otherwise to deal individually with buyers. The boards for
eggs> hops, milk and wool fall into the first category and those for potatoes
and tomatoes and cucumbers into the second.
A Horticultural Marketing Council representing all those concerned in
the marketing of horticultural produce was set up in May i960 under the
Horticulture Act, i960. The task of the Council was to improve marketing
and distribution and develop trade in horticultural produce. Lack of support
by the organisations representing growers, wholesalers and retailers for a
scheme to raise the necessary revenue for the Council, led to its dissolution
in March 1963- A Covent Garden Market Act, iq6i, authorised the setting
up of a Covent Garden Market Authority, which has powers to reorganise
and modernise the largest of London s five horticultural wholesale markets.
Under the Agriculture (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1963, the Government
is providing £1^ million over a period of three years for grants towards the
cost of research and development in the marketing of agricultural and
horticultural produce; the industry will have to make available a similar sum
from its own resources.
The Government makes certain relatively small grants towards the cost
of setting up or improving the efficiency of horticultural producers’ marketing
co-operatives.
CONTROL OF
DISEASES AND
PESTS
Animals
The day-to-day work of treating animal disease is the responsibility of the
veterinary profession, of which there are over 6,000 members. The State
veterinary service, which was inaugurated in 1865, deals with situations beyond
the control of the individual practitioner. The service for the whole of Great
>^6 BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Britain is controlled from London, where the Ministry’s Animal Health
Division is manned day and night to deal promptly with outbreaks of infectious
disease. Northern Ireland has its own State veterinary service.
Britain has now been free for many years from eight serious animal diseases
including rinderpest, sheep scab, glanders and rabies.1 Northern Ireland, in
addition, is free from from foot and mouth disease, fowl pest and swine fever.
On ist October, i960, the whole of Great Britain became an attested area,
virtually free from bovine tuberculosis and Northern Ireland became so in
November i960. Thus in a space of ten years bovine tuberculosis in the
United Kingdom had been reduced to a point where it was no longer a
national problem. Any cattle reacting to the tuberculin test are slaughtered
and compensation is paid to the owner. Strict movement and isolation controls
are applied to all imported cattle not of fully attested status.
To supplement the work of private veterinary surgeons and practitioners
in England and Wales, a Government-operated Veterinary Investigation
Service carries out investigations requiring specialised knowledge or facilities
beyond the range of the general practitioner. In Scotland this is not a Govern¬
ment service but is linked with agricultural teaching institutions.
The work of the State veterinary service is backed by applied research
carried on at the State veterinary laboratories at Weybridge, Surrey,
Lasswade, Midlothian, and Stormont, Northern Ireland.
Plants Advice to growers on the general control of plant pests and diseases is given
by the advisory services. In addition, the State plant health service is res¬
ponsible for statutory controls designed to limit the spread of plant pests
and diseases present in Britain and prevent the introduction of new ones
from abroad. It also issues the health certificates required by other countries
to accompany plant material imported from Britain.
Voluntary certification schemes are operated to encourage the development
of healthy, vigorous and true-to-type planting stocks, particularly of crops
subject to degenerative diseases.

ADVISORY
SERVICES
The National
Agricultural
Advisory
Service
Although the increasing employment of pesticides has contributed appreciably
to expansion of agricultural output in Britain, it has been recognised that
effective safeguards are needed against the dangers arising from uncontrolled
use. The Agriculture (Poisonous Substances) Act, 1952, and the regulations
made under it, provide protection for agricultural workers using toxic
chemicals. In addition, to safeguard the many interests which might be
adversely affected by the use of chemicals in agriculture and food storage, a
voluntary notification scheme is operated by the Government, with the help
of an Advisory Committee and with the full co-operation of the agricultural
chemical industry. A report by a Research Study Group, set up in i960,
stated that present arrangements were proving generally effective but recom¬
mended further research. This is being undertaken by the Research Councils,
and the Agricultural Research Council has set up a scientific committee to
keep all research relating to the use of pesticides under review.
In England and Wales free technical advice on all agricultural and horti¬
cultural matters is available to every farmer and grower through the Ministry
of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food’s National Agricultural Advisory Service
(NAAS). Every county has a county advisory officer in charge of advisory
work and is divided into districts, in each of which there is a district advisory

officer who can call on an extensive system of specialist advisers. In Northern
Ireland advisory work is organised by the Ministry of Agriculture, working
through the County Agricultural Executive officers. In Scotland the advisory
services, similar in scope to the NAAS, are based on the three agricultural
colleges.
Facilities are provided at the NAAS experimental farms and horticultural
stations in England and Wales and at agricultural college centres in Scotland
and Northern Ireland for field-scale extensions of research work and investi¬
gations of local problems.
The main functions of the Agricultural Land Service, which operates in
England and Wales, are:
(1) to advise owners of agricultural land on estate management matters,
including farm buildings;
(2) to provide professional advice and services to the Minister of Agriculture,
Fisheries and Food and his agents on all matters relating to farm land
and buildings;
(3) to provide expert professional advice to the Minister and department
on the agricultural land use implications of planning proposals, including
the possibilities of reclaiming to agriculture, land worked for minerals
by open-cast methods; and
(4) liaison with other departments and planning authorities about such
proposals.
In Scotland similar duties are carried out by officers of the Department
of Agriculture and Fisheries but advisory work regarding farm buildings is
undertaken by the agricultural colleges. In Northern Ireland advice on matters
relating to farm land and buildings falls within the scope of the Ministry’s
advisory service.
The work of the advisory and veterinary services is supplemented by
numerous technical publications.
Agricultural research in Britain is planned and co-ordinated by the Agri¬
cultural Research Council (see p. 217) and is largely financed by the State.
The council has 24 research stations and units under its direct control and is
responsible for the administration of Government grants to 14 independent
research institutes in England and Wales; in Scotland, eight independent
research organisations receive grants through the Department of Agriculture
and Fisheries for Scotland. The Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and
Food and the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries for Scotland also
have their own investigation laboratories (see p. 218). Grants are also made
by the Agricultural Research Council to universities and to other recognised
research institutions.
Information on research is exchanged with other Commonwealth countries
through the machinery of the Commonwealth Agricultural Bureaux and
Institutes (ten Bureaux and two Institutes in the United Kingdom and one
Institute in Trinidad).
In England and Wales, research and advice on farm economics are combined
in the Provincial Agricultural Economics Service, which comprises ten
university Departments of Agricultural Economics and which is co-ordinated
by the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food. In Scotland, agricultural
economists are on the staff of the three agricultural colleges. The agricultural
348

departments in both England and Wales and Scotland have economics and
statistics units.
The Northern Ireland Ministry of Agriculture also has an Economics and
Statistics Division and has, in addition, its own research divisions investigating
problems of animal and crop production. The staff of these divisions are
also responsible for lectures in the Faculty of Agriculture of Queen’s University,
Belfast, and for specialist advice to the county advisory staffs.
Industrial concerns manufacturing weed-killers, insecticides, fertilisers,
feedingstuffs and agricultural tractors and implements undertake research on
a considerable scale and in most cases maintain experimental farms and
estates.
There are four types of institution which provide full-time education in
agricultural subjects: universities, agricultural colleges, county farm institutes
(in England and Wales), and farm schools (in Scotland). Twelve universities
in the United Kingdom provide degree and postgraduate courses in agri¬
culture, and one other university offers postgraduate diploma courses. A
National College of Agricultural Engineering was established in i960 at
Silsoe, Bedfordshire. This is the eighth of the national colleges (see p. 175)
established to train people for highly specialised industries, the needs of
which cannot be met at local technical colleges.
Two-year diploma courses and some specialised courses are given at five
agricultural colleges and at two of the county farm institutes in England and
Wales; three agricultural colleges in Scotland give two-year to three-year
diploma courses and also offer two- or three-term certificate courses. In
Northern Ireland there are two agricultural colleges; a third is to be built.
There are 31 county farm institutes in England and five in Wales run by
local education authorities. They provide residential courses in general
agriculture, dairying, horticulture, poultry husbandry and rural domestic
economy. Local education authorities also provide a wide range of short
courses and classes for farmers, farm workers, horticulturists and domestic
producers.
There are eight farm schools in Scotland, run by local education authorities,
providing courses—mainly residential—of from one to three years’ duration
for boys and girls of from 12 to 16 years. There is one residential agricultural
school in Northern Ireland, which provides short courses for boys and girls
over 15 years of age.
Courses in land management are available at the Universities of Cambridge
and London and at the Royal Agricultural College, Cirencester. Cambridge
offers a Land Economy Tripos (honours degree).
FISHERIES
Although the sea fishing industry contributes only about l per cent of the
United Kingdom’s gross national product, it is of greater importance to the
economy of Scotland. It is also by far the most important source of employ¬
ment in some of the major fishing ports. The industry falls into two main
divisions, concerned respectively with white fish and herring. White fish,
such as cod, haddock, plaice, turbot and sole, are demersal fish which live
on or near the sea bed. Herring and similar species, such as pilchard, mackerel
and sprats, are pelagic fish which live mainly in intermediate waters or near
the surface.

Fishing Ports
Methods of
Sea Fishing
The Fishing
Fleet
The white fish section of the industry is made up of three main groups:
the distant water, the near and middle water, and the inshore fisheries. The
distant waters are those off Iceland, Greenland, Bear Island and the north
coast of Norway, and the Barents Sea; the middle water grounds lie around
the Faroe Islands; and the near water grounds are those in the North Sea,
the Irish Sea and in the coastal areas around Britain. The herring fishing
grounds are mainly within 60 miles of land. The inshore waters also yield
considerable quantities of shellfish.
The principal fishing ports in England and Wales are Hull, Grimsby, Fleet-
wood, Milford Haven and Lowestoft for white fish, and Great Yarmouth
and Lowestoft for herring. In Scotland the chief centres for white fish are
Aberdeen, Fraserburgh, Granton, the Moray Firth, the west coast and Shet¬
land; herring landings are made mainly at the east coast ports of Aberdeen,
Fraserburgh and Peterhead, the west coast ports of Ullapool, Mallaig, Oban
and Portpatrick, and in Shetland. In Northern Ireland the herring fishing
ports are Ardglass, Portavogie and Kilkeel.
The chief methods of catching fish are by trawling, seining, lining, and ring
and drift netting.
Trawling is carried out throughout the year in the distant and near waters
for all species of demersal fish.
Seining is also used for catching demersal fish all the year round, mainly
in the North Sea, the Minches, the Firth of Clyde, and the Irish Sea. There
are about 720 Scottish and Northern Ireland seiners, and about 220 operating
from English ports.
The pelagic fisheries are seasonal. There is summer fishing for herring
based on the Shetlands, the east coast ports of Scotland, and the north-east
coast ports of England, and autumn fishing off East Anglia based on Lowestoft
and Yarmouth. Other seasonal fisheries take place off the west coast of
Scotland, in the Isle of Man area and off Southern Ireland.
The inshore fisheries comprise a great diversity of types of vessels and
methods of capture; in addition, there are extensive fisheries for crabs,
lobsters, shrimps, mussels, cockles and oysters, and, off Scotland, north-east
England and in the Irish Sea, there are substantial catches of ‘Norway lobsters’
(nephrops).
Distant water vessels, which operate mainly from Hull, Grimsby and
Fleetwood, numbered 227 at the end of 1962. They are over 140 feet and up to
220 feet in length and make voyages of 17 to 23 days to fishing grounds in
the Arctic Circle, although in the past few years there has been an increasing
tendency to fish the waters bordering Newfoundland, Labrador and Greenland.
The increase in fishing in these areas is due in part to the introduction of
factory trawlers of up to about 260 feet in length which spend up to three
months at sea and fillet and freeze much of their catch immediately it is
taken. At the same date, near and middle water vessels numbered 464; they
are under 140 feet long and most of them work nearer home, making voyages
of from a few days up to more than two weeks, although some of the
larger vessels fish regularly off the Faroes and seasonally as far afield as
Iceland. Included in the near water group are vessels engaged in drift net
fishing for herring; these vessels usually make daily voyages. The inshore
group consists mainly of vessels of under 80 feet which are seldom at sea

for longer than two or three days and more usually make daily landings,
often fishing within sight of land.
In the British fishing industry in 1962 there were about 22,000 fishermen
in regular employment and some 6,000 occasionally employed; 8,400 of the
former and 2,200 of the latter were from Scottish ports. In Northern Ireland
there were about 500 regular fishermen.
In 1962 landings of fish, both demersal and pelagic, by British fishing vessels
totalled 786,000 tons (677,000 tons of demersal fish and 109,000 tons of
pelagic), valued at about £49 million. Landings at British ports by foreign
vessels totalled about 123,000 tons of fresh and frozen fish (including 53,000
tons brought direct from the fishing grounds), valued at about £16 million.
British landings of shellfish yielded £2-5 million. Cod accounted for 39 per
cent of the total value of wet fish (i.e. fish other than shellfish) landed by
British vessels; haddock (20 per cent) and plaice (9 per cent) were the other
most important sources of earnings to the industry.
Net imports of all types of fish (fresh, frozen, salted or canned) in 1962
amounted to about 215,000 tons valued at £60 million, including 46,000 tons
of canned salmon to the value of £30 million and other canned fish worth
£9-7 million.
Weekly consumption of fresh, frozen and cured fish (excluding shellfish
and imported canned fish) in Britain averaged 15,900 tons landed weight in
1962. Consumption has been declining slightly; on an edible (fillet) weight
basis, it was estimated provisionally at 17-5 lb. per head in 1962, com¬
pared with 18-8 lb. in 1958, a peak total of 28-7 lb. in 1948 and an annual
average of 21-8 lb. from 1934-38.
Processing and packaging of fish—curing, kippering, canning and quick-
freezing for consumer packs—are the subject of continuing research and
development. The production of quick-frozen fish has been increasing steadily
since 1952. With the increase in quick-freezing, new export outlets have opened
up for white fish, which in 1962 accounted for nearly half the total British
exports of fish and fish products, valued at £j-i million. Markets abroad for
quick-frozen fish, mainly in Europe, have been expanding; exports of herrings
have continued to decline.
A valuable by-product of the industry is the manufacture of fish meal for
animal food and to a much lesser extent for fertilisers. Home production of
white fish meal and herring meal has over the past three years remained
constant at around 72,000 tons per annum.
The British whaling industry has declined in size, and now there is only
one Antarctic expedition a year; the volume of whale-oil obtained in the
1962—63 season amounted to about 80,360 barrels. Whaling is regulated by
the International Whaling Commission (of which Britain is a member) set
up under the International WTaling Convention of 1946. Its headquarters
are in London.
The main commercial freshwater catches are salmon, sea-trout and eels. In
Scotland and Northern Ireland, fixed nets along the coast and sweep or
draught nets in rivers and estuaries are used; in England, drift nets are used
for catching salmon in the sea, and draught nets and fixed traps in estuaries.
In England and Wales the value of the salmon catch is approximately
£200,000 a year, in Scotland it amounts to over £1 million, and in Northern

Ireland to some ,£250,000. In Northern Ireland, eels, worth about £160,000
a year, are captured by long lines and by eel nets placed in river weirs.
The principal inland wholesale distributing centre for fish is Billingsgate
Market in London, which handles about 300 tons a day, but other large
cities also have central fish markets. The principal method of distribution is
through wholesalers, located at the ports, who buy at the auctions and sell
to inland wholesalers; the port wholesalers prepare the fish for onward ship¬
ment. Many special express fish trains transport the catch daily from the
ports to inland centres, but increasing use is being made of road transport.
Retail sales are handled by some 25,000 to 30,000 fishmongers and fish friers;
the latter use about a third of the landings of white fish.
Recent developments include the entry of trawler-owning companies into
the system of distribution. This process is being speeded by the growing
popularity of quick-frozen consumer packs, which are sold by other retail
outlets as well as by fishmongers.
The Government departments mainly responsible for the administration of
legislation concerning the fishing industry are the Ministry of Agriculture,
Fisheries and Food, the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries for Scotland
and the Ministry of Commerce for Northern Ireland; the Ministry of Health
and the Scottish Home and Health Department are concerned with questions
of nutrition and hygiene affecting fish and fish products. The safety and
welfare of crews of fishing vessels are provided for under the Merchant
Shipping Acts, which are administered by the Ministry of Transport.
The Herring Industry Board was set up under the Herring Industry Act of
I935 to reorganise, develop and regulate the herring industry; subsequent
amending Acts have also been passed. The board consists of a chairman and
two other members, all part-time and independent of the industry, who are
appointed jointly by the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, the
Secretary of State for Scotland and the Home Secretary. The board, whose
activities are financed partly by Government grants and loans and partly by
levies and licence fees, is advised by the Herring Industry Advisory Council,
consisting of representatives of the catching and shore sections of the industry.
The functions of the board include the promotion of sales of herring, both
at home and abroad, and the provision of financial assistance for the purchase
of new boats, nets and gear, and the reconditioning of existing boats. The
board is particularly active in developing new and wider markets for herring,
and applying the benefits of technical progress to the industry, including
the adoption of new fishing methods, and the construction of new processing
plants for quick-freezing and kippering. The board buys all herring not sold
for other purposes for reduction to oil and meal, and, with the aid of Govern¬
ment grants, has built processing factories for this purpose.
The White Fish Authority and the Committee for Scotland and Northern
Ireland of the Authority were set up under the Sea Fish Industry Act, 1951.
The function of the Authority is to reorganise, develop and regulate the white
fish industry, and that of the Committee to advise the authority about the
exercise and performance of its functions in Scotland and Northern Ireland.
The authority is composed of five independent members, and the Scottish
Committee of four under the chairmanship of a member of the authority.
They are appointed jointly by the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food,
the Secretary of State for Scotland and the Home Secretary. The White

Fish Industry Advisory Council was also set up under the Sea Fish Industry’
Act, 1951, to advise the authority about the exercise and performance of its
functions. It consists of 51 members representing the various interests of the
fishing industry.
The White Fish Authority administers Government grant and loan
schemes for the purchase of new fishing vessels and engines and loans for
the purchase of nets and gear and processing plants. Up to 31st March, 1963)
£30-6 million in loans and £13 million in grants were approved for these
purposes by the authority. Its other activities are financed by a levy on first¬
hand sales of fish.
Since 1950 a Government subsidy has been paid towards inshore, near and
middle water vessels fishing for white fish. This subsidy, now paid under
the White Fish and Herring Industries Act, 1953, varies according to the
class of vessel concerned and is paid at the rate of so much per day at sea for
the larger vessels and at so much per stone of fish landed from the smaller
boats. In 1962-63 the amount paid in this way was £3-9 million. The White
Fish and Herring Industries Act, 1957, extended the subsidy to vessels
fishing for herring, the conditions being broadly the same as for white fish
vessels. In 1962-63 the herring subsidy totalled £317,415. Grants and loans
are also available under these Acts for vessels and engines for the fishing
fleets.
The Sea Fish Industry Act, 1959, which came into operation in December
1959, provided for further funds for subsidies and grants, and the White
Fish and Herring Industries Act, 1961, extended the white fish subsidy to
vessels over 140 feet in length and to other vessels fishing distant waters.
The Sea Fish Industry Act, 1962, passed in consequence of the report
of a Committee of Inquiry into the Fishing Industry, extended the scope of
these forms of aid and made provision for their continuance until the end of
1972. The Act, however, had special provisions for annual reductions in the
rates of white fish subsidy payable to vessels of 80 feet or over in length.
FORESTRY
The total woodland area of Great Britain is more than 4 million acres, or
over 7 per cent of the total land area. Except for the period of the two world
wars, when much over-felling took place, home woodlands have made only
a limited contribution to the nation’s timber requirements. At present,
Great Britain imports about 85 per cent of its needs of timber and wood
products; however, through the Forestry Commission, the Government is
successfully devoting effort to the long-term task of increasing the country’s
timber resources.
On 30th September, 1962, the area of woodland in blocks of one acre and
over in extent was estimated to be 4,205,000 acres, of which about half were
in England, about two-fifths in Scotland and the rest in Wales. The greatest
density of woodland in Great Britain occurs in north, east and central Scotland
and in the southern counties of England, although afforestation is now in¬
creasing the importance of forestry in many counties which were not
previously heavily wooded. The classification of forest area showing type and
ownership in 1962 is given in Table 23.
The high proportion of still unproductive woodland (scrub and areas
where trees have been felled and partially felled) is largely a legac} of two

and water supply undertakings.
wars, when many woods were felled to meet the need for timber. Since 1945
the area of this unproductive category has been reduced by about 255,000
acres, but the large area which remains gives some indication of the problem
of rehabilitation which still lies ahead.
The most common of the coniferous tree species in Great Britain is
probably the Scots pine, but such trees as the Sitka and Norway spruce are
also plentiful. Of the broadleaved species, the most common tree is the oak,
and there are considerable numbers of beech, ash, birch, sycamore and elm.
The climate and soil of Great Britain are such that the growth of timber
which can be obtained under systematic management compares most favour¬
ably with that achieved in other European countries.
The Forestry
Commission
and Forestry
Policy
In 1919 the Forestry Act was passed establishing the Forestry Commission
as the national forest authority, with the general duty of promoting the
interests of forestry, the development of afforestation and the production
and supply of timber in Great Britain. The commission consists of a chairman
and not more than nine commissioners who are appointed by the Crown;
in exercising their functions, they are required to comply with such directions
as may be given to them by the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food
and the Secretary of State for Scotland. There is continual contact between
the commission’s staff and private owners of woodland, and the staff gives
advice, free of charge, on silvicultural and management problems; substantial
grants for planting and forest management are paid to woodland owners.
In the years before the second world war, some progress was made by the
commission in increasing the area under forest. During the war, however,
extensive felling was necessary to replace imports of timber. In 1943 the
Forestry Commissioners recommended, in their report on post-war forestry
policy, that the nation should aim at having at least 5 million acres of productive
forest, of which 2 million acres, mostly in private ownership, would accrue
from the rehabilitation of existing woodlands and 3 million acres from the
afforestation of bare land by the Forestry Commission. The acreage of
woodland proposed would, it was estimated, produce ultimately a volume of
timber equivalent to about one-third of the country’s needs.

Forestry
In 1958 the Government decided that the planting programme of the
Forestry Commission for the five-year period 1959 to 1963 should be about
300,000 acres; after a further review of forest policy (promised in 1958),
the Government announced in July 1963 that over the decade 1964 to 1973
the Commission’s aim would be to plant another 450,000 acres. By about
1968 the Commission’s existing plantations will begin to come into full
production.
The Commission manages some 500 forests, which together include more
than 1,700,000 acres of forest land, well distributed over England, Scotland
and Wales. All these forests are covered by management plans, which provide
for such work as planting, road construction, thinning and fire protection.
A substantial amount of the Forestry Commission’s new planting has been
carried out in Scotland, much of it in the Highland counties. The poorer
types of land are being used, such as sour, peaty soil which is unsuitable for
other agricultural purposes, and has become suitable for forestry only as a
result of recent advances in deep ploughing. Sand dunes are also used; on
the southern shore of the Moray Firth, Culbin Forest now covers 7,700 acres
of land which had been unproductive for centuries. Similarly, in Wales,
about 3,000 acres of sand dunes at Mon, Anglesey, and nearly 2,000 acres
at Pembrey, Carmarthenshire, have been successfully planted.
The Forestry Fund was established by the Forestry Act, 1919; from it is
paid all the expenditure of the Forestry Commissioners and into it are paid
their receipts from sales of produce, rentals and other sources, together with
the amounts voted annually by Parliament. In the year ended 30th September,
1962, expenditure amounted to £15-3 million, of which nearly £1-3 million
represented various grants to private forestry.
Privately owned woods comprise about two-thirds of the total forest area in
Great Britain (as shown in Table 23), and contain most of the mature and
semi-mature timber. The size of woodlands in individual ownership ranges
from a few acres to several thousand acres, and a high proportion of private
woodland area is in small ownership (i.e. owners of up to about 250 acres).
Impetus has been given to the effective management of private woodlands
by the introduction of the Dedication of Woodlands Scheme under the
Forestry Act, 1947. Under this scheme, owners are invited to put their land
permanently to timber production and to manage their woods in accordance
with a plan agreed with the Forestry Commission, in return for the provision
of planting and management grants and technical assistance. By September
1962 the total area dedicated was 733,500 acres. In addition, there are the
woodlands covered by the Approved Woodlands Scheme in which a planting
grant, but no management grant is made; and these bring the total area
managed under an agreed plan to over 887,000 acres. Woodland owners are
represented, in their relations with the Forestry Commission, by the Forestry
Committee of Great Britain, which co-ordinates the work of two associations
of woodland owners, the Timber Growers’ Organisation (for owners in
England and Wales) and the Scottish Woodland Owners’ Association.
The Forestry Commissioners have encouraged the development of co¬
operative forestry schemes and have made loans available. The co-operative
societies provide for landowners and farmers the services of skilled staff,
centralised purchasing facilities, and a central agency for the disposal of
forest produce. The Commission also co-operates with the principal forestry
societies, such as the Royal Forestry Society of England and Wales and the
Royal Scottish Forestry Society, in disseminating technical knowledge.

In 1959 the Home Grown Timber Marketing Corporation was established
by the timber merchants to promote the use of home grown timber.
The Forestry Act, 1945, established national committees for England,
Scotland and Wales, composed partly of Forestry Commissioners and partly of
persons outside the commission. These committees supervise certain aspects
of the Commission’s work, including particularly the acquisition and manage¬
ment of land and the promotion of private forestry.
Other bodies have been set up to provide for consultation on the marketing
and utilisation of home grown timber. The Home Grown Timber Advisory
Committee, established by the Forestry Commissioners in 1939, consists of
representatives of the Forestry Commission, the Board of Trade and
associations of landowners and timber merchants. In 1949 the Forestry
Commissioners set up the Advisory Committee on Utilisation of Home
Grown Timber to advise landowners and to undertake research into problems
connected with the marketing of timber from the Commission’s own forests.
A voluntary scheme was agreed upon in 1961 for consultation on proposals
for afforestation of land within National Parks (see p. 187) that has not
previously been planted with trees. The Forestry Commission agreed, and
the Timber Growers’ Organisation and the Country Landowners’ Association
undertook to advise their members, to submit such proposals to the park
planning authorities.
The Forestry Commission maintains four forester training schools: in
England, at Parkend in the Forest of Dean, Gloucestershire; in Wales, near
Betws-y-Coed in Caernarvonshire; and in Scotland at Benmore, Argyllshire,
and Faskally, near Pitlochry in Perthshire. Northerwood House in the New
Forest, Hampshire, is the Commission’s educational centre, and is used for
practical courses for university students, landowners and agents, planning
officers, school teachers and others connected with, or interested in, forestry.
Higher education in forestry is provided at several universities; a proportion
of suitable graduates is recruited by the commission as forest officers.
The Commission’s Forest Research Station at Alice Holt Lodge, near
Farnham, Surrey, was opened in 1946. Expenditure on research work at this
station and in experimental areas in many forests in Great Britain amounted
to £446,000 in 1962. This sum included grants for special forestry research
work to various institutions and to university departments including the
Imperial Forestry Institute at Oxford, which is also financed by the University,
the Colonial Office, and Colonial Governments. Research into the qualities
of home grown timber is carried out by the Forest Products Research
Laboratory at Princes Risborough, Bucks, which is one of the establishments
of the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research, and also by grant-
aided research associations.
When the Government of Northern Ireland was formed in 1922, the new
Ministry of Agriculture became the forest authority working with similar
powers and duties to those conferred on the Forestry Commission by the
Forestry Act, 1919. At that time the Ministry took over some 4,000 acres
for afforestation, of which 700 acres had been planted.
Forest policy in Northern Ireland is now implemented by the Forestry Act
(Northern Ireland), 1953, which replaced earlier legislation. This Act pro¬
vides the Ministry with powers to acquire and manage land, and to give
financial and technical assistance for private planting. It introduced measures
356
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
for the protection of all woodlands, whether owned by the State or privately
owned, against destruction by over-cutting, fire or depredation by animals.
The State forest area has grown steadily and at a greatly accelerated pace
since the end of the second world war. By 1963 nearly 120,000 acres had been
acquired, of which about 67,000 acres had been planted. The present
afforestation programme provides for the creation, as soon as possible, of an
area of 150,000 acres of productive State forest. To reach this objective, a
minimum annual planting rate of 5,000 acres has been set.
Financial provision is made by sums voted annually by Parliament and
receipts from forest produce, rentals and other sources. From 1922 to 1963
expenditure amounted to about £10 million, and receipts, other than parlia¬
mentary grants, were in the region of ^3‘4 nfiHiom About 1,400 people are
employed in field labour and ancillary work. The area of exploitable private
woodlands is at present about 27,000 acres, and private planting, which is
gaining impetus, is assisted by schemes for the supply at a low cost of young
trees from the Ministry’s nurseries, by grants towards the cost of the estab¬
lishment of new plantations, and by free technical advice.
Pomeroy Forestry School at Pomeroy House, Co. Tyrone, provides
training and refresher courses for forestry workers, school teachers and
others interested in trees and forestry.

TRANSPORT AND
COMMUNICATIONS
357
THE MERCHANT
FLEET
Inland and overseas transport and communications employed 7-3 per cent
of the total labour force in the United Kingdom in June 1962. Of the 1,613,900
persons so occupied, 28-3 per cent were engaged in road passenger transport
and road haulage contracting, 26-1 per cent in railways and 20 per cent in
postal services and telecommunications. Sea and air transport absorbed
respectively 9-5 per cent and 2-8 per cent. Port and inland water transport
and miscellaneous transport services and storage absorbed 8-7 per cent.
Transport and communications contribute over 8 per cent to the gross
national product and 13 per cent to the nation’s gross fixed capital formation.
SHIPPING
Of the world’s active sea-going tonnage of 100 gross tons1 and over, 17-4 per
cent is registered in the United Kingdom. Although the British merchant
fleet is still the largest in active employment, British shipowners have been
subject to increasing competition from the growing fleets of other nations.
Between 1955 and 1962 the British merchant fleet increased by n-2 per cent
from 19-4 million to 21 - 7 million gross tons, while the total tonnage of all other
countries increased by 45-7 per cent, from 81-2 million to 118-3 million gross
tons. The balance of payments for shipping services was positive until about
1959 (it was minus £39 million in 1962) and shipping still makes one of the
largest contributions to Britain’s total earnings of foreign exchange. In 1962
freights, charter receipts and passage money amounted to £598 million, or
25 per cent of the total value of invisible exports. In recent years freight
earnings in cross-trade has amounted to about 60 per cent of total shipping
earnings. The proportion of the United Kingdom’s own sea-borne trade
carried in British ships is not known exactly, but is believed to amount to
about half.
Of the 21-7 million gross tons of merchant shipping (steam and motor vessels
of 100 gross tons and over) registered in the United Kingdom on 30th June,
1962, the largest tonnage ever recorded, tankers constituted 7-5 million gross
tons; this was 16-5 per cent of the world’s sea-going tanker tonnage and an
increase over previous years.
Recent trends in the composition of the merchant fleet have been the
reduction of tramp tonnage other than specially built bulk carrier tonnage,
the growth of tanker tonnage, the increasing size of tankers, and the com¬
missioning of vessels specially built to carry ore, sugar, and other commodities
in bulk.
1 One gross ton (g.t.) =100 cubic feet. One deadweight ton (d.w.t.) = 1 long ton
(2,240 lb.). Gross tonnage indicates the total capacity of the enclosed spaces on a ship.
Deadweight tonnage denotes the maximum load which a vessel can carry before
sinking to the load line.

As a result of replacements built in recent years, 56-5 per cent of the total
gross tonnage in 1962 was less than ten years old, compared with 43 per cent
in 1955. The corresponding figures for tankers were 75 per cent in 1962 and
58 per cent in 1955. There has been a tendency for replacements to be larger
because big ships are more economical to run; between 1955 an<^ I9^2 the
average size of all ships (over 500 gross tons) increased from 5,200 to 6,400
tons, and that of tankers (over 500 gross tons) from 8,400 to 12,100 gross tons.
In 1963 there were four liners of 30,000 gross tons and over operating on
transatlantic passenger services: namely, the Queen Elizabeth (83,673 g.t.),
the Queen Mary (81,237 g.t.), the Mauretania (35,673 g.t.), and the Caronia
(34,173 g.t.). The two largest liners to be built in Britain since 1939, the
Oriana (42,000 g.t.) and the Canberra (45,000 g.t.), came into service in i960
and 1961 respectively on the services from Britain to Australia and across
the Pacific to North America. In June 1962, 24 tankers of 40,000 d.w.t. and
over were owned and registered in Britain.
Steam has continued to give place to the diesel engine, 50-8 per cent of all
tonnage being diesel-driven in 1962. The Ministry of Transport, with the
co-operation of the shipowning, shipbuilding and marine engineering in¬
dustries, has been investigating the possibility of applying nuclear propulsion
to merchant ships. In February 1963 the Minister of Transport announced
that research had reached a stage at which the Government had decided to
approach the shipping and shipbuilding industries about arrangements for
building the first British nuclear merchant ship and a decision might be made
before the end of the year.
In June 1962, 17-4 million gross tons of trading vessels of 100 gross tons
and over were owned and registered in Britain.1 The usual employment of
this fleet has been analysed by the United Kingdom Chamber of Shipping
as follows: 8-i million gross tons were employed as ocean-going passenger
and cargo liners; 3 million gross tons as ocean-going tramps; 5-3 million
gross tons as ocean-going tankers; and i-o million gross tons in coasting and
trade with ports between the Elbe and Brest (home trades).
About half of British-owned shipping registered in the United Kingdom
consists of ocean-going passenger-cargo and cargo liners, mostly the latter.
Practically all these ships are owned by large liner companies or groups of
liner companies. Many of them operate wide networks of scheduled freight
and passenger services which, between them, cover every ocean. The 3 million
gross tons of ocean-going tramp ships are operated by a large number of
private owners, some of them having only a small number of ships and some
only one ship.
According to a survey published in 1959, the British shipping industry was
composed of some 270 companies, over half the tonnage being owned by
nine or ten main groups controlling about 50 companies. The many world-
famous British shipping lines operating services on international routes
include: the Cunard, to North America; the Royal Mail, to South America;
the Blue Funnel, to Australia and the Far East; the Peninsular and Oriental
(P. and 0.)-0rient and the British India lines, to India, Australia and the
1 The remaining tonnage included fishing vessels, tugs, river and estuary craft,
Admiralty vessels (mostly tankers) not usually engaged in the commercial carriage of
cargo, and shipping registered in Britain but owned in other Commonwealth countries
(including over 848,000 gross tons of tankers).

Over two-thirds of the total tanker fleet belongs to the oil companies,
although there are a few important independent United Kingdom tanker¬
owning companies. A new type of specialised bulk carrier—the ore-carrier—
is in use on a substantial scale; some of the ore-carriers are partly owned by
companies in the steel industry, but are managed and operated by shipping
companies.
Since the second world war shipowners have received no direct financial
assistance from the Government. For some years, however, the Government
has recognised that the shipping industry is faced with severe competition
and has found it increasingly difficult to build up finance for the replacement
of ships. In 1956 the shipping industry was almost the only industry allowed
to retain the 20 per cent investment allowance in respect of taxation which
was withdrawn from industry generally (but restored in 1959). The allowance
for capital expenditure on the construction of new ships was raised to 40 per
cent in 1957.

Organisations
The main organisations concerned with the activities, interests and common
problems of the industry are as follows:
Lloyd’s Register is an organisation (distinct from the Society of Lloyd’s, see
p. 415) which surveys and classifies ships with particular regard to their
safety and operational efficiency. It will accept responsibility for surveying
and giving technical advice on vessels of all flags from the initial stages of
building, at regular intervals during their service, and after casualties. A
satisfactory Lloyd’s classification is a guarantee to an underwriter that he may
accept the risk of a vessel, and this forms a strong link between the Register
and the Society of Lloyd’s.
The representative bodies speaking for shipowners generally (excluding, for
the most part, owners of fishing vessels) are the Chamber of Shipping and the
Liverpool Steamship Owners' Association. The General Council of British
Shipping co-ordinates the views of the shipping industry as a whole on all
matters of major policy.
There are a number of local associations of shipowners centred around the
main port areas, for example, the Bristol Steamship Owners' Association, the
London General Shipowners' Society, and the North of England Shipowners'
Association. Others represent companies specialising in a particular trade or
type of cargo.
The Shipping Federation and the Employers' Association of the Port of Liverpool
are the employers’ organisations concerned with labour relations and the
regulation of employment throughout the Merchant Navy. They are res¬
ponsible for the administration of the Merchant Navy Established Service
Scheme, under which shipowners engaging crews for ships of 200 gross tons
and above engage them through the Merchant Navy Establishment Admin¬
istration unless they are prepared to offer two-year Company Service contracts.
The Shipping Federation is also responsible for the day-to-day operation of
the National Sea Training Schools set up for the purpose of training ratings
for the deck and catering departments and as firemen.
Shipmasters are represented by the Mercantile Marine Service Association-,

surgeons by the Merchant Navy and Airline Officers' Association’, and radio
officers by the Radio Officers' Union. Some uncertificated engineer officers are
represented by the Amalgamated Engineering Union. The interests of the deck,
engine-room and catering ratings are represented by the National Union of
Seamen.
The National Maritime Board is composed of equal numbers of representa¬
tives of the shipowners and seafarers and is responsible for all negotiations
of wages and conditions of service in the Merchant Navy, although, except
by special arrangement, National Maritime Board agreements do not apply
to vessels of under 200 gross tons, or to certain other ships, including tugs
and salvage vessels. Detailed working of the board is carried on by a number
of ‘panels’ representing the various interests of those forming the seafarers’
part of the board.
British shipping companies operating liners have associated with each other
and with the companies of other countries operating on the same routes in
a series of ‘conferences’ designed to secure standardisation and stability of
rates, and to maintain frequency and regularity of services. The essential
principle of a conference is the establishment of a common tariff of freight
rates or passenger fares from each port of departure. Each conference meets
from time to time to review and revise existing rates, or to compile new ones.
Some of the conferences are connected by rate agreements, or have joined
together to form wider groupings. There are over 60 conferences dealing
with trade to and from the United Kingdom.
The Baltic Mercantile and Shipping Exchange, which originated in one of
London’s seventeenth-century coffee houses, is the world’s largest market
for the chartering of ships of all nationalities. Shipbrokers and merchants’
representatives meet here to arrange the chartering of dry-cargo tramp ships
for the carriage of goods to and from all parts of the world.
RELATIONS The Ministry of Transport is the Government department responsible for
WITH THE most matters connected with merchant shipping. Under the Merchant
GOVERNMEN Shipping Act of 1894 and subsequent legislation, it administers many
regulations for marine safety and welfare, for instance: certifying the load-
line (or Plimsoll line) that ensures that a ship is not overloaded; ensuring that
standards of safety are observed in ship construction; ensuring the provision
of adequate life-saving, fire-fighting and radio equipment; and dealing with
the discipline, professional standards, health and accommodation of seamen.
Most of the work which these responsibilities entail is carried out by the
officers of the Marine Survey and Mercantile Marine at the ports. There is
also a Registrar-General of Shipping and Seamen in whose office at Cardiff
a complete record of all British ships and seamen is kept. The Ministry is
represented on the Merchant Navy Welfare Board and on the Merchant
Navy Training Board (see p. 361). The Ministry fosters the development
and use of modern navigational aids.
The Ministry of Transport arranges for the provision of space in merchant
ships to meet the sea transport needs of the armed forces and looks after
ships that it owns or has chartered. It is concerned with general shipping
policy and the strategic implications of the Merchant Navy; and it is also
the sponsoring department for the shipbuilding, ship repairing and marine
engineering industries.

United Kingdom, are administered by H.M. Consuls and by officers of
Commonwealth and Colonial Governments.
In August 1962 the Minister of Transport set up a Shipping Advisory
Panel, under his own chairmanship, to advise him on commercial and
economic matters affecting the prosperity of British shipping.
Britain is a party to the 1954 International Convention for the Prevention
of the Pollution of the Sea by Oil which came into force in 1958. The nations
which have ratified this convention agree to prohibit their national fleets
from discharging oil within 50 miles of any coast and also in extensive areas
of the Atlantic Ocean and the North Sea. Amendments to the Convention
were agreed at an international conference held in London in 1962. British
ships registered in the United Kingdom were already prohibited from
discharging oil within a wide zone of the sea around the United Kingdom
under the Oil in Navigable Waters Act, 1955 (the discharge of oil from
any source into United Kingdom territorial waters and harbours was first
prohibited in 1922); a further Act was passed in 1963 giving effect to the
amendments agreed at the 1962 conference.
The Ministry of Transport administers the Coastguard Service. This is
primarily a life-saving organisation which keeps watch at danger points around
the coast for vessels in distress and renders assistance either by rocket life¬
saving apparatus or by informing other authorities who may be able to give
help. There is close liaison between the Coastguard Service and the Royal
National Life-boat Institution. The latter maintains lifeboats around the
coast of the United Kingdom; it is supported entirely by voluntary subscrip¬
tions, and depends largely for its operation on voluntary workers. From its
foundation in 1824t0 the end of 1962, the Royal National Life-boat Institution
rescued 83,873 people. Lifeboats were launched 833 times in 1962, and
rescued 422 people.
The general lighthouse authority for England and Wales, the Channel
Islands and Gibraltar is the Corporation of Trinity House, which received its
first Royal Charter in the sixteenth century and is administered by a Board
of ten Elder Brethren, elected from the Royal Navy and the Merchant Navy.
Lighthouses in Scotland and Ireland are the responsibility respectively of
the Commissioners of Northern Lighthouses and the Commissioners of Irish
Lights.
Trinity House is also the chief pilotage authority, licensing some 750 pilots
in 41 districts in England and Wales, including London. In some cases the
harbour authority or local council is the pilotage authority. The Ministry of
Transport also has certain responsibilities in connection with lighthouses and
pilotage.
The number of masters, officers and men serving in December 1962 in
British ships on articles of agreement opened or closed in the United Kingdom
was 134,600. Masters and deck and engineer officers numbered 42,100 and
deck and engine-room ratings 43,000. There were 37,700 catering personnel,
nearly 5,900 apprentices and cadets and 3,400 radio officers.
The Merchant Navy Training Board promotes the instruction and studies at
sea of apprentices and cadets who are preparing for their examinations for
certificates of competency as second mate.
The Ministry of Transport holds examinations for, and issues certificates
of competency to, ships’ officers as master, first mate and second mate of

foreign-going ships, or master and mate of home trade ships and as first-class
engineer and second-class engineer. Officers may not normally serve on board
ships in these grades unless they hold the appropriate, or a higher, certificate.
Radio officers are required to hold certificates of competency in radio¬
telegraphy issued by the Postmaster General on the results of an open
examination.
A seaman may not be rated as A.B. (Able Seaman) in United Kingdom
registered ships unless he holds a certificate of competency as A.B., granted
by the Ministry of Transport, or an equivalent certificate. To obtain this
certificate a seaman must, among other qualifications, have served three years
at sea on deck, have obtained a certificate of proficiency as lifeboatman and
have passed a qualifying examination.
Seamen qualify by seniority for promotion to the rating of petty officer.
Service as a deck rating qualifies for the purpose of admission to the examina¬
tion for a second mate’s certificate.
Wages and conditions of employment are negotiated by the National Maritime
Board. Minimum wages and holidays with pay are guaranteed for both officers
and ratings. Moreover, the Merchant Navy Established Service Scheme,
introduced by the Board in 1947, has removed a great deal of the uncertainty
formerly associated with a seafaring life. Officers and men can now take
two-year contracts, not only with individual shipping companies but
with the industry as a whole, and get special benefits, in addition to
the normal unemployment insurance benefit, when they are ashore between
voyages.
The Merchant Navy Welfare Board, on which are represented officers’ and
seamen’s unions and associations, shipowners, voluntary societies, the
Ministries of Transport, Labour, and Pensions and National Insurance, and
the Colonial Office, has been responsible since 1948 for the control and
co-ordination of the welfare services for merchant seamen in the United
Kingdom and of British merchant seamen abroad.
There are over 300 ports in Britain. It is estimated that 132 million tons of
imports passed through the ports in 1962, and 33-3 million tons of exports
and re-exports, including 6-5 million tons of coal.
The Port of London, with 69 miles of waterway and over 4,000 acres of
dock estate, including 42 miles of quayage, is the largest port in the Common¬
wealth, and with New York and Rotterdam is one of the three largest ports
in the world. Goods of every kind, from meat to marble, from plywood to
perfume, pass through the docks; 51 million tons of cargo were handled in
the year 1962. Imports are distributed all over the United Kingdom, though
the port supplies, primarily, Greater London and the home counties. The
Thames Navigation Service, operating from Gravesend, provides navigational
surveillance and information, by means of radar and radiotelephone and other
methods, for vessels between the estuary and London Bridge.
Liverpool is the second largest port and the major export cargo outlet of
the United Kingdom. The port handles one-sixth of Britain’s grain imports,
and has one of the largest grain-handling plants in Europe. There are tobacco
warehouses with a capacity of 70,000 casks, and for wool imports, a warehouse
with a capacity of 30,000 bales. In 1962, 8-4 million tons of imports (excluding
petroleum and cattle) passed through the port. Full use of the new terminal
at Tranmere caused imports of oil to rise from under a million tons in i960
to 6-4 million tons in 1962, and crude oil is now the major commodity entering

the port of Liverpool. To assist the passage of oil tankers to Tranmere, the
Harbour Board have installed an electronic surveying system (which operates
irrespective of weather conditions) covering the sea channels.
Manchester is an inland port, access to which is by the Manchester Ship
Canal. Petroleum is both the main import and export. At Eastham is the
largest oil dock in the United Kingdom, covering 19 acres.
Southampton is the chief port for ocean passenger traffic, and the principal
port for imports of deciduous and citrus fruits. Southampton’s value as a
port is enhanced by its deep water, double tides and its easy access to London.
A considerable volume of oil for the refinery at Fawley (see p. 286) is handled.
Newcastle upon Tyne and the other Tyne ports serve the industrial north¬
east of England and comprise the most important coal-shipping and largest
ship repairing centre in the country.
Hull, on the Humber estuary, serves particularly the industrial centres of
Yorkshire and the Midlands, and is one of the largest white fish ports in
the world. Other imports are grain, timber and oil.
Middlesbrough is one of the largest importing centres in Britain for iron
ore, and exports mainly steel and engineering products.
Swansea has the largest trade of the group of ports serving South Wales.
As well as coal, Swansea exports the steel and tinplate manufactured in its
immediate neighbourhood. It is also an important oil port.
Bristol and nearby Avomnouth serve the industrial Midlands as well as the
city of Bristol itself, and also have a large coastal trade. About 7^ million tons
of cargo are handled annually, including a quarter of Britain’s banana imports
and one-fifth of its tobacco imports. There are also extensive oil installations.
Glasgow, the principal Scottish port, serves as an entrepot centre for the
industrial area of central Scotland, and is the principal outlet for exports of
Scotch whisky.
Leith is the port of the city of Edinburgh. The chief import is grain and
the main export coal from the Lothian coalfields.
Belfast is the principal port of Northern Ireland and handles the main
traffic across the Irish Sea.
Other important ports are Immingham, Cardiff, Newport (Monmouthshire)
and Grangemouth.
Port improvement projects costing over £23 million were completed in 1962.
Among the most important were improvements to the port of Hull, costing
some £6 million. A new dry dock, quay and tanker-cleaning installation at
Greenock on the Firth of Clyde is being built and is expected to cost over
£4 million and to be completed in 1964. At Bristol a programme for providing
additional grain-handling and storage facilities is in hand, a new 30,000-ton
granary, with services, costing £1-4 million was completed in 1963 and
improvements to the oil basin in Avonmouth Docks, costing ^1-5 million,
will be completed in 1964. Important developments are in hand at London,
Liverpool, Hull and other ports, including the Canada-Langton dock
improvement scheme at Liverpool, completed in 1963 at a total cost of about
£20 million, which was opened by the Queen in December 1962.
Since 1948 about a third of the total port capacity has been in public owner¬
ship. Under the provisions of the Transport Act, 1962, the majority of these
ports are managed by the British Transport Docks Board (see p. 368). The
ports of Cardiff, Hull, Swansea and Southampton are among those controlled
by the Docks Board; the conservancy authorities at Southampton and Hull

are the Southampton Harbour Board and the Humber Conservancy Board
respectively.
Certain ports and docks used largely for the cross-channel services of the
railways are administered by the British Railways Board: examples of these
are Folkestone, Holyhead, Heysham, Stranraer and Parkeston Quay (at
Harwich).
In 1962 shipping arrivals at British Transport docks, at which nearly
17,000 were employed at the end of that year, totalled 53 million net tons,
and the total cargo handled was about 60 million tons.
Other ports are controlled by public trusts on which are represented users
of the port (such as shippers, importers and shipping companies) and other
bodies, such as local authorities. Examples are London (controlled by the
Port of London Authority), Liverpool (Mersey Docks and Harbour Board),
Belfast (Belfast Harbour Commissioners) and Glasgow (Clyde Navigation
Trust). The Port of London Authority has 28 members, nominated by
Government departments, local authorities, port users and the Corporation
of Trinity House. A few ports—Bristol is the most important example—are
owned by the town or city council and controlled entirely by a committee
of the council. Finally, there are about 100 ports which are privately owned.
Manchester is the only major port so owned—by the Manchester Ship
Canal Company—and here the Manchester City Council exercises considerable
control by appointing 11 of the company’s 21 directors.
The powers and responsibilities of the port authorities are, in the main,
set down in private Acts of Parliament. A model set of clauses dealing with
many of the details is set out in the Harbours, Docks and Piers Act, 1847.
Most ports are represented on the Dock and Harbour Authorities' Associa¬
tion, formed in 1917 to represent the common interests of port authorities
in their relations with Government, shipowners and traders.
There are about 125,500 people employed in the operation of ports in the
United Kingdom. Just under half of these are administrative, clerical and
technical staff, and pilots, lightermen and customs officials. Over half are the
dock workers (popularly called ‘dockers’) who do the physical handling of cargo.
Shipping arrivals and departures do not all conform to a regular schedule,
with the result that there is sometimes too much work for the dock workers
available, sometimes too little. Dock labour was therefore largely casual
labour until 1941, when war-time schemes were introduced to control the
port registers of employers and workers. The war-time arrangements were
superseded in 1947 by a permanent scheme administered by the National
Dock Labour Board, which consists of a chairman, vice-chairman, and eight
members appointed by the Minister of Labour, four to represent employers
and four to represent employees. Workers on the board’s registers now
receive a guaranteed minimum wage for attendance, even when there is no
work available. The National Joint Council for the Port Transport Industry
agreed in 1959 to a pension scheme which came into operation in January
1961. Proposals for further ‘decasualisation’ are being considered by the
National Joint Council.
Most of the oil tankers coming to the United Kingdom to discharge crude
oil are berthed at special tanker terminals which are near the oil refineries
and are owned and operated by the oil companies. The maximum deadweight
tonnage of tankers able to use some of the most important terminals is:
Finnart (West of Scotland) 100,000; Isle of Grain (Thames estuary) 42,000;

Coryton (London) 45,000; Purfleet (London) 32,000; Thames Haven
(London) 60,000; Tranmere (Liverpool) 65,000; Milford Haven (Pembroke)
100,000; and Fawley (Southampton) 65,000. Long pipelines connect Finnart
with the refinery at Grangemouth on the Firth of Forth, and Milford Haven
with the refinery at Idandarcy (near Swansea).
New terminals for crude oil are planned at Milford Haven and on the River
Tees, whilst the capacity of existing terminals on the Thames and at South¬
ampton is also being increased by dredging.
The report of the Rochdale Committee of Inquiry into the Major Ports of
Great Britain, published in September 1962, recommended the establishment
of a National Ports Authority with statutory powers to supervise a programme of
port development. Among the measures suggested were the concentration
of development at selected major ports, a higher level of investment and more
research. The Committee thought that ports should be regarded as commercial
undertakings and considered that there was no general case for Government
assistance although it might be justified in very exceptional cases.
In March 1963 the Government announced its intention of setting up a
National Ports Council, which would formulate a national ports plan and
keep its execution under continuous supervision; the power to decide on
major development schemes would reside with the Minister of Transport,
to whom the Council would tender advice. The National Ports Council
would have jurisdiction over all ports, whether independent or nationalised,
and one of its functions would be to conduct studies of ports by geographical
areas and to make recommendations to the Minister for grouping them where
this would make for greater efficiency.
The National Ports Council was set up on a non-statutory basis in July 1963,
pending the legislation which will be needed to enable the Council to carry
out all the functions envisaged for it.
INLAND TRANSPORT
The dense passenger and freight traffic of Great Britain1 is carried mainly
by road and rail, although coastal shipping and, to a lesser extent, inland
waterways are important in carrying certain types of freight, particularly
bulk cargoes.
Part of the inland transport system of Great Britain is nationalised; namely,
the railways, London passenger transport, certain road haulage and road
passenger services, inland waterways and some of the vessels on them. Many
local authorities and private firms run road passenger services, while road
haulage is largely, and coastal shipping entirely, in the hands of private
enterprise.
Table 24 gives comparative figures relating to the carrying activities of the
nationalised transport undertakings in Great Britain. At the end of 1962 the
nationalised section owned 24 per cent of the 93,000 public road passenger
vehicles and over 21 per cent of the 1,418,800 road goods vehicles in use.
British Railways and Road Services and London Transport were responsible
for 39 per cent of the 15,996 million passenger journeys made in public
passenger vehicles in 1962. In the spring of 1963 there were 6 million motor
cars and 1-4 million motor cycles, scooters and mopeds licensed for use on
the roads.
1 For an account of inland transport in Northern Ireland, see p. 380.
366
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
In 1958 the Ministry of Transport made a sample survey (the most recent
published) of goods transport by road. According to this survey, 76 per cent
of the total tonnage carried in 1958 (estimated at 1,320 million tons) went
by road, while in terms of ton-mileage1 * the proportion was 45 per cent. The
railways accounted for 19 per cent of all tonnage carried and 35 per cent of
ton-mileage. The proportions for coastal shipping were 4 per cent and 20 per
cent, respectively, and for inland waterways 1 per cent of the total tonnage.
Although the volume of goods transported by the railways was reduced
considerably in 1958 by the fall in demand for coal and for iron and steel,
the survey affirmed that it was clear that, whatever unit of measurement was
used, road transport was now the major means of inland carriage of goods.
According to a survey carried out in the second quarter of 1962 (the complete
results of which had not yet appeared in September 1963), of the total ton-
mileage carried by road and rail, 69 per cent was by road. The corresponding
figure for 1958 was estimated to be 61 per cent.
Between 1958 and 1962 the number of vehicle-miles travelled by motor
cars on the roads of Britain is estimated to have increased by 46 per cent,
while in the case of light vans and other goods vehicles the increases were
30 and 20 per cent respectively. The growth of private and commercial
motor traffic is causing congestion problems of increasing severity, especially
in large cities (see p. 377).
A survey of needs for inland transport facilities during the next twenty
years, published by the Ministry of Transport in 1963, envisages an annual
rate of increase in total traffic of 4 to 5 per cent; a large rise in ownership
of private cars by 1980; and a further switch of goods traffic from rail to road.
NATIONALISED
TRANSPORT
The present role and structure of the nationalised transport undertakings are
the result of a series of legislative measures passed over the last 15 years.
Transport
Legislation,
I947-56
On 1 st January, 1948, in accordance with the provisions of the Transport
Act of 1947, the British Transport Commission (BTC), came into being and
assumed control of Britain’s railways, all railway-owned steamships, docks,
hotel and road transport interests, most of the country’s canals (including all
those owned by the railways) and the whole of the London passenger transport
system. In addition, the BTC was to arrange for the gradual acquisition of
privately owned long-distance road haulage firms. Road passenger transport
outside London was not taken over, but the BTC was given powers to prepare
area schemes for co-ordinating passenger services by road and rail, including
power to acquire road passenger undertakings for this purpose. A considerable
amount of road haulage, several waterways and many docks were left outside
the Commission’s scope.
The Conservative Government which took office in 1951 announced a new
policy for the operation of public transport, including decentralisation of the
railway administration, greater freedom to adopt normal commercial practice
(particularly in charging), the partial return of long-distance road haulage to
private enterprise, and the revocation of the commission’s power to make
schemes for the co-ordination of road and rail passenger services. The policy
was put into effect by the Transport Act of 1953, and the actual reorganisation
of the BTC was completed by 1st January, 1955. A further Act, the Transport
(Disposal of Road Haulage Property) Act, 1956, provided for the completion
of the denationalisation of road haulage.
1 Ton-mileage is calculated by multiplying the tonnage carried by the actual distance
it was transported.

The British Transport Commission (whose members were appointed by and
responsible to the Minister of Transport) was a policy-making and not a
managing body. Management functions were carried out by seven divisions,
corresponding to various activities, namely: British Railways, British Road
Services, the Tilling Bus Group, the Scottish Omnibus Group, British
Transport Docks, British Waterways, and British Transport Hotels and
Catering Services.
The London Transport Executive was established by the Transport Act,
1947, as an agent of the BTC to operate road passenger transport and the
underground railways in the London area.
The BTC was required to submit an annual report and statement of
accounts to the Minister, who laid it before Parliament. The Commission
was under obligation to cover its outgoings, taking one year with another,
but during the period of railway modernisation it was permitted to carry
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
forward the deficits arising on British Railways. Meanwhile, in order to meet
financial needs during the critical years of reconstruction, the Government,
under the Transport (Railway Finances) Act, 1957, and the Transport
(Borrowing Powers) Act, 1959, was empowered to make repayable advances
to the Commission of up to £400 million to meet the annual revenue deficits
until 1962. From the financial year 1960-61 these deficits were met by the
Exchequer from revenue and are not repayable advances. The Commission’s
ordinary borrowing powers (i.e. excluding those to meet deficits) had been
limited to £1,200 million.
Reorganisation
Under the
Transport Act
of 1962
Statutory Boards
Duties and Rights
of the Boards
The Transport Act, 1962, gave effect to the Government’s policy, set out
in the White Paper on the Reorganisation of the Nationalised Transport
Undertakings. The Government concluded that the activities of the British
Transport Commission were so large and diverse that they could not be run
effectively as a single undertaking. The commercial capacity of the railways
was circumscribed by outmoded statutory obligations and restrictions on
their trading operations. Mounting deficits, the size of the capital debt in
relation to the earning capacity of the assets and the increasing burden of
interest as modernisation proceeded, were detrimental to the morale of
railwaymen, to financial control, and to hopes of recovery. The Government
therefore proposed that each of the main activities of the Commission should
be managed by a separate board, holding its own assets and responsible for
its own capital debt.
The Transport Act, 1962, dissolved the BTC1 and set up four boards for
British Railways, London Transport, British Transport Docks and British
Waterways, each of which is responsible directly to the Minister of Transport,
who appoints the members. Road passenger and haulage undertakings, such
as British Road Services, the Tilling Bus Group, the Scottish Omnibus
Group, Road Freight Shipping Services, Thomas Cook and Son and other
holdings, are operated as companies incorporated under the Companies Act,
with their own boards; they are grouped under a Transport Holding Company,
responsible to the Minister of Transport, who appoints its directors. The
hotel property of the BTC was transferred to British Transport Hotels Ltd.,
a wholly owned subsidiary, first of the BTC and later of the British Railways
Board.
The cross-channel shipping services operated by British Railways and
certain ports and docks used for them passed to the British Railways
Board.
Each board is required to conduct its business so as to pay its way, taking
one year with another, and to set up general reserves. The Railways Board
and the British Waterways Board may receive financial assistance from the
Exchequer for five years from vesting date. All the boards may borrow up to
specified limits from the Minister with the approval of the Treasury. The
Act facilitates operations on a commercial basis by conferring on the boards
powers to sell or develop their land and to construct and operate pipelines,
and by freeing them from controlled charges schemes. Except for railway
passenger fares in the London Passenger Transport area and road passenger
fares in an area including London, the boards are free to fix the rates charged
for their services. The boards are also released from common carrier obliga¬
tions as regards carriage by rail or inland waterway.
1 The BTC remained in existence until 1st October, 1963, to facilitate the transfer
of its undertakings and property to the new boards.

The Treasury assumed responsibility for outstanding British Transport
stock (amounting to about £1,450 million), so that interest on this debt is
now met out of taxation instead of the BTC’s receipts. The Treasury
assumed responsibility for Exchequer advances for capital purposes, which
amounted to about £690 million by the end of 1962, and for about £300
million lent to the BTC since 1957 to meet revenue deficits. Altogether, the
community as a whole assumed responsibility for debt amounting to about
£2,440 million.
A Nationalised Transport Advisory Council of up to twelve members has
been established to advise the Minister on questions relating to the co¬
ordination, or any other aspect, of the nationalised transport undertakings.
At present the Minister presides over the council.
The Transport Tribunal, set up under the 1947 Act, had jurisdiction over
the charges schemes governing maximum charges which the British Transport
Commission could make in respect of all its activities save road services. It
could also hear appeals arising from applications for road haulage (goods
vehicles) licences. Under the 1962 Act, the tribunal sits in two divisions, one
having jurisdiction over London rail and road fares and the other continuing
to hear appeals relating to road carriers’ licences.
The 1947 Act set up a structure of Area Transport Users’ Consultative Com¬
mittees which could consider criticisms of nationalised transport services and
suggestions made for improving them. The Area Committees sent their
findings to the Central Transport Consultative Committee which could make
formal recommendations. Where it did so, the Minister had power to give
directions to the BTC. The committees continue under the 1962 Act, with
some changes in functions and membership. In particular, they have been
given a principal role in a new statutory procedure for effecting railway
passenger service closures. The Area Committees consider objections from
users to such proposals and report to the Minister on any hardship which is
likely to arise. The Minister considers the Area Committee’s report and
decides whether, bearing in mind all the issues involved, he should consent
to the closure.
The main features of the previous safeguards for coastal shipping were that a
complaint might be made on behalf of coastal shipping to the Transport
Tribunal if charges made or proposed by the railways in competition with
coastal shipping place coastal carriers at an unfair disadvantage, or were in¬
adequate in relation to the cost of the service provided. The 1962 Act provides
that complaints of this kind can be made to the Minister.
Britain was the pioneer of railways. The opening of the Stockton to Darlington
Railway in 1825, and of the Liverpool and Manchester line in 1830, when
George Stephenson’s famous ‘Rocket’ locomotive was used, began a century
of widespread railway development. The great period of railway building
was from 1840 to 1875, with a short lull following the collapse of the specula¬
tive railway boom in 1846.
During the first world war, the railways came under centralised Govern¬
ment direction through a Railway Executive Committee. This experience
emphasised the need for concentration and a reorganisation of the whole
rail system. The Railways Act of 1921 amalgamated 123 private companies
into four large groups: the London, Midland and Scottish; London and
North Eastern; Great Western; and Southern. In the 1920s and 1930s the
railways suffered from the prolonged industrial depression and the growing

competition from road transport. The causes of road competition were two¬
fold: first, motor transport often offered cheaper and better facilities;
secondly, the statutory regulation of the railways’ charging system resulted
in the loss of some lucrative traffic and the forced retention of unprofitable
traffic.
In 1938 the railways made proposals for relief from statutory regulation of
charges, but the outbreak of war in 1939 postponed action and the railways
again became controlled by the Government.
The Transport Act of 1947 brought the railways under public ownership as
a single enterprise, British Railways, grouped in six regional sub-divisions
and operated under the overall management of a Railway Executive established
as the agent of the BTC.
The 1953 Transport Act abolished the Railway Executive and provided
for a reorganisation of the administration. The operation of British Railways
was placed in the hands of six area boards (the areas corresponding with the
former regions), day-to-day management being left to the general managers
of the areas. Important matters affecting general policy were reserved to the
BTC and were dealt with by the British Railways Division and the Railways
Sub-Commission.
Under the Transport Act, 1962, the British Railways Board assumed
responsibility for running the railways. Area boards are replaced by regional
railway boards to which the British Railways Board delegates responsibility
for the management and operation of their regional railway systems.
Statistics relating to the operations and traffic revenue of British Railways are
given in Table 24. The number of passenger miles travelled increased between
1955 and i960; but there was a fall in 1962, compared with i960. The urban
and suburban passenger commuting services for London and other large
conurbations carry about 2-| million passengers a day, mainly to and from
their work in brief rush hour periods. These services account for about half
the annual total of 1,000 million passengers on British Railways. The number
of freight ton-miles carried decreased by 25 per cent between 1955 and 1962.
Traffic revenue increased, partly owing to increases in fares and freight
charges.
British Transport Hotels Ltd. owned refreshment rooms at 326 stations
and also 38 hotels. These contributed £20 million to gross receipts. At 78 of
the stations, tenants operated refreshment services.
Because of the economic difficulties of the early 1930s, the strain of the war
years, and the numerous post-war claims on national resources, for many
years it had not been possible for the railways to carry out any large modern¬
isation schemes or to maintain an adequate replacement programme. The
Government and the BTC decided that this should be remedied and, in 1955,
the BTC produced a modernisation plan which was designed to transform
virtually all the services offered by the railways. Since then the plan has
been modified in the light of economic and technical developments which
have occurred since its conception. But some £1,000 million was invested in
British Railways and their associated activities in the eight years 1955-62,
and capital expenditure is still substantial, with investment in 1963 estimated
to reach £115 million.
In 1955 there were on main lines about 18,000 steam, 7 main line diesel
and 71 electric locomotives. At the end of 1962 the corresponding figures

were 8,767 steam, 1,673 diesel and 178 electric locomotives. In addition,
there were 4,074 diesel and 6,958 electric passenger-carrying multiple units.
The phase of railway modernisation represented by the diesel multiple unit
was completed by 1961. The total fleet of diesel shunting locomotives at
the end of 1962 was 2,010, which completed the BTC’s requirements in
this field.
Passenger services have continued to improve as steam is replaced by
electric or diesel traction. The replacement of out-of-date passenger coaches
by new stock, with improved amenities, continues and diesel electric de luxe
trains are in operation on routes from London to Manchester, to Birmingham,
to Wolverhampton, and elsewhere.
The efficiency of freight services is being improved as new and modern
type freight vehicles come into service and as facilities become available for
concentrating freight traffic at fewer and better equipped and better sited
marshalling yards and terminals. For example, a new marshalling yard is
being constructed at Sheffield at a cost of over £6 million. This yard will
be capable of sorting wagons quickly for the 130 different destinations for
which traffic passing through the area requires to be marshalled. Many
other new freight facilities, such as the hump marshalling yard at Port Talbot
(Margam) which is among the most modern in Europe and cost about
£2-8 million, are now in use.
The installation of modern colour-light signalling, coupled with the
installation of either electro-mechanical or power-operated signal boxes and
the rapid extension of the automatic warning system, is enabling faster and
more frequent trains to be run with a greater degree of safety. A scheme
is in hand, costing about £5 million, for the complete modernisation of
signalling on the main line between London and Didcot (an important
junction in Berkshire).
One of the most important suburban electrification schemes carried out is
that of the Glasgow central lines (‘Blue Train service’) at a cost of nearly
.£13 million. The extension of the Southern Region’s electrification of the line
to the Kent coast at a cost of over £20 million has been completed. Good
progress is also being made on the electrification of the London Midland
Region’s lines from Euston via Crewe to Liverpool, including the lines
serving the industrial complexes around Birmingham, Northampton and
Stoke-on-Trent, at a cost of about £175 million. This expenditure includes the
cost of rolling-stock and works such as overhead equipment, signalling
improvements and station modernisation.
On other main lines, and in specific areas, steam traction is being eliminated
by diesel traction as quickly as economic and other factors allow.
A report, The Reshaping of British Railways, was published by the British
Railways Board in March 1963. Based on the most massive compilation and
systematic analysis of information about the railways ever attempted, it
contained proposals for discontinuing many services the operation of which
seemed no longer justifiable and for improving others to attract new traffic
to the railways. The report expressed the view that by implementation of the
proposals, as a whole, much of the railways’ deficit (though not necessarily all)
should be eliminated by 1970.
The Minister of Transport has said that the report offers a firm prospect
of an efficient and modern railway system, handling those traffics technically
best suited to rail, and that it is a major contribution to the Government’s
372
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
ROADS
Development
Motorways
policy of providing an efficient, economic and well-balanced transport system
for Britain as a whole. Study of the implications of the report continues.
The advent of the motor vehicle made it necessary for the Government to
set up a central road authority; accordingly, the Road Board was established
by the Development and Road Improvement Funds Act of 1909. In 1919
the board’s responsibilities were taken over by the newly established Ministry
of Transport.
In April 1962 Great Britain had 196,135 miles of public highway. There
were 145 miles of motorway, 8,340 miles of trunk roads, 19,760 miles of
Class I roads, 17,620 miles of Class II roads, 48,950 miles of Class III roads
and 101,320 miles of unclassified roads. Roads are classified according to
their traffic value, those of purely local traffic importance remaining un¬
classified. On maps and signposts the trunk and Class I roads can usually
be identified by the letter ‘A’ in front of a route number, and Class II roads
by a letter ‘B’. Trunk roads are the main arteries of national traffic and the
whole cost of their upkeep is met from Exchequer funds. The Minister of
Transport is the highway authority for trunk roads in England and Wales
and on these roads he administers expenditure, which is provided wholly
from central Government sources, although for many purposes he employs
local authorities as his agents. The highway authority for Class I, Class II
and Class III roads is, in general, the council of the county or county borough
in whose area the road lies. The Minister makes grants towards approved
expenditure on construction and improvement of these roads at the rate of
75, 60 or 50 per cent according to the class of road. (Classified roads include
nearly all the main streets of the large cities.) The Secretary of State for
Scotland has corresponding responsibilities for roads in Scotland. Unclassified
roads are entirely the responsibility of the local authority in whose area they lie.
While it was impossible in the years immediately following the second world
war to spend much more on the roads than was required for their essential
maintenance, a large road-building programme has now been in progress for
several years. Central Government expenditure on new construction and
major improvements has recently been rising steadily: for the whole of Great
Britain in the year 1960-61 it was £72-6 million and in the year 1963-64 it
is expected to be ^117-3 million. In the five years 1963-68 expenditure is
expected to reach ^660 million and a substantial part will be in the form of
grants to local authorities for work on classified roads, mainly in urban areas.
The current programme includes Britain’s first motorways, constructed for
the use of limited classes of traffic under the powers granted to the ministers
by the Special Roads Act, 1949 (now consolidated in the Highways Act, 1959).
The motorways form part of a programme designed to provide a national
network of modern through routes. At the same time, work done under this
programme will eliminate the worst bottlenecks in urban areas and thus give
free outlets from the big cities and from other main sources of traffic to the
trunk routes, while smaller road-works will be undertaken to the maximum
possible extent all over the country.
It is planned that 1,000 miles of motorways should be completed by the
1970s. At the end of April 1963 there were 204 miles of motorway in use
and 154 under construction; contracts had been placed, tenders invited or
schemes prepared for another 252 miles. A further 387 miles were being
surveyed for inclusion in the second half of the 1960s. The motorways in
Great Britain open to traffic or under construction were:
TRANSPORT AND COMMUNICATIONS
373
M i—London to Yorkshire. The projected length of this motorway is
about 190 miles, of which 73 have been open to traffic since 1959. Con¬
struction of the section from Crick (in Northampton) to Yorkshire started
in 1962, with the 26-mile length from Crick to Markfield (in Leicestershire).
M 2—Medway motorway, London to Dover. The 25 miles of this motorway
came into use in 1963.
M 4—London to South Wales. The projected length of this road, which
will link London with Cardiff and Swansea and will include a new .£11
million bridge over the Severn, is 134 miles. By April 1963 a 6-mile bypass
at Maidenhead and a 51-mile bypass at Slough had been completed. A
further 14! miles were under construction.
M 5—Birmingham to Bristol. Of this 102-mile motorway, the first 28 miles
running south from Birmingham were opened in July 1962. The 2o|-mile
Ross Spur (M 50), opened in i960, will link the M 5 with the existing
road system leading from Ross-on-Wye (Herefordshire) to South Wales.
M 6—Birmingham to Penrith. The projected length of this road, which
will run from Dunston (north of Birmingham) to Penrith (Cumberland)
is 153 miles. Sections completed total 37 miles and include the 8|-mile
Preston bypass, the first section of motorway, opened in 1958. The remainder
of the in miles between Stafford and Lancaster are under construction
and due to be finished early in 1965. A system of motorway links will
connect this road at its southern end with the M 1 and M 5.
In Scotland, motorways are planned between Glasgow and Edinburgh,
Edinburgh and Stirling and for a 16-mile section, south of Glasgow, of the
Glasgow-Carlisle route. Work started in 1963 on the first section (over 5 miles)
of the Glasgow to Edinburgh motorway.
Other Roads Notable schemes for improving existing trunk roads include those for the
Great North Road (Ai) between London and Newcastle, of which 162^ miles
of dual carriageway, several sections built to motorway standards, are already
open. Improvements are being made on the A40 route, linking London with
Gloucester and South Wales via Oxford, including a 13^-mile bypass around
High Wycombe in Buckinghamshire, built to motorway standards, and work
is expected to start in the spring of 1964. Sixteen schemes, each costing over
^ 100,000 and amounting in all to over £12 million, were started in Great
Britain in the latter half of 1962.
In Scotland, the trunk roads in the central belt and to Carlisle, where
industrial traffic is greatest, are to be improved to provide dual carriageways.
Bridges and Tunnels The largest bridge building programme in Britain for over a century is in
progress. The j£2-3 million Medway Bridge, which is part of M 2 and is the
largest pre-stressed concrete structure of its kind in the world, was completed
in 1963 and the new suspension bridge across the Firth of Forth, the main
span of which is the largest of its kind in Europe, is due for completion in 1964.
The Severn Bridge, whose main span is nearly as long as that of the Forth
Bridge, is due for completion in 1966, and work has started on a bridge across
the Firth of Tay.
Work has been in progress since i960 on the second Blackwall Tunnel
(under the Thames), which is expected to cost ^6-5 million and is due for
completion in 1965. Work on the j£i2-6 million Tyne Tunnel between
Wallsend (Northumberland) and Jarrow (Durham) was started during 1961.
The first Whiteinch Tunnel (under the Clyde) and the £11 million Dartford-
Purfleet tunnel (under the Thames) were completed in 1963.

Research on roads is carried out at the Road Research Laboratory (see p. 214).
Its aims are to find more economical ways of designing, constructing and
maintaining roads and of facilitating the flow of traffic on them and to reduce
road accidents. The layout of roads, their traffic, the safety features of road
vehicles and the behaviour of road users are investigated, and new methods,
materials and processes are developed for building roads and providing them
with a smooth, safe and durable surface. The Laboratory has a Tropical
Section, which undertakes research and advice on road problems overseas.
Late in 1962 there were 10-5 million motor vehicles licensed to use Great
Britain’s roads. Of these, 1-4 million were goods vehicles and 92,000 were
public road passenger vehicles (i.e. buses, trolleybuses and taxicabs).
The first world war greatly stimulated the development of motor vehicles,
and road transport began to make itself felt as a serious competitor of the
railways. The first step towards Government regulation of public road
transport was the passing of the London Traffic Act of 1924, which gave the
Minister of Transport power to control the number of buses and their
journeys in London; this was followed, in 1933, by the setting up of the
London Passenger Transport Board (see p. 379). In 1928 a Royal Commission
was appointed to examine the problems that had arisen out of the growth of
motor traffic. The recommendations of this commission led to the introduction
of further legislation.
The Road Traffic Act, I93°> ended the licensing of public service vehicles
(i.e. buses and coaches) by local authorities and set up instead traffic areas,
of which there are now eleven, covering the whole country and each under
the control of three traffic commissioners (except for the London metropolitan
area, which has one) appointed by the Minister. The commissioners regulate,
by means of a licensing system, all public road passenger transport services,
and they sanction routes and time-tables in order to secure proper co-ordina¬
tion of services and eliminate unnecessary competition; they may also control
fares. Competing operators and local authorities are entitled to raise objections
concerning applications to the commissioners for new licences or the renewal
of existing licences and to appeal to the Minister of Transport against the
commissioners’ decisions.
The Road and Rail Traffic Act, I933> based upon the recommendations of
the Royal Commission and of an experts’ report (the Salter Report) of 1932,
established a system of licensing for road haulage vehicles, which is still in
operation, designed to restrict vehicle operations to proved needs and to
eliminate wasteful competition. A licence has to be secured from the licensing
authority (the chairman of the appropriate body of traffic commissioners)
before a goods vehicle can be used on the road. There are three types of
licence: the ‘A’ licence for general public haulage; the ‘B’ licence for public
haulage limited to certain goods or certain areas and covering also the
carriage of the licensee’s own goods; and the ‘C’ licence for the carriage by
traders solely of their own goods. Applications for ‘A’ and ‘B’ licences are
examined by the licensing authorities to see if they are necessary in view of
existing transport services, and competitors may raise objections. There is
a right of appeal to the Transport Tribunal against the decision of the
licensing authorities. The ‘C’ licence is granted on application, as of right.
All goods vehicle operators are bound by regulations concerning the fitness and
loading of vehicles, the movement of large vehicles likely to obstruct traffic,
the keeping of records, and driving hours and rest periods of their employees.

BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Under the Transport Act, 1947, the BTC took over ‘A’ and ‘B’ hauliers
predominantly engaged on long-distance haulage; vehicles operating under
‘C’ licences and those used for carrying certain specialised traffic were not
affected. After the change of Government in 1951, the Transport Act of
1953 required the BTC to dispose of the bulk of its road haulage undertaking.
In 1956 this process was halted by the Transport (Disposal of Road Haulage
Property) Act, which enabled the Commission to retain under its control
more vehicles than were permitted under the 1953 Act. Altogether, the
Commission disposed of 20,000 vehicles. From September 1956 British Road
Services (BRS), were a division of the Commission, and conducted their
business through the medium of five companies which together owned about
16,000 vehicles: British Road Services Ltd. (general haulage); BRS (Pickfords)
Ltd. (special traffic and some contracts); BRS (Contracts) Ltd.; BRS (Parcels)
Ltd.; and BRS (Meat Haulage) Ltd. All the companies’ vehicles are subject
to the licensing system.
Since January 1963 these organisations have been operating as companies
incorporated under the Companies Act, with their own boards. As a result of
the 1962 Transport Act, they are grouped under the newly created Transport
Holding Company, responsible to the Minister of Transport.
The number of licensed vehicles in the road goods transport industry rose
from 1-2 million in 1955 to 1-4 million in 1962. The percentages with ‘C’
licences were 78-3 in 1955 and 80-4 in 1962 (1,266,000 vehicles). Of the
other 192,000 vehicles, with ‘A’ and ‘B’ licences, about 13,800 are operated
by British Road Services and the rest are operated by some 63,000 hauliers.
There are only a few operators with large fleets of vehicles in any of the
licence categories. ‘C’ licence vehicles include a large number of small
vehicles used locally in the delivery of groceries and other goods. Other vehicles
in this class are engaged in long-distance carriage of traders’ own goods. A
sample survey made by the Traders Road Transport Association in 1958
indicated that ‘C’ licence operators with fleets of over 100 vehicles were
probably fewer than 3 per cent of the total number of operators, but accounted
for over half the ‘C’ licence vehicles in use in the country.
In the summer of 1963 the Minister of Transport appointed an independent
committee of inquiry to examine the licensing system for road haulage and to
make recommendations.
With the exception of the London transport system which is operated by the
London Transport Board, road passenger transport in Great Britain is run
by about 5,000 operators, 94 of them being local authorities owning and
operating urban bus services. About 4,000 are independent operators of
coaches and of these, 3,600 have not more than 5 vehicles. Most of the
remainder operate both bus and coach services and belong to three main
groups—Tilling, Scottish Omnibuses and British Electric Traction. The
British Electric Traction Group is a private concern but substantial share¬
holdings in many of its companies, without any controlling interest, are held
by the British Transport Holding Company, who own the Tilling and
Scottish Omnibus groups outright.
In May 1963 there were 52 concerns operating fleets of over 250
vehicles, 13 of which were local authorities, the largest being the Birmingham
Council, with 1,749 buses and coaches. Glasgow, where the last tramcars in
ordinary municipal services in Britain made their final journey in September
1962, had 190 trolleybuses and 1,35° buses and coaches; Manchester had
1,345 buses and 115 trolleybuses. During 1962 Birmingham transport

carried 146 million passengers, Glasgow, 465 million and Manchester,

Road Safety
Measures
and Traffic
Problems
Relief of Congestion
Britain has the highest density of traffic in the world, giving rise to pressing
problems of road safety. In 1962, 6,709 people were killed on the roads and
335,ooo injured. This compares with 7,343 persons killed and 231,603
injured in 1934, when there were only million motor vehicles on the roads
—an indication that the problems have, to some extent, been held in check
by road safety measures introduced under Acts of 1934, 1956, and i960. In
fact, the number killed and injured in 1962 was only very slightly higher
than in 1959, despite a 30 per cent increase in the total of cars licensed for
use on the roads. Among the most important safety measures are a speed
limit of 30 miles an hour in built-up areas, modified later by the introduction
of a 40 m.p.h. limit on certain main roads on the outskirts of London and a
50 m.p.h. limit on certain roads during peak periods of summer holiday
traffic; the requirement that all new drivers must pass a driving test; the
provision of pedestrian crossings, including some illuminated by flashing
beacons and marked with conspicuous white stripes (zebra crossings); and a
system of road markings, including double white lines at dangerous bends,
to keep traffic to its own side of the road and prohibit parking.
Private motor cars and motor cycles and goods vehicles up to 30 cwt.
which are five years old or more may not legally be used on public roads
without a valid certificate of road worthiness.
All drivers of motor vehicles—including motor cycles, motor scooters and
powered pedal cycles—have to pass a driving test before being granted a
substantive licence to drive1; until they pass the test they must obtain a
‘provisional’ licence which necessitates their displaying ‘L’ (Learner) plates
and in all cases where vehicles are constructed to carry passengers, other than
pillion passengers, learner drivers must be accompanied by a qualified driver.
The Road Traffic Act, 1962, which came into force in May 1963, redefined
the standard of unfitness to drive a motor vehicle when the driver is under
the influence of alcohol or drugs and increased the severity of penalties for
dangerous driving.
In addition, vigorous road safety campaigns are conducted by local authori¬
ties with the aid of Government grants. The Royal Society for the Prevention
of Accidents, which acts as the Government’s agent in this connection,
assists and co-ordinates these campaigns. The police and education authorities
are actively at work in the cause of road safety. The standard of conduct
for all road users—pedestrians and drivers—is set out in the Highway Code.
A failure to observe the code does not of itself render a person liable to
criminal proceedings but may be taken into account in any such proceedings.
There is a Pedestrians’ Association for Road Safety, a voluntary society
which promotes the reduction of road accidents.
The Road Traffic and Roads Improvement Act, i960, permits the employment
of traffic wardens (with strictly limited powers), and provides for fixed
penalties (the ‘ticket’ system) for parking offences. Other measures in the
Act, designed to reduce traffic congestion, include the granting of greater
powers of action to the Minister of Transport within London and to local
traffic authorities in other areas. Several extensive schemes for the improve¬
ment of road safety and the relief of traffic congestion are being undertaken:
these include ‘fly-overs’ at road junctions; new outlet roads from cities; and

the designation of certain stretches of trunk roads as ‘clearways’, on which
waiting on the carriageway is (with certain exceptions) prohibited.
In London and certain other large towns, such as Manchester and New¬
castle upon Tyne, street parking in certain areas is permitted only for limited
periods and on payment at parking meters, and increased off-street parking
facilities are being provided. In i960 a London Traffic Management Unit
was established, charged with securing the maximum use of London’s streets
as traffic arteries by applying modern traffic engineering techniques. Measures
taken to improve the flow of traffic in the London area include the wider use
of parking meters and the introduction of a one-way traffic plan in central
London and the institution of peak-hour clearways on certain main roads.
In 1761 James Brindley completed the Bridgewater Canal to take coal from
the collieries owned by the Duke of Bridgewater at Worsley to Manchester.
This marked the beginning of canal building in modern Britain; and canals
played an important part in promoting the industrial and commercial
expansion in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries. As railway
competition developed, about one-third of the canal mileage passed to the
control of the railways. During the first world war Government control of
railways included railway-owned canals and, under the Transport Act, 1947,
most of the country’s canals passed from Government control, which had
been re-established in the second world war, to that of the British Transport
Commission in January 1948. From 1955 the canals were managed separately
by the waterways division of the Commission, known as British Waterways;
under the Transport Act, 1962, control has been vested in a British Waterways
Board since 1st January, 1963.
There are some 2,500 miles of navigable inland waterways in Great Britain,
some 1,850 miles of which belong to the British Waterways Board; the
remainder is mainly still in the hands of local authorities or private companies.
About 1,000 miles of the Board’s canals are narrow waterways which can
generally be used only by boats not exceeding 7 feet in width, capable of
carrying a load varying from 25 to 30 tons; the remainder are broad waterways
and canalised rivers which can be used by craft of up to 400 tons capacity.
The canals in Scotland are all broad waterways.
Of the 1,850 miles of inland waterways under the control of the British
Waterways Board, 100 miles are closed to navigation or abandoned, leaving
1,750 miles still open, of which 1,200 miles are in commercial use. For
administrative purposes the canals in England and Wales are grouped into
four divisions, based on the main navigable river estuaries, each group under
a divisional manager. In Scotland, the Caledonian Canal and the Crinan
Canal each have a separate manager, and the Forth and Clyde, Monkland and
Union Canals are grouped together under another manager.
In 1962 total traffic on British Waterways amounted to 9-3 million tons,
of which 3-9 million tons were coal, 2-2 million tons liquids in bulk and
3-2 million tons general cargo. The total traffic is stated in ton-miles in
Table 24. Some three-quarters of the total traffic is carried on 325 miles of
the broad waterways, which are mainly canalised rivers.
Although British Waterways is the largest single operator, most of the
traffic is handled by independent carriers, or by traders in their own craft.
The Board at the end of 1962 owned 16 tugs and 1,045 carrying craft, with
a carrying capacity of 42,500 tons, including 132 power-driven craft with a
carrying capacity of 7,000 tons.

The London

Under the control of the BTC, the commercial organisation was strengthened;
it improved dredging methods and equipment, brought better types of craft
into service, established a research organisation and undertook various
development works. Following the report, issued in 1955, by a specially
appointed Board of Survey, a comprehensive development plan was begun
in 1956. Under this plan, nearly ^6 million was invested in the improvement
of navigation and the provision of modern equipment on the seven major
waterways that carry most of the traffic—the Aire and Calder Navigation,
the Sheffield and South Yorkshire Navigation, the Trent Navigation, the
river Lee, the river Severn, including the Gloucester and Sharpness Canal,
the river Weaver, and the Grand Union Canal (on the stretch below
Berkhamsted). With the near completion of the plan in 1963, the British
Waterways Board controls about 300 miles of first-class waterways linking
important industrial districts with ports; further investments in improved
facilities are being made.
The total revenue of British Waterways in 1962 amounted to ^4-6 million,
of which only ^0-9 million arose from carrying activities. The sale of water is
an important source of revenue and has trebled since 1948. British Waterways
encourages pleasure boating and receipts from this source are rising but as
yet constitute only just over 2 per cent of total revenue. British Waterways
does not usually own fishing rights and income from this source is very small.
London is, with Tokyo and New York, one of the world’s three largest cities.
The area known as Greater London, within a radius of about 15 miles from
Charing Cross, contains over 8J million people.
London’s passenger transport system, in its modern sense, began in 1829
when the first omnibus, horse-drawn, appeared on the London streets. The
first regular tram service, also horse-drawn, began in 1870. In 1863 the first
underground steam railway, the Metropolitan, was built by digging a great
trench for the line and roofing it over. In 1870 the world’s first tube railway,
the Tower Subway, was constructed under the river Thames; it was cable-
operated and ran for only a few months. In 1890 the first electric tube railway
in the world was opened, the City and South London line, and this was
followed in 1900 by the opening of the Central London Railway and shortly
afterwards by the electrification of the steam-operated underground lines.
Meanwhile, horse-drawn buses and trams were being replaced by motor
buses and electric trams.
Until 1933 there were many separate undertakings providing passenger
transport facilities in London, but in that year these were all vested in a single
public corporation, the London Passenger Transport Board. In 1948, with
the establishment of the British Transport Commission, the London Trans¬
port Executive took over control as an agency of the Commission.
Under the Transport Act, 1962, as in the case of the other BTC under¬
takings, the London Transport Executive has been replaced by a financially
independent board, known as the London Transport Board.
The London Transport undertaking operates all road and rail passenger
transport services in the London area with the exception of the London lines
of British Railways and the taxicabs. (Some 6,000 taxicabs that ply for hire
in the streets are privately operated by companies or owner-drivers and are
licensed annually by the metropolitan police.) London Transport’s operations
extend beyond Greater London to cover an area of 2,000 square miles (known
as the London Passenger Transport Area) with a radius of about 25 miles

from Charing Cross and with a population of some 10 million. Between 1955
and 1962 the number of passenger journeys made annually on the London
Transport system fell from 4,079 million to 3,153 million, largely owing to
increased private motoring and changes in leisure-time habits and also some
shifting of population away from the centre of London.
London Transport’s railway network stretches 18 miles from north to south
and 32 miles from east to west. The total length of the railway over which
London Transport trains operate is 244 miles, of which 90 miles are under¬
ground, including the longest tube tunnel in the world, 17J miles long.
London Transport trains serve 271 stations. London Transport’s buses and
coaches travel over more than 3,100 miles of roads. To carry traffic over all
this area, in December 1962 London Transport owned 4,267 railway cars
and 8,679 buses and coaches. The total staff employed was 76,000.
Improvements carried out by London Transport since the war have
included complete renewal of the bus and coach fleet, replacement of trams
and trolleybuses by diesel buses, extension and modernisation of parts of the
Underground system and renewal of half the railway rolling stock fleet.
Recently, work was started on the building of a new io|-mile tube railway
between Victoria Station and Walthamstow, in north-east London. It is
estimated that the work will cost at least £56 million and completion is
expected in 1968.
Passenger transport in Belfast is provided by the Belfast Corporation and
private hauliers are engaged in freight transport in the cities of Belfast and
Londonderry. All other public road passenger and freight services and all
rail services in Northern Ireland are provided by the Ulster Transport
Authority, a public body which was established under the Transport Act
(Northern Ireland), 1948.
The road passenger section of the authority’s undertaking operates a wide
network of omnibus services and an extensive programme of coach tours.
The road freight section provides a comprehensive service for the carriage
of merchandise of all descriptions (including heavy indivisible loads and
livestock) and can supply vehicles under contract for the exclusive use of
traders. A chain of hotels is also owned and operated by the authority.
In the year ended 30th September, 1962, nearly 94 million passengers,
over 2-7 million tons of merchandise and over one million head of livestock
were carried by road and rail services run by the Ulster Transport Authority.
There were 297 miles of permanent way, 69 locomotives and 161 diesel rail
cars and trailers. The route mileage of regular omnibus services was 2,188
miles and there were 1,108 omnibuses and coaches and 2,188 goods motor
vehicles in use. The gross revenue of the Authority was £10,264,000.
On 31st March, 1963, there were 13,838 miles of public roads in Northern
Ireland, comprising 380 miles of trunk roads, 955 miles of Class I roads,
1,733 miles °f Class II roads, 2,865 miles of Class III roads and 7,905 miles
of unclassified roads.
The Ministry of Commerce is directly responsible for the trunk road
system and bears the entire cost of maintenance and reconstruction work on
these roads. In addition to major reconstruction schemes on trunk roads, a
total of about 70 miles of motorway are planned; the first section, 7 miles
long, running southwards from Belfast to Lisburn, was opened in July 1962.
The Ministry of Commerce also administers the Road Fund (the proceeds
of motor vehicle taxation, driving licence fees, etc.), from which grants are

paid to the local authorities (county, county borough, borough and urban
district councils) who are responsible for the other roads. The rates of grant
range from 90 per cent for major improvement works on Class I roads to
25 per cent for maintenance work on unclassified roads.
Gross expenditure on all roads in the financial year to 31st March, 1962,
was j£io-5 million and it is expected to increase in the next few years as major
improvement schemes are undertaken on both trunk and local roads. Expendi¬
ture in the five-year period 1961-66 is expected to be about £56 million,
compared with about £30 million in the five years to 1961.
CIVIL AVIATION
British airmen were among the first to carry mails (at the time of the
Coronation of King George V in 1911) and among the first to operate regular
mail and passenger services, which were inaugurated on 25th August, 1919,
when a daily passenger service was opened between London (Hounslow)
and Paris (Le Bourget). The year 1919 was also marked by notable pioneer
flights, including the crossing of the Atlantic by John Alcock and Arthur
Whitten Brown in June (both were later knighted for their achievement) and
the first flight between England and Australia by Captain (later Sir) Ross
Smith and his crew.
In April 1924 four small British companies merged to form Imperial Airways
Limited, which received a Government grant of j£i million spread over the
next ten years. As a substantial shareholder the Government was represented
on the board of directors.
Imperial Airways Limited pioneered the commercial development of
intercontinental air routes (including the organisation of ground services),
following up, in many cases, the exploratory work of the Royal Air Force.
By 1929 there was a through service from England to India. In 1931 the first
service was established to Central Africa. The first mail service to Australia
started in December 1934, followed by a passenger service in 1935. During
a part of 1939 Imperial Airways operated an experimental transatlantic
service for mail.
The British Overseas Airways Corporation, a public corporation, was
established by the British Overseas Airways Act, 1939, and took over the
undertakings of Imperial Airways Limited and British Airways Limited
in 1940. British European Airways was established under the Civil Aviation
Act, 1946, as a separate public corporation to cover the United Kingdom
and Europe. In addition to the two large corporations, there were in 1963
about 34 independent air transport operators, some of them, being grouped,
so forming 20 principal companies in all.
Responsibility for the general development and expansion of United Kingdom
civil aviation is vested in the Ministry of Aviation. The Ministry supervises
the development and production of civil aircraft and undertakes an extensive
programme of research and development to meet civil as well as Service
needs. It is also responsible for air safety and in this capacity is advised by
the Air Registration Board and the Air Safety Board (see p. 387).
Up to 1949 Government policy was that independent operators should under¬
take charter work and the corporations should operate scheduled services.
Starting in 1949, independent operators were permitted to operate certain

scheduled services as ‘associates’ of the corporations. From 1952 the inde¬
pendent companies became eligible to develop new routes and new types of
scheduled services. The Air Transport Advisory Council (ATAC), set up by
the Civil Aviation Act, 1946, advised the Minister whether permission for
these services could be given without materially diverting traffic from existing
services. Under the Civil Aviation (Licensing) Act, i960, an Air Transport
Licensing Board was set up in place of the ATAC, and from 30th March,
1961, the independent operators became entitled to apply for permission to
operate scheduled services on an equal basis with the corporations.
The ATLB consists of six to ten members appointed by the Minister of
Aviation. The Board is responsible for granting licences to both the corpora¬
tions and the independent operators for the operation of air services. In
granting licences the Board takes into account an operator’s experience,
financial resources, equipment, organisation and staffing arrangements, and
the adequacy of existing services. There is provision for appeals to the
Minister from decisions of the Board. In the period from its inception to
31st March, 1963, the Board received about 4,500 applications for licences
for air services of various kinds, including charters and holiday tours.
The existing powers and constitutions of BOAC and BEA are laid down by
the Air Corporations Acts, 1949 to i960 (though the Corporations’ monopoly
of scheduled services was repealed by the i960 Civil Aviation (Licensing)
Act, as noted above). Each corporation consists of 5 to 11 members, including
the chairman and deputy-chairman, all appointed by the Minister of Aviation.
In the case of BOAC the Minister may, if he wishes, appoint two deputy-
chairmen.
Under the Air Corporations Act, 1962, each corporation may, with the
consent of the Minister of Aviation and the approval of the Treasury, borrow
by raising temporary loans or by means of interest-bearing, redeemable
loans from the Exchequer. The current borrowing limits under the Act are
£300 million for BOAC and £125 million for BEA. In addition to providing
for the corporations’ capital requirements the Act enables them to incur
losses on revenue account up to £100 million and £10 million respectively
by 31st March, 1964.
Although the Minister of Aviation has certain statutory powers of direction
over the corporations, including power to give general directions as to the
exercise of their functions on matters affecting the national interest, these
powers are very seldom used. The corporations function as commercial
undertakings with autonomy in matters of day-to-day management. However,
as their activities may have an impact on matters of national policy or inter¬
national relations, and as the Minister is responsible for answering for the
corporations in Parliament, there is in practice close co-operation, consultation
and exchange of information between them and the Ministry. It is also the
practice of the corporations to seek the approval of the Minister and the
Treasury for orders of aircraft, which account for the bulk of their capital
expenditure, and for investments in foreign airlines, which commonly involve
foreign currency and may have political implications. Under the 1949 ^ct
the corporations are also required to render annual reports of their activities,
and statements of account, and the Minister lays these before Parliament,

Table 25. Total capacity ton-miles offered on all services more than doubled
between March 1956 and March 1961 and a further increase took place in
the following two years. In 1955, 2-9 million passengers entered or left the
United Kingdom by air, compared with 6-4 million who arrived or departed
by sea; in 1962, the first year in which there were more air than sea passengers,
the corresponding figures were 7-7 million by air and 7-2 million by sea.
BOAC operates scheduled services to all parts of the world: to Europe, the
Middle East, the Far East, Australia, Africa, North America, the Caribbean
and South America. It also operates a complete round the world service.
Partnership with Commonwealth airlines has been a feature of British civil
aviation since 1934, when Qantas and Imperial Airways first co-operated on
the Australian route, and BOAC now operates a number of services in close
association with other airlines. In addition, it has a financial interest in airlines
operating in the southern Red Sea area, the Caribbean and the Arabian Gulf,
and is associated either financially or through advisory or other agreements
with local airlines providing services in less developed areas adjacent to
BOAC’s main routes.
In June 1962 BOAC and the Cunard Steamship Company Limited jointly
formed a new company, BOAC-Cunard Limited, with an initial share
capital of £30 million, of which BOAC contributed 70 per cent and the
Cunard Company 30 per cent. Services in a large part of the Western
Hemisphere for which BOAC and Cunard Eagle held route licences are
operated on behalf of the new company. These include services between
Britain and the United States eastern seaboard and mid-west, Bermuda, the
Bahamas and the Caribbean, together with the extension of these services
to parts of northern and western South America.
Table 25 shows that the capacity offered on its own scheduled services by
BOAC rose between March 1956 and March 1963 by 239 per cent to 829
million capacity ton-miles. At the beginning of the period traffic was carried
entirely in piston-engined aircraft, but in the year ending in March 1963
nearly three-quarters was carried in pure jet aircraft. Over a third was carried
in Boeing joys, which were brought into service in i960. Over the seven-year
period, passenger-miles sold on scheduled services rose by 178 per cent.
During that period the load factor fell from 61 to 45 per cent. This was due
mainly to the introduction of larger aircraft over the whole period.
Owing to heavy investment in new aircraft in recent years and the losses of
its associated companies, BOAC’s annual accounts have shown deficits since
I957“5^» despite the increasing revenue from its operations shown in Table 25.
In 1961-62 (the latest year for which figures are available) interest on capital
borrowed amounted to £6 million and the deficit of the associated and sub¬
sidiary companies to £4-3 million. Adding the operating deficit of £10-5
million, the combined result was a deficit of ^20-8 million. Some £65 million
of BOAC’s gross revenue was earned in foreign currencies, which, after
payment of local expenditure overseas, produced a net contribution to earnings
of foreign currency of £28 million.
BEA operates a network of services serving 80 places in Britain, Europe,
North Africa and the Middle East. Its services in Britain include a number
which cannot be operated on a commercial basis, but which meet a vital
social need; these include services to the Highlands and Islands of Scotland.
BEA maintains a close working relationship with BOAC, whose aircraft, by

agreement, use a number of European stopping points. BEA also co-operates
with other airlines in order to create ‘through travel’ facilities. It has a
financial interest in several subsidiary and associated companies, the majority
of which collaborate with BEA in providing a network of services.
The capacity ton-miles offered and load ton-miles sold by BEA rose by 165
and 148 per cent respectively between March 1956 and March 1963 (see
Table 25). Load factors, which had increased up to 1961, were lower in
1962-63, capacity having increased more rapidly than space sold. Reasons
for the previous increase in the load factor appear to have been reductions
in fares, especially during winter months, the increasing use of air transport
on international routes by passengers from outside London, and increased
services and traffic on domestic routes. The proportionate increase in freight
ton-miles sold on domestic routes by BEA (from o-8 to 3-4 million)
was outstandingly high. On international routes this type of traffic more
than doubled. In March 1956 BEA’s fleet consisted of 28 Viscounts with
propeller-turbine engines in service, three on hire, and 73 piston-engined
aircraft. By March 1963 the number of Viscounts in service had increased
to 39. In addition, there were 20 propeller-turbine-engined Vanguards,
3 Heralds and 13 Comet 4BS with jet engines. The three-engined jet propelled
Trident is to come into service early in 1964. At the end of 1961 BEA introduced
the jet-prop Argosy, a new type of freighter capable of carrying 11 tons of
freight. Three of these aircraft are in service on European routes.
From 1954-55 to 1960-61 BEA earned a net profit after meeting interest
charges. In 1961-62 the Corporation showed a net loss of £265,301, before
bringing in reserves. This was a considerable improvement on the net loss
of £1,415,534 made in the previous year.
Of the 20 independent air transport companies, 12 are members of the
British Independent Air Transport Association. Among the largest are
British United Airways Limited, Cunard Eagle Airways Limited and Pan-Air
Services Limited. In addition, there are over 40 operators engaged in
miscellaneous activities, such as crop spraying and air photography and survey
work. Table 25 shows that the capacity offered by the independent transport
companies on non-scheduled services (comprising inclusive holiday tours
and charter and contract services) has been greatly in excess of that offered
on scheduled services. Until 1961 the development of scheduled services by
independent firms was controlled in the interest of the corporations (see
p. 382) and the scheduled service activities of these companies were con¬
centrated mainly on secondary routes and the provision of special types of
service, such as vehicle ferry services from the United Kingdom to Europe,
and all-freight services to Europe and Africa. Since 1961, however, the
independent companies and the corporations have been able to apply to the
Air Transport Licensing Board for licences for the development of their
networks of scheduled as well as other services.
Much charter business is arranged through the air section of the Baltic
Exchange, the London market for shipping space (see p. 360). The Air-
brokers’ Association, formed in 1949, operates in London a world market
for chartering aircraft to carry cargo and passengers.
The proportion of United Kingdom foreign trade carried by aircraft is
steadily increasing. In 1956, 1-7 per cent of imports and 2-9 per cent of
exports (by value) were carried by air. During 1962 these percentages were
386
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Private Flying
Aerodromes
Development
5-1 per cent and 6-y per cent respectively, and the total value of exports,
imports and re-exports by air was £525 million. The chief export items were
expensive machinery and parts, aircraft and vehicle parts, and electrical and
electronic products; furs and skins accounted for about a third of the total
value of re-exports by air.
At the end of 1962 the estimated number of aircraft on the United Kingdom
register used for business and private purposes was about 580, while approxi¬
mately 400 were owned by clubs, groups and training schools. Private pilot’s
licences were held by about 7,400 people.
The Minister of Aviation is authorised to establish and maintain civil aero¬
dromes, and so may local authorities, subject to his approval; there are also
privately owned aerodromes. All aerodromes not operated by the Government
which are used for commercial operations are subject to the Minister’s
licensing, inspection and regulation.
There are approximately 120 civil aerodromes in the United Kingdom and,
in addition, about 54 Service aerodromes are available for civil use. Those
under civil control include 21 directly controlled by the Ministry, 3 in the
Channel Islands and 1 in the Isle of Man administered by the local island
governments, and 30 aerodromes licensed for public use, of which 21 are
owned by municipalities. Customs facilities are provided at 9 of the Ministry’s
aerodromes and at 19 others.
The main airports used by international scheduled services in 1963 were:
for European services: London (Heathrow and Gatwick);
for North Atlantic services: London (Heathrow);
for Middle East, African and Far East services: London (Heathrow and
Gatwick).
Aircraft and passenger movements at the principal aerodromes continue
to increase. In 1962 all United Kingdom civil aerodromes handled 14-4
million passengers. Of this total, London (Heathrow) Airport dealt with
7 million, and London (Gatwick), a million. Outside the London area,
Manchester (Ringway) handled a million; Glasgow (Renfrew), 878,000;
Belfast (Nutt’s Corner), 585,000; and Southend 551,000. The three airports
in the Channel Islands together handled 12 million passengers. The number
of movements of aircraft engaged on commercial transport operations in
1961 was 449,000 for all aerodromes.
London (Heathrow) Airport, already the largest and busiest airport in
Western Europe, will be strained to capacity within the next few years owing
both to the increasing number of passengers and to the greater number of
large new jet aircraft which many international airlines are bringing into
service. Domestic and European short-haul services are handled at the
passenger building in the central terminal opened in 1955- additional
building for short-haul services is planned. For long-distance passengers a
£3 million terminal was completed in 1962. Communications between central
London and Heathrow will be greatly improved when a section of the M 4
motorway (see p. 373) from Heathrow to inner London is opened in 1964.
Freight traffic is expected to increase considerably during the next few years,
and plans are being prepared for a new freight terminal in the south-west
corner of the airport. The airport at Gatwick, 25 miles south of London,
was opened in June 1958 as the second airport for the London area and
TRANSPORT AND COMMUNICATIONS 387
further development is being undertaken by enlarging the terminal buildings
and aprons and adding a second and third passenger pier. The second pier
was completed in the summer of 1963. In June 1963 a ^2-5 million contract
was placed for extensions which will more than double the size of the terminal
buildings and add a third passenger pier by the summer of 1965. Plans have
been made to extend the 7,000-foot runway to enable it to handle the larger
aircraft likely to come into use for short- and medium-haul services as well as
the largest jet airliners diverted from Heathrow. The two airports are
becoming increasingly interdependent. Built alongside the main London to
Brighton railway, London (Gatwick) Airport is the first in the world to contain
road, rail and air transport in one unit. A privately owned helicopter terminal
(or ‘heliport’) was opened in London, on the south bank of the Thames,
in April 1959.
Prestwick, in Scotland, is being developed so that it can accommodate large
jet aircraft. Development schemes costing £4 million are nearing completion
and an entirely new passenger terminal and freight area will be brought into
use in 1964. The runways at Ringway Airport, Manchester, have been length¬
ened and a new terminal building was completed in 1962. Work started
during 1963 on a new airport for Glasgow, which will cost over £4 million.
In the autumn of 1963 Belfast’s services were transferred from Nutt’s Corner
to a new civil terminal built on the former RAF aerodrome at Aldergrove.

The role of the Government in promoting air safety lies in research and
supervision. Government research is mainly in aircraft design, navigational
aids and air traffic control. Every aspect of civil aircraft operation is supervised
by the Government, which shares its responsibility for safety with manu¬
facturers and designers of aircraft engines and equipment, airline operators,
flight crews, ground staffs, air traffic controllers and others.
In major issues of safety policy the Government is advised by the Air
Safety Board, which was established in 1946 and is a standing body of experts;
it may make recommendations to the Minister or give advice on matters
referred to it by him.
Research on aircraft design and construction is done at the Royal Aircraft
Establishments at Farnborough and Bedford, which belong to the Ministry
of Aviation and are exceptionally well equipped with testing facilities.
All aircraft registered in the United Kingdom must have a valid certificate
of airworthiness issued (or rendered valid) by the Ministry of Aviation on
the recommendation of the Air Registration Board. This Board was set up
in 1937 and consists of 18 members, four of whom are independent, the
others being representatives of constructors, operators and insurers of aircraft.
No aircraft built in Britain is granted a certificate of airworthiness unless it
has been constructed in accordance with British Civil Airworthiness Require¬
ments, a code compiled and frequently reviewed by the Board. Continued
airworthiness is ensured by regular inspection and maintenance performed
according to a schedule which has to be approved by the Board.
Firms engaged in the design and construction of aircraft must be approved
by the Board, and the Board is associated from the start with all new develop¬
ments in aviation, such as automatic landing.
Each member of a flight crew must hold the appropriate licence granted or
rendered valid by the Minister. The requirement that pilots of public transport
aircraft must hold licences issued by the Ministry of Aviation is to be extended
to all pilots flying for remuneration. Operators are required to ensure that

pilots employed by them have adequate knowledge of routes, and Ministry
inspectors check the standards maintained by the operators, which must be
adequate for purposes of the Air Operator’s Certificate (see below).
In order to replace the supply of well-trained pilots for civil airlines from the
Royal Air Force, which has declined in recent years, the College of Air
Training was set up at Hamble in i960. It is sponsored and partly financed
by the Government and the two Airways Corporations. The first 26 students
graduated in October 1962. As this college can supply only about half the
pilots needed, the Government approves independent colleges, whose
standards are adequate for the training of professional pilots. Besides the
College of Air Training at Hamble, so far only Airwork Services Training,
Perth, has been approved. Early in 1963 there were about 230 students at
the latter, three-quarters of them from overseas.
Every operator of aircraft above a certain size used for public transport
must, as required by the Civil Aviation (Licensing) Act, i960, and the Air
Navigation Order, of March 1961, possess an Air Operator’s Certificate
issued by the Director of Aviation Safety (who is appointed by the Minister
of Aviation) when satisfied by inspectors that all safety precautions are
constantly taken by the operator. In addition, the Air Registration Board
maintains continuous supervision of operators’ maintenance arrangements.
Until December 1962 the Ministry of Aviation was responsible for providing
efficient navigation and traffic control services for all civil aircraft flying over
or near the United Kingdom, meteorological information was provided by the
Air Ministry, and the Ministry of Aviation’s Air Traffic Control Service was
responsible for the safe, orderly and expeditious movement of all air traffic
using United Kingdom controlled airspace, airways, terminal areas and
control zones. Since December 1962 responsibility for policy, planning and
execution of both civil and military air traffic control over the United Kingdom
and the surrounding seas has rested with the Air Traffic Control Services
Organisation, under the joint control of the Ministry of Aviation and the
Secretary of State for Air. This organisation has an integrated policy and
planning staff drawn from both ministries. An integrated civil and military
executive headquarters will take over the operation of air traffic on a joint
basis. These organisational changes have been brought about by the increasing
demands on a limited amount of airspace.
In 1950 the then Ministry of Transport and Civil Aviation introduced a
system of airways covering the main traffic routes with controlled zones
around the major airports. During 1957 and 1958 a revised and extended
airways system was brought into use. There are three main air traffic control
centres: at London (Heathrow) Airport for southern England, at Preston for
the north of England and Wales, and at Prestwick for Scotland and the
Atlantic Ocean to 30° W. The Southern Air Traffic Control Centre, situated
on the boundary of London (Heathrow) Airport, is one of the most advanced
control centres in the world.
A variety of radar installations and equipment provide the means by which
the system can accept the increasingly heavy load of air traffic. Britain
was the first country to use radar for the control of civil air traffic. The
radar approach system known as Ground Controlled Approach (GCA)
is now in use at all major airports in the United Kingdom, in addition
to the Instrument Landing System (ILS). During the next few years
virtually the whole of the airspace over the United Kingdom above 5,000

feet will be brought under surveillance by the latest types of radar equipment,
which will be used in two new Air Traffic Control Centres, located at West
Drayton (near London) and Preston, Lancashire. A subsidiary centre will be
located at Prestwick to deal with traffic over Scotland. Extensive use will be
made in these centres of automatic data-processing and other advanced
electronic techniques.
The Ministry of Aviation has provided a number of radio navigational aids
to help aircraft to remain safely within the controlled airspace and to make
accurate estimates of their time of arrival. In addition, the Ministry supports
the Decca Air and Marine Navigator System now operating over a wide area
of the United Kingdom and northern Europe which can be used, by arrange¬
ment with the Decca Company, by any aircraft fitted with the appropriate
receiving equipment. Research is in progress into new landing aids for use
in bad weather. A unit of the Royal Aircraft Establishment, at Bedford, in
co-operation with industry, has successfully developed a fully automatic
landing system, making Britain the pioneer in all-weather landing. The system
is now coming into use with the Royal Air Force and is being further developed
to the standards necessary for use by civil aircraft, including the VC 10
and Trident.
Radio stations provide air to ground communications for the use of the
Air Traffic Control Services. There is also a network of communications
between ground stations within the United Kingdom and between United
Kingdom and overseas ground stations.
To cope with the new problems caused by high-flying, high-speed jet aircraft,
a European international agency, Eurocontrol, has been formed by Britain,
France, Germany, Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg, to provide
air traffic control at the higher flight levels for civil aircraft and for military
aircraft operating according to civil procedures.
THE POST OFFICE
The Post Office, founded in 1657, provides the postal and public tele¬
communications services of the United Kingdom. Although formally a
Government department it is in effect a nationalised industry.
The political head of the Post Office is the Postmaster General (see p. 60).
Immediately under him is the General Directorate consisting of the Director
General, three Deputy Directors General and the Engineer-in-Chief. They
are supported by a considerable staff, organised functionally, in the task of
framing plans for the Post Office as a whole and supervising its affairs
generally. For most operational purposes Britain is divided into nine
geographical regions, each under a Director (two in London) with his own
supporting staff. Responsible to them, and forming the third tier of the
organisation, are 464 head postmasters and 57 telephone managers who
directly control operations in the field. In March 1963 the Post Office had
394,000 employees and 25,000 post offices.
Among the means by which the Post Office keeps in touch with public
opinion are a central Advisory Council and about 196 local advisory com¬
mittees.
Finance
The Post Office Act, 1961, recognised the commercial character of the Post
Office by separating its finances from the Exchequer and giving the Postmaster
General sole responsibility for them. Post Office expenditure is generally

subject neither to Parliamentary control by Estimate nor to Treasury control.
Income is determined by tariffs which the Postmaster General fixes, subject
only to negative resolution of Parliament. The Post Office makes its own
investment plans, subject only to the same need for broad Government
approval as applies to other nationalised industries. Like them, it is expected
to aim at an adequate return on its capital and to contribute suitably to the
financing of its investment.
Table 26 gives recent figures of income, profit and capital. Nearly all the
capital is invested in telecommunications, which are drawing rapidly ahead
of the postal services in size and profitability. Among nationalised industries,
in size of income the Post Office as a whole ranks after coal and electricity
supply, and in rate of growth it is second only to the latter.
The development of postal communications in Britain can be traced from
the time when horsemen carried dispatches to the Tudor Court up to modern

airmail transport. There was a great expansion in the postal services in the
eighteenth century with the introduction of mail-coaches in 1784. In the first
half of the nineteenth century the Post Office was quick to take advantage
of Britain’s early lead in engineering and railway development and the
first dispatch of mails by train was made in 1830 between Liverpool and
Manchester.
The inauguration of the penny post (the uniform charge for any inland
distance being prepaid by means of postage stamps, which originated in
Britain) in 1840 was followed by a rapid extension of the scope of the postal
services. The registered post, ensuring additional safety for valuable mail,
was introduced in 1841. The money order system, which had operated as a
private venture from 1792 to 1838, was supplemented in 1881 by the issue
of postal orders for fixed amounts. Letterboxes had been instituted in London
in 1855 to facilitate the increased postal traffic, and in 1883 the parcel post
was introduced. By the end of the nineteenth century a regular delivery of
letters was assured to every house in Britain. In 1919 the Post Office inaugura¬
ted its own motor transport fleet and the first mail was carried by air in
Britain in 1911.
Table 26 gives statistics of items of inland and overseas mail carried. Each
year about 7,000 tons of mail are carried by air within the United Kingdom.
Out of the 464 million items of overseas correspondence carried in 1962-63,
61 per cent were carried by air, compared with 51 per cent in 1955-56. The
air parcel service now operates to all countries in Europe except Roumania
and to over 180 countries outside Europe.
All private telegraph systems in Britain were transferred to the control of
the Postmaster General in 1870. Teleprinter-working for the transmission
of inland telegrams was introduced generally in 1928 and conversion to the
present automatic switching system was completed in mid-1954. It is now
one of the most up-to-date systems in the world and gives direct connection
between any of the 500 larger telegraph offices. The overseas telegraph
services were shared until 1950 between the Post Office and Cable and
Wireless Ltd. This company was brought into public ownership in 1947.
The Post Office, which acquired the British services, operates all overseas
telegraph services from the United Kingdom, except those offered by foreign
telegraph companies. Cable and Wireless Ltd. continues to operate its cable
and wireless services in many dependencies and foreign countries. Telegraph
services to overseas countries are operated from Electra House, Victoria
Embankment, London.
The Telex Service combines the speed of the telephone with the accuracy
of the printed word. Calls may be made between the rapidly increasing
number of telex users in the United Kingdom (10,300 in March 1963) and also
to some 200,000 subscribers spread throughout the world. To send a message,
the subscriber types it on the keyboard of his teleprinter: it is then reproduced
simultaneously on both the sending and receiving subscribers’ installations.
For call charging purposes Britain is divided into 50 charging areas, each
with its own telex centre. The International Telex Exchange provides a
teleprinter service to 70 countries abroad. The service is available day
and night except for a few routes outside Europe, and messages may be
transmitted to a subscriber even though his teleprinter is unattended, for
attention when his office reopens. The service is expanding rapidly and the
Post Office is planning for a system of 26,000 United Kingdom subscribers
by 1970.

When the Post Office bought the property of the National Telephone Com¬
pany in 1912 it became the owner of almost the whole telephone service in
the country. Local authorities wishing to operate their own telephone service
were permitted to do so under licence from the Postmaster General, but the
only municipal system now in existence is that provided by the Corporation
of Hull. Local telephone service in the Channel Islands is provided, also
under licence, by their Government’s telephone departments. The Hull and
Channel Islands local systems, although operated independently of the Post
Office system, are connected to the Post Office trunk network. At the end
of March 1963 there were 6,011 local telephone exchanges and about
9 million telephones in Britain.
Telephone service to Europe is through the Continental Exchange, from
which over 1,100 direct telephone circuits give service to all countries except
Albania. These circuits are also used to send and receive pictures, and special
circuits are used for broadcast transmissions. Radio circuits which provide
service with most countries outside Europe and with many of the larger
liners at sea are controlled at the International Exchange.
The figures in Table 26 show that the number of inland calls made rose
by 26 per cent between 1955-56 and 1962-63, while the number of overseas
calls more than doubled.
There are several specialised services available by telephone, including the
‘999’ emergency dialling service, enabling subscribers to be connected as
quickly as possible, and free of charge, to the police, ambulance or fire
brigade services; the automatic time service; and a telephone weather forecast
service available in 16 centres. In London a telephone information service
provides details in English, French, Spanish and German of important
events being held in and around the capital on the day of the call and a
similar service in English in Edinburgh exists during the summer months.
In Birmingham, Liverpool and Manchester there is a daily cooking recipe
service. A test match cricket score service operates at 41 centres during the
cricket season and a road weather service is provided in collaboration with
the Automobile Association at nine centres from 1st October to 30th April
each year.
A public radiotelephone service, introduced in 1959, enables the users of
vehicles fitted with suitable radio equipment to make calls to, or receive
them from, any telephone in the United Kingdom network. At present the
area of this service is restricted to South Lancashire and parts of Cheshire
but a service to cover the Greater London area is planned, to open in 1964.
At the post office counter the citizen can draw his pension and his family
allowance, buy a licence for his gun, dog, sound radio or television receiving
set, renew his car licence and buy national insurance stamps and premium
savings bonds.1 In much of the work at its counters the Post Office acts as
agent for other Government departments or local authorities. Largely as a
result of the widening scope of the social services and the increase in personal
incomes, the volume of work at post office counters has been increasing
rapidly: this is shown by the figures in Table 26 which give the total value of
transactions and the value of some important items.

random number indicating equipment used for selecting winning premium savings
bond numbers.

In March 1963 there were 86,000 private circuit stations not connected with
the public exchange networks. These circuits are rented for private use for
telephone conversations, teleprinter connections, photo-telegraphy, television,
music, or for the transmission of signals which represent data for computers
or operate other devices.
In addition to the radio stations for overseas telecommunications, the Post
Office has 11 coast radio stations in the United Kingdom. These stations
provide radiotelegraph and radiotelephone communications with ships at sea
at ranges of up to some 500 and 300 miles respectively. There is also the
long-distance radiotelegraph station, Portishead-Radio, which communicates
with ships in all parts of the world.
These coast stations play an important part in the services concerned with
safety of life at sea. They keep continuous watch on the international radio¬
telegraph and radiotelephone frequencies for distress calls from ships or
aircraft and take immediate action to obtain assistance for any vessel in
distress. During 1962-63 the stations handled 661 urgent and SOS calls
from ships and aircraft.
In addition to the services for safety of life at sea, the stations exchange
radiotelegrams with ships and connect radiotelephone calls between telephone
subscribers ashore and suitably equipped ships; they also broadcast naviga¬
tional warnings and weather bulletins.
The stations also operate a free medical advice service whereby the Master
of a ship of any nationality may obtain advice from appropriate medical
authorities on the treatment to be given in cases of sickness or injury aboard
ship. During 1962-63 the stations dealt with 352 medical inquiries in this
service.
In 1960-61 the total operating expenditure of the Post Office was £444
million and the cost of salaries, wages and pensions amounted to 63 per cent
of this. With such large manpower costs, the field for mechanisation is great
and many machines have been introduced in recent years. In 1960-61 the
net capital expenditure of the Post Office was £105 million, of which £7 million
was for postal services and £98 million for telecommunications. The largest
single item was £87 million for telecommunications plant. Some £14 million
was for accommodation, including new post offices. All these items have
increased in subsequent years and in 1962-63 net capital expenditure
amounted to £131 million.
In 1963 the Post Office had 37,000 motor vehicles for carrying mail and for
engineering purposes; for quick transmission of mails in the central London
area the Post Office operates an automatically controlled underground railway,
6J miles long and serving eight stations. In November 1961, when BEA
introduced night air services between London and Glasgow, Edinburgh and
Belfast, the Post Office started to send by air large quantities of letter mail
which had previously been sent by rail and sea.
To cope with the ever increasing work, the handling and sorting of mail
are being continually improved. The Post Office has embarked on a large-
scale scheme of mechanisation designed to speed up the service and at the
same time keep down costs and relieve staff of tedious and repetitive work.
Already many offices have been equipped with chain conveyors for moving
bags of mail. In 1962 the first production models of a letter-segregating and
letter-facing machine designed by the Post Office were installed in a London
district office at Southwark; the segregating machine separates the packets

from the letters, and the long letters from short ones at speeds of up to
60,000 items per hour; the letter-facing machine performs such tasks as
arranging the letters in stacks with all addresses facing the same way, and
the stamps in the same corner of the stack. Parcel-sorting machines have
been developed and installed at Leeds and Worcester, which can deal with
10,000 and 2,400 parcels per hour respectively. The Post Office is working
towards making letter-sorting completely automatic and is experimenting
with a system by which letters can be marked with phosphorescent dots
corresponding to the address and then sorted automatically.
Work is well advanced on a scheme to mechanise the overseas telegraph
system and operators in London are already dialling a large number of
offices in Western Europe over a special network and teleprinting the messages
straight through.
The Post Office is developing facilities for the transmission of data over
its telephone and teleprinter networks to meet the needs of customers wishing
to transmit information to distant automatic data processing equipment.
The first international high speed data transmission service (datelex) was
opened between London and New York in September 1962.
In March 1963, 8-6 per cent of the 5 million1 telephones in the United
Kingdom were connected with automatic exchanges and less than a tenth
of the exchanges remained to be changed to automatic working. Trunk
dialling by subscribers began in Bristol in December 1958 and by March 1963
the facility had been extended to 475 exchanges, serving approximately
one-third of all subscribers; by 1970 it will be available on 90 per cent of all
telephones. The introduction of the new group routing and charging equip¬
ment brings the advantages of quicker service, automatic accounting and
cheap long distance calls of short duration, and constitutes the most radical
reform of the telephone service since the Post Office assumed national
responsibility for it.
Telephones transmitting messages through loudspeakers instead of through
instruments held by hand were made available to the public in 1961. Britain’s
first electronic telephone exchange, the first of its kind in the world, was
brought into experimental use in 1962 at Highgate Wood, in London. Three
more electronic exchanges, each of a different and advanced type, are expected
to open in 1964.
To improve the telephone service to Europe, equipment has been installed
to enable London subscribers to dial their own calls to Europe, and Inter¬
national Subscriber Dialling between London and Paris was inaugurated in
March 1963.
The first transatlantic telephone cable was laid in 1956 and its high quality,
speed and reliability has opened up a new era in the world of communications.
The Post Office, in co-operation with Cable and Wireless Ltd., is taking part
in the extension of the Commonwealth submarine cable links. The first of
these, which links Britain with Canada, was laid and opened in 1961. The
second link, between Australia and New Zealand, started working in 1962
and the trans-Pacific link between Canada and New Zealand will be completed
by the end of 1963. The two existing transatlantic cables provide 57 public
telephone circuits from Britain to the United States, 23 to Canada, 40 circuits
linking those countries with Europe, and a number of telegraph channels.
1 This figure refers to ‘exchange connections’ and not to telephone instruments, some
of which are extensions.

A further 132 circuits will become available when a third transatlantic
cable is laid from Britain to the United States in the autumn of 1963. A fourth
transatlantic cable between Scotland and Canada via Greenland was com¬
pleted late in 1962. Many more circuits will be provided by six new cables
to be laid between Britain and Europe by 1967.
Other Developments Research on the use for long distance communications of satellites, with a
probable capacity of 1,000 circuits, is being done in co-operation with the
United States and in consultation with Commonwealth countries (see p. 222).
A radio tower, 580 feet high, is being erected in London to provide more
microwave radio links for carrying long-distance telephone and television
circuits. This is expected to be in operation early in 1965.

FINANCE
PUBLIC FINANCE
Public finance is concerned with the way public authorities (i.e. the central
Government and local authorities) finance their activities—how their expendi¬
ture is decided upon and how their revenue is obtained.
Money administered by public authorities1 can be roughly divided into
two categories:
1. The funds of the central Government, raised mainly by taxation, but
also in part by borrowing, and paid into and out of the Exchequer2 in
accordance with the proposals of the Government, as approved by
Parliament (principally the House of Commons).
There are also funds administered for special purposes by central
Government departments and wholly or partially maintained by receipts
which do not come from the Exchequer. The most important one is
the National Insurance Fund, administered by the Minister of Pensions
and National Insurance and used for the payment of benefits under the
National Insurance Scheme.
2. The funds of local authorities, obtained partly from rates (local taxes
on dwelling houses and other real estate) and income from property
and trading receipts, partly from grants and loans from the Exchequer,
and partly from loans raised in the open market (see pp. 77_9)-
The following broad account of Government finance is concerned mainly
with the Exchequer and only incidentally with local government and other
public funds. For a fuller account of the nature and operation of the Exchequer
and its Accounts and certain suggested reforms, see the White Paper Reform
of the Exchequer Accounts {Cmnd. 2014), published in May 1963-
Financial control, as exercised by the House of Commons, is based on law,
parliamentary rights and custom.
As the power of Parliament grew in late medieval and Tudor times, the
principle that taxation by the Crown required parliamentary consent was
gradually evolved. The principle was established, at the end of the constitu¬
tional struggles of the Stuart period, by the Bill of Rights, 1689.
In medieval, Tudor and Stuart times, it is broadly true to say that once
the King was granted the right to raise a given sum by taxation, he was free
to spend it as he chose. In the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, the House
of Commons gradually developed the modern system of controlling expendi¬
ture through the device of Appropriation which was embodied in the
Exchequer and Audit Departments Act, 1866.
From the very early days of Parliament it had been established that such
financial control as Parliament possessed should be exercised by the House of
Commons. This control became effective, as regards taxation, in the seven-
1 por an account of public finance in Northern Ireland and its relationship to that
of the United Kingdom, see pp. 406-7.
2 The term ‘Exchequer’ took its name from the ‘chess-board’, or table with chequered
cloth, round which the King’s financial officials sat for accounting purposes in the
twelfth century.

teenth century, but as regards expenditure it was not effective until the
nineteenth century. The controlling power of the House of Commons is
acknowledged today in the Speech from the Throne at the opening of a new
session of Parliament, which is addressed to both Houses but contains a
special paragraph addressed to the Commons alone.
The Commons have traditionally claimed that the Lords have no power
to modify financial provisions, though they may reject such provisions; thus,
to minimise the chance of rejection, the practice was started in 1861 of
embodying the main financial provisions for the ensuing year in a single Bill.
Since the passing of the Parliament Act, 1911, however, the assent of the
House of Lords is no longer needed for a Bill certified by the Speaker to be
a Money Bill (see p. 40).
Today, the authority of the House of Commons has to be obtained for all
expenditure by the central Government itself and for the raising of revenue
by taxation or borrowing. All Government revenue, other than sums received
by Government departments in the course of their normal activities (known
as appropriations-in-aid), is paid into the Government account with the
Bank of England—known as the Exchequer Account or the Consolidated
Fund. With certain exceptions (the main one, as previously stated, being
National Insurance benefits), all payments by the Government come out of
this account.
The following sections outline the machinery by which expenditure and
revenue are authorised and controlled, the purposes on which public money
is spent and the sources from which revenue is obtained.
Central Government expenditure falls into two main groups:
1. Expenditure which is specifically authorised by Acts of Parliament other
than annual Appropriation Acts. This expenditure includes the loans
made by the Government (shown ‘below the line’1 in the Exchequer
accounts) to nationalised industries, local authorities and other public
and private concerns for which the Treasury has specific statutory
authority to borrow. It also includes the Consolidated Fund services,
which are ‘above the line’ in the Exchequer accounts. These services,
which represent a permanent charge on the Consolidated Fund, include
the interest, sinking funds and cost of management of the National
Debt, the financial provision made for members of the royal family,
and salaries and pensions of judges and certain high officers whose
independence of the Government is thought to be better guaranteed by
permanent grant than by annual vote.
2. All other Government expenditure, which is authorised by annual
Appropriation Acts and which includes all expenditure on defence, on
the social services and on the general administration of the country.
These are called Supply Services because the House of Commons, when
voting money, is granting to the Crown ‘such aids or supplies as are
required to satisfy . . . the pecuniary necessities of the Government’.
It should be noted that some of this expenditure may also depend on
legislation, such as the National Health Service Acts, which relates to
a specific object of expenditure.
The Estimates for these Supply Services are considered by the House of
Commons in Committee of Supply (that is, in Committee of the whole House
1 See footnote on page 400.
398 BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
with the Chairman of Ways and Means, instead of the Speaker, in the Chair).
The committee usually discusses public policy relevant to the Estimates,
though any Estimate may be examined in detail if members wish and if
time allows (see p. 43).
Estimates for Supply Services in the financial year beginning on 1st April
are submitted to the Treasury by each department in the preceding November
and December. Estimated expenditure is grouped under main headings called
‘Votes’ which are further broken down into subheads and items. If the House
of Commons approves the Estimates, the sums asked for are voted and later
confirmed in the Appropriation Act; this Act appropriates the money to
specific Votes. Within each Vote, a ‘virement’, the spending of money on
one subhead instead of on another, is permissible so far as Parliament is
concerned, but only with Treasury consent. The Service departments may
spend money on one Vote instead of another, but only with Treasury sanction
which, in turn, requires the retrospective authorisation of Parliament.
Departments are free to distribute expenditure within subheads as they
please subject to Treasury approval of the type of expenditure involved.
An insufficient Estimate, or a new service not covered by the Vote, or a
virement of a magnitude or character which the Treasury considers should
be brought to the attention of Parliament, requires a Supplementary Estimate.
The Treasury exercises the same power of scrutiny over this as over the
ordinary Estimates.
Scrutiny of Control of expenditure is maintained by the Treasury, by the Comptroller
Expenditure and Auditor General, and by the Public Accounts and Estimates Committees
of the House of Commons.
The Treasury The power of the Treasury to control expenditure derives from the res¬
ponsibility of the Chancellor of the Exchequer for the financial policy of the
Government.
A central function of the Treasury is to present the Civil Estimates to the
House of Commons. In considering the Estimates submitted by departments,
the Treasury has to look at the proposals for expenditure in relation to
prospective national resources and to weigh the advantages of administrative
proposals against the monetary and economic cost, taking into account
current Government policy; to decide the relative merits of expendi¬
ture proposed by different departments; and to eliminate any overlapping,
uneconomic or wasteful expenditure where this has escaped the net of depart¬
mental financial control. Quite apart from the scrutiny of Estimates, through¬
out the year the Treasury keeps a close control over such matters as rates
of pay and the aggregate size of the staff in all Government departments, in
addition to exercising a general supervision over all departmental expenditure.
The Treasury also lays down general rules of financial and accounting
procedure for departments and prescribes the principles on which depart¬
mental contracts shall be made and the limits within which losses may be
written off.
The Comptroller and Control over issues of money to departments and the audit of accounts is
Auditor General exercised by the Comptroller and Auditor General, who holds a permanent
appointment with the status of an officer of the House of Commons. Since
1866 he has had two functions: as Comptroller of the Exchequer he controls
receipts and issues of public money to and from the Exchequer Account,
and as Auditor General he audits departmental accounts and submits his
report on the Appropriation Accounts and other accounts, as required by
FINANCE
399
statute, to Parliament. His statutory function is to ensure that all expenditure
is properly incurred, e.g., that no payments are made which go beyond
any relevant statutory authority, and that Treasury sanction has been
obtained wherever necessary. In addition, however, he has been encouraged by
successive Committees of Public Accounts (see the next paragraph) to
examine departmental expenditure with a view to drawing attention to any
cases of apparent waste or extravagance.
The Public Accounts The accounts of each department and the reports on the accounts made by
Committee the Comptroller and Auditor General are considered by a select committee
called the Public Accounts Committee. This was first set up in 1861, on the
motion of Mr. Gladstone, for the purpose of ensuring that expenditure was
properly incurred in accordance with the purpose for which it was voted and
with any relevant Acts of Parliament. The terms of reference of the committee
are to examine the accounts and these terms have been widely interpreted by
successive committees which have investigated whether full value has been
obtained for the sums spent by departments and have examined cases in which
the administration appears to have been faulty or negligent. The committee
has therefore become a powerful instrument for the exposure of waste and
inefficiency. It embodies its findings in reports which may be debated in
the House of Commons. Its recommendations are considered by the Treasury
in consultation with departments and put into effect, so far as they are
accepted, according to Treasury instructions. A reply to each report is
submitted by the Treasury to the committee of the following session and
where the recommendations have been unacceptable to the Treasury the
committee may either accept the objections or return to the charge in sub¬
sequent reports.
The Estimates This committee was originally set up in 1912 and has been reappointed
Committee annually except during the war years. In i960 it was made a select committee
set up each session under standing orders. The committee’s functions are
to examine the Estimates, to report whether the policy implied in the Estimates
can be carried out more economically, to examine the principal variations
between the Estimates of the current year and those of the previous year
and to suggest the form in which the Estimates should be presented. Usually,
the committee selects each year a few Votes, or aspects of Government-
voted services, for review.
Since 1945 the committee has functioned through the medium of four, later
five, sub-committees, which carry out extensive investigations into the
departments under consideration. In practice, the Estimates for the current
year are not affected, but the committee’s recommendations produce changes
in future Estimates and strengthen Treasury control. In i960 a further
sub-committee was added to examine and report briefly on the spring supple¬
mentary estimates. The committee’s functions have been extended to examine
the principal variations between the estimates presented and those of the
previous year, and additional parliamentary time has been allocated for
discussion of the reports of the committee and of the Public Accounts
Committee.
THE BUDGET ‘Budget’ is an old word meaning a bag containing papers or accounts. The
use of the word in public finance originated in the expression ‘The Chancellor
of the Exchequer opened his Budget’, which was applied in Parliament to
the annual speech of the Chancellor of the Exchequer explaining his proposals
for balancing revenue and expenditure.
400
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Budget Policy
The Budget speech is the main occasion of the year for reviewing the
Exchequer finances and the economic state of the nation, and its formal
basis is the Chancellor’s proposals for raising money by taxation. By the
time the Budget is introduced (usually in April) the Estimates of expenditure
under various headings will have been presented to Parliament and published,
and the expected total of Government expenditure for the year will be known.
The Chancellor estimates the yield of the revenue on the basis of existing
taxation and proposes such changes in taxation as he considers desirable on
economic grounds. These proposals are later embodied in detail in a Finance
Bill. The interval between the Budget Statement and the Royal Assent to
the Finance Bill (usually given in July) is covered by the Provisional Collection
of Taxes Act, 1913, whereby changes in income tax and customs and excise
duties1 have immediate statutory effect if adopted by Resolution of the House
of Commons.
The Budget speech also gives figures relating to certain payments mainly
of a capital nature for which the Government has statutory power to borrow
and which are accordingly excluded from that part of the Budget expenditure
which is met from revenue. These items and others are set out in the part
of the Budget which lies ‘below the line’.2 Since 1961 a White Paper has been
issued before the Budget giving details of below the line expenditure.
The original purpose of the Budget was purely financial—to provide money
for Government expenditure. From an early stage, however, it was appreciated
that taxation would affect the distribution of income and property and
the level of expenditure on particular goods and services. At a later period it
was realised that taxation also affected the nation’s total expenditure and
therefore the general level of economic activity. Since the second world war,
Budgets have been consciously designed in greater or lesser degree to bring
the total demand for goods and services into balance with the supplies which
could be made available. Growing emphasis is now being placed on long¬
term programmes of public expenditure and on regular surveys over a period
of years taking into account prospective resources.
Direct taxation on income and property affects the distribution of wealth
because the rates vary according to the size of income and property, the
proportion of a high income taken in tax being much greater than the propor¬
tion of a small one; at the same time, the services provided by the Government
(whether in cash or kind) are generally available to all, irrespective of wealth,
but in some cases they are specially designed to benefit people with lower
incomes. Indirect taxes, or taxes on expenditure (see pp. 402-3), do not affect
the distribution of income; their main purpose has always been the raising
of revenue, but by discouraging or encouraging consumption of particular
goods they can be used to influence the allocation of resources and the
pattern of trade.
The Budget affects the general level of expenditure and, therefore, the
total demand for goods and services in the following way: if there is an
increase in Government expenditure without an increase in taxation then
total demand for goods and services will tend to rise; the same thing will
happen if there is a decrease in taxation without a decrease in Government
spending. In this way the Budget can be used to counter unemployment.
1 In 1957 the Act was extended to include purchase tax.
2 Items ‘below the line’ are: (1) receipts applicable by statute to debt interest which
would otherwise be paid out of revenue; (2) receipts applicable to debt redemption;
and (3) payments for which the Treasury has power to borrow.
FINANCE

Surtax, and
Profits Tax
On the other hand, if there is an increase in taxation without an increase
in Government expenditure or a decrease in Government expenditure without
a decrease in taxation then the total demand for goods and services will
tend to fall. In this way the Budget can be used to counter inflation or deflation.
For example, the aim of the Budget of April 1959, which provided for some
important reductions in taxation, was to give a further stimulus to economic
activity. The i960 Budget was designed to consolidate and fortify the progress
of the economy, and that of 1961 to counter inflation and encourage exports.
The 1962 Budget’s aim was to keep the economic position in balance. The
purpose of the 1963 Budget was to contribute towards achieving the target
of a 4 per cent growth rate in the national economy, as recommended by the
National Economic Development Council (see p. 257).
Money to meet ‘Ordinary’ (mainly current) Budget expenditure of the
central Government is in normal years derived from taxation. Taxes can be
divided into two groups, direct and indirect, which correspond roughly to
the duties collected by the Board of Inland Revenue and by the Board of
Customs and Excise. The most important inland revenue duties—income tax
(including surtax), profits tax and estate duty (death duty)—are levied directly
on the income or property of those who, in general, have to bear them.
Income tax on individual (though not on corporate) incomes and estate duty
are progressive taxes, that is, larger incomes and estates bear a proportionately
higher rate of tax. Stamp duties, although not a direct tax, are also collected
by the Board of Inland Revenue. Taxes on motor vehicles are collected
by the principal local taxation authorities, which are the county or
county borough councils in England and Wales and the corresponding
councils in Scotland; the proceeds are paid by the local authorities to the
Exchequer.
Income tax is imposed at a standard rate for the year of assessment beginning
on 6th April. The standard rate for the year 1963-64 is 7s. gd. in the
(38-75 per cent). The tax imposed on an individual is graduated by means
of personal allowances and reliefs, by reduced rates of tax on the first sections
of taxable income,1 and by the surtax.2 In the case of a married couple the
incomes of husband and wife are aggregated and are treated as one income,
but higher allowances are given than for a single person. Earned income bears
less tax than other income as certain fractional deductions (‘earned income
relief’) are allowable.
A single person earning £1,000 a year pays ^179 in income tax, while a
married couple with the same earned income pays j£i32> if the couple have
two children under the age of 11, their tax falls to £51; when the children
are between the ages of 11 and 16, the tax is only £36; if the children are
over 16 and receiving full-time education, only £21 is paid. The range of
tax payable by a single person varies from, for example, ^40 on an earned
1 The balance of income remaining after deduction of the personal allowances and
reliefs is taxable income. For 1963—64 the reduced rates are: 4s. od. in the £ on the
first £100; and and 6s. od. in the £ on the next £200. The remainder is charged at the
standard rate.
2 The surtax, which is essentially an income tax at higher rates, is charged on personal
incomes exceeding £2,000 a year after deducting certain personal allowances in excess
of the single person’s basic allowance. In addition, the same earned income relief as
for income tax and a special earnings allowance (not exceeding £2,000) are deductible
from earned income only. Surtax is imposed at rates which increase progressively
until (for 1962-63) on investment income above £15,000 a year, income tax and surtax
combined amount to 17s. gd. in the £.

income of £500 a year to £1,427 on an earned income of £5,000; if the income
is unearned, tax liability on £500 will be £52, and on £5,000 will be £2,321.
Most wage and salary earners pay their income tax under a PAYE (‘Pay-as-
you-earn’) scheme, under which tax is deducted at source, thus enabling
them to keep up to date on tax payments.
Companies are liable at the standard rate of tax on their total income
irrespective of its amount; they are also subject to profits tax, the rate of
which was increased from 12^ per cent to 15 per cent from 1st April, 1961.
In general, income tax is charged on all income which originates in the
United Kingdom and on all income arising abroad of persons (including
companies) resident in the United Kingdom. The main exceptions are that
interest on certain United Kingdom Government securities belonging to
persons not ordinarily resident in the United Kingdom is exempt; income
from certain classes of possessions abroad is chargeable not on the amount of
income arising but on the amount of income remitted to the United Kingdom;
and the trading income of specified overseas trade corporations1 is not
charged so long as it remains undistributed. The United Kingdom has entered
into agreements with many countries providing for relief from double
taxation; where such agreements are not in force, the United Kingdom
allows unilateral relief.2
Estate duty is chargeable on the value of property (whether legally settled or
not) which passes or is deemed to pass at death. Thus, it is not limited to
property owned by the deceased. It may, for example, extend to trust funds
to the income of which the deceased was entitled during his lifetime, and to
gifts made by the deceased within five years of his death (one year in the case
of a gift for public or charitable purposes). Estates with a net capital value of
£5,000 or less are exempt from duty, but on estates of a higher value there
is a progressive duty ranging from 1 per cent to 80 per cent.
Indirect taxes or taxes on expenditure are levied on commodities or services.
They are called indirect because the importer, manufacturer, wholesaler, or
provider of commodities or services pays them first and then adjusts his
prices to his customers accordingly.
Customs and Excise duties form the largest group of indirect taxes. Customs
duties are levied on imported goods, and excise duties on goods produced,
and services provided, at home. The purchase tax, which is also collected
by the Board of Customs and Excise, applies equally, and at the same rate,
to home-produced and to imported goods.
The system of customs duties is twofold in its purpose: it has the function
of providing a measure of protection for British industries or preference for
products imported from Commonwealth countries overseas and it has also
the function, in association with the excise system, of providing revenue.
The principal revenue duties collected by the Board of Customs and Excise
are those on tobacco, alcoholic drinks and hydrocarbon oil. There are a
number of smaller revenue duties, for instance, on betting, matches, and
television advertisements. The protective customs duties cover a wider field,
but their contribution to the yield of indirect taxation is relatively small.
1 Broadly speaking, these are companies, which, though managed and controlled in
the United Kingdom, carry on all their trading activities overseas.

reference should be made to the relevant Statutory Instruments. Inquiries in the
United Kingdom should be addressed to the Secretary, Board of Inland Revenue,
Somerset House, London, W.C.2.

403
Purchase tax is charged on a wide range of goods, nearly all of them con¬
sumer goods, at three rates, 10 per cent, 15 per cent and 25 per cent of the
wholesale value. Articles subject to revenue duties of customs and excise are
in general exempt from this tax; other goods free of purchase tax include
food (other than confectionery, soft drinks and ice cream), fuel, books and
newspapers, young children’s clothing and footwear, certain non-proprietary
drugs and medicines, some household appliances and textiles. In the 1961
Finance Act the Chancellor of the Exchequer was given power, which lapses
annually, to vary by order the rate of purchase tax and of the main customs
and excise duties on certain goods by up to 10 per cent in either direction.
This power is intended to be a regulator of the economy and was renewed
for the 1963-64 financial year.

Parliament in this form for the first time in 1962, The diagram on p. 404
illustrates the pattern of Government estimates of revenue and expenditure
on current account in 1963-64.
Capital expenditure dealt with in the part of the Budget statement which
lies ‘below the line’ consists chiefly of loans to the nationalised industries.
The remainder consists of loans to other public bodies, such as the New
Towns Development Corporations, loans under the Export Guarantees Acts,
and loans for overseas assistance. If, on balance, there is a deficit, it is met
from the proceeds of Government borrowing or from the surplus, if any, in
revenue and expenditure, i.e. ‘above the line’; while if there were a surplus
it would go to reduce the National Debt.
Apart from the use of surpluses, repayments and extra-budgetary funds
such as the National Insurance Fund, Exchequer payments ‘below the line’
are financed by direct borrowing from the public either through the National
Savings Movement (see p. 410) or by borrowing on the market by means of
new issues of securities. New issues of Government securities are made from
time to time for the purpose of refinancing maturing issues (conversion issues)
or to raise new money (issues for cash). Since 1956, capital requirements of
the nationalised industries have been met by the Exchequer, while most of
those of the local authorities since 1955 have been met by direct borrowing
from the public by mortgages or stock issues. Net Exchequer lending (via
the Local Loans Fund) to local authorities has steadily diminished since 1955

and in the last five years local authorities have, on balance, been repaying
debt to the central Government.
So far, borrowing on a large scale has been undertaken only to finance deficits
during or immediately after a war. The National Debt rose from ^651 million
in 1914 to £7,435 million at the end of the first world war, and from £7,131
million in 1939 to £23,637 million in 1946. On the 31st March, 1963, the
total National Debt was £29,856 million, of which £1,875 million was
repayable in currencies other than sterling, mainly to the United States and
Canadian Governments. Of the £27,981 million of internal debt, £4,476
million was short-term debt, mainly in the form of 91-day Treasury bills,
while the long-term loans included a variety of stocks, bonds, loans, and
certificates carrying fixed rates of interest (ranging from 2| to 6 per cent)
and with fixed or indeterminate dates of repayment.
The general system of public finance in Northern Ireland is, in its main
features, similar to that operating in the United Kingdom as a whole, under
which public revenues, with a few minor exceptions, are paid into the
Exchequer, from which no money can be withdrawn except on the authority
of Parliament. That authority is expressed in the case of Consolidated Fund
charges in permanent legislative form, and in the case of Supply Services by
annual Appropriation Acts based on estimates prepared by departments and
sanctioned by the Ministry of Finance.
The major portion of taxation (customs duties and most excise duties,
purchase tax, income tax, surtax and profits tax) is imposed by the United
Kingdom Parliament over the whole country, and is paid, in the first instance,
into the United Kingdom Exchequer. From the amount attributable to
Northern Ireland, known as ‘Reserved’ Revenue, there is deducted and
retained by the United Kingdom Treasury, under the Government of Ireland
Act, 1920, the sum contributed by Northern Ireland towards Imperial
Services (called the ‘Imperial Contribution’), the cost of the administration
of the Supreme Court, and other Reserved Services, and the cost of collecting
Reserved Revenue. The balance, termed the ‘Residuary Share of Reserved
Taxes’ is paid over to the Exchequer of Northern Ireland and joins with the
proceeds of taxes levied and collected by the Government of Northern Ireland,
called ‘Transferred’ Taxes, and with other non-tax receipts of a miscellaneous
nature, to form the public income. The items of Transferred Tax Revenue
are estate duties, stamp duties, pool betting duty, bookmakers’ licence duties,
television advertisement duty, most excise licence duties and motor vehicle
duties.
A Joint Exchequer Board, representative of the Treasury and the Ministry
of Finance for Northern Ireland, constituted in accordance with the Govern¬
ment of Ireland Act, 1920, determines the amount of Reserved Revenue and
the cost of Reserved Services attributable to Northern Ireland for each year, the
amount of the Imperial Contribution, and such other questions affecting
the financial relations of the two Governments as may be referred to it.
In the Northern Ireland Budget for 1963-64 (year ending 31st March), total
revenues were forecast at £140-54 million and expenditure at £136-97
million. After allowing for the Imperial Contribution, provisionally estimated
at £3-5 million, there was a Budget surplus of £73,500.
The Public Debt of Northern Ireland, totalling £110-5 million on 31st
March, 1963, is fully covered by repayable advances and investments held
by the Ministry of Finance.
The Bank of
England
FINANCE 407
Outside the Exchequer system in Northern Ireland, various funds have
been established, in addition to statutory Reserve and Sinking Funds, for
specific purposes. In general, these funds follow the United Kingdom pattern,
the principal funds being those relating to National Insurance and Govern¬
ment loans. The latter constitutes a pool of capital money available mainly
for local and public authority borrowings; on 31st March, 1963, a sum of
approximately £98 million was outstanding against such authorities.
BANKING AND PRIVATE FINANCE
The British banking system is long established and well integrated. It
comprises a central bank; commercial banks which carry on the usual main
banking services; the United Kingdom offices of various banks whose main
business is in other countries; and various specialised banks and similar
financial institutions.1
The Bank of England is the central bank and its principal business is to act
as banker to the Government and to the other banks, as the agent of the
Government for important financial operations and as the central note¬
issuing authority; it also maintains relations with central banks overseas. It
was established in 1694 by Act of Parliament and Royal Charter as a corporate
body, and its entire capital stock was acquired by the Government under
the Bank of England Act, 1946.
As the central bank, the Bank of England is responsible for co-ordinating
the application of the Government’s monetary policy. One of the main instru¬
ments for this purpose is the Bank Rate—the minimum rate at which the
Bank of England will discount approved bills of exchange and a key factor in
the general pattern of interest rates.
As banker to the Government, the Bank of England holds the main
Government accounts and it acts as the Government’s agent for the issue and
registration of Government loans. It also operates, for the Treasury, the
administration of exchange control which has been in force since 1939.
The commercial banks maintain large balances with the Bank of England
and these balances form part of the banks’ cash reserves. In addition, under
an arrangement made with the London clearing banks and Scottish banks in
1958, the Bank of England may call on these banks for ‘special deposits’
which, not being freely disposable, do not rank as part of their liquid assets.
This scheme, designed to restrict the liquidity of the banking system should
the need arise, was first put into operation in June i960, when each of the
London clearing banks was called upon to deposit a sum equivalent to 1 per
cent Q per cent for Scottish banks) of its total deposits. Further calls, in
instalments of | per cent and J per cent respectively, brought the cumulative
total of the special deposits outstanding in September 1961 to 3 per cent of
total deposits for the London clearing banks and 1J per cent for the Scottish
banks, together amounting to ^233 million. The special deposits were all
released, in similar instalments, between June and December 1962.
The Bank of England has the sole right in England and Wales of issuing
bank notes. Notes thus issued need a 100 per cent cover in gold and securities,
together with a limited amount of coin, the part covered by securities and
coin being the ‘Fiduciary Issue’, the level of which is subject to parliamentary

control. In practice very little gold is now held by the Issue Department of
the Bank of England, the bulk of the United Kingdom gold (and foreign
exchange) reserves being in a separate Government fund, known as the
Exchange Equalisation Account; this account was originally established in
1932 for the purpose of checking undue fluctuations in the exchange value of
sterling, and is operated by the Bank of England as agent for the Treasury.
The provision of coin for circulation is the responsibility of a Government
department, the Royal Mint.
The banks handling the major part of the domestic banking business in the
United Kingdom are limited liability companies which, in the main, are
subject to the ordinary law relating to such companies.
Some of the main features of the United Kingdom commercial banks are:
1. A relatively small number of banks control a large number of branches.
United Kingdom members of the British Bankers’ Association include
11 London clearing banks,1 5 banks in Scotland and 3 Northern
Ireland; they control some 13,000 branches and had total deposits of
over £9,200 million at the end of 1962.
2. The volume of cheques handled is very large and, in spite of a stamp
duty of 2d. on each cheque, many payments—and even relatively small
payments—are made by cheque. The average daily value of cheques,
drafts, bills and bankers’ effects cleared in 1962 through the London
and Provincial Clearing Houses was ^898 million; and many cheques
do not, for various reasons, pass through clearing houses. In addition,
a growing volume of payments is effected through the credit transfer
scheme introduced in i960: the average daily value of the credit clearing
through the London Clearing House in 1962 was almost £20 million.
3. It is the practice of the London clearing banks to maintain a ratio of
about 8 per cent between cash reserves and total deposits (of which just
over one-half are repayable on demand, the remainder being mainly
deposits at interest and subject to notice).
The banks make advances to customers partly in the form of overdrafts
and partly in the form of loans (with or without collateral security); in
either case, the advance is normally for a short term only unless renewed.
The ratio of London clearing bank advances to total deposits declined
from about 43 per cent in 1938 to about 17 per cent at the end of the
war, but gradually climbed back to settle down to a level of 26 to 30 per
cent for a number of years from 1951. After the withdrawal in 1958 of
official requests to the banks to restrict the level of their advances, the
percentage again moved up, and by July when the banks were
again asked to restrain their lending, was over 47 per cent. In May 1963
the ratio of advances to total deposits was over 50 per cent, well above
the 1938 level.2 The diagram on p. 409 shows the relative size of bank
advances outstanding in recent years to different sectors of the economy.
The increase in the volume of advances since 1958 has been accompanied
by innovations in bank lending practice, including the introduction of
schemes for personal loans repayable by fixed monthly instalments over
1 Three of these banks are members of the London clearing house but have headquarters
outside London (at Liverpool and Manchester).
2 About 33 per cent of the banks’ deposits at this time were covered by cash and other
highly liquid securities, while 15 per cent were covered by British Government and
other long-term securities. It is a convention that at least 30 per cent of deposits should
be covered by cash and other liquid securities.

periods up to two years, and facilities for limited service accounts at
low cost. Another development was the acquisition by many banks of
share capital in hire purchase finance companies.
4. Certain banks in Scotland and Northern Ireland have retained limited
rights to issue notes; these issues, apart from an amount specified by
legislation for each bank, must be fully covered by Bank of England
notes and by coin.

are United Kingdom companies and the London office is the head office.
These London offices form part of the complex structure engaged in the
financing of trade not only between the United Kingdom and other countries
but also in goods which are shipped direct between other countries.
Savings Banks
and the
National
Savings
Movement
The function of Trustee Savings Banks and the Post Office Savings Bank is
to provide readily available facilities for the investment of savings, particularly
the small savings of persons with low incomes. Both these types of banks
were already well established during the nineteenth century. The growth of
their business was, however, encouraged in the first world war when the
War Savings Committee was set up under Government auspices to promote
an official savings drive. A new type of long-term security for the small
investor was inaugurated at that time. This was the National Savings Certificate,
encashable at par at any time, with interest payable only on encashment, but
free of income tax. From this war-time drive originated the present National
Savings Movement, which encourages the widespread investment of savings
in Trustee Savings Banks and the Post Office Savings Bank and in National
Savings securities. The movement is led by the National Savings Committee
for England and Wales and similar committees for Scotland and Northern
Ireland.1 The committees are bodies of independent persons representing
regional savings organisations and various national institutions connected
with such matters as finance, industry and education. They are assisted by a
salaried staff of civil servants. Voluntary local savings committees, often
assisted or promoted by local authorities, co-ordinate the work of voluntary
local savings groups.
There are now three National Savings securities: the National Savings
Certificate, the Defence Bond and the Premium Savings Bond. Defence
Bonds were introduced in 1939 and are repayable at par on notice; interest
is payable half-yearly and is taxable. Premium Savings Bonds, which were
first issued in 1956, give investors (after an initial period of three months
and thereafter monthly) a chance to win prizes ranging from ^25 to £5,000
instead of receiving interest. At the end of June 1963, £402-8 million was
invested in this form of savings.
Trustee Savings Banks are managed by boards of honorary trustees and
managers, and two-thirds of the funds deposited with them are ordinal y
deposits which are withdrawable on demand or at short notice. These
deposits are invested with the National Debt Commissioners, and the
Government is responsible to the trustees for the repayment of the money so
invested, with accrued interest, as and when required. In certain circum¬
stances, Trustee Savings Banks also accept deposits of up to £3,000 for
special investment. These deposits, which may receive a higher rate of interest
than ordinary deposits, are invested by the Trustees under the supervision
of the National Debt Commissioners, but the Government is not responsible
to the trustees for the repayment of these investments. There are about
1,350 Trustee Offices controlled by 80 independent banks and depositors
number over 8^ million. At the end of June 1963 deposits in the
Ordinary Departments of the Trustee Savings Banks totalled £951-8 million
and deposits of the Special Investment Departments totalled £677-3
million.
1 The Northern Ireland Ministry of Finance is responsible for the administration
of Ulster Savings, but the furtherance and organisation of the savings movement in
Northern Ireland is the concern of a central voluntary committee, which is assisted
by county and local committees and district groups, all of a voluntary nature.

The Post Office Savings Bank, which celebrated its centenary in 1961, is
the largest organisation of its kind in the world. It has over 22 million
active accounts; in June 1963 total balances, which carry a Government
guarantee, amounted to £1,788 million, roughly £80 per depositor. Through
a centralised system of accounting, a depositor can pay in money or make a
withdrawal at any one of some 20,000 post offices throughout the country.
A person may have deposits in only one Trustee Savings Bank and his
holding in the ordinary department is limited to £5,000. He may also hold
up to £5,000 in the Post Office Savings Bank. The maximum amount of
National Savings Certificates which may be held by any one person is £300
worth of the current (eleventh) issue, introduced in May 1963, in addition
to holdings of previous issues, and £800 worth of Premium Savings Bonds.
The limit on individual holdings of the current issue of 4J per cent Defence
Bonds, which was introduced in March 1963, is £5,000; this is in addition to
holdings of previous issues. By June 1963 National Savings had reached a
record total of over £7,817 million, and covered over a quarter of the
National Debt.
The Co-operative Wholesale Society formed a deposit and loan department
about the year 1870, and the right of a co-operative society to engage in
banking was legally defined in the Industrial and Provident Societies Act of
1876. The primary purpose of the Co-operative Wholesale Society Bank was
to serve the co-operative movement, whose financial centre it has become,
but the bank has also come to include among its clients trade unions and other
mutual societies, local authorities and individual depositors. The bank’s
headquarters are in Manchester. The Scottish Co-operative Wholesale Society
has similarly engaged in banking since 1948, with headquarters in Glasgow.
It has been the policy of the commercial banks to leave the provision of
many special financial facilities to other financial institutions. These facilities,
which are supplementary to the credit facilities of the banking system, are
mainly provided through the Discount Market, Finance Corporations, hire-
purchase finance companies, the Stock Exchange, Investment Trusts,
Building Societies and the Insurance Market. The firms engaged in such
activities are in the main highly specialised, e.g., discount houses, stockbrokers,
insurers, insurance underwriters and brokers. Another type of financial
institution, the merchant bank, has been of great importance in the finance
of trade and commodity dealings and in the flotation of major issues of bonds,
particularly for overseas concerns and governments.
The merchant banks have helped to give London an international reputation
as a world financial centre for short-term and long-term borrowing. Long¬
term loans for development purposes floated on the London market earned
for Britain a steady flow of interest and attracted orders for British goods and
products. Where short-term credit was required, much British trade and also
a large proportion of trade between foreign countries was usually financed
by bills of exchange, which were accepted as payable at maturity by the
merchant banks (also known as accepting houses) and were traded on the
discount market, thus providing an easy method of transferring debts and
claims.
The main business of the Discount Market consists of trading in and holding
commercial bills of exchange, United Kingdom Government Treasury bills
and other short-term securities. In recent years commercial bills have become
412
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
a small proportion of the discount market’s business, while dealings in
short-term bonds and Treasury bills have increased considerably. Tenders
for Treasury bills are invited by the Government each week and the firms
which comprise the discount market acquire the bulk of their Treasury bills
in this way. They finance the purchase of the bills and securities they hold,
chiefly by loans from the banks; about half of these loans come from the
London clearing banks, and most of the remainder from other United
Kingdom and overseas banks. In the main these loans and deposits may be
called in at any time.
The commercial banks do not, in the ordinary way, buy Treasury bills
at the weekly tenders except on behalf of customers, but purchase, from the
Discount Market, bills which have been taken up by the market and held
until they become of a maturity required by the banks.
The Bank of England acts as lender of last resort to the 12 members of the
London Discount Market. The clearing banks do not borrow money directly
from the Bank of England; if they need to add to their cash resources they
call in part of their loans to the Discount Market. If, as a result, any particular
discount house is unable to cover its needs for cash elsewhere, it is obliged
to borrow from the Bank of England, normally at bank rate. Since the
beginning of 1963 the Bank of England has reaffirmed its right to charge a
rate higher than bank rate, in order to allow more flexibility in its control of
short-term interest rates.
Finance
Corporations
Finance
Corporation for
Industry Limited
Two corporations, the Finance Corporation for Industry Limited and the
Industrial and Commercial Finance Corporation Limited, were set up in
1945 to assist in dealing with the problems of post-war reconstruction and
development. Although the Government displayed considerable interest in
their formation, the corporations themselves are ordinary limited companies
with no official representation on their boards and having no recourse to
public funds. Another finance corporation, the Commonwealth Development
Finance Company Limited, was established in 1953 to assist development
projects in the Commonwealth. Among other financial corporations of note
are the Agricultural Mortgage Corporation Limited, and the Scottish Agri¬
cultural Securities Corporation Limited.
The FCI was formed to assist in the provision of capital (in amounts of
f 200,000 and upwards) for the re-equipment and development of major
industries with a view to promoting efficiency and thereby assisting in the
maintenance and increase of employment.
The FCI has an authorised and issued capital of £25 million and may
borrow up to four times this amount, making a possible total of resources of
£125 million. The share capital is held as follows: 40 per cent by insurance
companies, 30 per cent by trust companies and 30 per cent by the Bank of
England. At 31st March, 1963, the capital called and paid up was 2 per cent
(£500,000); the Bank of England paid £5 million in advance of call in 1958-59.
The liability of the shareholders in respect of the uncalled capital represents
security to the banks providing loans for the corporation’s working capital.
The enterprises assisted by the FCI are concerned with a variety of products,
such as steel, oil, chemicals, shipping, diesel engines, and electrical com¬
ponents.

in cases where the existing facilities provided by banking institutions and the
Stock Exchange are not readily or easily available.
The authorised and issued share capital of the ICFC is £15 million paid up
in full and a line of credit of ^12-5 million, both provided principally by the
London clearing banks and the Scottish banks in proportion to their size,
with a token participation by the Bank of England. In addition, public
debenture issues were made of ^10 million in July 1959, £6 million in April
1961 and £4 million in December 1961. The current resources of the ICFC,
including reserves shown in the balance sheet, therefore total about
£53 million.
The corporation’s function is to provide finance in sums ranging between
£5,000 and £200,000 for small and., medium-sized concerns. It has been
associated with more than 1,000 companies in the financing of their long¬
term development and has established branches in several large provincial
cities.
The Commonwealth Development Finance Company was set up in 1953 as
a new channel for the investment of private capital in Commonwealth
development schemes. Its authorised share capital is £30 million, of which
about 14^ million ‘A’ ordinary shares of £1 (2s. paid) are held by industrial,
shipping, mining and banking interests in the United Kingdom, and nf
million ‘B’ ordinary shares of £1 (10s. paid) are held by the Bank of England
and certain central banks in the Commonwealth. Commitments entered into
from its inception in 1953 up to the end of March 1963 amounted to the
sterling equivalent of approximately £25 million.
The primary function of the Agricultural Mortgage Corporation Ltd.,
established in 1928, is to grant long-term loans against first mortgages on
agricultural lands and buildings in England and Wales. The share capital
was subscribed by the Bank of England and other banks, but the funds are
mainly derived from public issues of debentures, of which about £46 million
was outstanding in March 1963.
The Scottish Agricultural Securities Corporation Limited was established
in 1933 and fulfils broadly similar functions in Scotland. Its share capital
is subscribed by three Scottish banks.
Although there are several Stock Exchanges in the United Kingdom, the
London Stock Exchange is by far the most important and is one of the world’s
two foremost free markets in securities.
The Stock Exchanges provide a means by which a holder of quoted stocks
or shares (all important securities are quoted) can, if he wishes, find a buyer
for his securities; they are also a most important element in the raising of new
capital by Government and commercial borrowers. Some 9>5°0 securities
are quoted on the London Stock Exchange; at the end of March 1963 these
had a total market value of £55,000 million, of which over three-fifths
represented equity capital.
The Stock Exchanges do not fix dealing prices; the terms on which
bargains are made between members reflect the interaction of supply of and
demand for the securities concerned. All the Stock Exchanges operate under
strict rules of conduct which they formulate themselves.
In recent years there has been a constantly rising demand for ordinary
(equity) shares, partly in expectation that such shares will maintain their real
value or grow in value in periods of rising prices. The diagram on p. 414
illustrates the growth of equity capital since 1947. Insurance companies and

pension funds now invest a larger proportion of their assets in these shares
than formerly, and the Trustee Investments Act of 1961 permits trustees,
under certain conditions, to invest up to half the funds they hold in trust in
equity shares.
The ownership of Stock Exchange securities in the United Kingdom is
much more widespread than formerly: it is estimated that there are about
3 million shareholders and that their shareholdings are widely distributed.
The largest public company in Britain has over 300,000 shareholders and
there are several others with more than 25,000.

Through investment trusts and unit trusts, investors may spread their risks
and obtain the benefit of skilled management.
The ordinary type of investment trust is constituted as a public company,
registered under the Companies Acts with limited liability; its business is
to invest its capital in a range of stocks and shares. Like other companies,
it may issue several types of stocks or shares and may retain part of its profits
to build up reserves. Investment trusts grew to importance in the latter half
of the nineteenth century and have been prominent in directing capital
towards overseas investment.
Unit trusts are constituted by trust deed between a management company
and a trustee company which holds the securities. Normally, the managers
sell units to the public and invest the proceeds in a fairly wide range of
Stock Exchange securities. The costs of running the trust are defrayed partly
by an initial charge which forms part of the price of a unit, and partly by a
semi-annual service charge which is taken usually out of the income of the
trust. The level of both charges is controlled by the Board of Trade, whose

authorisation is required before units can be offered to the public; this is
only granted if the Trust Deed is satisfactory to them.
The first British unit trust was formed in 1931 and by 1939 there were
98 trusts, with assets estimated at £80 million. This medium of saving
suffered a decline after the war, owing mainly to Government restrictions
on new capital issues, but has grown considerably since 1957. There are now
900,000 unit holdings in 66 authorised unit trusts, holding funds valued
at £30 million.
Although a certain amount of insurance is provided by Friendly Societies and
Trade Unions, most insurance services in the United Kingdom are in the
hands of either mutual or joint stock companies or Lloyd’s underwriters.

0 Including Industrial Life assurance, which is a type of life assurance in which the
premiums are collected at frequent intervals of two months or less by house to house
collection. It is conducted by both friendly societies (called collecting societies) and
companies, the former accounting for a gross premium income of £42 million in 1961
and the latter for a further £169 million.
There are over 300 insurance companies incorporated in the United Kingdom
but most of the business is in the hands of about 100 companies. Most
United Kingdom insurers write several of the main classes of business
although some specialise in one class, particularly in life assurance where about
40 companies write only that type business. A few specialise in re-insurance.
In addition over 100 overseas companies carry on business (and even more
companies are represented) in the United Kingdom, thus emphasising the
international nature of the market. The natural centre of the market is in
London, but some of the large companies have their administrative head¬
quarters elsewhere.
In 1961 the total insurance funds of the British insurance companies and
collecting societies amounted to ,£7,300 million; of this, ,£4,500 million was
ordinary life funds, ,£1,500 million was industrial life funds and ,£1,300
million general non-life funds. With the growth of group pension schemes
the rate of accumulation of life funds is increasing greatly.
There is no government control over the investment policy of insurance
funds and these represent one of the most important sources of funds for
investment in commerce and industry. More than a third of the total assets
of British insurance companies are invested in equity shares and debentures,
and this proportion is gradually increasing.
Lloyd’s is an incorporated society of underwriters in London. The name
‘Lloyd’s’ is derived from Edward Lloyd’s coffee house, established in the late

seventeenth century, where merchants with maritime and other interests
gathered to transact business. By the middle of the eighteenth century,
Lloyd’s coffee house had become the principal centre of underwriting business
and of intelligence about shipping movements. Although in its earlier history
the activities of Lloyd’s were confined to the conduct of marine insurance
business, during the last sixty years there has also been built up at Lloyd’s
a very considerable world-wide market for the transaction of other classes
of insurance business, except life assurance of which the amount transacted
at Lloyd’s is negligible. In addition to its insurance activities, Lloyd’s main¬
tains a world-wide organisation of the collection and diffusion of shipping
intelligence.
Lloyd’s is now governed by a series of special Acts of Parliament starting
in 1871; the affairs of the Society of Lloyd’s in its corporate capacity are
administered by the Committee of Lloyd’s, which does not itself transact
insurance business.
The interests of a holder of a Lloyd’s policy are safeguarded in the following
ways: (1) every Lloyd’s underwriter is liable for his underwriting debts to
the full extent of his means and is required to lodge security by way of a
deposit with the Committee of Lloyd’s; (2) the whole of the premiums
received by an underwriter must be placed in a trust fund to be used exclusively
for the payment of his underwriting liabilities and expenses, and only
ascertained profits can be released to the underwriter and then only with
the consent of the trustees; and (3) every underwriter must submit his
accounts to an annual audit.
The usual practice of underwriters today is to form themselves into groups
known as syndicates which generally specialise in particular branches of
insurance. The underwriters forming the syndicate appoint an agent who is
empowered to accept risks on their behalf and to control all matters concerned
with the syndicate’s business. If the insurance is for a relatively large amount,
several syndicates may participate, but each underwriter is individually
liable only for the proportion of the risk accepted on his behalf.
Underwriters may not accept business directly from the public, but must
transact through Lloyd’s brokers in London, who must be connected with
Lloyd’s, either as members or subscribers.
The insurance market is completed by the insurance brokers, acting on
behalf of the insured; brokers are an essential part of the Lloyd’s market and
a valuable part of the company market. Many brokers specialise in re-insurance
business, acting as intermediaries in the exchange of contracts between
companies, both British and overseas, and often acting as London repre¬
sentatives of the latter.
Over two-thirds of the fire, accident and marine insurance business comes
from abroad, partly by direct placing in London and partly from branches
and agencies established in over 100 countries. The basic principle of this
international business is that resources capable of meeting any potential loss
are instantly available for use in any part of the world.
Behind this large and international volume of business stand the very
substantial assets of the companies, in addition to substantial reserves of
uncalled capital and the whole of the deposits, underwriting trust funds and
personal fortunes of Lloyd’s underwriters.
The principal function of building societies is to supply long-term loans on
the security of private dwelling-houses purchased for owner occupation,
FINANCE
41?
though loans are occasionally made on the security of commercial and
industrial premises and farms. The funds of building societies are derived
mainly from the general public who invest in shares or deposits. The amount
of share capital is not fixed; shares, which have a fixed value, are not dealt
with on the Stock Exchange but may be withdrawn in cash if notice is given.
The Building Societies Acts, 1874 to i960, prescribe the general way in
which societies must conduct their business. The Chief Registrar of Friendly
Societies has discretionary powers to stop a society either advertising or
accepting money from investors if he considers that the way in which the
society’s business is conducted is jeopardising investors’ money. The rapid
expansion of building society activity in the twentieth century has been
accompanied by a concentration of most of the business in the hands of a
few very large societies. At the end of 1962, 706 societies were in operation,
with total assets of £3,831 million. The seven largest societies, however,
account for more than half the total funds. The amount advanced on mortgage
in 1962 was £617 million, a record total.

TRADE AND PAYMENTS
PATTERN
TRADE
Britain was one of the first countries to remove legal and fiscal restrictions
on the internal movement of persons and goods, and the first to develop
adequate facilities for the movement of large quantities of goods by mechanical
transport (canals, roads, railways and steamships). With its resources of coal
and iron, and its succession of mechanical inventions, Britain was also the
first country to industrialise on a large scale and to produce a wide variety
of consumer goods in large quantities. In addition, Britain evolved, over a
long period of years, the specialised financial services essential for the smooth
functioning of overseas trade.
OVERSEAS TRADE
Although relatively small in area and accounting for less than 2 per cent of
the world’s population, the United Kingdom is the world’s third largest
trading nation, conducting nearly 10 per cent of international trade.
In the nineteenth century Britain attained a pre-eminent position in
international trade. At the end of the century Britain’s share of exports of
manufactures entering into world trade was about 33 per cent. Its share of
world imports of all goods was somewhat larger than that of world exports,
as imports into Britain were paid for not only by exports of goods but by
interest on overseas investments and net receipts from shipping and a variety
of financial services. As other countries followed Britain in becoming fully
industrialised, it was natural that Britain’s share of world exports of manu¬
factures should fall. Even before 1914 this supremacy was being increasingly
challenged by other nations, including Germany and the United States,
and although Britain’s imports and exports increased in absolute terms over
the years, its share of the world total tended to decline. By 1937 Britain’s
share in world exports of manufactures, measured by value, had fallen to
20 per cent compared with 22 per cent in 1929 and 32 per cent in 1914. In
the years immediately following the second world war, Britain s share rose
again and in 1950 was 26 per cent; but by 1962 it had fallen to about 15 per
cent.
For over a century international trade has been of vital importance to
Britain’s economy. Britain relies upon imports for half its total consumption
of foodstuffs and nearly all the raw materials needed for its industries. Its
exports of goods and services together represent over a fifth of the gross
national product. It is a major supplier of machinery, vehicles, aircraft, metal
manufactures, electrical apparatus, chemicals and textiles. It is the world’s
largest market for foodstuffs, and among the largest for metals, cotton, wool,
petroleum and many other products.
For some hundreds of years Britain has also been an important centre of
entrepot trade, the importance of which, however, in relation to total Lnited
Kingdom trade, has declined in the last half-century.

The value of imports (c.i.f.) passed the £2,000 million mark in 1948 and,
with rapidly rising prices of raw materials, totalled £3,892 million in 1951.
As a result of the tendency in subsequent years for import prices to fall, the
1951 level was not reached again until 1957. In 1962 imports were valued at
£4,492 million, about £49 million below the peak level of i960. The increase
in exports has been at a steadier rate. The 1948 total of £1,579 million (f.o.b.)
had increased to £2,566 million by 1951, and there were further marked
expansions between 1954 and 1956, and 1958 and i960. Exports in 1962
totalled £3,792 million, an increase of £91 million over 1961 and the fourth
successive year in which the previous year’s total was surpassed.
Between 1948 and 1962 the volume of both exports and imports increased
by about two-thirds. In the eight years since 1954 the volume of exports had
risen by 28 per cent and that of imports by 40 per cent. Over this period the
terms of trade, i.e. the ratio between the general level of export prices and
that of import prices, moved in Britain’s favour.
The value and volume of exports and imports in selected years from 1948
to 1962 are shown in Table 30.

The expansion of domestic agriculture by over 80 per cent compared with
pre-war and by over one-quarter since 1954 has reduced Britain’s dependence
on imported food supplies. Imports of food, beverages and tobacco repre¬
sented 42 per cent by value of total imports in 1948; since 1954 the proportion
has not been above 40 per cent and in 1962 was 35 per cent. There has been
a similar downward trend in the proportion accounted for by basic materials
—from 31 per cent in 1948 to 20 per cent in 1962. In the latter year the volume

of imports of basic materials as a whole was slightly below the 1954 level.
Imports of crude petroleum and lubricants have increased steadily, and in
1962, with a total value of £534 million, accounted for 12 per cent of the
value of imports, compared with 7! per cent in 1948.

Imports of manufactures have increased considerably in recent years. (A
marked growth in trade in manufactured goods has been a general trend in
world trade over this period.) In the case of semi-manufactures, the propor¬
tion has risen from 14 per cent in 1948 to 20 per cent in i960 and about
i8| per cent in 1962. The growth in imports of finished manufactures
(including both capital and consumer goods) has been stimulated by the
lifting of quantitative restrictions, and the proportion has risen from 5 per
cent in 1954 to 14 per cent in 1962.
More than five-sixths of Britain’s exports consist of manufactured goods.
By far the most important group are engineering products, which in 1962
accounted for 451 per cent of the total, compared with 36 per cent in 1948.
Within this group, exports of many types of machinery, electrical equipment,
road vehicles, tractors, aircraft and scientific instruments have expanded
markedly over this period. The share represented by chemicals has also
grown steadily, but that of metals has shown little change. Exports of textiles
have fallen from over 19 per cent of the total in 1948 to 13! per cent in 1954
and 7! per cent in 1962. In contrast to the pre-war period, coal exports
account for less than 1 per cent of the total, but those of petroleum products

BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
As will be seen from Table 32, the growth of trade between Britain and
Western Europe has been a feature of the area distribution of trade in recent
years, but conversely there has been a decline in the proportion of Britain’s
exports going to primary producing countries. In 1962, 19 per cent of exports
went to the six countries of the European Economic Community or Common
Market (Belgium, France, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands and the
German Federal Republic), compared with under 14 per cent in 1956 and
10 per cent in 1948, and nearly 14 per cent to the other members of the
European Free Trade Association. In 1962, 31 per cent of total imports
came from Western Europe. The increases in trade with the German Federal
Republic, the Netherlands and Italy have been particularly marked.
Relatively, trade with other members of the Commonwealth and with the
sterling area as a whole has tended to decline. In 1962, for example, less
than one-third of Britain’s exports and a slightly higher proportion of its
imports were accounted for by Commonwealth countries, compared with
about two-fifths in 1956. Canada, Australia, India and New Zealand, however,
are among Britain’s most important trading partners. The United States has
been both Britain’s largest single market and source of supply since 1957.
The proportions of total exports going to North America rose from 9 per cent
in 1948 to 14 per cent in 1962. Expanding oil consumption in Britain has
given rise to a substantial expansion of imports from the Middle East. Trade
with Latin America has shown only a small increase in recent years and in
1962 accounted for under 5 per cent of exports and under 7 per cent of
imports. Britain’s trade with the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe has been
growing over the past decade but is still small in relation to trade with
other parts of the world.
Re-exports are goods which are exported (1) in the condition in which they
are imported or (2) after having undergone minor operations—such as simple
blending, husking, repacking—which leaves them essentially unchanged.
Traditionally, the greater part of United Kingdom re-export trade is in raw
materials and foodstuffs, for example, wool, rubber, tea, non-ferrous metals
and fur-skins. In recent years a considerable re-export trade has developed
in machinery. Commodities imported from Commonwealth countries and sent
on to countries in Europe, particularly traditional re-exports such as tea and
wool, account for a considerable proportion of the total value.
In 1962 the value of re-exports was £158 million, slightly below the peak
total reached in 1961, and the principal items were: fur-skins, rubber, raw
wool, tea, non-ferrous metals, beverages, aeroplane engines and electrical
machinery. About half of the re-exports went to countries in Western
Europe.
As previously mentioned, the United Kingdom has usually imported more
goods than it exports; until a few years ago the gap was normally covered by
net earnings from invisible transactions, but since 1958 this source of foreign
exchange earnings has declined sharply. In 1958 net invisible earnings were
£297 million; in 1961 the surplus fell to ^76 million but recovered to
£138 million in 1962.
Invisible transactions are divided for statistical purposes into six main
groups: Government; shipping; interest, profits and dividends; travel; other
services; and private transfers. Some of these figures are precise (for instance,
for Government transactions), others are estimates. The diagram on p. 423
shows the breakdown of the figures from 1959 to 1962.
TRADE AND PAYMENTS
423
BRITAIN’S INVISIBLE OVERSEAS TRANSACTIONS (net) 1959-62
Under the heading of Government current transactions, the main items
on the debit side are rising military expenditure overseas and grants and
loans, mainly to less-developed countries. Shipping receipts come mostly
from export freights and cross trades between other countries and also from
passenger traffic. Shipping payments, on the other hand, arise mainly on
account of tramp shipping services. Shipping transactions produced a net
credit until 1959 but now represent a net burden to the balance of payments.
This deterioration has in part occurred because the capacity of the British
merchant fleet has been outstripped by the expansion of Britain’s overseas
trade and by the growth of foreign fleets.
About three-fifths of Britain’s receipts under the heading interest, profits
and dividends come from investments in the sterling area. On the debit side,
major items include interest paid on sterling held by other countries (which
thus fluctuates with changes in short-term interest rates in Britain) and interest
payments on long-term loans from Canada and the United States. Receipts
from travel have increased greatly since 1950, reflecting the growing im¬
portance of the British tourist industry (see p. 424), but expenditure on travel
and tourism overseas has also expanded, and the small net debit has changed
little. Major components of other services include payments and receipts in
respect of insurance, civil aviation, films; expenditure of United States and

The tourist industry is now one of Britain’s largest earners of foreign
currency. Over the period 1951-61, earnings from the foreign tourist trade
and business travel amounted to the equivalent of nearly £1,400 million, in
addition to about £600 million earned by associated British shipping and
air services. In 1962 tourist receipts from overseas amounted to £220 million,
while a further £100 million was estimated to have been paid to British
carriers. United Kingdom residents on holiday or travelling on business
overseas spent about £240 million in the same year. The United Kingdom
usually has a large net surplus on earnings from tourism with North America
but a substantial deficit with Western Europe.
The total number of visitors to the United Kingdom in 1962 was i^b.ooo1
—an increase of 7 per cent on the 1961 total and twice that of 1955.
The British Travel and Holidays Association, which is a grant-aided body,
is concerned with the promotion of the tourist trade, particularly by means
of publicity overseas. It maintains offices, agencies or representatives in
many overseas countries (see Appendix, p. 51?)- The association was formed
in April 1950 by the merger of the British Travel and Holidays Board and
the Travel Association.
It has been a major aim of successive United Kingdom Governments since
the second world war to work for the removal of restrictions on trade and
payments, to reduce barriers to exports and, as far as possible, to restore the
convertibility of sterling. To this end, Britain has taken a leading part in
setting up such organisations as the International Monetary Fund (IMF),
the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), the Organisation for
European Economic Co-operation (succeeded in the autumn of 1961 by the
Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD)) and
the European Payments Union (succeeded by the European Monetary
Agreement), and has had a large share in these organisations’ activities,
especially those to free trade from the restrictions which grew up in the war
and post-war periods.
In addition to substantial reductions in tariffs on imported goods, carried
out through the GATT, the United Kingdom has removed almost all its
quota restrictions on imports from countries with which it is in normal
GATT relations.
There is a very short list of goods on which import controls remain. It
includes some items of special difficulty and a few where restrictions are
recognised internationally, such as arms, ammunition and radioactive
materials.
In the nineteenth century the United Kingdom became strongly attached to
the principle of free trade, and at the beginning of the twentieth century the
only customs duties were those imposed for revenue purposes on a small
range of products. During the first world war, certain duties (the McKenna
duties) were introduced to discourage imports of motor cars, musical instru¬
ments, clocks and watches and cinematographic film. These were continued

after the war. Certain key industries, notably optical and scientific instruments
and fine chemicals, were given protection for strategic reasons under an
Act passed in 1921. In 1925 duties were imposed, for revenue purposes, on
imported silk, artificial silk and articles containing these materials; these
duties were later transformed into protective duties. It was not until 1932,
however, that any serious departure was made from the principle of free
trade. Under the Import Duties Act of that year, the United Kingdom imposed
a duty of 10 per cent ad valorem on all imported goods except those on a
Free List (mainly important raw materials and foodstuffs) and set up machinery
for the imposition of additional duties and for additions to be made to the Free
List where appropriate. This measure provided a degree of protection for
British industry and, at the same time, a basis for negotiations with foreign
countries already in possession of a tariff structure.
The principle of Imperial Preference had been introduced into the United
Kingdom customs tariffs in 1919 and, as a result of the Ottawa Conference
in 1932, agreements were concluded with independent Commonwealth
countries providing for reciprocal preferential tariff treatment over a wide
range of goods. The Import Duties Act had already permitted the duty-free
entry of goods from the United Kingdom dependencies.
A series of bilateral trade negotiations with other countries between 1932
and 1939 resulted in some modification in the level of protection and in the
Commonwealth preferences which had been established. During the second
world war, because of Government purchase and import control, protection
by the tariff was of relatively minor importance, and it was only after the
substantial relaxation of quantitative import controls in 1949 that the tariff
again became an effective instrument of protection.
Since the war, the United Kingdom’s protective tariff has been considerably
modified as a result of a series of multilateral tariff negotiations held under
the auspices of the GATT, which permits the retention of existing preferences
but prohibits the creation of new ones. The United Kingdom has, however,
obtained certain limited waivers from the GATT no-new-preference rule;
these permit, under certain conditions, increased tariff protection for United
Kingdom industries while preserving duty-free commitments for Common¬
wealth goods, and allow increased preferences for the benefit of Colonial
products wholly or mainly dependent on the United Kingdom market. In
the negotiations under the GATT, United Kingdom customs duties have
been reduced, or bound against increase, on goods which account for about
half of Britain’s normal imports from other contracting countries, in return
for concessions by those countries. Margins of preference (which are subject
to the GATT near-preference rule) have thus been reduced, but only in
return for compensating tariff concessions by other countries, and only after
consultation with all the Commonwealth countries concerned. The most
recent series was completed in July 1962, after negotiations lasting nearly
two years; it consisted mainly of tariff reductions negotiated between the
members of the European Economic Community, the United Kingdom and
the United States. Most of the necessary changes in the British tariffs were
brought into effect on 31st October, 1962. Arrangements are in hand for a
further round of GATT tariff negotiations, as part of the ‘Kennedy round’,
to start in May 1964.
Two Acts of recent years have affected tariff policy. The Customs Duties
(Dumping and Subsidies) Act, 1957, empowers the Board of Trade to impose
duties on imported goods of any description which have been dumped or
subsidised and which are causing or threatening material injury to a particular

industry. To date the Board of Trade has taken action against the import of
seven commodities and nine other cases have been settled by negotiation.
The Import Duties Act, 1958, replaced the existing legislation relating to
the protective tariff (i.e. four main Acts and some 70 Finance Act provisions)
and brought it up to date in a single measure. Following the passing of the
Act, the tariff was recast into an internationally agreed form (the Brussels
Nomenclature), which came into use from 1st January, 1959.
The moves towards establishing closer economic unity in Europe have a
direct and far-reaching influence on tariff policy. The British Government in
February 1957 put forward proposals aimed at associating the six countries
(see p. 422) of the European Economic Community (EEC) with other members
of OEEC, in a free trade area in Europe covering industrial products. The
negotiations proved unsuccessful and were suspended in November 1958.
During 1959 seven members of OEEC—Austria, Denmark, Norway,
Portugal, Sweden, Switzerland and the United Kingdom—agreed to establish
between themselves a European Free Trade Association (EFTA) with the
object of reducing trade barriers in Europe and establishing a bridge between
the EEC and the other members of OEEC. A convention was initialled in
Stockholm in November 1959 and ratified by member countries in the early
months of i960. Under it, customs tariffs on trade in industrial products
between members of EFTA are being eliminated by stages, originally over
a ten-year period. Reductions of 50 per cent, however, had already been made
by 31st October, 1962, and under a new time-table, agreed in February 1963,
the dismantlement of intra-EFTA tariffs will be completed by the end of
1966, thus reducing the period to six and a half years. In March 1961 an
Agreement of Association was signed between Finland and EFTA.
On 10th August, 1961, the United Kingdom Government made a formal
application for membership of EEC under Article 237 of the Rome Treaty.
Negotiations started in the autumn of 1961 and were principally concerned
with safeguards for the essential interests of British agriculture and of Com¬
monwealth suppliers to the British market and the need to respect Britain’s
obligations to the other EFTA countries. At the request of the French delegate
to the Community negotiations were suspended at the end of January 1963.
At that time provisional agreements had been reached on many important
issues and it had been hoped that the outstanding problems could have been
settled within a comparatively short time.
The export trade and virtually all the import trade of the United Kingdom are
conducted by private firms.
Methods of export trading vary considerably, according to the firm, the
industry, the product and the market. A good deal of United Kingdom export
trade, especially of the smaller manufacturing firms, is conducted through
export merchants in the United Kingdom; many firms, however, sell to
importers and consumers abroad through their own agents or resident
representatives in the countries concerned; in other cases, sales are made
through a firm’s own branch offices, distributing organisations or subsidiary
sales companies established in overseas markets.
Similarly, in import trade, many large firms engaged in manufacture or
domestic trade buy directly from overseas suppliers, while smaller firms may
find it more convenient to buy through intermediaries such as import/export
houses, commission agents, and the representatives of overseas firms. Since
January 1957 overseas trading undertaken directly by the Government has

been confined to jute goods; the purpose of this is to protect employment
in Dundee, where the jute industry is concentrated and forms the mainstay
of employment.
During the war and in the difficult economic circumstances of the post-war
period, a large number of restrictions on the movement of goods and services
and on payments were imposed. Most of these have been progressively
abolished. The following section gives a short account of the controls still
in force.
Exchange control, which includes, inter alia, control over the purchase and
sale of gold and foreign currencies, was introduced at the outbreak of war in
September 1939. Most of the temporary war-time powers were embodied in
permanent legislation in the Exchange Control Act, 1947.
Exchange control is now confined mainly to transactions between residents
of the sterling area and residents outside it, and has been greatly relaxed in
the past few years. Since the end of December 1958 residents of all countries
outside the sterling area can settle transactions between themselves in sterling.
Sterling held by non-residents of the sterling area on an external account is
freely convertible into other currencies, including dollars. The only remaining
important restrictions relate to the movement of capital from the United
Kingdom to non-sterling countries.
Exports of goods to destinations outside the sterling area are subject to
exchange control and, in general, have to be paid for within six months in an
acceptable currency or by sterling from an external account. Control is also
exercised over imports, to ensure that currency authorised for their payment
is, in fact, used for that purpose.
Exchange control policy is the responsibility of the Treasury, but most of
the administration is, in practice, carried out by the Bank of England as agent
of the Treasury; and, in turn, the Bank of England has delegated to the
commercial banks a wide variety of powers to deal with applications.
Restrictions in various forms on the amount of foreign currency and sterling
notes that United Kingdom travellers might take abroad were in force from
the end of the war until November 1959. Since that date there has been no
limit on the amount of foreign currency that United Kingdom residents may
obtain; a bank or authorised travel agency may supply travellers with up to
^50 in sterling notes and £250 in foreign currency for each journey abroad
for travel outside the scheduled territories (sterling area); and an amount
exceeding ^250 may be authorised by the Bank of England on application
being made through the traveller’s bank. Reference is made to the Bank of
England as a protection against the unauthorised export of capital and not to
limit the amount available for travel.
The Import, Export and Customs Powers (Defence) Act, 1939, empowers
the Board of Trade to make statutory orders prohibiting or regulating the
import or export of goods. The powers of both import and export control
derive from the same legislation, but the purpose and mechanism are quite
distinct.
In accordance with its international obligations under the GATT and the
IMF, the United Kingdom Government has progressively removed quanti¬
tative restrictions from almost all imports from the countries of the free world.
Goods still subject to control require a specific import licence and quotas

have been set up for most of these goods. Some quotas refer specifically to
individual countries and are usually shared out among exporters by the
authorities of the countries concerned. Others are accorded on an overall or
global basis; these are generally allocated by the United Kingdom authorities
to United Kingdom importers, usually on the basis of their share of the trade
in the commodity in the past.
Except for the control necessary to ensure that exports to destinations
outside the sterling area are paid for in the proper manner, United Kingdom
exports are not, except in a very minor -way, subject to any Government
control or direction. The few controls that are in operation are imposed to
supervise exports of military and strategic importance, to conserve materials,
such as metal scrap, which may be in inadequate supply, to assist exchange
control operations in preventing the export of capital in the form of valuable
goods, and to prevent the export of works of art classed as national treasures,
such as paintings, manuscripts and antiques. Normally, individual licences
are required for specific consignments of goods subject to export licensing
control. Goods controlled for strategic reasons, not included in the category
of atomic energy materials and appliances, arms and ammunition, may be
exported to the Commonwealth, the Irish Republic and the United States
of America without licence.
The United Kingdom Government does not subsidise exports, but supplies
information, advice and practical assistance (including credit insurance
facilities) to exporters1 and seeks to create conditions in which export trade
can flourish. Its general economic policy includes the use of fiscal, credit and
other measures to maintain a stable economy and to control excessive demand
for goods and services by the home market, and action through international
negotiation to reduce barriers to the free flow of trade and to move towards
the freest possible system of trade and payments.
The Government department most concerned in export promotion is the
Board of Trade, which calls upon the assistance of overseas representatives.
At each Embassy or Legation there is always an officer of high rank, a Minister,
Counsellor or First Secretary (Commercial), who specialises in commercial
matters. These officers direct the commercial activities of consular officers
in their respective territories. At important centres in the Commonwealth
there are Trade Commissioners, who are directly responsible to the Board
of Trade.
Overseas officers regularly report on local economic and commercial
conditions, pay special attention to local demand for particular commodities,
and generally assist the exporter to overcome any difficulties he encounters
in trade with the country in question, particularly those arising out of
governmental regulations. These officers investigate potential markets for
British products, advise about methods of trading with particular areas, and
seek out and pass on opportunities for export business and inquiries for
British goods. Assistance is also given to United Kingdom exporters in
appointing agents and locating potential importers. From records kept in
London, brought up to date by reports from its overseas officers, the Export
Services Branch of the Board of Trade can provide information concerning
any country on:

(1) prospects for United Kingdom exports and requirements of particular

and tariffs and duties on particular commodities;
(3) methods of trading;
(4) local tastes and preferences in design; and
(5) the probity and influence of firms with which an exporter contemplates

The Government’s official information services overseas help to promote
trade by publicising British industrial achievements and providing informa¬
tion on new developments in British industry.
The Export Credits Guarantee Department, responsible directly to the
President of the Board of Trade, is run on commercial lines to provide
insurance for United Kingdom exporters and merchants against the main
risks of financial loss incurred in overseas trading. These facilities have been
developed over a period of nearly forty years and in the last six years the
Department’s business has more than doubled. In 1962 it insured £879
million worth of exports, an increase of 14 per cent over the previous year;
this sum represents nearly one-quarter of the total United Kingdom export
trade. The department is obliged to conduct its business on a self-supporting
basis, taking one year with another, and cannot therefore be regarded in any
way as a provider of subsidies to exporters.
The risks covered include insolvency or protracted default of the buyer,
governmental action which blocks or delays transfer of payment to the
United Kingdom exporter, imposition of new import licensing restrictions
in the buyer’s country, war between the buyer’s country and the United
Kingdom, cancellation or non-renewal of a United Kingdom export licence,
or ‘any other cause of loss occurring outside the United Kingdom and not
within the control of the exporter or the buyer, and not normally insurable
with commercial insurers’. Cover may commence from the date of contract
or (at lower premiums) from the date of shipment.
The main types of export insurance policy are:
1. Comprehensive policies normally covering goods sold on terms of up to
six months’ credit. The exporter insures the whole of his trade, or the
whole of his trade with an agreed group of markets, for the twelve
months (or, in some cases, three years) covered by his policy. For certain
engineering goods this type of cover is extended to goods sold on credit
terms of up to five years. Cover is also available for goods of foreign
origin sold by a United Kingdom merchant to third countries, provided
this trade does not conflict with direct United Kingdom exports.
2. Specific policies which cover capital and other goods sold on credit
terms of up to five years. Specific policies are negotiated for each
individual contract.
In October i960 it was announced that to match overseas competition, in
certain cases cover would be given for periods in excess of five years; where
competition was supported by an overseas government, full matching cover
would be given; in other cases, cover would be given on payments due within
five years. In April 1961 ECGD introduced financial guarantees for United
Kingdom banks providing finance on a long-term basis for overseas purchasers
of large capital goods and works, and in January 1962 the London Clearing
430
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Trade Fairs
Banks, the Scottish Banks and a number of insurance companies agreed to
provide finance at fixed rates of interest for such loans, and also in respect of
other export financing on longer than three years’ credit which was secured
by an ECGD guarantee to the bank concerned. At the end of April 1963 the
value of export contracts financed through such guarantees totalled more than
£51 million.
The exporter or merchant is normally required to retain an interest in the
debt or risk involved and, consequently, guarantees are given up to a maximum
of between 85 and 95 per cent of loss. In February 1962 this was extended
to 100 per cent for transactions involving over three years’ credit which had
already operated satisfactorily for two years. Premium rates are assessed
separately for each country, and vary according to the risks and the terms of
payment. Cover is also available for United Kingdom concerns carrying out
services for overseas firms or, under certain conditions, entering into an
international consortium.
Under the Export Guarantees Acts, 1949 to 1957? Government has
powers to give economic assistance to other countries (see p. 436).
An inquiry carried out by the Federation of British Industries (FBI) in 1957
showed that the large majority of British trade associations favoured the
development of specialised fairs, concentrating on the products of a particular
industry or group of industries, rather than the general fair at which wide
ranges of products are exhibited.
Some 70 specialised fairs are held every year in the United Kingdom and the
number is growing steadily. An increasing proportion, at present about half
the total, are international in character, and the remainder are national (i.e.
open only to firms showing United Kingdom products). Some of the specialised
fairs, such as the Motor Show and the Radio and Television Show, attract large
numbers of the public as well as many trade buyers from home and overseas,
and provide an important means of advertising and selling British goods.
United Kingdom manufactures are shown at most of the large international
trade fairs throughout the world. For example, the United Kingdom is
usually well represented at the Milan, Hanover and Poznan Fairs. In addition
to such international events there are, from time to time, specially organised
displays of British products. Through a subsidiary company, British Over¬
seas Fairs Ltd., the FBI organised British Trade Fairs in Baghdad in 1954,
in Copenhagen in 1955, in Helsinki in 1957? Lisbon in i959> New- York
in i960, in Stockholm in 1962 and in Zurich in 1963; it is organising similar
fairs in Barcelona and in Sydney in 1964. In 1961 a British Trade Fair,
organised by Industrial and Trade Fairs, Ltd., was held in Moscow, at
which 620 British firms exhibited. United Kingdom manufacturers have been
prominent at the many important specialised international fairs which are
held in North America and Europe.
Participation in trade fairs and ‘British Weeks’ overseas is a form of export
promotion for which the Government provides information, advice and, in
certain cases, free facilities. The Government is prepared to provide stands
for United Kingdom trade associations whose members wish to take part in
overseas fairs; to build and manage British pavilions at trade fairs where
displays are on a basis of nationality; to provide exhibits at all-British fairs,
and to give support to ‘British Weeks’ and similar events (often including
promotion of British goods in department stores). The amount allocated to
the Board of Trade for these purposes has risen from £60,000 in 1955-56
to £635,000 in 1963-64.

In i960 the Dollar Exports Council was renamed the Western Hemisphere
Exports Council and its area of responsibility was extended to include the
whole of Latin America and the Caribbean as well as Canada and the United
States. The Council (originally named the Dollar Exports Board) was
established in 1949 by representatives of industry, trade, finance and organised
labour in Britain, with the approval and support of the Government. It is
an independent, self-governing, voluntary organisation to promote exports.
Similar tasks are being undertaken in Europe and the Middle East respectively
by the Export Council for Europe, also set up in i960, and by the Council
for Middle East Trade, which was established in 1963.
By a process of evolution through the centuries, the United Kingdom has
developed an efficient and adaptable organisation of trade and financial
services, centred mostly on London, and capable of meeting the needs, not
only of Britain itself, but of the world in general. Britain’s supremacy in
this respect derives from a number of factors—historical, geographical and
economic—as well as the technical efficiency and low cost of its services.
In the nineteenth century, the rapid growth of British industry, commerce
and shipping under the stimulus of the industrial revolution made Britain
the market as well as the workshop of the world. It became the site for the
chief world markets in raw materials (see below), freight, insurance, and
precious metals. At the same time, British capital was invested in overseas
countries to assist their development, increase their output and exports, and
provide markets for manufactured goods. London became the chief supplier
of capital for many Commonwealth and foreign governments and a centre
for entrepot trade proceeding to and from the growing industrial areas on
the continent of Europe and in North America. In course of time, the pound
sterling and the sterling bill of exchange developed into the principal form
of money for transactions between one country and another in all parts of
the world.
Side by side with these developments, a sound commercial banking
system and a flexible system of central bank control have been built up, while
specialised institutions such as discount houses, merchant banks, accepting
houses, the stock exchanges, investment trusts and finance corporations have
evolved to satisfy particular needs for short-term or long-term finance. The
facilities provided by merchant banks and accepting houses, for example, have
long been used to finance shipments of goods not only to and from Britain,
but also between overseas countries themselves.
Britain is the traditional centre for marketing many of the world’s basic
commodities. Most of these markets were closed during the war but most,
if not all, have now reopened and many have fully regained—some even
surpassed—their previous position. Among the more important are the Baltic
Exchange (the market for shipping and air transport, grain, seeds and
vegetable oils), the London Commodity Exchange (cocoa, coffee, copra,
hides and skins, rubber and sugar), the London Wool Exchange, the London
Metal Exchange, the Liverpool Cotton Exchange and the Liverpool Corn
Exchange. These markets not only cater for the import of goods for home
consumption but do much business in effecting transactions between buyers and
sellers in other countries. In addition to these formal markets, there is scarcely
any product which cannot be traded through an intermediary in the United
Kingdom. For example, London is the world’s most important philatelic
market and also the leading international centre for the sale of works of art.

BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
The Foreign Exchange Market is subject to United Kingdom exchange
control regulations governing the purchase and sale of foreign currencies in
the sterling area, but these regulations have been progressively relaxed in
recent years. The turnover of the market has increased materially since the
introduction in December 1958 of external convertibility for the principal
European currencies.
The market consists of about 130 authorised banks and nine firms of
brokers, all linked together by telephone in the United Kingdom, and by
telephone, telex and cable with overseas centres.
The London Gold Market, which had remained closed from the outbreak
of war, was reopened on a restricted basis in March i954> under the general
supervision of the Bank of England. It has regained its pre-war position as
the leading centre for dealings in gold, handling about four-fifths of the gold
coming on to the free markets of the world. The market consists of five
firms dealing in gold bullion, whose representatives meet each working day
to ‘fix’ the official London gold price.
As a result of Britain’s early lead in international trade and finance, several
countries tended not only to use sterling as their natural currency for inter¬
national transactions, but also to maintain central currency reserves in
Britain. When Britain abandoned the gold standard in 1931 these countries,
which came to be known as the ‘sterling bloc’ and later as the ‘sterling area’,
did likewise, and pegged their currency exchange rates to the pound sterling.
In 1939, after the outbreak of war, the pound sterling was no longer freely
convertible into other currencies and the sterling area became more formally
defined as a currency area for exchange control purposes. The United
Kingdom imposes no exchange control on transactions with residents of
other sterling area countries.
All the Commonwealth countries (except Canada), together with Burma,
Iceland, the Irish Republic, Jordan, Kuwait, Libya, the Republic of South
Africa, South West Africa, the British protected States in the Persian Gulf
and Western Samoa are members of the sterling area. These countries contain
one-quarter of the world’s population and account for one-quarter of the
world’s trade. The main feature of the sterling area is that the greater part of
the overseas trade of member countries is financed in sterling; they keep
their foreign reserves largely in the form of sterling and generally maintain
a fixed relationship between their currencies and sterling. Member countries
for the most part sell their foreign currency earnings in London in exchange
for sterling and can purchase for sterling the foreign currency they require.
They generally also sell gold in the London market for sterling. The United
Kingdom reserves of gold and foreign currencies are held in the Exchange
Equalisation Account, which buys and sells exchange in the market as appro¬
priate. All these currency arrangements are voluntary; there are no strict or
centralised rules of conduct.
THE BALANCE OF PAYMENTS
Estimates of the United Kingdom’s balance of payments are published
quarterly and provide a summary of the most important transactions with
other countries, classified by type of transaction and by area.
The transactions fall into three main groups—current account, long-term
capital account and monetary movements. The balance on current account is
TRADE AND PAYMENTS
433
composed of the balance of visible trade (i.e. the difference between mer¬
chandise imports and exports and re-exports) and the balance of invisibles.
On long-term capital account, the main groups of items are intergovernmental
loans (including amortisation) and other identified net long-term investment
abroad by United Kingdom residents, or in the United Kingdom by non¬
residents. The third heading, monetary movements, reflects in part the
United Kingdom’s position as an international banker. It includes identified
capital transactions not of a long-term character (e.g. changes in acceptances);
changes in overseas sterling holdings and changes in the United Kingdom
reserves of gold and convertible currencies.
With the decline in receipts from invisible transactions and the continuing
need for Britain to export capital, and in particular to give financial assistance
to developing countries, the main balance of payments problem for the country
is to achieve a substantial surplus on visible trade account; that is to say,
to export more while preventing imports from rising equally.
Between 1945 and 1951 the balance of payments on current account
fluctuated widely. From 1952 to 1959 there were surpluses in each year
except 1955. In i960 there was a substantial deficit of ^308 million, but in
the following year this was reduced to only £72 million, and in 1962 there
was once more a surplus, amounting to £67 million.
The favourable balance on current account of £67 million in 1962 was made
up of a surplus of £239 million with the overseas sterling area and a deficit
of £172 million with the non-sterling area. In almost every year from 1950
to 1959 the deficit on visible trade was more than balanced by invisible
earnings, but in i960, and again in 1961, as a result of a substantial drop in
the favourable net balance on invisible trade, these were insufficient to
provide a current account surplus. In 1962, however, the deficit on visible
trade was the lowest for some years and there was also an improvement in
net invisible earnings.
Movements of capital, both short- and long-term, may mean that changes
in balance on current account are not necessarily reflected in the reserves
of gold and convertible currencies. These rose by £31 million in 1961,
strengthened by borrowing from the International Monetary Fund (IMF),
but fell by £183 million in the following year to ^1,002 million, of which
.£922 million was in gold. Britain’s net external liabilities in sterling amounted
to £3,543 million at the end of 1962. About two-thirds of these are towards
countries in the overseas sterling area. Table 33 summarises Britain’s balance
of payments from 1959 to 1962, and Table 34 gives the reserves of gold and
convertible currencies at the end of each year since 1945.
In addition to its reserves of gold and convertible currencies, Britain has
drawing rights on the IMF based on its quota, which was raised to £696
million in 1959. On three occasions recourse has been made to these facilities,
including a drawing of $1,500 million (£536 million) in nine different currencies
in 1961. The final instalment in repayment of this drawing was made in August
1962. A stand-by arrangement with the IMF, authorising drawings up to
the equivalent of $1,000 million by the United Kingdom up to August 1963,
has been extended to August 1964.
Informal arrangements between the central banks of certain European
countries to hold each others’ currencies provide a further means of safe¬
guarding the position of sterling.
An additional line of reserves is provided by the dollar securities, with an
estimated value of $750 million to $1,250 million, held by the Exchange
Equalisation Account.

OVERSEAS INVESTMENT
A vital factor in helping Britain to balance its external accounts, particularly
with the dollar area, in the immediate post-war years was the financial aid
made available by the United States and Canada. In 1945 the United States
extended to Britain a line of credit of $3,750 million, and a loan of $650
million (later adjusted to $622 million) in settlement of Lend-Lease and
reciprocal aid adjustments arising out of the war. In 1946 Canada also
extended a line of credit, amounting to $C. 1,250 million, of which the United
Kingdom drew $C. 1,185 million. The terms of settlement with both
countries provided for repayment in 50 annual instalments, starting on
31st December, 1951, with interest at the rate of 2 per cent a year. (Between
1948 and 1951 Britain received in all $2,700 million in Marshall Aid from
the United States under the European Recovery Programme.)

Investment
Overseas
Overseas investors in Britain are allowed to repatriate the proceeds of the
sale of their direct investments, including any capital gains that may have
accrued, provided that the investment was made after ist January, 1950.
Earned profits and dividends can be transferred, irrespective of the amount;
transfers of this kind have never been restricted.
By far the largest proportion of private investment by overseas countries
in Britain is made by United States firms. It has been estimated1 that between
1950 and 1961 the total value of United States direct investments in Britain
rose from $847 million to $3,523 million, representing nearly half the total
United States direct investment in Western Europe over the period. The
1961 total included $761 million in petroleum refining and distribution and
$2,305 million in manufacturing industry. A British Industrial Development
Office in New York provides potential American investors with advice and
information about manufacturing conditions in Britain.
According to a survey by the Board of Trade, it is estimated that private
direct investment (excluding oil and insurance) in 1961 amounted to £236
million, of which about ^181 million was United States capital, £14 million
Canadian and £29 million from Western European countries. (The 1961
total was inflated by the acquisition by the American Ford company of the
remainder of the shares of its British subsidiary.) Portfolio investment (for
instance, by purchase on a stock exchange of securities in United Kingdom
companies) by people in overseas countries has also increased markedly since
1957 and was particularly high in the latter half of 1961.
For well over a hundred years the United Kingdom has been a major supplier
of external finance for other countries; up to the first decade of the twentieth
century it was the foremost supplier of private long-term capital. About
two-thirds of such private finance goes to Commonwealth countries (including
dependent territories).
All the countries of the sterling Commonwealth except the United Kingdom
are net importers of long-term capital and look to the United Kingdom for
a substantial proportion of their external capital requirements. The sources
and availability of capital for the needs of developing countries are discussed
from time to time at Commonwealth Economic Conferences and similar
meetings.
Private investment abroad may take several forms: the raising of loans on
the London capital market; direct investment by the establishment of
subsidiary companies, by the ploughing back of profits earned overseas and
participation, jointly with domestic capital, in enterprises overseas.
The United Kingdom imposes no restriction on investment in the sterling
area by United Kingdom firms. Such investment is frequently made from a
firm’s existing resources. However, borrowers outside the United Kingdom
must normally obtain the consent of the Treasury (which is advised by the
Capital Issues Committee) if the amount borrowed exceeds £50,000 in any
one year. Borrowing by Commonwealth and Colonial Governments in the
London capital market has fallen in recent years, but averaged about £50
million a year in the 1950s. Finance is also made available by the Common¬
wealth Development Finance Company (see p. 413), which, by March 1963,
had entered into commitments totalling over £25 million in fourteen countries
for a wide variety of projects.
Investment outside the sterling area is subject to Exchange Control

regulations and, broadly speaking, official exchange is only available for
direct investment projects which promise benefit to the United Kingdom
balance of payments. Direct investment projects which do not satisfy this
test may be financed by borrowing abroad or by using the proceeds of the
sale of foreign securities.
Until i960 the net level of United Kingdom private investment in all areas
had been over £100 million a year. In 1961 and 1962 there was, exceptionally,
a net inflow of investment into Britain. The gross outflow of new funds is
estimated to have averaged £300 million yearly since 1953. About £150
million a year goes to under-developed countries. The annual survey by the
Board of Trade estimated that private direct investment abroad by United
Kingdom companies (excluding oil and insurance companies) was about
£224 million in 1962, a drop of £2 million compared with the previous year;
in 1961 a little more than one-half was in the sterling area, some 17 per cent
in North America and about 18 per cent in Western Europe, representing
the highest total in any year for investment in that area. The figures include
long- and short-term investment and reinvested profits.
Since the second world war, despite economic difficulties, the United
Kingdom has made available to other countries very large sums in the form
of grants and loans for relief, rehabilitation, development and other economic
purposes. Loans and grants to the less-developed countries from the United
Kingdom Exchequer since 1951 have exceeded £1,200 million and in the
three years 1960-62 have averaged over £150 million a year (see Table 35).
The greater part of such assistance goes to dependent territories and to
developing countries inside and outside the Commonwealth.

This assistance takes two forms: grants and loans, and payments for
technical assistance arranged directly with the country receiving help (bilateral
assistance); and contributions to international bodies (multilateral assistance).
The division of assistance is shown in Table 36. In 1962 bilateral assistance
totalled £145-3 million and multilateral assistance was £7-2 million. Bilateral
technical assistance, in so far as it is quantitatively assessable, accounted for
about £23 million, having more than trebled since i960. Over half of
Britain’s governmental aid goes to Commonwealth countries in Africa.
There are several public sources of finance from which United Kingdom
funds are made available for overseas development. The following are the
principal forms of machinery through which funds are provided.

From 1949 to April 1963 over 44 loan agreements with a total value of
about £320 million had been made, of which all but 7 have been made since
mid-1958. The total includes 13 loans to India, amounting to about £175-3
million, 6 to Pakistan to a value of £45 million and 2 to Nigeria, valued at
about £22 million. For the more recent loans, repayment periods are up to
25 years, and in certain cases there is a grace period before repayments
begin.

Technical
Assistance
“ The figures do not cover all technical assistance provided by the United Kingdom,
some of which cannot be assessed in quantitative terms.
The Colonial Development and Welfare Acts are the principal machinery for
providing assistance for development in British dependent territories:
£340 million has been made available for the period 1946-66. The 1959 Act
enables Exchequer loans to be made, to a total of £100 million for the five
years 1959-64, to finance development expenditure. By the end of the 1962-63
financial year £73 million had been made available.
The Commonwealth Development Corporation (CDC), which is financed
from Exchequer funds, provides capital for development projects in dependent
territories. Up to the end of 1962, the CDC had capital commitments totalling
over £117 million, of which two-thirds were in Africa. Under legislation
enacted in 1963 the Corporation changed its name from Colonial Development
Corporation and was empowered to undertake schemes in independent
Commonwealth countries in which it had operated before independence.
About one-seventh of Britain’s governmental aid contribution is directed to
technical co-operation efforts. Under the Colombo Plan for Co-operative
Economic Development in South and South-East Asia it is providing £5
million in the three years to 1966 for technical assistance, and over 5>500
people have come to Britain for training under the plan. (The United King¬
dom’s total development assistance to the area from Exchequer funds up to
30th June, 1962, amounted to £214 million.)

Technical assistance is an important element in the Special Commonwealth
Assistance Plan for Africa (SCAAP). British contributions include technical
services, educational and training facilities in Britain, the provision of
specialist advisers, and of teachers under the Commonwealth Educational
Co-operation Scheme. Under the Overseas Services Aid Scheme overseas
governments can retain the services of trained and experienced staff (at
present numbering over 15,000) until they can be replaced by local people.
Arrangements are also made for supplying technical assistance under the
Central Treaty Organisation (covering Pakistan, Iran and Turkey) and
through the Foundation for Material Assistance in Africa (FAMA).
Britain’s subscription to the International Bank for Reconstruction and
Development (IBRD) is the second largest of any country. The sterling area
subscription had been fully disbursed by September i960, mainly for loans
by the IBRD to Commonwealth countries. Britain is also contributing
£47 million to the capital of the International Development Association (an
affiliate of the IBRD), which provides long-term capital on easier terms for
developing countries.
For technical aid through the machinery of the United Nations, Britain
in 1963 raised its annual subscription to the Expanded Programme of
Technical Assistance to $3-75 million and to the United Nations Special
Fund to $6-25 million.
INTERNAL TRADE
The internal trade of the United Kingdom can be divided into two broad
categories: trade in raw materials, capital goods and intermediate products
(for example, vehicle components) and trade in consumer goods, involving
the network of distributive trades by which home produced or imported
goods reach the consumer. (The pattern of consumers’ expenditure is
outlined in Chapter 10, The National Economy.)
There have been a number of official statistical inquiries into the distributive
trades. Most recently, early in 1963, the preliminary results of a full Census
of Distribution for 1961 were published by the Board of Trade, covering the
retail and (related) service trades in Britain (but not Northern Ireland). This
census was only the second of its kind undertaken in Britain; the first,
covering also the wholesale trades, related to I95°> A sample inquiry, however,
was conducted by the Board of Trade into the retail and service trades in
1957 and a full-scale inquiry into the wholesale trade for 1959- A sample
inquiry into business done in 1962 is also being undertaken.
Only a proportion of the trade in consumer goods passes through whole¬
salers: sales are also made to consumers through producers’ own selling
organisations (including their own retail outlets and mail order business);
and other sales are made directly by producers to retailers. Wholesale channels
are particularly in evidence in the distribution of textiles, agricultural produce
and foodstuffs. The inquiry made by the Board of Trade in respect of 1959
showed that out of a total of 19,000 business units engaged in wholesale
distribution in Great Britain, over 3,000 dealt in clothing, footwear and
textiles, 2,000 in grocery and provisions, 2,000 in vegetables and fruit, and
over 3,000 in other food and in drink. In addition, there were 8,000 dealers
(wholesale or retail) in coal, builders’ materials, grain or agricultural supplies,
and 7,000 dealers in other industrial materials and machinery.

TRADE AND PAYMENTS 439
The value of stocks held by wholesalers and dealers at the end of 1962 is
estimated to have been about ^920 million; expenditure on capital assets is
about £100 million a year, about one-quarter of which is invested by business
units engaged in distributing petroleum products, most of them being the
distributing organisations of the major oil companies.
Methods of wholesale distribution vary according to the type of merchan¬
dise handled. Fresh fish, for example, is auctioned at the ports to port
wholesalers who sell to inland wholesalers at the main distribution centres or,
in some cases, direct to retailers; fruit and vegetables, on the other hand,
may be sold by growers to commission agents who dispose of the produce
either to wholesalers or direct to retailers, or alternatively the grower may
deal only with wholesale firms.
London’s wholesale markets are of outstanding importance in the distri¬
bution of foodstuffs, particularly imported supplies. Covent Garden handles
about five million tons of fruit, vegetables and flowers each year; nearly
8,000 tons of meat pass through Smithfield market each week; Billingsgate
is the principal distributing centre in Britain for fish. Other markets in London
include those at Leadenhall (poultry) and Spitalfields (fruit and vegetables).
Voluntary wholesale chains, that is to say independent retailers linking
themselves to a single wholesaler or a group of wholesalers and so benefiting
from some of the lower operating costs of large-scale trading without losing
their independence, have developed quite rapidly in the grocery trade since
1954. It has been unofficially estimated that by June 1961 about 41,000
independent grocers (35 per cent of all independent grocers and accounting
for 53 per cent of their turnover) had joined a voluntary scheme.

societies or department stores, with ten or more branches; and (4) independent
retail businesses and branches of small multiple stores (i.e. chains of stores
with nine or fewer branches). Market and street traders are also included in
the table but, according to the 1950 census of distribution, the amount of
business done by these traders is usually very small, their average turnover
being less than £2,000 per year. The table shows the shares of the four main
groups of retail business in 1961 compared with 1950 and 1957.
There are a large number of small undertakings; the 1961 census recorded
178,000 businesses with an annual turnover of under £5,000. Most of the
smaller undertakings have working proprietors; out of the 2-6 million persons
engaged in the retail trade in 1957, 590,000 were working proprietors and
unpaid family helpers. Out of a total of about 580,000 establishments shown
by the 1961 census of distribution, and recorded in Table 38, grocery and
other food retailing groups numbered nearly 280,000 establishments, and the
clothing and footwear group about 93,000.

The 1961 census showed that the value of retail sales increased by 18 per cent
between 1957 and 1961. This was an average rate of increase of about 4 per
cent a year, compared with about 6 per cent a year between 195° an<^ I957-
Allowing for a price rise of about 4 per cent, the increase in the volume of
retail sales over the four-year period was 13 per cent, or an average of 3 per
cent a year. The overall increase in sales was, however, achieved with much
the same number of shops and with almost exactly the same number in
employment. In 1962, according to the Board of Trade monthly sample
inquiry into retail sales, there was an increase in the value of sales only a
little less than in 1961—3! per cent compared with 4 per cent—but this
conceals a larger rise in prices in 1962 than in 1961, for the increase in the
volume of sales was only just over | per cent, compared with nearly 2 per cent
in 1961.

In Northern Ireland, it is estimated that the value of retail sales increased
by 3 per cent in 1962, compared with an increase of 5 per cent in 1961.
By form of organisation, multiples with 10 or more branches have shown
the largest rise in numbers in recent years. Between 1957 and 1961 they also
showed a 20 per cent rise in sales per shop, compared with 17 per cent for
all retail establishments. Their share in total sales rose from 25 per cent in
1957 to 29 per cent in 1961. The number of co-operative establishments
increased slightly between 1957 and 1961, but their share of retail trade
dropped from 12 per cent to 11 per cent. Other large retailers (small chains
with from 5 to 9 branches, and other firms with 25 or more persons engaged)
appear to have maintained their share of the market from 1957 to 1961 as also
have the department stores. The number of smaller independent shops, on
the other hand, declined by about 7,000 over the four years, though average
turnover per shop increased. This group has been giving ground only slowly
before competition from larger undertakings. During 1962 multiple traders
further increased their share of retailing at the expense of other types of
traders. They showed an increase of 7 per cent, compared with 6-i per cent in
1961, while independents experienced a smaller increase (2-4 per cent against
3-2 per cent) and the co-operative societies a fall of 0-3 per cent, compared
with an increase of 1 per cent in 1961.
The rate of increase in the value of retail sales has also varied according to
type of shop. Sales in the durable goods sector (furniture, radio and television,
household appliances and cycle shops) decreased sharply after the re-imposi¬
tion of hire-purchase restrictions at the end of April i960, and in 1962 were
6 per cent below the 1959 total, although an upward trend appeared towards
the end of the year. Clothing and footwear shops’ sales showed an increase
of 2 per cent between 1961 and 1962 while food shops’ sales advanced by
4 per cent.
Retail prices, which had previously been rising for some years until 1958, were
relatively stable in 1959 and i960, but again moved upwards in 1961 and 1962.
The development of self-service in retail establishments since 1950 has
probably helped the multiple stores and, to a lesser degree, the retail co¬
operatives to achieve a higher rate of expansion in sales. The number of
self-service shops in Britain in 1963 is unofficially estimated at about 12,000
and new self-service outlets are being established at a rate of over 1,900 a
year. Over two-fifths of these shops are thought to be owned by retail
co-operative societies and about one-third by multiple stores. Unofficial
estimates for self-service trading put the 1962 rate of sales at some £860 million.
Self-service shops as a whole are now estimated to be responsible for over
a quarter of retail sales (compared with 10 per cent in 1957) in the grocery
and provision trade, but for other types of merchandise the proportion is
insignificant.
Supermarkets, which may be broadly defined as self-service shops with a
selling area of more than 2,000 square feet and selling all types of food and
some household goods (such as cleaning materials), have been operating
in Britain since 1956. By the beginningpf 1963 about 1,000 had been opened,
of which the largest proportion were in or around the London area. Co¬
operative societies own about a third of the supermarkets, and multiple
stores over half.
An even more recent trend is the emergence of ‘discount houses’, which
in essence are supermarkets often located outside established shopping areas,

and selling household goods (as well as groceries) at prices below those
normally prevailing. So far, because of resale price maintenance, only a few
discount houses have been opened in Britain.
New forms of automatic vending machines have come to the fore since
1955, and an increasing number of coin operated machines are being installed
in factories and commercial premises as well as in normal retail outlets. The
range of goods sold is widening, with hot and cold beverages and prepared
foodstuffs among the most popular. Various estimates have been made of the
trade done through automatic machines; perhaps 200,000 machines are in
use, and total sales may be of the order of £20 million to ^25 million a year.
Traders who owned and operated automatic vending machines, but were not
otherwise engaged in retail trade, had sales of over £\ million in 1961.
Some 11,700 mobile shops1 (compared with 8,000 in 1957) were reported in
the Census of Distribution for 1961, with sales amounting to ^93 million.
Nearly a quarter of this turnover was concentrated in Scotland (compared
with a tenth of all retail sales). Co-operative societies accounted for 39 per cent
of sales through mobile food shops, against 16 per cent in ordinary food shops.
For the most part, mobile shops were concerned with food sales; well over
40 per cent were travelling grocers, and over 25 per cent and 20 per cent
respectively were greengrocers and butchers. Only a very small proportion
(about 6 per cent) were non-food shops, and these mainly specialised in
paraffin supplies and hardware.
Mail order trading has been one of the most rapidly growing forms of selling
in Britain in recent years, especially in the north of England. Mail order
sales through all channels reached ^277 million in 1961. The 1961 Census of
Distribution showed that the sales of specialist retail mail order businesses
had risen from ^126 million in 1957 to ^227 million in 1961, a rise of 80 per
cent. Mail order sales by large retailers amounted to ^12 million, by manu¬
facturers to £34 million and by wholesalers to £4 million.
Mail order houses operate through advertising in the press or through
recruiting agents who have at their disposal elaborate catalogues. General
mail order houses still largely dominate the trade, with sales of £205 million.
The bulk of their orders consists of clothing, footwear and household textiles.
The smaller mail order businesses generally specialise in a single commodity,
notably in the sale by post of seeds, plants and small horticultural requisites.
An inquiry conducted by the Board of Trade showed that sales by manu¬
facturers direct to the public totalled £144 million in 1961, compared with
£jo million in 1950. Mail order sales accounted for 24 per cent of the former
total, sales to employees, 11 per cent, and charges for work done, 9 per cent.
Other direct sales, including sales by door-to-door salesmen, accounted for
the balance of 56 per cent. Included in these sales were items as various as
carpets, washing machines, brushes and soft drinks.
The retail co-operative societies are voluntary non-profit-making organisations
engaged in retail trade and controlled by their members, who are also their
customers. An operating surplus is returned periodically to members as a
dividend, and the amount distributed is proportionate to the value of the
member’s purchases.
Retail co-operatives also sell to the general public, but membership is open
to anyone paying a small deposit on a minimum share, which entitles the

member to an equal voice with other members in determining the policy of
the society. Investment by individual members is limited to ^1,000 but the
rules of some societies fix lower limits. Only a low rate of interest is paid
on the shares.
At the end of 1961 there were 926 retail co-operative societies registered
under the Industrial and Provident Societies Act. Amalgamations are slowly
diminishing the number of societies, the total having fallen by 89 in three
years. More than a quarter of the total membership of the co-operatives
(12,832,000) was provided by the eight largest societies, each of which had a
membership of more than 150,000. One, the London Co-operative Society
with just under 1-3 million members and a turnover of £55 million, is the
largest retail co-operative in the world. Total sales of the retail co-operative
societies in 1961 reached £1,018 million (this figure includes certain activities
not covered by the census of distribution figure in Table 37); and of the total
trading surplus, £46 million, or about three-quarters, was allocated to divi¬
dends on sales.
Retail co-operative societies are free to purchase where they wish or to
produce their own goods, but in order to secure the advantage of large-scale
production and distribution, they have collectively established wholesale
and production societies.1
About 1-3 million people are employed in Great Britain in industries providing
services directly to the public which are closely connected with the distributive
trades. The largest number are in the catering and hotel trades, employing
about 580,000, and the garage and motor repair trades, with over 360,000.
Others include laundries, dry cleaning, entertainment, sports and recreations,
and betting.
An inquiry undertaken by the Board of Trade relating to i960 showed
that there were 124,000 establishments primarily concerned with catering
with a total turnover in that year of £1,300 million. (Catering was defined to
cover public houses, canteens, and fish and chip shops, as well as hotels and
restaurants, etc.) Hotels and holiday camps (i.e. excluding boarding houses
and small unlicensed hotels) had receipts of about £170 million, of which
£80 million was from residential accommodation. Nearly half the total
turnover of the catering trades was from the sale of alcoholic drinks.
There are about 1,500 commercial laundries with an annual turnover of
about £70 million, of which some £45 million is domestic laundry. (The
latter figure has tended to decline with the increasing popularity of coin-
operated washing machines and launderettes.) Dry cleaning firms in 1961
had a turnover of £36 million.
Of the estimated 36,000 garages in Britain, nearly one-third are mainly
petrol filling stations, about the same proportion also deal with repair work,
and the remainder are primarily motor car distributors. Most garages are
tied under contract to major oil companies, selling only one company’s petrol,
and sometimes lubricants also.
Takings in hairdressing establishments have increased very rapidly—from
£38 million in 1950 to £62 million in 1957 and £98 million in 1961.
About three-quarters of total receipts are from women. The number of
establishments (currently about 40,000) has also increased, though less
rapidly.

and the Scottish Co-operative Wholesale Society Limited.

BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
The Institute of Packaging has estimated that British industry now spends
between £500 million and £600 million annually on packaging, an increase
of one-half during the previous decade. The expansion of self-service shops
and the growth of sales in the form of branded and standardised products
have been major factors in the great changes which have taken place in
packaging methods. These developments are reflected in the marked increases
in output of the industries concerned—plastics, fibre-board, metal tubes, tin
plate and glass containers. Fruit and vegetables, for example, are increasingly
sold in packs of transparent film. Aerosol dispensers, almost unknown a few
years ago, were being used at a rate of over 55 million in 1961, having increased
from about 28 million in 1959. Their principal uses are for insecticides and
air fresheners. Laminated aluminium foil is now employed extensively as a
wrapping material in the food industry.
The rapid growth of sales of household and durable consumer goods, such
as cars, furniture, washing machines, refrigerators and cookers, has been greatly
helped by instalment purchasing. The Board of Trade has powers to regulate
the terms of hire-purchase and credit sales agreements. The current terms
are: a minimum deposit of 10 per cent on durable consumer goods except
motor vehicles, for which 20 per cent is required, and usually a maximum
repayment period of three years.
Total hire-purchase debt outstanding rose by about £450 million to
£937 million during the period between October 1958 and April i960 when
controls were removed; it amounted to £918 million at the end of July 1963.
At that date also the hire-purchase debt owing directly to household goods
shops, covering furniture and other domestic goods, including the amount
re-discounted by finance houses, was ^315 million. In addition, some of the
hire-purchase sales of household goods are directly financed by finance
houses but these companies are mainly concerned with the financing of hire-
purchase business in motor vehicles and industrial, farm and commercial
equipment. At the end of July 1963 the hire-purchase debt owed directly
to them was £603 million. There are a large number of these companies
but a high proportion of the business is done by a small number which
operate on a national scale. Finance houses suffered substantial losses in
i960 and 1961 as a result of bad debts, fraud and a declining volume of
business. Measures have been taken to improve standards of credit-worthiness
among potential borrowers.
Hire-purchase in Northern Ireland directly financed by the major finance
houses operating from offices in Northern Ireland amounted in 1962 to over
£10 million and at the end of 1962 the hire-purchase debt owed to them
amounted to over million.
The expansion of productive capacity in industries manufacturing consumer
goods in Britain, and the ever-increasing choice of goods and services available
to the consumer in recent years, have been accompanied by a steady upward
trend in expenditure on advertising. About £498 million is estimated to have
been spent on all forms of advertising in 1962, £18 million more than in 1961.
About £221 million was expended on press advertising, well over half of it
in the national and provincial press and the rest in periodicals and magazines
and in the technical trade press; and £100 million (including ^10 million in tax)
was spent on television advertising. The remainder was divided between
other media, such as posters, films, catalogues, window displays, exhibitions,
and free samples and gift schemes. Most of the advertising is carried out by

advertising agencies, which, in some cases, also provide marketing, consumer
research and other services. The central organisation of the agencies is the
Institute of Practitioners in Advertising. The trade association for agencies,
owners of advertising media, and all concerned in advertising is the Advertising
Association. The latter was responsible for the setting up in 1962 of the
Advertising Standards Authority, an independent body whose objective
is the promotion and enforcement of the highest standards of advertising.
Industry and commerce have in recent years paid increasing attention to
improving public understanding of their work and objectives. Public relations
consultancy firms and the public relations departments of advertising agencies
provide general services, apart from the increasing employment by industrial
organisations and trade associations of staff specialists in public relations.
Their professional body, founded in 1948, is the Institute of Public Relations:
not only commerce and industry, but the professions, national associations,
central and local government are represented within the Institute.
Various legislative measures exist in the United Kingdom to protect the
consumer against specific abuses. Independent organisations have also sought
to establish voluntary minimum standards of quality. Weights and measures
legislation, one of the earliest forms of consumer protection, is strictly enforced
by qualified inspectors. The Merchandise Marks Acts, 1887-1953, are
designed to ensure that the marking of goods is both accurate and
honest. The purity, hygiene and description of food are controlled by the
Food and Drugs Acts, 1955, 1956, and 1958.
The British Standards Institution (see p. 274) has established a number of
standards for consumer goods, and the Council of Industrial Design (see
p. 232) helps to foster improvements in the design of consumer goods.
Advice to the public on the merits of consumer goods is provided by the
Consumers’ Association Ltd., a private body financed by the subscriptions
of members and, until recently, through the British Standards Institution’s
Consumer Advisory Council. The Consumers’ Association tests and reports
on the quality of goods bought on the open market; its findings are published
in its monthly bulletin Which?, issued to subscribers. In addition to the
Consumers’ Association there are a number of local independent consumer
groups, which in 1963 formed themselves into a national Federation of
Consumer Groups. Assistance with certain aspects of consumer guidance is
also given by a number of other private bodies and by certain Government
departments, e.g., the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research.
Special arrangements in the form of consumer councils and consumer com¬
mittees, have been made for the nationalised industries. Individual trades and
industries have also taken measures to raise standards of quality.
A prospective purchaser of a second-hand car can obtain guidance as to
whether the car is the subject of a hire-purchase agreement. Virtually every
hire-purchase agreement on a car is registered with H.P. Information Ltd.,
a non-profit-making company whose members are car dealers or finance
companies concerned with car sales, and this company will answer inquiries
made through its members, the police, solicitors, the motoring associations,
or the Citizens’ Advice Bureaux (see p. 138).
The Moloney Committee on Consumer Protection, set up by the President
of the Board of Trade in 1959 to consider and report whether changes in the
law and other measures were desirable for the further protection of the
consumer, presented its report in July 1962. Some of its principal recom-

mendations are now being implemented. The Government in 1963 set up
a Consumer Council, as envisaged by the committee; it is being financed from
public funds and will work in conjunction with the Citizens’ Advice Bureaux
to further the interests of the consumer. The Government have also announced
their intention of introducing comprehensive legislation on hire-purchase.
Other recommendations of the committee were in respect of the consolidation
and amendment of the Merchandise Marks Acts, and improvements on the
existing labelling practices.
In March i960 the President of the Board of Trade set up a confidential
fact-finding inquiry into the extent and effects of individual resale price
maintenance (see p. 276); the results are at present under consideration.

MANPOWER
The total working population of Great Britain at the middle of June 1963
was about 25 million, some 46 per cent of the total population, and included
about 73 per cent of persons of normal working age (15 years to 59 years for
women, 15 years to 64 years for men). About 94 per cent of the men of working
age are today in or seeking gainful work. The remaining 6 per cent consist
mainly of those continuing their education, of the severely disabled and of
some persons of private means. The proportion of women of working age
in or seeking gainful work is much lower, about 50 per cent, as many
housewives have no wish to take employment outside the home, or if they
have, are prevented by household duties from doing so. Besides those of
normal working age, there are probably about a million older men and
women still at work. The great majority of the working population work for
a wage or salary, but over 1 • 6 million are employers or self-employed.
The situation is markedly different in Northern Ireland, where the ratio of
working to total population is under 40 per cent, and farmers and small¬
holders working their own holdings account for about an eighth of the working
population. Northern Ireland, however, has under 3 per cent of the United
Kingdom population, so that the figures for Great Britain are broadly
representative of the position in the United Kingdom.
During the present century, decreases in both birth and death rates have
had the effect of increasing the proportion of persons over the age of 45 years
in both the total population and the working population (see p. 12). Changes
in laws and customs have also had an effect. The school-leaving age has been
raised to 15 years and more young people aged 15 to 21 are engaged in full¬
time education. The proportion of those over the normal working age who
are still working has declined (though the great increase in the number of
older persons has meant that the actual number who are working has increased).
The proportion of men aged 20 to 64 who are at work has remained very
high at all ages. Among women, on the other hand, there has been a steady
increase during the century in the proportions employed in the age groups
15 to 59, but this has been offset by the raising of the minimum working age
and by a decrease in the proportion of women employed above the age of 60.
There has been an increase in the employment of married women, particularly
in the last twenty years.
The proportion of single women at work tends to decrease with age.
About 90 per cent of women aged 20 to 30 are in, or seeking, employment,
compared with rather more than half in their late fifties; among married
women, however, the proportion at work which is nearly 40 per cent for
women in their early twenties, declines for the age-groups 25 to 34 but rises
again for those aged between 35 and 50. An increasing proportion of women
in the middle age groups are taking up employment (including part-time
work) and more than half the women at work are married.
Between 1950 and 1961 the total working population of Great Britain
increased by 8 per cent from just under 23 million to just over 24J million;

by the end of 1962 it had reached the record total of 25 million. The Ministry
of Labour estimated in 1962 that the total labour force will increase by
about a million between 1962 and 1972. Much of this increase is expected to
come from the exceptionally large number of school-leavers in the earlier
part of the decade and the remainder mainly from the recruitment of labour
reserves, particularly older married women.
The broad changes in the manpower position in Great Britain between
mid-1948 and mid-1963 are shown in Table 39.

and temporarily stopped workers. Part-time workers are counted as full units.
c The working population figures include small numbers of ex-Service personnel on
leave after completing their service and not included in the other figures in this table.
About 40 per cent of those in civil employment are employed in the mining
and manufacturing industries and only about 4 per cent in agriculture and
fisheries, even during the harvest season. Over half of those in manufacturing
are in the metal, engineering and chemical groups of industries.
Most industries employ women as well as men, but there are jobs, such as
underground work in coal mines, for which it is illegal to employ women.
The industrial groups in which women are chiefly employed are in the
metal-using industries, in the manufacture of textiles and clothing, in the
food, drink and tobacco industries, and in the distributive trades and pro¬
fessional and miscellaneous services.
An analysis of the total number in civil employment by broad industrial
groups is given in Table 40.
The numbers given in Table 40 as working in an industry or service,
include those engaged on administrative, technical and clerical work, so that
the totals given for the production industries are greater than the numbers on
productive processes. The numbers employed in manual occupations in
manufacturing and mining industries represent about one-third of the total

of men employed in all industries and a quarter of the total of women so
employed.
At the beginning of the twentieth century the occupied male population of
Great Britain still tended to be concentrated in five major groups of industries
and services: commerce and finance, agriculture, coalmining, building and
construction and engineering and shipbuilding. Women were also largely
employed in commerce and finance, but otherwise tended to be concentrated
in four other occupation groups: personal service (including domestic service),
clothing, textiles and professional work. During the past sixty years this
concentration and segregation of male and female labour has grown much
less marked as the result of a number of changes in the industrial and occupa¬
tional distribution of the population. The following appear to be among the
more important of these changes:
(1) A general and large increase in the number of persons occupied in
professional, administrative, technical and clerical work; the increase
in the number of women in clerical work has been particularly large
(nearly 200 per cent between 1921 and 1951).
(2) A decline in the proportion of the working population engaged in
manual labour.
45°
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
(3) A decrease in the number of persons occupied in private domestic
service; the number of women so occupied fell by about a million
between 1901 and 1951.
(4) A large increase in the proportion of the working population employed
in professional, financial and scientific services and in personal services
other than private domestic service.
(5) An increase in the proportion of the working population employed in
the distributive trades.
(6) A large increase in the proportion employed by public authorities, as a
result of the taking of certain industries and services into public
ownership and also—up to 1951 but not since—of increases in employ¬
ment in national and local government service.
(7) A continuance, after 1911, of the decline in agricultural employment
which started in the second half of the nineteenth century. Recent
decreases are associated with rising productivity rather than declining
production.
(8) A very large increase (about 150 per cent since 1931) numbers
employed in the metals, engineering and vehicles group of industries
and the chemical group. Expansion has been most marked in those
sections of the industries which are concerned with relatively new or
technically advanced products.
(9) A decline in employment in certain large old-established industries,
notably coalmining, cotton textiles and shipbuilding.
A manpower research unit was set up in 1962, to study the future dis¬
tribution of manpower and the probable changes in occupational structure,
so as to provide a basis for implementing the Government’s proposals for
industrial training (see p. 478) and to supply information to the National
Economic Development Council (see p. 257).
Unemployment Since the war the general unemployment rate in Britain has been among the
lowest in the world—usually between 1 and 2 per cent. In June 1961 all the
major regions of England had unemployment rates of 2 per cent or under,
while the majority of development districts (see p. 263) in England had rates of
under 4 per cent. In Scotland the rate was higher—2-8 per cent. From the
middle of June 1961 the underlying trend of unemployment was steadily
upward and the numbers available for civil employment were increasing
rather rapidly. A post-war peak in the birth rate increased the number of
school-leavers and there was considerable immigration, so that between
June 1961 and August 1962 the population available for work rose by 400,000
while the number in the armed forces was reduced by 36,000. Thus, although
civil employment grew by 250,000 in this period, the number of unemployed
increased by about 190,000. After June 1962 the upward trend in production
flattened out, the number in civil employment fell, and unemployment
continued to rise. By mid-December the general unemployment rate in
Great Britain had reached 2-5 per cent and, in the coldest January and
February for over 100 years, it rose sharply, first to 3 • 6 per cent and then to
3*9 per cent, partly because of the weather. By mid-August it had fallen to
2 • 2 per cent. Unemployment rates in the development districts, however,
were still relatively high, in some cases over 10 per cent.
Unemployment was generally a more serious problem in those parts of the
country which have the greatest dependence on shipbuilding, coalmining,
LABOUR
451
Northern
Ireland
and certain branches of the heavy engineering and metal manufacturing
industries. In consequence unemployment in parts of Scotland and Wales,
and in north-east England and Merseyside was much higher than in the
Midlands and south-east England. (For the remedial action taken, see p. 264.)
The total working population of Northern Ireland—including employers and
self-employed, but excluding certain unpaid helpers—was about 540,000 in
June 1962 (365,000 males and 175,000 females). The largest productive
industries are agriculture and textiles. Most of the agricultural work in
Northern Ireland is done by small farmers and their families without hired
help. The total manpower in agriculture, forestry and fisheries was 73,000 in
mid-1962, according to the official estimates of the Ministry of Labour and
National Insurance of the Northern Ireland Government, and was con¬
siderably larger according to other estimates, which include unpaid helpers,
but the number of insured employees in these industries was only about
16,000. The textile industry employs about 56,000 people.
The unemployment rate in Northern Ireland has remained higher than in
England, Wales or Scotland. In July 1962 it was about 7-2 per cent of the
insured employees and during the last 10 years has rarely fallen below
6 per cent. The Ministry of Commerce of the Northern Ireland Government
has wide powers (similar to those of the Board of Trade in development
districts in Great Britain) to assist the development and diversification of
industry. It is using these powers vigorously in an attempt to improve the
situation.
GOVERNMENT EMPLOYMENT AND TRAINING SERVICES
The provision of employment services in Great Britain has been one of the
principal functions of the Ministry of Labour since its inception in 1916.
Northern Ireland has its own legislation in these matters which embodies the
main principles of the corresponding legislation in Great Britain, but owing
to the much smaller area of administration and the less favourable employment
situation, the facilities available are not so comprehensive in their scope as is
the case in Great Britain, and administrative arrangements are in some
respects on different lines. The responsible department is the Ministry of
Labour and National Insurance.
The following account, therefore, of services in Great Britain applies in
general to Northern Ireland except where otherwise stated. The scope of the
services in Great Britain has gradually been extended to include the provision
of advice on employment and, in suitable cases, of vocational training. The
Employment and Training Act, 1948, provided a permanent legislative basis
for these wider services. The main services are provided through the country¬
wide network of some 1,000 local offices, which act as employment exchanges.
Local employment committees, composed of representatives of employers,
workers and other local interests, are attached to certain employment exchanges
as advisory bodies to secure for the department the full benefit of local
knowledge and the close co-operation of employers and workers. There is an
additional service designed to meet the needs of men and women who are
qualified for professional, administrative, managerial, senior executive and
technical and scientific posts at home and overseas and for those likely to
qualify, i.e. ex-regular officers of the armed forces and young men and women
suitable for training. This service is operated in Great Britain through the
Professional and Executive Register, held at 38 of the larger exchanges.

BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
All the offices referred to above accept on their registers both employed and
unemployed persons seeking employment. Their primary function is to
introduce suitable persons seeking employment to employers requiring
employees, thus providing an efficient service to employers and job-seekers
and meeting the needs of the national economy.
The employment exchanges holding the Professional and Executive Register
are also ready to give information about the professions and allied occupations
to young men and women aged 18 years and over who have not already
established themselves in a profession or in the business world, and to older
people who wish to change their careers.
In certain densely populated areas where there are large groups of hospitals,
there are employment exchanges with officers specially trained to deal with
the employment problems of nurses, midwives and those in related occupations.
There are 27 of these offices. Outside the larger areas, nurses and their
employers are dealt with at the local employment exchange. Qualified nurses
are available to give advice and conduct interviews where necessary.
The Ministry of Labour’s Regular Forces Resettlement Service helps
Regular officers and other ranks returning to civilian life to find suitable
employment. Nearly all those leaving the Services are successful in securing
satisfactory resettlement. The Ministry arranges special six-week business
training courses for ex-Regulars (mainly ex-officers) at commercial and
technical colleges and four-week courses in industrial supervision are pro¬
vided at the Ministry of Labour, Ebury Bridge House, London. Training
for a civilian trade is also available under the Vocational Training Scheme
(see below).
In view of the increasing number of older persons in the population the
Ministry recognises the need to promote the employment of older men and
women and seeks to persuade employers to consider older workers on their
merits without regard to their age; employment exchanges have instructions
to make special efforts to find employment for older persons.
A special responsibility of the local employment offices is recruitment under
the vocational training scheme. In Britain the main responsibility for vocational
training for employment below professional level rests on the industries and
trades directly concerned. The main purpose of the Ministry’s scheme is to
assist certain classes of people in special need of help to fit themselves for
suitable employment, but the Ministry is also concerned in helping to over¬
come shortages of labour in key industries and for this purpose training is
available to a much wider range of workers. The majority of trainees under
the scheme are disabled persons but many are able-bodied men and women
seeking employment after voluntary service in the regular armed forces, or
other unemployed persons having special difficulty in resettlement (including
skilled workers whose prospects of employment in their existing trade are
poor)-
The training is normally provided at Government Training Centres which
are situated near the main industrial areas, but training under the scheme can
in some cases be arranged at technical and commercial colleges, private
training schools or employers’ establishments and, for the more severely
disabled, at four residential Training Centres run by voluntary societies.
Courses vary in length according to the trade; most last for six months.
Schemes of training for particular trades have been drawn up in consultation
with representatives of the employers and workers concerned, who in some
cases also assist in the selection of persons suitable for training. Allowances,

at a higher rate than for unemployment benefit, are paid to trainees during
training to maintain them and their dependants. About 4,800 people were
trained under the scheme in 1962, and about 87 per cent of them were
subsequently employed in the trade for which they had been trained.
As one measure designed to encourage industry to increase its intake of
apprentices during the years 1961 to 1963, when large numbers of children were
leaving school, facilities have been provided in Government Training Centres
for full-time training of apprentices in their first year. The object is a demon¬
stration, limited in numbers, to enable employers to see for themselves what
can be achieved by systematic methods of practical and theoretical instruction,
combined with day-release for further education at technical colleges. The
employers continue to pay the apprentices’ wages during the course and are
responsible for completion of the remaining years of apprenticeship. In
Northern Ireland the Ministry of Labour and National Insurance sponsors
the training of additional apprentices by employers in the engineering industry,
a condition being that the sponsored apprentices are available for recruitment
to new industries.
As part of its plan for increasing the productivity of British Industry, and in
accordance with the recommendations of the National Economic Development
Council, the Government has decided to foster expansion and improvement
of industrial training (see p. 478). The provision of training by the Government
is, accordingly, to be more than doubled through the setting up of 18 more
Government Training Centres.
The Ministry of Labour provides a service to industry through its scheme of
Training Within Industry for Supervisors. The four programmes of instruction
which comprise the TWI scheme are: job relations, the fostering of good
working relationships; job instruction, the technique of instructing or directing
staff; job methods, the steps taken in planning the best way of doing a job;
and job safety, which seeks to arouse safety consciousness and to train super¬
visors to detect dangers and deal with them.
The Ministry employs a small staff of TWI officers, who both train super¬
visors directly and also train firms’ representatives to enable them to present
TWI courses to supervisors in their own concerns. The Ministry is prepared
to extend a measure of these services to overseas branches of British firms.
It is prepared also to train suitable persons to develop the scheme in their
own territories. The arrangements may be made by the government of the
country concerned or (where appropriate) by the International Labour
Organisation (ILO).
In addition, the Ministry’s Technical Staff Colleges at Letchworth,
Hertfordshire, and Hillington, Glasgow, provide two-week courses in teaching
methods for instructors responsible for the training of apprentices and other
workers. These courses have been developed by the Ministry to meet its own
requirements for the training of instructors engaged in training adults in
skilled occupations at Government Training Centres, and the syllabus has
been made available to employers in the United Kingdom and in overseas
countries.
Vocational training services at Government Training Centres, TWI courses,
and courses at the Ministry’s Technical Staff Colleges at Letchworth and
Hillington are available to trainees from overseas under approved schemes
(for instance, those of the ILO or the Colombo Plan).

Citizens
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Foreigners are admitted to the United Kingdom to take up employment with
a particular employer, provided they are in possession of a permit issued to
the prospective employer by the Ministry of Labour (the Ministry of Labour
and National Insurance for Northern Ireland if the proposed employment is
in Northern Ireland). Over 50,000 such permits are issued each year. Of these,
nearly two-fifths are for domestic workers in hospitals, schools, other insti¬
tutions and private households, and nearly one-eighth for student employees.
Employment is limited to a maximum of one year in the first instance but may
be extended on application by the employer. In certain circumstances, per¬
mission may be given by the Home Office for foreigners who landed as
visitors or students to take employment approved by the Ministry of Labour.
Approval is subject to the same conditions and requirements as are applied
to the issue of permits to foreigners while still abroad.
Before a permit is issued, the Ministry of Labour must be satisfied that
there is a bona fide job, that no suitable British or foreign worker already
resident in Britain for a long period is available, and that the wages and con¬
ditions of employment are not less favourable than those enjoyed by British
workers. These conditions are waived for student employees who are admitted
for limited periods in order to improve their English and to gain a wider know¬
ledge of their occupations. A foreigner permitted to take employment in the
United Kingdom may not change his employment, unless his prospective em¬
ployer has obtained prior approval from the Ministry to employ the foreigner.
The permit system applies to individual foreigners, but the Ministry of
Labour has an arrangement for the admission on a ‘group’ basis of selected
Italian workers for employment in certain undermanned industries.
The United Kingdom, as a member of the Western European Union,
participates in the arrangements for assisting nationals of the countries con¬
cerned to obtain employment in other member countries.
These controls over entry and employment used to apply only to citizens of
foreign countries. Until 1st July, 1962, all citizens of the Commonwealth
had the right of free entry to the United Kingdom. Since that date, however,
Commonwealth citizens from overseas have been subject to control under the
Commonwealth Immigrants Act, 1962. Except for those who were born in
the United Kingdom or hold passports issued by the United Kingdom
Government, the control applies, broadly, to all Commonwealth citizens.
Such people, if they wish to come to Britain for full-time employment, are
now required on their arrival to be in possession of an employment voucher
issued by the Ministry of Labour. Vouchers are issued without restriction
to those who have obtained jobs with named employers, and to those who have
some special qualification or skill of particular value. Subject to a numerical
limit laid down from time to time by the Government, vouchers are also
issued, on the basis of ‘first come, first served’, to other Commonwealth
citizens who wish to come to Britain to seek employment. (Commonwealth
citizens who wish to work in Northern Ireland, and who are not ‘Northern
Ireland workers’,1 need special Northern Ireland employment permits, which
are issued only in respect of definite jobs.)
The Commonwealth Immigrants Act applies also to citizens of the Irish
Republic; but no control is imposed on persons travelling between Ireland
and Britain.

British nationality by virtue only of their citizenship of the Republic of
South Africa ceased to be British subjects and became aliens on 31st May, 1962.
From that date, therefore, any South African entering the United Kingdom
for the first time for employment must be in possession of a permit issued to
the prospective employer.
The Ministry of Labour is also responsible in Great Britain for two specialised
employment services: the Youth Employment Service and the Disablement
Resettlement Service.
The purpose of the Youth Employment Service is to help young people
leaving school and young workers under 18 years of age at the start of their
working life.
The service is under the general direction of the Central Youth Employment
Executive, staffed by officers of the Ministry of Labour, the Ministry of
Education and the Scottish Education Department. This joint executive is
appointed by the Minister of Labour, who is responsible to Parliament for
the Youth Employment Service as a whole. The Minister has appointed a
National Youth Employment Council and separate advisory committees for
Scotland and for Wales to advise him.
Locally the service is operated in most areas through Youth Employment
Offices established by local education authorities (in Scotland by education
authorities) in accordance with the schemes submitted by them to the Minister
of Labour and approved by him. In those areas where such schemes are not
in operation, the service is operated by the local office of the Ministry of
Labour.
The main functions of the service are to collect and disseminate information
on careers, provide talks in schools, give vocational guidance, find suitable
employment and keep contact with young workers to help them settle down.
A further function is to help employers to fill vacancies for young people. Local
Youth Employment Committees, made up of teachers, employers, workers
and other appropriate interests, assist the service in an advisory capacity.
In Northern Ireland the functions of the youth employment service are
similar to those in Great Britain but its organisation is different. A new
unified service, for which the Minister of Labour and National Insurance
will be responsible, started with the establishment in December 1961 of a
statutory board composed of representatives appointed by the education
committees of the counties and county boroughs, and persons appointed by
the Minister to represent the governors of voluntary grammar schools,
teachers, employers, workers, the universities and colleges, youth organisations
and the Churches’ Industrial Council. There will also be local youth employ¬
ment committees, as in Great Britain. This service will gradually replace that
now operated by the Ministry of Labour and National Insurance with the
co-operation of the Vocational Guidance Service of one of the education
committees.
The purpose of the Disabled Persons (Employment) Acts, 1944 and 1958, on
which all the work of the Ministry of Labour for disabled persons is based,
is ‘to make further and better provision for enabling persons handicapped
by disablement to secure employment or work on their own account’, and the
Disablement Resettlement Service is designed to help disabled persons to get
and keep suitable work. The service is available to all persons over school¬
leaving age who are substantially handicapped as a result of injury, disease
or congenital deformity in obtaining or keeping employment.

The Ministry of Labour is responsible for the administration of the service.
At each of its local offices there is a disablement resettlement officer, working
under the direction of the manager and in co-operation with other officers.
Besides his contacts with employers, this officer is in touch with all the hospitals
in his area and visits any patient who wishes to discuss the question of future
employment. His work involves close co-operation with doctors, local authori¬
ties and voluntary welfare agencies.
The help given by the service falls under five main headings:
Vocational guidance is given at local offices by disablement resettlement
officers in consultation, as necessary, with the local disablement advisory
committees, hospital resettlement clinics and medical interviewing com¬
mittees, and also by vocational psychologists in the industrial rehabilitation
units (see below).
Having regard to a disabled person’s qualifications and aptitude and to medical
guidance, and concentrating on what the person can do rather than on what
he cannot do, the disablement resettlement officer endeavours to find the
work most suited to each person, either immediately, or in appropriate cases
after a course of industrial rehabilitation or vocational training. To some
extent this is facilitated by the main provision of the Disabled Persons
(Employment) Act, 1944, namely, that all employers of 20 or more persons
are required to employ a quota (at present 3 per cent for all industries, except
shipping, in respect of the manning of ships) of registered disabled persons.
Registration is voluntary. The number of disabled persons registered on
16th April, 1963, was 653,362. At the same date 62,415 registered disabled
were unemployed, 56,525 being considered capable of ordinary employment.
The remaining 5,890 were so severely disabled as to be classed as unlikely to
obtain ordinary employment, though in fact many so classed are found work
in open industry by careful selective placement.
Industrial rehabilitation1 is provided at seventeen units run by the Ministry
of Labour. These units offer to men and women an opportunity, when their
medical treatment is completed, to adjust themselves gradually to normal
working conditions and to obtain vocational guidance based on a skilled
assessment of their aptitudes. No charge is made for attendance and main¬
tenance allowances are paid. Courses are individually planned and average
about eight weeks. Recommendations for courses are made in the first instance
to the disablement resettlement officer at the employment exchange, who
has responsibility for placing in employment after the course.
For the blind, similar industrial rehabilitation facilities are available at two
centres conducted by voluntary organisations, with the financial assistance
of the Ministry of Labour.
There are vocational training facilities for the disabled at Government Training
Centres, educational institutions and employers’ establishments. For the more
seriously disabled there are special residential training colleges run by voluntary
organisations with the financial assistance and technical help of the Ministry
of Labour. There are also arrangements for the training of special categories
of disabled persons such as the blind, and for providing disabled persons
(including the blind), who are of the appropriate educational standard, with
grants to undertake study or training for the purpose of qualifying for pro¬
fessional or comparable employment.

Sheltered
Employment
Remploy Ltd., a non-profit-making public company with no share capital, was
set up in accordance with the provisions of the Disabled Persons (Employment)
Act, 1944. Its objects are to provide training and employment facilities for
registered disabled persons unlikely to obtain work except under special
conditions. Its powers include the provision of special factories and workshops,
hostel accommodation and facilities for homeworkers. The directors are
appointed by the Minister of Labour; funds for capital development and to
meet operational costs are provided by loans and grants under the Ministry
of Labour Vote. At the end of 1962 Remploy Ltd. operated 89 factories and
employed 6,394 severely disabled men and women, including some 140
homeworkers.
Facilities for the employment of both blind and severely disabled sighted
people are provided by local authorities and by voluntary organisations, with
the financial assistance of the Ministry of Labour. At the end of December
1962, 67 workshops for the blind accommodated 235 blind people in training
and 3,692 in employment. In addition, some 1,100 blind people were working
at home under homeworkers’ schemes. The Ministry also helped to finance
the training and employment of 1,195 severely disabled sighted people in
47 workshops provided by local authorities or voluntary undertakings, and
210 such people in workshops for the blind.
TERMS OF EMPLOYMENT,
CONDITIONS OF WORK AND LABOUR RELATIONS
At the beginning of the nineteenth century, industrial workers lacked legi¬
timate means of defending their standards of living or of ameliorating their
working conditions. The traditional methods of fixing wages had become
obsolete, trade unions were regarded as criminal conspiracies, and there was
no protective legislation setting minimum standards of safety, health and
welfare in places of work.
The first attempt at protective legislation was the Health and Morals of
Apprentices Act, 1802, but the first effective Factory Act was that of 1833,
which created an inspectorate employed and paid by the central Government
to enforce its provisions. Since that date, legislation extending, strengthening,
adapting and consolidating the statutory protection for employees has been
passed at an accelerating rate. The progress in standards has owed much to
the recommendations of strengthened inspectorates, much to the example of
progressive employers and much to the persistent pressure of trade unions
and disinterested reformers.
Trade unions ceased to be actionable conspiracies in 1824 but their status as
legal entities was not properly established until 1871. This latter step had
been made acceptable to public opinion by the leaders of certain craft unions,
who had abandoned the revolutionary and financially unsound policies of
earlier trade unions to pursue the limited practical objectives of securing for
their members better wages and improved working conditions.
After 1880 the organisation of unskilled workers became more extensive
and effective and the whole tone of trade unionism became more militant and
political, while employers began to form associations in an increasing number
of industries. Partly as a result of continuing antagonisms and of the changing
and difficult economic situation, much of the first thirty years of the twentieth
century was marked by widespread and prolonged strikes. Since 1932, how¬
ever, the strike rate (in terms of man-days lost) has, in most years, been very
much lower, and arrangements for the negotiation of terms of service and the
458
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
peaceful settlement of disputes have become general and are on the whole
satisfactory.
This improvement in industrial relations has been achieved mainly by
voluntary action. There is, in general, no legal obligation on an employer to
recognise a trade union, or not to refuse to employ trade unionists; nor is a
collective agreement with a trade union held to be in itself a legal contract of
employment, though the terms of a collective agreement may be expressly or
by implication incorporated in an individual contract of employment. The
Terms and Conditions of Employment Act, 1959, does, however, provide
machinery for enforcing on an employer the observance of terms or conditions
established by collective agreement in his industry (see p. 474).
Nevertheless, in the majority of trades and industries minimum or standard
wages, normal working hours and other terms of employment are effectively
settled by collective agreements, whose negotiation and observance continue
to depend primarily on the strength, integrity and representative character
of the signatory organisations rather than on any legal sanction. The deter¬
mination by statute of minimum wages, holidays and holiday pay is in
principle confined to those trades and industries where the organisation of
employers or workers, or both, is inadequate to negotiate collective agree¬
ments and to ensure their observance.
On the other hand, the conditions of work of employees—their safety,
health and welfare—depend to a far greater extent on minimum standards
established by statute and enforced by official inspectorates. Voluntary action
is, however, of the greatest importance even in these matters. In some cases,
additional health, safety or welfare requirements are the subject of collective
agreements, while many employers provide higher standards on their own
initiative with help and advice from Government departments and various
voluntary bodies.
Management-employee relations depend not only on terms and conditions
of employment, but on human relationships at the place of work; managements
have in recent years become increasingly concerned with improving such
relationships.
PAY, HOURS Minimum or standard time rates for most British manual workers, as deter-
AND HOLIDAYS mined by agreements or by statutory orders, vary between 3s. nd. and
Earnings 4s. nd. an hour for men and between 2s. 8d. and 3s. 8d. for women. Actual
earnings are usually higher. Higher rates are sometimes paid, and piece rates,
shift rates and overtime rates raise the level of average earnings. The Ministry
of Labour conducts a six-monthly survey of earnings and hours of work of
manual workers in manufacturing industries and in some of the principal
non-manufacturing industries in Great Britain. Table 41 is based on these
surveys.
The survey does not cover agriculture, coalmining, railways, dock work,
shipping, distribution, catering or other services but average weekly earnings
are separately compiled for the first four of these industries; they are some¬
what above the average in coalmining and dock work, and below the average
in railway work and agriculture.
Since 1950 average weekly wage rates have increased by about 109 per cent
and average weekly earnings by about 117 per cent. Most of the increase
in wage rates has been offset by a rise in the cost of living. The trends of
manual workers’ earnings, and of wage rates and retail prices from 1951 to
1962 are shown in the diagram on p. 460.

Women in industry are for the most part engaged on different tasks from
men and are paid less than men on the grounds that these tasks are unskilled
or semi-skilled. In the relatively few instances in the field of manual employ¬
ment where men and women are employed on precisely the same work and
under identical conditions, collective agreements frequently provide for
equal remuneration.
Information about the spread of earnings of manual workers, i.e. the propor¬
tion of manual workers with weekly earnings within certain ranges, has
become available for the first time since 1938 as the result of a special inquiry
made by the Ministry of Labour as part of its survey of earnings in the
second pay-week of October i960.
This survey covered establishments not only in manufacturing but also in
mining (other than coalmining), construction, gas, electricity and water
supply, transport other than rail transport, public administration, laundries
and cleaners, garages and shoe repairers. It is estimated that returns received
relate to about four-fifths of the full-time adult manual workers in manu¬
facturing and probably to about two-thirds in the other industries surveyed.
Corresponding figures for coalminers, dock and agricultural workers have
been compiled by the National Coal Board, the National Dock Labour
Board and the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food.
In all the industries surveyed by the Ministry of Labour, 3-6 per cent of
the men earned less than £9 and 42 per cent earned £15 or over; in manu¬
facturing industries alone, 3-1 per cent earned less than ^9, and 48 per cent
^15 or over; in the non-manufacturing industries covered, 4-8 per cent
earned less than £9 and 28 per cent £15 or more. In coalmining no full¬
time workers underground earned less than £10 and no surface workers less
than £9. Nearly two-thirds of the underground workers earned £15 or more,
but only just over a quarter of the surface workers earned ^15 or more, while
about the same proportion earned less than £10. A few dock workers (2-3
per cent) earned less than £9, while 65-5 per cent earned £15 or more and
19-5 per cent earned £23 or more.
It must be stressed, however, that in all these cases the distribution of
earnings is that for a single week. Particularly in dock work, but also in
coalmining and in a number of manufacturing occupations, there are sharp
variations in piecework earnings from week to week, so that it is probable
460
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
A=April 0=October
that relatively few manual workers maintain over a long period the high level
of earnings which a substantial proportion attains each week.
Information about the rates of pay and earnings of non-manual workers
is less detailed and comprehensive, as the pay of such workers is often based
on individual contracts, except in the public service, teaching and retail
distribution. Evidence suggests, however, that clerks and shop assistants, who
form the majority of non-manual workers, have average earnings little
different in range from those of manual workers. The Ministry of Labour
has since 1959 collected information each October on salary earnings in
productive industry; and on the basis of the survey for 1962, which with the
help of the Ministry of Commerce of the Northern Ireland Government
covered 84 per cent of the salary earners in productive industry in the United
Kingdom, the average weekly salary earnings of weekly paid workers (largely
clerical and analogous) were £16 2S. 4d. for men and £8 3s. 9d. for women,
LABOUR
Professional and
Technical

while the average monthly earnings of monthly paid workers were fno ys. 2d.
for men and £48 4s. 5d. for women. The pay of shop assistants is on scales
prescribing weekly minima of from about £7 17s. 6d. to 14s. 6d. for men
and £5 12s. 6d. to £7 16s. for women.
The starting salaries in many professional and technical careers are often in
the range of £600 to £800 a year, though they may be lower for trainees
starting work in their teens, and higher for some graduates entering industry
and the Civil Service. Such posts offer incremental progression to higher
salaries and opportunities for promotion.
Most of the senior posts in business, the professions and the Civil Service
are in the range of £2,750 to £7,000 a year. The posts with salaries of £5,000
to £12,000 a year include those of Cabinet Ministers, most chairmen and
full-time members of boards of nationalised industries, judges of the High
Court and Court of Appeal, and Lords of Appeal, the Permanent Secretaries
of Government departments, the clerks of the largest municipal authorities,
editors of daily newspapers, some persons outstanding in their professions
and in the higher managerial posts in industry, commerce and banking. A
few persons in business draw still higher salaries, while the earnings of star
entertainers and certain other very successful people exceed £25,000 a year.
Statistics published by the Inland Revenue Department indicate that in
1960-61 some 13-7 per cent of male wage and salary earners earned £1,000
a year or more, 3-7 per cent £1,500 a year or more, i-8 per cent £2,000 a year
or more and 0-7 per cent £3,000 a year or more. For women in the same
wage or salary ranges, the corresponding percentages were 2, 0-4, o-i and 0-03.
Women have the same right of entry as men to nearly all public offices,
administrative posts and professions. They are paid the same salary for
doing the same work in medicine, dentistry, physiotherapy, radiography,
university teaching, journalism, broadcasting and architecture, and as
Ministers of the Crown, members of Parliament, salaried magistrates and
solicitors, pharmacists working in hospitals, and administrative, professional
and technical workers in local government. Women in independent pro¬
fessions are not expected to charge lower fees than men. In many other
non-manual occupations, however, a woman in Britain doing the same job
as a man is still paid less for doing it, and the position is changing very slowly,
except in the public service.
National legislation in the United Kingdom embodies a general prohibition
of employment of children under thirteen years of age; forbids the employ¬
ment of older children and women in certain occupations; and limits and
defines permissible hours of work for women and young persons in a number
of industries or trades. Children aged thirteen to fifteen may not be employed
during school hours or before 6 a.m. or after 8 p.m. on any day, or for more
than two hours on school days or on Sundays. This part-time employment
is regulated in various ways by statute and by by-laws made by local authorities.
The Shops Act, 1950, makes local authorities responsible for ensuring that
the shops in their area observe its requirements. With certain exceptions,
shops must be closed on weekdays by 8 p.m. (9 p.m. on one late day) except
on the early closing day when they must be closed by 1 p.m., and all day
on Sunday; but local authorities may make orders modifying these and other
provisions of the Act within their own area. The hours of work of shop
employees under sixteen years of age are normally restricted to 44 a week,
and those of employees between sixteen and eighteen years of age to 48 a

week, with limited provision for overtime. Broadly speaking, all shop assistants
must be given a half-holiday (half a day) every week and, in addition, every
Sunday off or another day off instead.
In premises under the Factories Act the working hours of women and
young persons between the ages of sixteen and eighteen are generally limited
to 48 a week and nine a day, although some overtime is allowed (up to six
hours a week but not more than 100 hours a year or in more than 25 weeks
in a year). Young persons under sixteen years of age are limited to 44 hours
a week. Adequate intervals for meals must be arranged for women and young
persons and the employment of women and young girls at night is, in general,
prohibited.
In mines and quarries, women and young persons under eighteen may not
normally start work before 6 a.m. and must never start before 5 a.m. Their
work must normally end before 9 p.m., in the case of young persons under
sixteen, and before 10 p.m., in the case of women and young persons aged
sixteen to eighteen; and never in any case after 11 p.m.
The Young Persons (Employment) Act, 1938, imposes restrictions on the
hours of work of young persons (48 a week at the age of sixteen years and over
and 44 for those under sixteen years) in certain occupations not covered
by the Factories Act, the Mines and Quarries Act, 1954, or the Shops
Act, 1950.
While the hours of work of adult men are not, in general, restricted by
statute, normal hours of work for both sexes and those of all ages are usually
well within the legal limits on the hours of women and young persons. Agreed
weekly hours, in which substantial reductions have been negotiated in many
cases within the past three years, are mainly 42 to 44, and may be worked as
either a five-day or a five-and-a-half-day week according to the industry and
the rule of the particular establishment. Hours actually worked by men are
somewhat longer owing to overtime working.
In April 1963 the number of hours actually worked by manual workers
averaged 46-9 for men and 39*5 for women on full-time work.
With a few exceptions, manual workers (including shop assistants) in indus¬
tries covered by agreements or statutory orders are entitled to paid holidays
of twelve days or two weeks. Moreover, payment is made for bank or
statutory public holidays, which are as follows: in addition to Good Friday
and Christmas Day, there are Bank Holidays in most parts of England, Wales
and the Channel Islands on Easter Monday, Whit-Monday, the first Monday
in August and the first weekday after Christmas (Boxing Day), and in Scotland
on New Year’s Day, the first Monday in May, and the first Monday in
August. Northern Ireland observes all the English holidays and, in addition,
has a holiday on St. Patrick’s Day, 17th March, and on 12th July (com¬
memorating the Battle of the Boyne, 1690); Easter Tuesday is also a customary
holiday for industry and trade. Many agreements provide that payments
should also be made for specially proclaimed holidays.
In some industries there are also agreements on extended holidays related
to length of service. In addition, numerous firms have long-service extended
holiday schemes which apply to both staff and manual workers.
Employers have a duty at common law to take reasonable care of their
employees and provide a safe system of working, while employees have a
duty of care towards each other. In addition, minimum required standards
of safety in certain kinds of workplaces or work are laid down under a number

of statutes, some of which also deal with health and welfare. The statutes
include: the Mines and Quarries Act, 1954, the Agriculture (Safety, Health
and Welfare Provisions) Act, 1956, the Factories Act, 1961 (which consolidates
earlier Acts), and the Offices, Shops and Railway Premises Act, 1963, which
closely follows the Factories Act, 1961. Fatal and serious industrial accidents
have tended to diminish during the twentieth century and the British rates
for fatal and serious accidents are among the lowest in the world. There were
disturbing increases during 1959 and i960 but the upward trend in accidents
in industrial premises was checked during 1961 and in 1962 the total was
slightly below the high figure for i960.
Over 200,000 industrial premises (factories, workshops, slaughterhouses,
shipyards and docks) and about 25,000 building and civil engineering sites
come under the Factories Act, which is administered by the Ministry of
Labour and enforced by H.M. Inspectorate of Factories, which forms part
of the Ministry. The total strength of the Factory Inspectorate, including
medical and other specialists, was 447 in 1962, its authorised strength being
477. Over a million premises come under the Offices, Shops and Railway
Premises Act, which is also administered by the Ministry of Labour; enforce¬
ment is shared by H.M. Inspectorate of Factories and local authorities.
Under these Acts any person intending to use industrial premises has to
notify the enforcing authority of his intention before he begins to occupy
them and every fatal accident and every accident causing more than three
days’ incapacity must be reported; under the Factories Act, provision is also
made for compulsory notification and for investigation of certain dangerous
occurrences.
In addition, a number of general and specific safety requirements are laid
down. The general requirements include provisions concerning the fencing
of prime movers, transmission machinery and dangerous parts of other
machinery; the sale, hire or use of power-driven machinery without effective
guards of certain parts; the cleaning of machinery in motion; the training
and supervision of young persons employed at certain machines; the examina¬
tion of hoists and lifting equipment, steam boilers and steam and air receivers;
the construction of floors; precautions against falls, against gassing, and
against explosions of flammable dust or gas; fire prevention, fire-fighting,
fire alarms and means of escape in case of fire; the protection of the eyes;
precautions where dangerous substances are present; and the lifting of heavy
weights. These general requirements are supplemented or modified by
regulations providing for safeguards against special risks in particular industries,
processes, and types of machinery.
Safety depends, in fact, at least as much on the education and voluntary
efforts of the employers and of the workers as upon safety regulations. In
addition to regulatory functions, the Ministry of Labour since 1959 has had
the duty of promoting safety, health and welfare by the collection and
dissemination of information and by investigating safety, health and welfare
problems—activities which had, in fact, long been an important part of the
Ministry’s work. The Accident Prevention Movement, a voluntary educational
campaign, is strongly supported by the Factory Inspectorate. Inspectors
inquire into safety aspects of machine design and specification, circulate
expert advice by personal exhortation, lectures and literature, and encourage
the appointment of safety officers and the formation of works safety com¬
mittees. The Factory Inspectorate maintains an industrial health and safety
centre in London, at which various types of machinery demonstrating the

effectiveness of guards are displayed, as well as a wide range of protective
clothing and equipment.
The concern of both trade unions and employers’ associations with safety
helps to maintain safety standards; and the requirements about accident
notification help inspectors to examine the means of prevention with employers,
machinery manufacturers and interested organisations. But the voluntary co¬
operation of managements and employees in individual workplaces is essential
to the safety drive. Many firms have works safety committees and, in many
areas, safety groups have been organised, whose members meet monthly for
the exchange of information, discussions, lectures and films on safety measures.
Training for safety is an important facet of the safety drive and, to help in
this work, the Ministry of Labour has incorporated a safety course in the
Training Within Industry for Supervisors (TWI) scheme (see p. 453)*
industrial safety training centre in Birmingham is run by the Birmingham
and District Industrial Safety Group, and there are safety training centres
for the construction industries which have been set up, with the assistance
of the Ministry of Labour, by local accident prevention groups at Enfield
(London), Aintree (Liverpool), Granton (Edinburgh), Norwich and Leeds
and by the Federation of Civil Engineering Contractors at Cardiff. The
Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents helps the accident prevention
movement by providing publicity and organising conferences and courses
for safety officers; it has recently organised a course for the training of
safety instructors.
Organisations in industry are now concerning themselves to an increasing
extent with the promotion of safety at work and the provision of information
and advisory services to their members. They participate also in joint standing
and advisory committees appointed by the Minister of Labour. Representatives
of the Trades Union Congress, the British Employers’ Confederation, the
nationalised industries and the Ministry of Labour meet on the Industrial
Safety Sub-committee of the National Joint Advisory Council. The Minister
of Labour has also established a joint advisory committee, representative of
employers and workers in the building and civil engineering industries, to
examine safety and health problems in these industries.
The safety of workers in mines and quarries is the subject of comprehensive
legislation which also deals with health and welfare at work and a number of
related matters. Protective legislation in mines began with an Act of 1842,
which forbade the employment of women underground; successive measures
laid down detailed requirements for the safe conduct of operations and dealt
with such matters as ventilation, dust suppression, support of workings, the
safe use of electricity, rescue and first aid. The latest stage was reached when
the Mines and Quarries Act was passed in I954- This Act established the
basic modern principles of safety, health and welfare, leaving the details to
be dealt with in statutory regulations; it both consolidates the previous law
and brings it up to date. Apart from technical matters, it also covers such
subjects as the general responsibilities of owners and managements, the
appointment and duties of officials, training, welfare, the powers of official
inspectors, statutory qualifications of managers and under-managers, employ¬
ment of women and young persons, and inspections on behalf of workmen.
The Ministry of Power is responsible for the administration of these
enactments, while the Mines and Quarries Inspectorate, which is part of the
Ministry of Power, is responsible for their enforcement.

The National Coal Board is expressly charged with the statutory duty of
securing the safety, health and welfare of its employees and has set itself to
accomplish this in all practicable ways. The Board has its own safety organisa¬
tion—a Standing Committee on Safety, a chief safety engineer, and safety
engineers at divisions, areas and the largest collieries. It conducts courses of
safety training for workmen and officials and is constantly on the alert for
new methods of reducing risks. Its research programme includes a number of
projects with a direct bearing on safety. Examples of voluntary action by the
Board to reduce risks include the use of fire-resistant conveyor belting, and
the withdrawal of light alloy equipment from the coal face pending the
development of an alloy unlikely to cause dangerous sparks.
The Ministry of Power maintains a Safety in Mines Research Establish¬
ment, with stations at Buxton and Sheffield, which carry out research into
safety problems in co-operation with the Mines and Quarries Inspectorate
and the National Coal Board’s research organisation.
Two Acts provide for the protection of agricultural workers by means of
regulations made by the Ministers concerned with agriculture in Britain.
The risks involved in the use of chemicals are dealt with in the Agriculture
(Poisonous Substances) Act, 1952; other risks are covered by the Agriculture
(Safety, Health and Welfare Provisions) Act, 1956. Regulations have been
made dealing with the safe use of dangerous chemicals, the provision of
first-aid equipment, safety standards for workplaces and ladders, the safe¬
guarding and safe operation of farm machinery, the lifting of heavy weights
and the avoidance of accidents to children arising out of the use of farm
vehicles and machines. Regulations are enforced by inspectors of the
Agricultural Departments. To safeguard the many interests which
might be adversely affected by the use of chemicals in agriculture and
food storage, a voluntary scheme is operated by the Government with the
help of an advisory committee and with the full co-operation of the chemical
industry.
The general safety legislation covering the main forms of transport protects
transport workers as well as members of the public against accidents involving
moving vehicles.
The Minister of Transport is responsible for the administration of the
Merchant Shipping Acts, which cover in great detail the question of marine
safety, including navigational procedures, the strength and design of hulls,
the safety of machinery, the safety and design of living quarters, life-saving
appliances, measures for protection against fire, and the carriage of special
cargoes and dangerous goods.
The Air Navigation Order and Regulations provide for the registration of
aircraft and for the issue of certificates of airworthiness and of competency
certificates and licences for aircrew, lay down requirements for safety equip¬
ment and for safety procedures during take-off, flight and landing, and
prescribe maintenance schedules for public transport aircraft. The Minister
of Aviation delegates most of his powers in respect of airworthiness to the
Air Registration Board (see p. 387).
The Ministry of Transport exercises technical supervision of the safety
aspects of railway construction and operation through an inspectorate, whose
main functions are statutory approval of new works on railways carrying
passenger traffic; accident investigation, including the holding of formal
inquiries; and technical advice to the Minister.

In the interests of road safety, the hours of driving and the rest periods of
drivers of buses and goods vehicles are regulated by the Road Traffic Acts.
In certain cases, the driver must be accompanied by a second person.
In addition to general safety legislation, there are certain statutory pro¬
visions concerned entirely, or mainly, with the safety of employees; for
example, railway employees are protected by the Railway Employment
(Prevention of Accidents) Act, 1900, and the statutory rules and orders made
under it which enable the Ministry of Transport to require the use of safe
plant and appliances, to forbid what is unsafe, and to make rules for safe rail¬
way operation. This Act also sanctioned the employment of inspectors, now
known as Railway Employment Inspectors, who inquire into the more serious
accidents to railway employees.
Both transport operators and the Ministries of Transport and of Aviation
give high priority to safety measures affecting crews and passengers. Every
endeavour is made to counter the higher risks resulting from rising traffic
densities, by improving the design of vehicles, transport plant and equipment,
by traffic regulation and control of standards of maintenance and by training
crews in competency and safety awareness. The detailed regulations and
instructions issued by the ministries and their agents form the basis of
elaborate safety procedures laid down by the operators themselves and by the
makers of vehicles and aircraft, equipment and works. The radio industry
and the transport services co-operate in the development and application of
radar systems and other safety devices (see p. 388).
There are at present no specific statutory safety requirements in hotels and
restaurants, places of entertainment or educational establishments, apart from
the fire regulations applicable under local authority by-laws to all large
buildings. The Ministry of Labour has no statutory responsibility in regard
to safety in workshops or laboratories in educational establishments, though
it maintains liaison with university authorities and the education departments.
Employers, however, are bound by their common law obligation to provide
a safe system of work, and employers and educational authorities may
voluntarily seek the advice and help of the Factory Inspectorate, which is
given freely on request.
Local authorities, under the Public Health Acts, have power to regulate the
provision of suitable sanitary accommodation in houses and at places of work
and to treat workplaces which are dirty or badly ventilated or overcrowded
as nuisances the abatement of which can be enforced. They are also responsible
under the Shops Act, 1950, for seeing that shops in their area observe the
requirements of the Act, which include a number of provisions relating to
closing hours and to hours of work of young employees (see p. 461).
Factories, other industrial premises, offices, shops and railway premises must
comply with the health and welfare requirements of the Factories Act or the
Offices, Shops and Railway Premises Act. These include: with regard to
health, the cleanliness of workrooms, adequate ventilation and suitable
temperature and lighting, the avoidance of overcrowding and the provision
of sanitary accommodation, and the protection of workers against inhaling
harmful dust or fumes; with regard to welfare, the provision of washing
facilities, lockers or other accommodation for outdoor clothing, drinking
water, first aid, and adequate seating arrangements. On entry into employment
in factories and docks, or on building operations all young persons under
eighteen years of age must be medically examined by doctors appointed by

the Chief Inspector of Factories and known as Appointed Factory Doctors,
and they must be re-examined annually until they reach the age of eighteen.
Boys employed in certain jobs involving night work are examined more
frequently.
The general requirements of the Factories Act in regard to health and
welfare are supplemented by regulations, some of general application, others
providing for the needs of particular industries or processes. They may
include provision for compulsory periodic medical examinations. The
Offices, Shops and Railway Premises Act is similarly supplemented by
regulations.
The far-reaching and detailed requirements of the Merchant Shipping Acts
and the regulations made thereunder include specific provisions for the
protection of merchant seamen, covering such matters as the engagement
and discharge of seamen, limitations on the employment of young persons at
sea, standards of crew accommodation, scales of provisions, medicines and
medical stores, and the care and repatriation of seamen left behind at ports
abroad.
The laws restricting the employment of children, young persons and women
form an important part of legislation to protect the health and welfare of
employees. National legislation, besides forbidding any employment of
children under thirteen years of age, forbids the employment of children
under fifteen years of age in any industrial undertaking; of women and young
persons underground in mines and in certain other dangerous occupations
(for example, those involving work with lead compounds); and of women in
factories and workshops within one month of childbirth. It also limits and
defines the permissible hours for children aged thirteen to fifteen and for
young persons under eighteen and women in a number of industries and
occupations. Local authorities, moreover, have wide powers under the
Children and Young Persons Act, 1933, as well as by the Education
Acts, 1944-48, which regulate hours and conditions of employment of
children under fifteen years within their areas within the limits of national
legislation.
The above are the main legislative provisions relating to health and welfare
at work, but it is essential to note that employers frequently achieve health
and welfare standards considerably higher than those prescribed by law.
They are helped to do this by the inspectorates, by Government departments
and agencies, by employers’ associations and trade unions and by expert
voluntary bodies.
In addition to the statutory requirements of the Factories Act, 1961, and
the Offices, Shops and Railway Premises Act, 1963, and regulations under
both Acts a number of employers voluntarily maintain medical services for
their employees. In premises under the Factories Act it is estimated that
there are about 400 full-time and 4,000 part-time doctors employed, together
with several thousand nurses and assistant nurses. There are also the 2,800
Appointed Factory Doctors who carry out the compulsory medical examina¬
tions under the Acts and Regulations.
The big employers, including the State and the boards of nationalised
industries, have naturally taken the lead in this expansion. A number of
smaller factories also provide medical services and in some cases (for instance,
in Slough and Harlow) have joined together in group medical schemes.
There are, however, difficult problems to be solved in connection with the
468

Canteens
further development of industrial health services, and in 1955 the Minister
of Labour appointed a Standing Industrial Health Advisory Committee, of
which he is the chairman, to advise him on this subject. The membership
of this committee includes persons nominated by the British Employers'
Confederation, the Trades Union Congress, the nationalised industries, the
British Medical Association, the Royal College of Nursing and other organisa¬
tions and bodies closely concerned with the promotion of industrial health.
The committee has advised on the conduct of two pilot surveys of medical
supervision in factories, one in Halifax and one of the pottery industry in
Stoke-on-Trent, and has approved the issue of two booklets. One, Health at
Work, describes the medical service in fourteen factories in different parts of
Great Britain, whilst the other, Organisation of Industrial Health Services, is
intended to provide guidance to occupiers considering the establishment of
an industrial health service.
Industrial hygiene services can give valuable assistance in securing healthy
working conditions in industry; there are at present three centres in Great
Britain which undertake studies of factory conditions. They are staffed and
equipped to make comprehensive investigations of particular problems or
health risks and also carry out routine physical, chemical and biological tests
for industry.
Prompt and effective action in industrial health depends, among other
things, on adequate and properly co-ordinated arrangements for investigation
and research. Field investigations are carried out by the Factory Inspectorate,
which has specialised medical and technical branches. Research facilities are
provided by Government agencies such as the Medical Research Council and
the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research; by the faculties of
industrial health and social medicine of the universities; and by the research
departments of various industries and large industrial concerns.
Welfare standards vary considerably from one firm to another. The amenities
provided by large factories or offices depend partly on the employees’ needs
and desires. The requirements of a factory, or office or shop where the work
is light, and where many employees are women or young persons, are different
from those of an iron foundry or steelworks, where much of the work is
arduous and is undertaken by men. Progressive firms are careful to find out
what their employees want, and welfare policy is often decided in consultation
with the workers, through regular consultative machinery or by other means.
An increasing number of firms in Britain pay part or all of the cost of clubs
and sports grounds, operate retirement and sickness insurance schemes
supplementing the State schemes, and afford training and educational
facilities. Some have their own rehabilitation centres or support convalescent
homes.
The provision of low-priced meals at the place of employment has become
usual in large undertakings and quite common in smaller ones. There are
also colliery canteens providing meals for about 98 per cent of coalminers.
It is customary for any surplus earned by canteens to be used to improve
the canteen or to finance some other welfare services, while any losses are
usually borne by the firm. Many offices and shops which are unable to
provide canteen facilities for their staff have adopted luncheon voucher
schemes. There are now over 13,000 firms using this service and more than
70 million vouchers are issued annually and are accepted by all principal
catering establishments.

LABOUR 469
The safety, health and welfare of employees in Northern Ireland have been
the subject of legislation which, with certain exceptions, is similar to that in
Great Britain and is embodied in separate statutes to meet the special require¬
ments of Northern Ireland. Provision for the safety, health and welfare of
workers in factories with and without power, shipyards, electrical stations,
certain institutions and at docks, warehouses, building operations and civil
engineering works is embodied in the Northern Ireland Factories Acts. Many
firms voluntarily employ safety officers, and an Industrial Safety Group for
the area, supported by representatives of industry, trade unions, insurance
companies and public authorities, is very active and makes a valuable contri¬
bution in the field of industrial accident prevention on similar lines to what
is done in Great Britain.
The structure of labour relations in Britain is established mainly on a voluntary
basis, and rests on the organisation of employers and workers into employers’
associations and trade unions. These organisations1 * * discuss and negotiate
terms and conditions of employment and other matters affecting the work¬
people at their work. In some industries these negotiations are conducted
simply by ad hoc meetings, which are held when necessary; in others, voluntary
joint machinery has been established on a permanent basis. Normally these
arrangements for collective bargaining suffice to settle all questions which
are raised, but provision is often made for matters not so settled to be referred
for settlement to independent arbitration. In certain trades where wages
cannot be effectively controlled by voluntary agreement owing to the in¬
adequate organisation of employers or workers, provision has also been made
by the State for statutory regulation under the Wages Councils Act, 1959,
the Agricultural Wages Act, 1948, and the Agricultural Wages (Scotland)
Act, 1949.
Many employers in Great Britain are members of employers’ associations,
which are wholly or partly concerned with labour questions.
The primary aims of such employers’ associations are to help to establish
suitable terms and conditions of employment, including a sound wage
structure and proper standards of safety, health and welfare; to promote
good relations with employees and the efficient use of manpower; and to
provide means of settling any disputes which may arise. Different associations
vary in the emphasis which they put upon these different aims and in the
means by which they try to achieve them. Some concentrate on defensive
action, trying by negotiation and representations to modify proposals of
trade unions and Government in their members’ interests. Others also try to
give their members practical help and advice in developing positive employ¬
ment policies. A number of them, for example, have developed training schemes
for their industries and some provide advisory services on recruitment,
training and further education and general or specialised training courses.
There is diversity in regard to structure as well as function. Generally,
however, employers’ associations are organised on an industry basis rather
than a product basis. Some associations are purely local in character and deal
with a section of an industry; others are national in scope and are concerned
with the whole of a particular industry. In some of the chief industries there
are local or regional organisations combined into national federations, while
1 Some employers, including the central Government and the public corporations
operating the nationalised industries, negotiate directly with the trade unions repre¬
senting their different types of employees.

in others, within which different firms are engaged on making different
principal products, there is a very complex structure with national and
regional federations for these different sections of the industry as well as for
the industry as a whole. Altogether there are some 1,500 employers’ associa¬
tions dealing with labour matters and about 80 of them are national
federations.
The final authority of a local or small national association may be a meeting,
where all member firms are directly represented; but in larger organisations
some form of indirect representation is necessary, either through local associa¬
tions or through the regions or sections into which these associations are
grouped.
The representatives thus chosen, together with a number of office holders,
form a general council, central committee or general committee, which meets
perhaps once a quarter, mainly to take major policy decisions, to elect com¬
mittees and to ratify their work. The committees usually include a general
purposes committee and a negotiating committee. A small paid staff under a
director or secretary carries out the day-to-day work of the organisation.
There is usually a small working group, consisting of senior officials and
committee chairmen, which meets to deal with urgent questions and co¬
ordinate the work of the committees.
The central organ of employers’ associations is the British Employers’ Con¬
federation (BEC), which was set up in 1919 and was at first called the National
Confederation of Employers’ Organisations. Its membership now comprises
some 59 separate autonomous organisations in industries employing about
70 per cent of the persons engaged in private enterprise industries and
services in the country. The boards of nationalised industries are not in
membership. The confederation’s business is managed by a council which
meets under the chairmanship of the President and on which every member
organisation is represented.
The confederation deals with matters affecting the interests of organised
employers and their relations with their employees and is recognised by the
Government as a channel for consultation between Government departments
and representatives of private employers as a whole on such matters. It acts
as an advisory and consultative body for its member organisations, providing
them with information and statistics, ascertaining their collective views and
representing them nationally to the Government and the public and also
internationally, for instance, on the International Labour Organisation. Its
representatives sit on various councils and committees advisory to the
Government, on other statutory bodies, and on a number of voluntary bodies.
In nearly all industries and occupations some workers—and in some industries
nearly all workers—are organised into trade unions. These have grown up
gradually and independently over a great many years, and consequently their
form and organisation vary considerably. Trade unions started more than
two hundred years ago among the skilled craftsmen and spread later to the
general labouring and unskilled classes. More recently trade unionism has
increased among clerical, supervisory, technical and administrative workers.
A number of associations of professional workers, formed primarily for the
preservation and improvement of professional standards, have also come to
exercise many of the functions of trade unions, including negotiations on
salary and fee scales, and are legally trade unions.

others the qualification is industrial, i.e. they seek to recruit all persons in an
industry, whatever their occupation. In a number of unions recruitment is
based on a combination of these principles. A few large unions recruit members
in a number of difiFerent occupations and industries.
At the end of 1961 the total membership of British trade unions was about
9,883,000. There were 635 unions but about two-thirds of all trade unionists
were in the 17 largest unions, while about half were in the six largest, namely:
the Transport and General Workers’ Union, the Amalgamated Engineering
Union, the National Union of General and Municipal Workers, the National
Union of Mineworkers, the Union of Shop, Distributive and Allied Workers,
and the National Union of Railwaymen.
The basic unit of organisation in most British trade unions is the local
branch (called a lodge in some trade unions). Every member of the union
belongs to a branch or lodge. He may attend its meetings, put forward
suggestions about terms and conditions of employment, discuss the work
and policy of the union, and take part in the election of branch officers.
The branch takes action on certain matters considered to be entirely, or
mainly, of local interest but refers wider issues to the union’s national or
regional bodies.
Many unions also have shop stewards or other representatives at the place
of work to enrol members and collect dues, to report any encroachment on
agreed or customary conditions of work, and in some cases to act as representa¬
tives of members at their place of work for the settlement of grievances.
In a few trade unions, mainly in the printing and allied trades, organisation
is based primarily on the place of work.
In most large unions the central organisation is along the following lines:
elected officials, including a general secretary assisted by clerical and specialist
staff, are in charge of the work of the head office and are responsible to a
national executive council or committee which may be part-time or full-time,
and which is usually elected by, and responsible to, annual or biennial con¬
ferences of delegates from the branches.
Executive committees or councils play an important part in the government
of the unions; between conferences they are the highest authorities and carry
out policy decisions made by delegates.
Most unions also have some regional, district or area organisation, while in
large unions there are usually regional, district or area committees or
councils.
Trade unions may affiliate to one or more federations or confederations
whose main purpose in most cases is to represent all or most of the trade
unions in an industry in negotiations with employers. The scope and authority
of these federations and confederations vary greatly in different circumstances.
In Britain the national centre of the trade union movement is the Trades
Union Congress (TUC). Most trade unions of any size and importance are
affiliated to it: the main exceptions are the National and Local Government
Officers Association (NALGO), the National Union of Teachers (NUT) and
certain Civil Service staff associations. The TUC’s objects are to promote
the interests of its affiliated organisations and to improve the economic and
social conditions of the workers. Its membership comprises 175 organisations,
of which about a dozen are federations of some 150 separate unions; approxi¬
mately 350 unions in all are affiliated directly or indirectly. These represent
over 8 million workpeople. The TUC deals with all general questions which
concern trade unions both nationally and internationally and gives assistance
Q

BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
on questions relating to particular trades or industries at the request of the
trade union concerned.
The congress of delegates, which constitutes the TUC proper, meets for a
week every year to discuss matters of general interest to trade unionists and
to employees generally. It elects annually a General Council which represents
it during the remaining 51 weeks of the year. The General Council is responsible
for carrying out congress decisions, for watching economic and social develop¬
ments, and for providing educational and advisory services. It is also em¬
powered in certain circumstances to mediate in inter-union disputes.
One of the main tasks upon which the TUC is at present engaged is a
re-examination of the aims and structure of the British trade union movement.
Previous inquiries dealt principally with structure but on this occasion the
purposes of the movement also are being reviewed in the light of modern
conditions.
The TUC and a number of affiliated unions have in recent years substantially
developed their educational services to members. At the training college in
TUC headquarters, Congress House, London, one-week and two-week
courses are provided for about 700 students each year in general trade union
subjects, production and management subjects, industrial relations, collective
bargaining, and social insurance and industrial welfare. The TUC Educational
Trust also provides summer schools, regional week-end schools, and special
week-end schools for women and for young workers.
Certain unions organise one-week and other short residential courses, and
these and other unions provide week-end schools, for the education and
training of officers and members in the principles and practice of trade
unionism. More than 80 unions arrange education schemes either with the
National Council of Labour Colleges or with the Workers’ Educational
Association, or with both these organisations. Scholarships for longer-term
studies (usually one academic year) at Ruskin College, Oxford, other adult
residential colleges, or the London School of Economics, are offered by the
TUC Educational Trust and by certain unions.
The Trades Union Congress has been critically examining trade union
educational facilities and in 1961 approved proposals that began to be applied
in 1963 and are designed to lead eventually to the disbanding of the National
Council of Labour Colleges and the Workers’ Educational Trade Union
Committee (but not the Workers’ Educational Association itself) and their
replacement by a co-ordinated educational scheme financed mainly out of
increased affiliation fees to the TUC.
The TUC is recognised by the Government as the channel of consultation
between the Government departments and representatives of organised
workers on matters affecting the interests of employees generally.
There is also a separate Scottish Trades Union Congress, to which trade
unions may affiliate in respect of their membership in Scotland.
The TUC is a non-political body but under the Trade Union Act, 1913,
individual trade unions can, by a ballot vote of members, decide to set up a
political fund, financed by a separate levy, which any member can refuse to
pay without loss of his normal union rights and benefits. About 100 separate
trade union organisations, including most of the largest trade unions, have
such a fund and, in most cases, it is used to support the Labour Party (or
the Co-operative Party, which is associated with the Labour Party and has
substantially the same platform).
Branches of various trade unions in a locality generally affiliate to a local
trades council, which acts as a forum for the discussion of matters of common

interest and as a local agent of the TUC, by which it is registered each year.
There are more than 500 trades councils in England and Wales alone, grouped
together in 22 federations.
While in some industries all matters affecting terms and conditions of employ¬
ment are discussed on an ad hoc basis between the employers’ organisations
and the trade unions concerned, in other industries there are standard
procedures for dealing with such matters by joint discussion at national
level. In many industries there are, for this purpose, bodies composed of
representatives of both sides of the industry with, in some cases, an independent
chairman. There are about 300 of these bodies, most of which are called
Joint Industrial Councils. Their functions vary considerably, some being
simply negotiating bodies, while others deal with a wide range of subjects
affecting the interests of the industry concerned. Provision is sometimes made
in their constitution that a dispute on which it is not found possible to reach
agreement should be referred to some form of conciliation or arbitration by
independent persons, including the means provided under the Conciliation
Act, 1896, or the Industrial Courts Act, 1919.
Collective agreements between employers’ associations and trade unions
are not civil contracts between particular employers and employees, and are
not, therefore, in themselves enforceable at law. Observance of agreed terms
and conditions is based mainly on the good faith of employers and the mutual
respect and vigilance of trade unions and employers’ associations, but can be
secured in particular instances through reference to the Industrial Court
(see p. 474).
Arrangements for negotiation and joint consultation also exist at district
and factory level in many industries, where matters are discussed either
between the appropriate representatives of the two sides on an ad hoc basis,
or through regular machinery provided by District Joint Industrial Councils
or similar bodies and Works Councils. Such bodies discuss how agreements
reached at a national level may be applied to their district or factory, but as a
rule have no power to alter the terms of such national agreements. They also
discuss new problems which may arise, and if no solution can be found at
factory or district level, refer them to the national body. In many of the larger
industries national agreements recommend such consultation, and in some
they even prescribe model rules for its conduct.
In certain industries in which, owing to the lack of organisation among
employers and workers, voluntary negotiating arrangements do not exist
for the effective settlement of terms and conditions of employment or are
inadequate to secure their observance by voluntary methods throughout
the industry, statutory bodies known as Wages Councils and Agricultural
Wages Boards have been set up. These are composed of equal numbers of
representatives of employers and workers in the respective industries, with the
addition of certain independent members. Wages Councils may submit pro¬
posals for fixing minimum remuneration and holidays with pay to the Minister
of Labour, who must then make orders giving statutory force to such proposals,
subject only to his right to return them as a whole to the council for further
consideration.
Orders relating to employment in agriculture are made by the appropriate
Agricultural Wages Board (England and Wales or Scotland). Such orders
are effective only in the county agricultural wages committee area in respect

of which they have been made, but there is a national minimum enforceable
in England and Wales and also one for Scotland.
Matters which prove difficult to settle by negotiation are sometimes referred
by agreement to independent conciliators or arbitrators, and one way in which
the parties can find such persons is by invoking the help of the Minister of
Labour. Under authority derived from the Conciliation Act, 1896, and the
Industrial Courts Act, 1919, the Minister has certain powers to assist industry
to settle disputes which it is not found possible to resolve through an industry s
own machinery and procedure. These powers are all intended to supplement
and not to supersede the industry’s own machinery. There is no legal obliga¬
tion on the parties to a dispute to notify the dispute to the Minister, nor to
place the question before a conciliator.
To assist conciliation in industry, a staff of conciliation officers long formed
part of the Ministry of Labour. The duties of these officers were to keep in
touch with the course of relations between employers and workers at national,
district, and, in some cases, factory level, and to assist them, if requested, to
settle their problems by joint discussion and negotiation. Conciliators have
no legal powers. In i960 this service and the Ministry’s personnel manage¬
ment advisory service (see p. 477)were merged to form an integrated industrial
relations service.
Disputes which cannot be settled in this way may, at the request of both
parties, be referred to voluntary arbitration, either by a single arbitrator, or
an ad hoc Board of Arbitration, or by the Industrial Court, a permanent
tribunal established under the Industrial Courts Act. The court normally
consists of three members—the president, one member experienced in
representing employers and one in representing workpeople.
Like collective agreements, arbitration awards are not in themselves
enforceable at law, but, under the Terms and Conditions of Employment
Act, 1959, reports that a particular employer is not observing the recognised
(i.e.' agreed or awarded) terms or conditions of employment in his trade or
industry may be made to the Minister of Labour by organisations which are
parties to the agreement or award. If the matter is not otherwise settled, the
Minister must refer it to the Industrial Court which, after hearing the case,
may issue an award requiring the employer to observe the recognised terms
or conditions. Such an award becomes an implied term of the contract of
employment. This procedure, established under the 1959 Act, replaced an
earlier one of similar intention and effect.
The Minister of Labour is also empowered to appoint a Court of Inquiry
or Committee of Investigation into a dispute, whether existing or apprehended.
These procedures are primarily means of informing public opinion of the
facts of a dispute and are not means of arbitration. The report of a Court of
Inquiry has to be laid before Parliament. Although the recommendations
contained in the reports of such bodies are not binding on the parties, they
often provide the basis for further negotiations which lead to a settlement.
Over the past 30 years the number of working days lost each year through
stoppages of work arising from industrial disputes, i.e. through strikes and
lockouts, has been on an average about million which, taking the working
population as a whole, works out at approximately one hour per worker per
year. These figures, however, only record the time lost at establishments
where strikes actually take place; they take no account of the indirect effect
of stoppages of work. Nevertheless, the time lost through strikes is very

much less than that lost on account of sickness, accidents and absenteeism
and the United Kingdom’s record over the past 10 years or so compares
favourably with that of most other industrial countries.
Strikes in Britain are not in general caused by a break-down in the collective
bargaining machinery. This on the whole works smoothly and well. For
example, in 1962 about 200 important claims for higher wages or shorter
hours covering practically all industries were settled peacefully. Less than
ten resulted in disputes that led to stoppage of work. In fact it is estimated
that over 90 per cent of all strikes and about 70 per cent1 of the time lost
through strikes are the result of the unofficial and usually unconstitutional
action of the comparatively small groups of workers in single firms.
These unofficial strikes are therefore symptoms of a break-down in relations
between management and workers at the place of work itself. The Government’s
approach to the problem presented by these strikes is that the best way to
tackle them is to attack their causes. This means in other words securing a
fundamental improvement in relations between employers and workers and
the loyal observance of agreements and constitutional procedures freely
negotiated. To this purpose the Minister of Labour has been getting the leaders
of both sides of industry, through his National Joint Advisory Council, to
work out agreed policies on labour/management relations. At the same time,
in industries where strikes have been a particular difficulty, he has brought
the leading employers and trades unionists together to thrash out outstanding
problems.
The Government is in contact with representatives of employers and workers
at all levels on matters affecting their common interests. At local and district
level the industrial relations officers of the Ministry of Labour keep in touch
with the representatives of both sides of industry, while, at national level,
officers of the department are requested by many Joint Industrial Councils
to attend their meetings as liaison officers. Standing arrangements also exist
for consultation between the Government, the British Employers’ Confedera¬
tion and the Trades Union Congress through the National Joint Advisory
Council, which was set up in 1939 to advise the Government on matters in
which employers and workers have a common interest. It meets quarterly
under the chairmanship of the Minister of Labour. Its membership consists
of representatives of the British Employers’ Confederation and the Trades
Union Congress, together with representatives of the managements of
nationalised industries. In recent years it has been turning its attention to a
number of subjects that are of importance to relations between management
and workers generally throughout industry. These subjects include redun¬
dancy arrangements, the selection and training of supervisors, the training of
shop stewards and communication and consultation within the firm.
While labour relations in Government service and in the nationalised industries
are, in general, organised on the same principles as in private industry, there
are some special features.
Non-industrial employees in central Government service, where salaries and
conditions of service are under the direct control of the Treasury, are per¬
mitted and encouraged to join the appropriate Civil Service staff associations

Nationalised
Industries
(trade unions) and there is a highly developed system of negotiation and
joint consultation by means of the National and Departmental Whitley
Councils (see p. 70), corresponding to the Joint Industrial Councils in
industry. The two sides of the National Whitley Council are parties to a
Civil Service Arbitration Agreement which, subject to certain limitations,
provides that if there is failure to reach agreement by negotiation a depart¬
ment or association may report the dispute to the Minister of Labour for
reference to the Civil Service Arbitration Tribunal. The tribunal is an
independent one appointed by the Minister by virtue of his powers under the
Industrial Courts Act, 1919. Industrial employees of the central Government,
however, are organised by trades and not by departments; negotiations
regarding their wages and conditions of employment take place on Trade
Joint Councils and unresolved matters are referred for arbitration at the
Industrial Court. In the major employing departments, Departmental Joint
Councils also exist for the discussion of matters other than trade questions
which are of mutual concern to the department and its industrial employees
(and which are domestic to the department).
In local government services there are separate National Joint Councils
for the main grades of employees (such as manual, clerical and technical
employees, and road-menders) which deal with wages and conditions of
service as well as other matters. There are corresponding regional and district
councils.
In the nationalised industries, the main corporations, though not subject to
detailed governmental control, have a statutory duty to establish satisfactory
arrangements for collective bargaining in their industries and for joint con¬
sultation with their employees; but in carrying out these duties they are free
to choose the arrangements that suit them. In nearly every case a complex
system which already existed before nationalisation, has been taken over and
modified. The arrangements, therefore, as in industry generally, vary sub¬
stantially. The main difference from private industry is that the corporations
are not usually members of employers’ associations. In some industries they
are sole or main employers, but even where part of the industry is in private
hands, as for example in air or road transport, the corporations are separately
and directly represented on wage-negotiating bodies.
Wages and conditions of service in the nationalised industries are generally
settled by negotiation between representatives of managements and trade
unions at the national level; in most cases there are also regional and local
bodies, similarly representative, charged with the duty of applying these
agreements and dealing with any difficulties or differences which may arise.
Most of the industries use the facilities for arbitration offered to industry
generally by the Ministry of Labour, but coalmining and rail transport have
their own special arrangements.
The machinery for negotiation and conciliation in the United Kingdom is
usually agreed by and based on the industry as a whole and not on the individual
establishment or firm. Accordingly, those industries, such as electricity or
gas supply, where there are several corporations which act as employers, are
covered by a single set of arrangements for each industry, and the duty of
seeing that the arrangements are made falls on the central authorities, e.g., the
Gas Council or the Electricity Council. In civil aviation, there is a single joint
council at national level on which both the nationalised air corporations and
the private operators are represented. Where a single public corporation
engages in various activities, these may be treated as separate industries and

organised separately. For example, the National Coal Board’s coke and by¬
products plants have arrangements quite distinct from the coal mines.
Throughout the various organisational changes in the transport industries,
rail, road and water transport have kept their different methods, based on
individual traditions which existed before nationalisation.
Some of the nationalised industries have felt that joint consultation was
best carried out by their negotiating bodies; others have established separate
and specially constituted joint committees at all levels. In general, where
consultation and negotiation are conducted through the same machinery,
separate committees exist for different groups or grades of employees; where
the consultative and negotiating arrangements are kept apart, a single con¬
sultative committee serves all grades.
The system of labour relations in Northern Ireland is based on the same
principles as that of Great Britain and, in these matters, the Minister of
Labour and National Insurance has powers and duties broadly similar to
those of the Minister of Labour in Great Britain. About 90 per cent of trade
unionists in Northern Ireland are members of trade unions whose head¬
quarters are in Great Britain.
The establishment of good working conditions is assisted by the organisation
of employers and workpeople, by arrangements for negotiation and settlement
of differences, and by protective legislation and its enforcement. This
institutional framework, however, cannot by itself create satisfaction with
work and working conditions, nor the mutual trust and co-operation of
management and workers, nor the sense of shared effort and achievement
known as ‘team spirit’. Nor will good wages and hours, high standards of
safety and health and lavish employee services necessarily bring about these
attitudes and responses; their achievement depends rather on building up good
relations between individuals and interacting groups within the organisation.
In recent years, therefore, there has been a marked increase of interest in
‘human relations’ in industry, i.e. relations between management and their
workers as individuals, as distinct from relations between organisations of
employers and organisations of workers. This has led to more widespread
attention being given to all aspects of personnel management and to the
establishment of more personnel departments.
Practically all large industrial firms and many small ones now have a
personnel department staffed by one or more specialist officers. While the
form of organisation of personnel departments varies, the personnel officer
is generally responsible for advising all levels of management on every aspect
of labour relations. This officer also has particular duties with regard to
recruitment, selection, education and training, transfer of labour, the appli¬
cation of wage agreements, the promotion of joint consultation and the
supervision of working conditions and employee services.
Both voluntary and official organisations are concerned with promoting
better human relationships in industry. Voluntary organisations include
bodies which deal with management problems and provide a service to
subscribing firms, professional associations, linking individuals with a
common interest in particular functions of management, and bodies providing
specialist services, usually on a fee-paying basis.
In 1945 the Ministry of Labour established a Personnel Management
Advisory Service which did much to promote good personnel management
478
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Education and
Training

Joint
Consultation
and to assist firms by discussing problems of personnel policy. In i960 the
service was amalgamated with the conciliation service to form an integrated
industrial relations service which continues to promote good personnel
management and assist in the settlement of disputes. It is staffed by specially
trained industrial relations officers of the Ministry.
Recruitment and promotion policies are matters which each undertaking
decides for itself, although in some industries the decisions may be limited
by collective agreements or by trade practices. Great importance has recently
been attached to selection; and courses for training personnel officers in
modern interviewing techniques, including the use of test procedures, are
now well attended. Selection of applicants for jobs is assisted by the Govern¬
ment Employment Services.
Practical industrial training is the responsibility of industry, though the
Government accepts entire responsibility for theoretical technical education.
Short-term training is almost entirely carried out within individual firms,
but in about 120 sections of industry and commerce employers and trade
unions have agreed on national or regional schemes of apprenticeship and
other long-term training. In 1958 improvement of training facilities was
urged in a report of a sub-committee of the National Joint Advisory Council,
and, in accordance with one of its recommendations, the Industrial Training
Council was established in July 1958 by the British Employers’ Confederation,
the Trades Union Congress and the boards of nationalised industries.
Representatives of interested Government departments and institutes were
appointed to participate in the Council’s work. In 1959 the Council accepted
the offer of a Government grant-in-aid of £75,000 to assist the expansion of
training facilities and the appointment of training development officers.
In December 1962 a new plan to improve the supply of skilled labour was
put forward, in the form of a White Paper, by the Minister of Labour. The
proposals, which were drawn up after a study of existing practice in Britain
and other countries, were intended to form a basis of discussion with in¬
dustrial and labour interests and educational authorities. The Minister plans
to introduce a training Bill which would give him statutory power to set up
boards with responsibility for all aspects of training in individual industries.
The boards would lay down training policies, establish syllabuses and tests,
give advice and financial grants to firms employing trainees, and run their
own training courses. They would be financed by a levy on firms in their
own industry and by loans and grants from the Ministry. The Government
has allocated £10 million towards the establishment of the boards.
Another Government measure to improve training facilities was announced
in April 1963, when the Minister of Labour told the House of Commons that
he intended to open 15 more training centres, in addition to the three
announced in December 1962, bringing the total number of training centres
to 31. The existing 13 centres provide training for about 5,000 persons
annually and when the new centres come into full operation, an additional
5,000 a year will be trained, most of them in the engineering and building
trades.
The realisation that the co-operation of workpeople depends largely on their
proper understanding of management’s aims and plans has focused attention
on the means of conveying information to workers. Methods used include
posters, wall information sheets, production charts, displays of photographs,
the production of news-sheets and house journals, discussions and lectures,
LABOUR
479
film shows and exhibitions. It is increasingly held, however, that, although
these media have their use, it is more important to improve communications
down the normal chain of responsibility to workshop level (a matter which
depends on personal relations and on the adequacy of supervisor training)
and to establish means for joint consultation, such as those provided by a
works council.
In the nationalised industries the various Acts placing them under public
ownership impose obligations on the management, except where adequate
machinery already exists, to consult with the appropriate trade unions to
establish such machinery for promoting measures affecting the safety, health
and welfare of employees and for discussing matters of mutual interest,
including efficiency. Arrangements for consultation at all levels, including the
workplace level, have been made in all the nationalised industries according
to the traditions and needs of each industry.
The range of subjects which works councils can fruitfully discuss is wide
and includes hours of work (within the framework of agreements), safety,
health, efficiency of production, absenteeism, labour turnover, training,
education, recreation and employees’ services generally. Works councils are
usually kept informed about the state of trade and production and the firm’s
prospects, and frequently consider problems resulting from decisions to
change production methods. It is the general practice, however, to exclude
all questions relating to wages and conditions of employment, and other
matters covered by negotiation between organisations of employers and
workers.
The Government has assisted these developments by advice on techniques,
by the supply of posters, pamphlets, films and other publicity material, and
by encouraging and promoting joint consultation. Industrial relations officers
of the Ministry of Labour are often approached by firms seeking advice on
the establishment of works councils or on ways in which their activities can
be made more effective.
Research into
Human
Factors in
Industry
The Government has sought to extend by research the available knowledge
of the factors influencing human relations in industry and human efficiency.
Results of researches sponsored by two committees set up by the Department
of Scientific and Industrial Research and the Medical Research Council in
1953 have been published; and the work of these committees is now carried
on by a committee on Human Sciences which was set up in 1957 by the
Department of Scientific and Industrial Research. Research Units of the
Medical Research Council have worked on these problems for many years
and continue to do so.
SOUND AND TELEVISION
BROADCASTING
Broadcasting of sound and of television in the United Kingdom is regulated
under powers conferred on the Postmaster General by the Wireless Tele¬
graphy Acts, 1949-1955, which prohibit the sending or receiving of radio
communications, except under licence. Users of sound and television receiving
sets must obtain an annual licence, which can be purchased from most post
offices.
Sound broadcasting services are provided solely by the British Broadcasting
Corporation (BBC), which was established as a public corporation by Royal
Charter in 1927. Television services are provided by both the British Broad¬
casting Corporation and the Independent Television Authority (ITA), which
was established by the Television Act, 1954, and continued by the Television
ACt’ I963' ... • . IT' 1 • T,
The number of receiving licences current in the United Kingdom in July
1963 was 15,841,322, of wffiich 12,621,901 were for sound and television
combined and 3,219,421 (including 550,481 for sets fitted in cars) for sound
only. A combined sound and television licence costs £4; a sound only licence
costs £1. Registered blind people are entitled to free sound licences or to
combined licences for £3. One licence covers all receiving sets in a household,
but a separate licence is required for a set fitted in a car.
Development of When sound broadcasting began in the United Kingdom in 1922, it was
the Services decided in Parliament that the Postmaster General should grant only one
licence for that purpose at any one time, and the first licence was granted
exclusively to a limited company (the British Broadcasting Company). The
decision to grant only one licence for broadcasting was maintained when the
British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) was formed to take over the functions
of the limited company in 1927; it was reaffirmed in 1937 when the BBC’s
second charter was granted to cover the sound services and the television
service which the BBC had inaugurated during the previous year; and it was
upheld throughout the second world war and during the post-war period
until 1952.
During the second world war television broadcasting was suspended and
transmissions were not resumed until 1946. After resumption, however, the
television service gained rapidly both in technical efficiency and in popularity;
and between 1949 and 1952 the Government instituted a major review of
sound and television broadcasting which aroused great interest in Parliament,
in the press and among the public. After prolonged parliamentary and general
discussion it was decided by the Government that the potential power of
television was so great that it would be undesirable to leave transmission ser¬
vices in this medium in the hands of a single authority, however excellent.
The Independent Television Authority was therefore established in 1954, as
a public body, to provide services additional to those of the BBC for an initial
period often years (extended for another 12 years, to i97^> t^ie Television

SOUND AND TELEVISION BROADCASTING 481
Act, 1963). Independent television transmissions began in September 1955—
the BBC’s monopoly in the provision of sound broadcasting services
remaining undisturbed.
In i960 the Government appointed a Committee of Inquiry, under the
chairmanship of Sir Harry Pilkington, to review both the technical considera¬
tions and constitutional principles on which broadcasting in the United
Kingdom had hitherto been based and the whole question of future sound
and television services; it reported in 1962. The principal recommendations
accepted by the Government were: the BBC’s current charter, due to expire
in 1964, should be renewed; the BBC should remain the sole provider of
sound broadcasting services, and should be authorised to provide a second
television programme; any new television service should from the start be
in the ultra high frequency (UHF) wave band, on a standard of 625 lines
(the internationally agreed standard in general use throughout Europe)
instead of on 405 lines as at present; existing services should eventually
transfer to 625 lines, and colour should be used (on 625 lines) as soon as
possible. The committee’s proposals for reorganisation of independent
television were not, in the main, accepted; the Government decided to
retain the existing structure and to give the Authority certain additional
powers.
The BBC and the ITA are independent authorities in the day-to-day
operations of broadcasting, including programmes and administration. The
Government, however, retains ultimate control, and the Postmaster General,
as the responsible Minister, is answerable to Parliament on broad questions
of policy and may issue directions to the BBC and to the ITA on a number
of technical and other subjects. The Postmaster General also has powers to
prohibit the broadcasting of any particular matter or class of matter, or to
revoke the licences of the BBC or ITA at any time; these powers, however,
are treated as major reserve powers, and no formal veto has ever been placed
on the broadcasting of a particular item. Both the BBC and the ITA are
required to prepare annual reports and accounts, which are presented by
the Postmaster General to Parliament.
The BBC and the ITA both consult with the Postmaster General as to the
hours of television broadcasting, and he has approved an arrangement which
permits a maximum of 50 hours a week, together with extensions (averaging
ten hours a week) for certain stated purposes, such as religious broadcasts,
ministerial and party political broadcasts, schools broadcasts, programmes of
adult education, outside broadcasts and Welsh language broadcasts. The
authorities may broadcast television programmes, within the prescribed
maxima, during any periods best suited to the needs of their audiences. The
BBC broadcasts about 39 hours of programmes from London in its domestic
sound services during a normal weekday and it is hoped to increase this to
about 54 hours by 1964.
The BBC operates under the provisions of two documents, each granted for
a limited period at the end of which they may be renewed or amended: the
Charter, which sets out the constitution, objects and organisation of the BBC
and contains certain financial provisions; and the Licence and Agreement
between the BBC and the Postmaster General, which deals with technical
matters, certain non-technical conditions such as the prohibition of commercial
advertisements and sponsored programmes, and details of the financial
arrangements in force. The operations of the ITA are governed by the
482
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
The British
Broadcasting
Corporation
provisions of the Television Acts, 1954 and 1963, which formulate its con¬
stitution, its functions, its purpose and the framework of its finances; and
by the Licence (which contains technical provisions) issued to it by the
Postmaster General in 1955.
Under the current Charter (which expires on 30th July, 1964, and will be
replaced by another, lasting until 1976) the corporation consists of nine
governors (including a chairman, a vice-chairman and separate national
governors for Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland), each appointed for a
period of not more than five years by the Sovereign in Council. As a corporate
body, the governors are responsible for the conduct of the whole broad¬
casting operation, including the content and presentation of the programmes
in sound and television, and the provision and working of the necessary
installations and equipment.
In the discharge of its responsibilities the BBC is required to ensure that
its services are used, as stated in the preamble to the Charter, ‘as a means of
disseminating information, education and entertainment’, and to pay heed to
the requirements of the Licence (for instance, it must allow the broadcasting
of any announcement at the request of a Government department, and must
not broadcast commercial advertisements or sponsored programmes). It must
refrain from expressing editorial opinion on current affairs and on matters
of public policy, and it is relied on to treat controversial subjects with
complete impartiality.
The governors are advised on all aspects of their work by a number of
councils, established in accordance with the terms of the Charter, for example,
the General Advisory Council, which has been in existence, except for a
break during the war years, since 1934; the National Broadcasting Councils
for Scotland and Wales, which, under the chairmanship of the national
governors for Scotland and Wales, are responsible for domestic sound services
in those countries and are to be given duties in respect of television also;
and the Regional Advisory Councils for the English regions and for Northern
Ireland. There are also a number of other councils and committees, not
specifically required by the Charter, but established by the BBC to advise
on such matters as religious broadcasting, schools broadcasting, music, adult
education and agriculture.
The chief executive officer of the BBC is the Director-General, who is
appointed by the governors at their discretion and with whom they discuss
all major matters of policy and finance. Under the Director-General are six
directors (the Chief Assistant to the Director-General, and the Directors of
Sound Broadcasting, Television, External Broadcasting, Engineering, and
Administration) who, between them, cover the whole work of the BBC, and
who, with the Director-General, constitute its Board of Management. The
number of staff employed is over 18,000.
The services of the BBC are financed from (1) an annual sum, voted by
Parliament, which is related to revenue derived from the sale by the Post
Office of broadcast receiving licences; (2) an annual grant-in-aid, voted by
Parliament, for the External Services, i.e. the European Services, the Overseas
Services, and the Monitoring Service; and (3) profits from BBC publications,
mainly the Radio Times, which has a weekly sale of nearly 5 million copies
and attracts a large advertising revenue. The gross revenue from the sale of
licences for the year ended 3IS^ March, 1963* amounted to j£4°>755>474>
excluding the excise duty which is not regarded as part of the income from
licences and is not available to be spent on broadcasting.

In 1962-63 the Post Office deducted £2,870,000 from the gross licence
income, for the expenses it incurred in collecting the licence fees, investigating
complaints of electrical interference, and administration, and the BBC
received £37,885,474. In the same year, the net revenue from publications
was £603,649 and grant-in-aid receipts for the external services amounted
to j£7>527>000-
The Independent Television Authority consists of a chairman, a deputy
chairman and, at present, eight other members (three of whom have special
responsibility for Scotland, Wales and Monmouthshire, and Northern
Ireland severally) appointed by the Postmaster General. The ITA owns and
operates the transmitting stations, but the production studios and equipment
are owned, and the actual programmes are provided, by programme companies
under contract to the ITA. The Authority has controlling and regulatory
powers of a wide and important character in regard to programmes; the
Television Act, 1954, requires it to ensure that they do not offend against
good taste or decency, that they are balanced in their subject matter, that
they preserve due impartiality in presenting matters of industrial or political
controversy, and that the news is reported accurately; and the Television
Act, 1963, makes it responsible for television broadcasting services ‘as a
public service for disseminating information, education and entertainment’.
The 1963 Act also strengthens the ITA’s powers, provides for the submission
by the programme contractors of programme schedules for the approval of
the Authority and lays on it the duty to produce and keep under review a
code of programme standards governing the rules to be observed about the
showing of violence, particularly when large numbers of children and young
people may be expected to be watching. In the choice of programme com¬
panies the ITA is guided by their potential ability to provide an efficient
service and, in the case of regional companies, by their associations with the
local communities concerned.
In the discharge of its duties the ITA is advised by three statutory com¬
mittees: the Advertising Advisory Committee; the Children’s Advisory
Committee; and the Central Religious Advisory Committee, which by
arrangement with the BBC acts as the statutory advisory body to the ITA
on religious broadcasting.2 The ITA has also appointed a panel of six con¬
sultants to assist it in the exercise of its day-to-day responsibilities for religious
services and programmes.
The chief executive officer of the ITA is the Director-General. There are
also two Deputy Directors-General, and a headquarters and regional office
staff covering all technical, administrative, clerical, typing and office services,
which numbered 206 in 1963. Staff has also been recruited for the trans¬
mitting stations, bringing the total number of ITA staff to 572. Fifteen
programme companies are under contract with the ITA: Associated-
Rediffusion Limited; Associated Television Limited; ABC Television
Limited; Granada TV Network Limited; Scottish Television Limited;
Independent Television for South Wales and the West of England Limited
(TWW); Southern Television Limited; Tyne-Tees Television Limited;
Anglia Television Limited; Ulster Television Limited; Westward Television;
Border Television Limited; Grampian Television Limited; Wales (West
and North) Television Limited; and Channel Television Limited. A common
news service is provided by Independent Television News Limited. A
standing consultative committee, composed of two representatives of the

External Services
ITA and a representative of each of the programme companies, provides
consultative machinery between the ITA and the companies on matters
affecting the companies as a whole. There is also an Independent Television
Companies Association, designed to further the collective interests of the
companies with such outside bodies as trade unions and sporting organisations,
and generally to ensure that they speak as far as possible with one voice on
public issues connected with television broadcasting policy.
The ITA receives no payments from licence revenue; its finance is drawn
from annual payments made to it by the programme companies. In the year
which ended on 31st March, 1962, these payments amounted to about
£4.7 million. Of its surplus of ^1,400,000 for the financial year 1961-62,
£531,311 was paid by the ITA into the Exchequer at the direction of the
Postmaster General. From July 1964 programme companies’ rental payments
will consist of an amount to cover the Authority’s costs and an additional
payment, related to advertising receipts, to be paid by the Authority into
the Exchequer.
The BBC operates its domestic sound broadcasting services from 57 long¬
wave and medium-wave transmitters at 43 transmitting stations, and from
28 very high frequency (VHF) transmitting stations. By the end of 1964 the
VHF service will be available to 99.4 per cent of the population of the United
Kingdom. The external broadcasting services are at present transmitted from
41 high power, high frequency transmitters: 39 in the United Kingdom and
two (used for relay purposes) at Tebrau, near Singapore. The Government
has approved a major programme of building new transmitters for the over¬
seas services, which will cost over £4^ million.
There are 147 studios for the domestic sound programmes, of which 57
are in London and 90 at various centres in the regional areas. The external
services use 38 London studios. There are also 31 semi-automatic studios
which can be operated by programme officials without an engineering staff.
The domestic sound services (which produce over 20,000 programme hours
a year) consist of the Home Service, the Light Programme and the Third
Network, carrying the Third Programme and Network Three. These separate,
but inter-related, services give the BBC reasonable scope in providing
programmes that fall within a very wide range of what can be effectively
broadcast in sound only.
Each of the four services has its own characteristics: the Home Service
is planned as a general service, and in addition to a wide range of musical
programmes and plays provides the principal news and information services,
discussions on domestic and foreign affairs, political broadcasts (ministerial
broadcasts and controversial broadcasts by party spokesmen) and special
programmes of various kinds, including broadcasts for schools. It is also the
vehicle for regional broadcasting (i.e. programmes specially compiled for
listeners in Scotland, Northern Ireland, Wales, and the Midlands, and north
and west of England). The main purpose of the Light Programme is to provide
a service of entertainment and relaxation for the majority. The Third Pro¬
gramme is intended for those who take pleasure in close and responsive
listening to broadcasts of artistic and intellectual distinction; and Network
Three to meet the practical needs of selective minority audiences for expert
information on specialist subjects.
The external broadcasting services of the BBC are intended to provide a link
of culture, information and entertainment between the peoples of the United
SOUND AND TELEVISION BROADCASTING
485
Kingdom and those in all other parts of the world; to present events of
world-wide importance with speed and accuracy; and generally to reflect
British opinion and the British way of life. These services are broadcast in
English and in 40 other languages for over 600 hours a week, which is longer
than the output of all the BBC’s domestic sound and television services
added together, and involves the transmission of some 11,000 news pro¬
grammes and 1,200 talks a week.
The services, under the Director of External Broadcasting, are divided into
the European Services and the Overseas Services, each in charge of a Con¬
troller. Within these two groups are the regional divisions. Common to both
groups is the External Services News Department, which prepares all the
news broadcasts for audiences outside the United Kingdom.
The European Services broadcast about 225 programme hours a week and
are subdivided into four regional groupings: South European (Spain,
Portugal, Italy, Greece, Turkey, Israel), Central European (Czechoslovakia,
Hungary, Poland, Finland), East European (Soviet Union, Roumania,
Bulgaria, Yugoslavia, Albania), and German. A French language service
provides programmes for both European and African listeners. There is
also an English service directed to the whole of Europe. The material
broadcast by the regional services is mainly supplied by two central depart¬
ments: the European Talks Department and the European Production
Department.
The Overseas Services, which are directed to countries outside Europe,
broadcast over 380 programme hours a week. They comprise the General
Overseas Service with its world-wide audience of English-speaking
listeners, and a number of regional services in English and 22 other lan¬
guages. The General Overseas Service, which includes among its audience
peoples of the Commonwealth, British Forces and British communities
overseas, gives a complete programme service for 22J hours every day.
The regional services consist of the African Service with programmes in
English, Hausa, Swahili and Somali; the Arabic Service; the Asian Service
with programmes in 14 oriental languages; the Latin American Service
with programmes in Spanish and Portuguese; and other special programmes
in English for North America, Australia, the Pacific, the Caribbean and
the Falkland Islands, in Maltese for Malta, in French for Canada and in
French and English for Mauritius.
The external broadcasting services also include the Transcription Service,
which records nearly 1,000 BBC sound programmes annually and distributes
them to broadcasting organisations in all parts of the world; the 'English by
Radio and Television' service, which produces some 200 English lessons with
•commentaries in 46 languages every week and reaches an audience of several
millions by direct transmission from London and the BBC’s Far Eastern
station and by recorded broadcasts from some 200 local stations in 87 countries:
it has recently produced its first series of English lessons by television; and
the Monitoring Service, which reports foreign broadcasts from some 50
countries in 35 languages and works under a reciprocal agreement with its
American counterpart as regards monitored material from the Far East and
other areas inaudible in the United Kingdom.
In the external services the Corporation works in consultation with the
Government departments concerned with overseas relations which prescribe
the languages and hours of broadcasting, but the day-to-day content of the
programmes remains the responsibility of the BBC.

The BBC maintains offices in New York, Paris, Berlin, Ottawa, Toronto,
Sydney, New Delhi, Singapore and Beirut, to encourage local interest in
the BBC, to promote the use of BBC television and radio material and to
provide the BBC with advice and help concerning programmes, whether for
home listeners about that area or for listeners in the area itself. The offices
(which are concerned with the whole field of sound radio and, where appro¬
priate, television) are also responsible for promoting good relations with the
local broadcasting organisations, and for keeping the BBC informed about
local broadcasting and other developments of interest; in these matters, they
work closely with the BBC’s Overseas and Foreign Relations Department.
Audience research is undertaken by sampling surveys and other research
methods to assess the size, nature and tastes of various audiences.
In 1936 the BBC launched the world’s first regular public service of high
definition television. By 1963 this service was being transmitted from 34
stations and was available to 99 per cent of the population. A further forty
relay stations will be completed by the end of 1964 to extend coverage to
another 275,000 viewers and to improve reception for 1,367,000 more. The
total coverage will then be 99-4 per cent of the population of the United
Kingdom. A new transmitter at Wenvoe will enable a distinctively Welsh
television service to be provided for Wales in 1964. This will also be trans¬
mitted by existing and proposed relay stations in Wales. The second BBC
television service is planned to begin in April 1964 in the London area and is
expected to reach some two-thirds of the population of Britain by the end
of 1966.
In the course of a year, the BBC television service broadcasts on a national
network more than 7,000 items, made up of studio productions, outside
broadcasts, films, and relays from the continent of Europe. BBC Television
Enterprises undertakes the world-wide sale of BBC television programmes
(films, tele-recordings and video-taped material); it also purchases material
for the use of the BBC television service and conducts business relations
with other television organisations throughout the world.
BBC studio productions come from the four main studios at the Television
Centre, at Shepherds Bush in west London; and three studios at Lime
Grove, London; and from fully equipped regional studios at Manchester,
Birmingham,1 Cardiff, Glasgow, Bristol and Belfast. In addition, fourteen
small interview studios (used mainly for short insertions into the news) have
been established in London, Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland, and in the
north, midland and west of England regions. The Television Film Department
of the BBC is housed at the Ealing film studios; and Television News and
newsreel programmes originate from a specially equipped studio at Alexandra
Palace, London. Three further main studios are now being equipped at the
Television Centre in west London; eventually, the Television Centre will be
able to produce 1,500 hours of television programmes in a year.
Outside broadcasting, which provides nearly 1,000 programmes annually
(over 16 per cent of the total BBC television output), covers most parts of
the United Kingdom with its mobile units, presenting programmes both of
national and of specifically regional interest. Programmes and news items
from many parts of Europe are brought to viewers in the United Kingdom
over the Eurovision network (see p. 489).
1 Work has started on a new Midland regional headquarters near Birmingham, which
will become the first combined television and sound radio centre in the world.
SOUND AND TELEVISION BROADCASTING
487
The first regular independent television (ITV) service was inaugurated in
September 1955 by a programme transmission from the IT A London station
at Beaulieu Heights, Croydon. By 1963 programmes were being transmitted
from 22 stations in all parts of the United Kingdom, and over twelve million
homes in the United Kingdom were able to receive independent television.
ITV programmes are produced at studio centres in London, Birmingham,
Manchester, Glasgow, Cardiff, Southampton, Newcastle, Norwich, Belfast,
Dover, Plymouth, Carlisle, Aberdeen, Bristol and St. Helier. The establish¬
ment of these studios is the direct result of the ITA’s policy of encouraging
the development of regional television, and the programmes are either for
local broadcasting or for transmission to one or more of the other regions
through the link system operated by the ITA. This consists of some 6,000 miles
of vision links, about 60 per cent of which are two-way circuits.
Both the BBC and the ITV services include programmes of music, drama,
light entertainment, variety, films, news reports covering international,
national, and local events, political programmes, and outside broadcasts,
particularly of national and State occasions and sport. Religious broadcasts
and broadcasts for schools also feature regularly in both services, as do
programmes designed to stimulate thought and widen people’s horizons,
such as interviews with outstanding personalities, investigations into matters
of public interest, and programmes on the arts; and there are programmes of
specialised interest, such as children’s and family programmes, programmes
for women, regional programmes, and programmes on agriculture. The BBC
provides time and broadcasting facilities for party political broadcasts (the
contents of which are, however, the responsibility of the political parties).
The Television Act, 1954, lays down that the programme companies (ITA)
may take the whole series of party political broadcasts but not some only.
Commercial advertising is excluded from the television programmes of the
BBC, as from its sound programmes, and the BBC seeks to avoid giving
publicity to any individual firm or organised interest except in so far as is
necessary in providing effective and informative programmes under the
terms of the Charter. The ITA broadcasts advertisements (on which the
programme companies depend for their revenue) subject to the relevant
provisions in the Television Acts, 1954 and 1963, namely, that there should
be no sponsoring of programmes by advertisers, that all advertisements should
be clearly distinguishable as such and recognisably separate from the pro¬
gramme, and that the amount of time given to advertising should not be so
great as to detract from the value of the programmes as a medium of enter¬
tainment, instruction and information. The ITA also has rules agreed with
the Postmaster General about certain classes of broadcasts (including, in
particular, religious services) in which advertisements may not be inserted
and, on the advice of the Advertising Advisory Committee, has drawn up
certain ‘principles for television advertising’ with a view to the exclusion of
misleading or unsuitable advertisements from the programmes. These
principles may form the basis of the code governing standards and practice
in advertising which, under the 1963 Act, the ITA (after July 1964) will
have to prepare and keep under review. The cost of inserting advertisements
in the ITA service is borne by the advertisers, who pay the programme
companies for advertising time.
An experiment in pay-television, a service whereby subscribers pay for
programmes they choose to view, will take place in a few areas, probably
starting in 1964. The Postmaster General will license companies taking part
to operate a service.

BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Wire broadcasting—a system whereby programmes are received at a central
point, whence they are distributed by wire to listeners and viewers—
began in the United Kingdom in 1925 as a private venture and remains in
the hands of private enterprise. Wire broadcasting companies operate under
licence from the Postmaster General. They are not allowed to originate
programmes of their own, and their function is to distribute programmes put
out by general broadcasting stations. A specified minimum of their programme
material must be taken from BBC sources. Subscribers to wire broadcasting
services must have ordinary broadcast receiving licences. At the beginning
of 1963 there were 637 wire broadcasting services, of which 474 gave television
service and the remainder sound-only service. The number of subscribers at
that date was 1,165,968, including 677,745 w^° were receiving television services.
Audience research, as conducted by the BBC, is carried on by means of
(a) a Survey of Listening and Viewing, during the course of which a representa¬
tive sample of the population is interviewed each day about its listening and
viewing on the previous day, (b) a continuous system of gathering information
about the way programmes are received by those who happen to see or hear
them, through panels of representative listeners and viewers, and (c) ad hoc
investigations. Independent Television relies in the main on figures supplied
by an independent research organisation—Television Audience Measurement
Limited—using a machine known as a Tammeter, which is fixed to a number
of representative television receivers and records the actual time these
receivers are in use. The 1963 Act requires the IT A to arrange for continuing
audience research on similar lines to the BBC’s.
The Postmaster General is advised on the technical aspects of television
(and VHF sound broadcasting) by the Television Advisory Committee,
which consists of an independent chairman, the Director-General of the BBC,
the Director-General of the ITA, representatives from the radio industry,
independent members, and representatives of interested Government
departments.
Research into technical problems is carried out by the scientific and
engineering staffs of the BBC, the Post Office and the radio industry. Since
September 1962 the BBC has been carrying out a series of 625-line UHF
field trials. Problems of transmission and reception when two programmes
are radiated from the same site are being investigated, using two transmitters
installed for the purpose (on channels 44 and 34). In addition to transmissions
in monochrome, a comparison is being made of three systems of colour
transmission, based on the NTSC, SECAM and PAL systems. Other recent
studies include: investigations into various systems of stereophonic sound
transmissions; methods of improving studio acoustics, microphones and
loudspeakers; long-distance propagation studies in the short wave, VHF
and ultra high frequency bands; and methods of increasing national coverage
both in sound and television by such means as the sharing of frequencies
between stations, the construction of transmitting aerials having special
horizontal radiation patterns, and the development of unattended relay
transmitters of low power for providing a television and VHF sound service
to small and isolated communities. The BBC has also developed equipment
for converting television programmes from European standards to those of
North America, and the world’s first electronic standards converter (from
625 to 405 lines) which operates unattended and gives converted pictures of
far higher quality than those of earlier converters.

The BBC and the ITA (together with the Independent Television Companies
Association) are active members of the European Broadcasting Union. The
union, which now has 25 full members among the broadcasting organisations
in the European zone and 17 associate members (mostly from outside Europe,
including the United States of America and many of the nations of the
Commonwealth) meets every year to exchange views and information, and
to study common problems. It also maintains a Technical Monitoring Station,
where frequency measurements and other observations on broadcasting stations
can be carried out.
Within the Commonwealth, the BBC is closely associated with the broad¬
casting organisations of the other member countries and of the dependent
territories. The BBC, the Australian Broadcasting Commission, the Canadian
Broadcasting Corporation, and the Rank Organisation have jointly set up
a British Commonwealth International Newsfilm News Agency Trust.
Through an associated non-profit-making company (the British Common¬
wealth International Newsfilm News Agency Limited), this joint enterprise
provides a reliable service of international news on film for subscribers who
operate television services, produce cinematograph newsreels or acquire
newsfilm for any other purposes, including education, anywhere in the world.
Both the BBC and the independent television companies are associated
with the Centre for Educational Television, which began work in 1962 and
concentrates particularly on the needs of the service in developing countries.
The centre receives a Government grant totalling £100,000 over five years,
but most of its funds come from private sources, including the independent
television companies. The BBC provides free technical and other facilities,
including film library resources and some use of lecture studios.
The BBC and the ITA also participate in the work of the International
Telecommunication Union (ITU)—the United Nations specialised agency
responsible for the regulation and control of all international telecommuni¬
cation services (including sound and television), for the allocation and
registration of all radio frequencies and (through its International Con¬
sultative Committees) for the promotion and co-ordination of the international
study of technical problems in broadcasting. In addition, the BBC has
long-established relations with the United Nations Radio Division, with the
United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation (UNESCO),
and with the Council of Europe.
As well as taking part in the exchange of sound radio programmes arranged
between the member countries of the European Broadcasting Union (EBU),
the BBC is a regular contributor to the network of European television
(Eurovision). This network now includes 17 Western European member
countries; the exchange of television programmes between them is arranged
by the EBU, which maintains an International Television Co-ordination
Centre (Eurovision) in Brussels. The range of Eurovision is steadily increasing
as countries expand their networks and facilities, and new countries participate.
Successful programme exchanges have also been made between Moscow and
London by both the BBC and the independent television companies.
The first television relay across the Atlantic by means of Telstar, the com¬
munication satellite, was seen in Britain in the early hours of nth July, 1962.
The first programme exchanges between America and Europe via Telstar
were televised on 23rd July, 1962. Further exchanges have been achieved by
means of the subsequent satellite Relay (see p. 222).

THE PRESS
The British press caters for all political views, different levels of education
and a wide range of interests. It is not subject to State control or censorship.
The British public buys more newspapers per person than any other in
the world. It has been estimated (United Nations Statistical Year Book, 1962)
that for every 1,000 inhabitants of the United Kingdom 514 copies of daily
papers are sold every day. Next comes Luxembourg with 500 and Sweden
with 462 per 1,000 inhabitants. Circulation figures of individual newspapers
are proportionately high: five of the daily morning newspapers and five of
the Sunday papers have circulations in the millions. These high figures
are largely explained by the fact that the London morning and Sunday
papers have ‘national’ circulations, i.e. they are distributed throughout
the United Kingdom, being available almost everywhere on the day of
publication.
Britain imports just over half its newsprint requirements, while the rest
is made from imported raw materials. In 1962 1-3 million tons of newsprint
were used in the United Kingdom. The average size of London national
morning papers varies between 16 and 32 pages. Prices of daily newspapers
vary from 3d. (for the majority of papers) to 3d. (for The Times). Sunday
papers run up to 48 pages and to a price of yd. {The Sunday Times includes
a colour magazine section of over 20 pages.)
According to The Newspaper Press Directory1 there are 143 daily and
Sunday newspapers and over 1,200 weekly papers published in Greater
London and almost every sizable town in the rest of the country. These
papers deal mainly with news of interest to the region where they are sold.
There are also the sporting papers, papers in foreign languages for groups of
nationals of other lands resident in Britain, and religious papers.
In 1947 a Royal Commission on the Press was appointed to inquire into
the finance, control, management and ownership of the British press. Its
report was issued in June 1949 {Cmd. 7700) and found that the British press
‘is completely independent of outside financial interests and ... its policy is
the policy of those that conduct it’; there was evidence that the direct influence
of advertisers on policy was ‘negligible’. After studying management and
ownership, the Royal Commission concluded that ‘there is nothing approach¬
ing monopoly in the press as a whole, or ... in any class of newspaper’.
Among other recommendations it suggested the establishment of a press
council (see p. 497).
Between 1949 and 1961 seventeen London and provincial daily and Sunday
newspapers ceased publication and the ownership of those that remained
became concentrated in fewer hands. In March 1961 a second Royal Com¬
mission was appointed to study this trend and to consider, in the public
interest, whether the economic and financial factors affecting the production
and sale of newspapers tended to diminish diversity of ownership and control
or the number and variety of publications.
1 Changes in the number of newspapers occur constantly; figures are based on the
1963 edition of The Newspaper Press Directory.

° The company named is, for each newspaper, the one in ultimate control of the
undertaking and is not necessarily the company which publishes the newspaper.
The Commission, which issued its report in September 1962, considered
that further concentration of ownership of the press might lead to a stifling
of variety of opinion, which would be against the public interest. To ensure
that future amalgamations of newspapers should be subjected to more
scrutiny than heretofore, it recommended that a Press Amalgamation Court
should be set up to examine transactions involving the acquisition of news¬
paper titles or of controlling interest in companies which own newspapers;
the scheme should be limited to daily and Sunday newspapers with aggregate
weekly sales of more than three million copies. The Commission also
recommended that the Press Council should be reconstituted and endowed
with additional authority and funds (see p. 497); that control of commercial
television interests by newspaper undertakings should be ended1; and that
efficiency in newspaper production should be improved.
1 In line with this recommendation, the Television Act, 1963, stipulates that, if it
appears to the Independent Television Authority at any time that newspaper share¬
holdings in television programme companies have led or are leading to results which
are contrary to the public interest, the Authority may, with the consent of the Post¬
master General, notify the companies that their programmes may cease to be
transmitted.
THE PRESS
493
Ownership
The ‘National’
Press
Provincial
Newspapers
Ownership of the press is varied: it includes individual owners, two or more
partner proprietors, local printing and publishing firms, newspaper companies
owning between one and half a dozen papers, or press groups controlling a
chain of newspapers in different parts of the country. Some newspaper
groups also have interests in groups of periodicals and in independent
television. In 1961, for instance, fourteen newspaper undertakings had
holdings of over five per cent of the voting share capital in a television company:
of these, four owned between 21 and 38 per cent of the voting shares, and
one—now the Thomson Organisation Limited—owned 80 per cent.
Although pronounced views may be expressed in newspapers and their
political leanings may be obvious, they are financially independent of any
political party.
While early newspapers were often family concerns (and some provincial
weeklies still are), with the development of papers for mass readership large
capital sums were needed and ownership began to be transferred to joint
stock companies. Control, however, continued to rest, and still rests more
often than not, with one person or a small group, holding a large proportion
of the voting shares. The largest press groups are: International Publishing
Corporation Limited; Daily Mail and General Trust Limited; Beaverbrook
Newspapers Limited; the Thomson Organisation Limited; and, as regards
provincial newspapers, the Westminster Press Provincial Newspapers
Limited.
The International Publishing Corporation is by far the largest publisher
of periodicals in England and Wales. In Scotland the largest publishers of
magazines are the D. C. Thomson Group.
Certain newspapers and periodicals are controlled by trustees whose aim
is to preserve the character and traditions of the paper and prevent control
from falling into the hands of people who might change the editorial
policy and tradition. Various forms of trust govern the direction of The
Times, The Guardian, The Observer, The Economist, Spectator and New
Statesman.
Ten morning papers published in London, and one [The Guardian) which
is produced in London and Manchester, are ‘national’ in the sense of circu¬
lating throughout the British Isles, and there are eight ‘national’ Sunday
papers (see Table 42). Most papers with big circulations have northern
editions published in Manchester which, after London, is the largest press
centre in England. Certain specialised daily papers published in London have
a circulation limited by interest and not by region, for example, Lloyd's List
and Shipping Gazette and Sporting Life. The leading Scottish papers (The
Scotsman and The Glasgow Herald) and one or two of the provincial daily
papers, for instance, the Yorkshire Post have national reputations. The
two London evening papers each have affiliations with a national daily, but
draw their readership very largely from people living within fifty miles of
London.
The provincial newspapers, numbering over 80 morning or evening daily
and Sunday papers and about 850 weeklies, provide the general and local
news expected by readers whose daily life and interests are known to, and
shared by, the newspaper staff. Only a few reflect a definite political tendency,
most of them considering themselves independent. The total circulation of
the provincial morning and evening papers is about 6| million. Among the
provincial mornings, The Journal (Newcastle), the Yorkshire Post and the
494

Scotland
Northern

Wales
Channel
Islands and
Isle of Man
Northern Echo have circulations of over 100,000; two provincial Sunday
papers—the Sunday Sun (Newcastle) and the Sunday Mercury (Birmingham)
—have circulations of over 200,000; while, among evening papers, the
Liverpool Echo and Evening Express has a circulation of 414,317, the Manchester
Evening News and Chronicle of 323,215 (Monday-Friday) and 547,094
(Saturday edition). Three evenings (Newcastle Evening Chronicle, Yorkshire
Evening Post and Wolverhampton Express and Star) have circulations of over
200,000 and twelve of between 100,000 and 200,000. The provincial news¬
paper, often read far more thoroughly than the national daily, is a valuable
medium for national and local advertising.
There are over 90 London suburban weeklies.
Scotland has six morning, eight evening and two Sunday newspapers,
excluding the Scottish editions of the Daily Express, Daily Mail and Sunday
Express. The leading morning papers are The Glasgow Herald (circulation
84,842) and The Scotsman, published in Edinburgh (circulation 69,992).
Others are: the Daily Record and the Noon Record, published in Glasgow;
the Courier and Advertiser, published in Dundee; and the Press and Journal
of Aberdeen. Evening papers include the Edinburgh Evening News, Glasgow’s
Evening Times and Evening Citizen, Dundee’s Evening Telegraph and Post,
Aberdeen’s Evening Express, the Paisley Daily Express and the Greenock
Telegraph and Clyde Shipping Gazette. The Sunday papers are the Sunday
Mail and the Sunday Post.
Weekly newspapers published in Scotland number over 160. The most
widely known are the Weekly Scotsman and the People's Journal and Weekly
News.
Northern Ireland has two morning papers and one evening paper, all published
in Belfast: they are The News-Letter (Unionist) and the Irish News (Nationalist)
and the evening Belfast Telegraph (Unionist) which has a circulation of
211,960. There are 45 weekly newspapers in Northern Ireland, with circu¬
lations ranging from about 4,000 to 23,000. The majority are published by
individual companies. No Sunday newspapers are published in Northern
Ireland.
One daily morning newspaper, the Western Mail, published in Cardiff, has a
circulation of over 100,000, mainly in southern Wales. In North Wales, the
Liverpool Daily Post gives wide coverage to events in the area. Evening
papers published in Wales are the South Wales Echo, Cardiff, the South
Wales Argus, Newport, and the South Wales Evening Post, Swansea. North
Wales is served by the Liverpool Echo and to a smaller extent by evening
papers published in Manchester, the Manchester Evening News and the
Manchester Evening Chronicle.
The weekly press includes 49 weekly papers in English, many of them
carrying articles in Welsh; 3 bilingual papers; and 11 papers in Welsh, of
which 5 are denominational.
The Channel Islands have one morning paper {Guernsey Star), two evening
papers and two weeklies. The Isle of Man Times is issued from Mondays to
Wednesdays with a special weekly edition which is published on Friday; its
companion paper, the Isle of Man Examiner, is published on Thursday. There
are four other weeklies.
THE PRESS
495
Periodicals
News Agencies
Weekly, monthly and quarterly journals cover an enormous field. Salient
features of the last twenty-five years have been the development, on the one
hand, of periodicals with a mass appeal, particularly those for women and
adolescent girls; and, on the other hand, the growth of the trade and technical
press. There are over 4,000 periodical publications: general magazines with
circulations of up to a million; women’s magazines, some of which have even
larger circulations; numerous publications for children; religious periodicals
for all denominations; fiction magazines; magazines dealing with sport,
gardening and other hobbies, and humour; journals specialising in various
subjects such as politics, finance and economics, science, the professions, and
the arts; trade and technical publications, many of which have circulations
throughout the world; and the publications of learned societies, trade unions,
regiments, universities, colleges, schools, and other associations. There has
also been a large increase in recent years in the number and circulation of
‘house journals’, produced by industrial organisations mainly for their staffs.
The weekly periodicals with the highest sales are: Woman (3,188,617);
Woman's Own (2,331,063); Reveille (1,452,906); Woman's Weekly (1,514,003);
Woman's Realm (1,391,285); Weekend (1,104,936); Woman's Mirror
(1,037,082); together with the Radio Times (5,254,774) and TV Times
(3>679.632)-
The leading weekly journals of opinion are The Economist (circulation
69,933) and the Statist which cover topics of the day from a far wider angle
than their titles would indicate and are politically independent; the New
Statesman (circulation 88,362) which is a review of politics, literature and
the arts with an independent socialist political tendency; the Spectator which
covers much the same subjects from an independent conservative standpoint;
and Tribune which has a strongly left-wing but anti-communist bias. Other
papers whose circulations are in the tens of thousands are the illustrated
weeklies such as the Illustrated London News, the Sphere, the Field, Country
Life, and Punch, traditionally the leading humour periodical. All these
weeklies are widely read in libraries, clubs and other institutions.
Monthly and quarterly journals, particularly the literary and political
journals and those specialising in international and Commonwealth affairs,
generally speaking appeal to the more serious type of reader.
In addition to the circulation of periodicals published in England, Wales
has its own farming weekly, the Welsh Farm News, and several monthly and
quarterly journals, published both in Welsh and English.
Four monthly illustrated periodicals are published in Scotland: Scottish
Field, Scotland's Magazine, the Scots Magazine and Scotland’, and two
weeklies devoted to farming interests, Farming News and the Scottish Farmer.
Among literary journals, probably the most famous is Blackwood's, published
in Edinburgh. Numerous popular magazines are also published in Scotland.
In Northern Ireland, weekly, monthly and quarterly publications cover
farming, the linen industry, building, motoring and politics.
There are three principal British news agencies:
Reuters Ltd. which is a world news agency owned by the newspapers of
the United Kingdom, Australia and New Zealand and operated by them on
a non-profit-making basis under the terms of a deed of trust which guarantees
the independence and integrity of the news service and ensures that all profits
are used to develop it. Founded in London in 1850, Reuters has offices in
many countries and maintains several hundred correspondents throughout

the world, supplying a continuous report of foreign news to the London
newsroom. This is then distributed to the national newspapers, to the radio
and television news services and, through an extensive private network of
communications, to news media in almost every part of the world.
Press Association Ltd. which is owned collectively by British provincial
newspapers. The Association distributes home news within the British Isles,
supplies the same home news to Reuters and its associated agencies for
distribution abroad and distributes to newspapers of the British Isles outside
London the overseas news of Reuters and the Associated Press. All profits
are used to develop the service.
Exchange Telegraph Company Ltd. (Extel), which distributes mainly home
news to the national and provincial Press, broadcasting organisations, overseas
news agencies, and private subscribers.
Two other agencies supply a general service of overseas news:
Associated Press, which is a branch of the Associated Press of America.
British United Press, which is a Canadian subsidiary of United Press
International, an American agency.
A number of other United Kingdom, Commonwealth and foreign agencies
and news services have offices in London, and there are agencies in other
cities, specialising in various aspects of newspaper and periodical requirements.
Syndication of features is not as common in the United Kingdom as in some
countries, but a few agencies specialise in this type of work.
There is no preparatory training for a career in journalism, but all new
entrants to provincial newspapers in the United Kingdom (and most national
newspaper reporters start work in the provinces and go to London after
gaining experience) take part in a training and education scheme administered
by the National Council for the Training of Journalists, which represents all
the principal press organisations. The scheme, which is based on training in
newspaper offices, and local colleges of further education, consists of a six-
month probationary period, followed by three years of basic training and a
proficiency test. A National Diploma Course of eighteen months may be
undertaken later. University graduates may be recruited for some of the
specialised posts in journalism (for instance, as correspondents abroad or on
special subjects) but their numbers are comparatively small.
Under the Commonwealth Press Union travelling fellowship scheme for
the training and education of young journalists throughout the Common¬
wealth, each year about ten journalists from overseas spend six months in
the United Kingdom: two or three months in the offices of newspapers or
periodicals and the remaining time acquiring a general idea of life in Britain.
Both employers and employees in the industry are well organised. On the
employers’ side the most important organisations are the Newspaper
Proprietors Association, whose members are proprietors of London (national)
daily and Sunday newspapers; the Newspaper Society, whose members are
proprietors of provincial daily and weekly newspapers in England and
Wales; the Scottish Daily Newspaper Society which represents the interests
of daily and Sunday newspapers in Scotland; the Scottish Newspaper
Proprietors’ Association which represents the owners of weekly newspapers
in Scotland; the Belfast Newspaper Society whose members are the
proprietors of Northern Ireland’s daily newspapers; Associated Northern
THE PRESS

Ireland Newspapers, whose members are the proprietors of weekly news¬
papers in Northern Ireland; and the Periodical Proprietors’ Association,
whose membership embraces the independent publishers of trade and
technical publications and general magazines. On the employees’ side there
are the Institute of Journalists (loj), founded in 1884 as the National Associa¬
tion of Journalists; and the National Union of Journalists (NUJ), founded in
1907. The National Union of Journalists has a membership of over 17,000
(June 1963) working journalists and is the largest trade union confined to
journalists in the world; editors who have powers of dismissal are excluded
from full membership but may be associate members. The Institute of
Journalists, as it admits all qualified journalists on equal terms of membership,
may claim to be representative of the profession as a whole. Free-lance
journalists (who are not on the staff of any one paper or group of papers, but
send contributions to any journal) may belong to the NUJ or loj. The aims
of these organisations are the improvement of the economic status of journal¬
ists, the promotion of their professional welfare, and the safeguarding of the
status of the press and its editorial staffs.
The main aims of the Guild of British Newspaper Editors are to sustain
the dignity of editorship, to raise and safeguard the professional status of
editors, to protect the rights and freedom of the press, and to improve the
education and training of journalists: the guild has about 320 members. The
British Association of Industrial Editors is the professional organisation to
which most editors of house journals belong.
The Printing and Kindred Trades Federation is made up of trade unions
linked with the production of newspapers. The principal craft unions are
the National Graphical Association and the Scottish Typographical Associa¬
tion, which organise such workers as compositors and machine minders.
The National Society of Operative Printers and Assistants (NATSOPA) has
a varied membership (850 categories), which includes machine room assistants,
clerical and administrative staff, and general assistants in printing works.
Following the recommendations of the 1947-49 Royal Commission on the
Press, a Press Council representative of the press organisations was set up in
1953 and in 1963 (after the further recommendations of the second Royal
Commission) was reconstituted, with a 20 per cent lay membership (to
represent the general public) and a lay chairman, with additional funds, and
an enlarged scope of endeavour. Its aims are: to preserve the established
freedom of the British press; to maintain the character of the British press in
accordance with the highest professional and commercial standards; to keep
under review any developments likely to restrict the supply of information of
public interest and importance; to deal with complaints about the conduct of
the press or the conduct of persons and organisations towards the press; to
report on developments in the British press which may tend towards greater
concentration or monopoly; to make representations on appropriate occasions
to the Government, to organs of the United Nations and to press organisations
abroad; to publish periodical reports recording its work and to review from
time to time developments in the British press and the factors affecting them.
Reports are published annually.
The press in Britain has the same freedom as the individual to do and say
what it likes provided it does not transgress the law and, in general, is at
liberty to comment on matters of public interest. Apart from enactments
relating directly to such matters as the registration of newspapers, there are
498
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
no laws applying to the press in particular and not to the general public;
but requirements which affect journalists and the press occur in a variety
of Acts of Parliament. For example, the Public Bodies (Admissions to Meet¬
ings) Act, i960, and other Local Government Acts govern the admission of
the press (and the public) to meetings of local councils; and restrictions on
the reporting of domestic proceedings and proceedings concerning juveniles
are imposed by legislation governing procedure in the law courts. The press
must comply with the copyright laws and with the laws against the publication
of matters covered by the Official Secrets Acts, with the laws of seditious
libel, blasphemous and obscene libel, and defamation, with the laws for the
protection of children from publications which might do them moral harm, and
with the laws against fraudulent advertising, against breach of parliamentary
privilege, and against ‘contempt of court’—for example, the publication of
anything affecting a case before the courts which might tend to influence the
result of the trial, or of comment on court proceedings which might tend to
prejudice their reputation for fairness.
Legal proceedings against the press are comparatively infrequent; the
majority of actions that do take place are libel actions brought by private
individuals seeking to protect their own interests. In such cases, the editor,
proprietor, publisher, printer and distributor of the newspaper, as well as
the author of the article, may all be held responsible.

SPORT
499
In Britain, the word ‘sport’ is used generally to describe such activities as
organised outdoor games, athletics, field or country sports, indoor games,
aquatic sports, and such popular pursuits as horse-racing, dog-racing, show-
jumping, riding, boxing, rock climbing, motor racing, cycling and rifle
shooting as well as those (for instance, archery, fencing, gliding and ice-skating)
which, although less popular judged by the number of participants and
spectators, all have their own devotees. Those who engage in sport may be
professionals (i.e. paid players) or amateurs.1 Professionals keep up the technical
standards of the sports in which they take part and spectators make a vital
contribution by their enthusiasm and their financial support; but the sporting
life of Britain derives its character principally from the amateur element—
people who devote time and energy to organising sport and to teaching and
training, as well as the many thousands of all ages who engage in sport for
pleasure alone.
The Government is not directly concerned with the organisation or promotion
of sport, but the Minister of Education and the Secretary of State for
Scotland, and the Minister of Education for Northern Ireland have power
to pay grants to local authorities and voluntary bodies towards approved
expenditure on the provision of playing fields, swimming baths and other
facilities for physical recreation, and (in Great Britain) to national voluntary
organisations for headquarters administration, including the cost of coaching
schemes. In Great Britain, the Minister of Housing and Local Government
is also concerned with the provision of facilities for sport, in that it is the
department responsible for the use of land. The Lord President of the
Council ensures that there is co-ordination between the various ministers
concerned with sport in Great Britain and between the ministers and local
authorities.
In Great Britain public capital expenditure on sport and general amenities,
not including schools and other educational institutions, rose from .£5-6
million in 1960-61 to £14-2 million in 1962-63. During the same period,
capital expenditure by public bodies exclusively for sporting activities rose
from £5-8 million to £8-8 million, and is expected to rise to over £11 million
in 1963-64. Annual grants to voluntary bodies amounted to £288,000 in
1962-63; the estimate for 1963-64 is £373,000. By 1965-66, an extra £1 million
is to be made available towards the construction of sports facilities by voluntary
bodies, bringing the total grant aid for this purpose to £ij million. At the
same time the grant aid to voluntary bodies is to be increased in England
from its present level of 33^ per cent of the cost of an approved scheme to the
Scottish figure of 50 per cent; the maximum grant will normally be £10,000.
Grants to national voluntary organisations for administrative purposes are
to be increased from £375,000 in 1963-64 to £625,000 in 1965-66.
1 Some sports, for example, athletics, Rugby Union football, hockey and rowing, are
entirely amateur, but in other sports the distinction between professional and amateur
status is becoming less strictly defined.

The Ministry of Education, the Secretary of State for Scotland and the
Minister of Education for Northern Ireland require that all schools receiving
financial assistance from public funds shall provide for the physical education
(gymnastics, games, athletics, dancing and swimming) of their pupils. Schools
in the national systems (excepting those solely for infants) must have their
own playing field, or the use of one, and most secondary schools have a
gymnasium. Facilities for, and instruction in, many kinds of sport are also
provided at the independent preparatory and public schools and at the
universities (some of which have departments of physical education). Local
authorities are empowered under the Public Health Acts and the Physical
Training and Recreation Acts to provide playing fields. They also provide
gymnasia, tennis courts, golf courses and swimming baths, on a varying
scale. Increasing provision of sports facilities for employees is being made
by industry and commerce.
The national organisations most closely concerned with the development of
sport are the Central Council of Physical Recreation, the Scottish Council
of Physical Recreation, and the National Playing Fields Association. The
British Olympic Association, whose main functions are connected with the
participation of British teams and competitors in the Olympic Games, is also
interested in all matters likely to benefit sport or physical recreation in
Britain as a whole.
The Central Council of Physical Recreation (CCPR), formed in 1935, is a
voluntary association of all national bodies in England, Wales and Northern
Ireland concerned with the development of post-school physical recreation. Its
funds are partly raised by voluntary contributions but it receives a grant from the
Ministry of Education, with which it is closely associated in much of its work.
The CCPR is composed of representatives of the British Olympic Associa¬
tion, the National Playing Fields Association, the governing bodies of 41
sports, 16 national outdoor activity associations, 16 bodies concerned with
dancing and rhythmic movement, and 34 voluntary youth organisations, in
addition to representatives of community centres, educational, physical
education and health education organisations, local authorities and the
Services’ sports branches. Its headquarters are in London and it has nine
regional offices in other parts of England. Its activities in Wales are controlled
by a representative Welsh committee, and in Northern Ireland by a separate
section with its own executive committee.
Broadly, the function of the CCPR is to promote all forms of physical
recreation. Its activities include the organisation of some 2,400 courses for
coaches and instructors, courses in personal performance, lectures, displays
and other publicity events which are attended, on average, by about 52,000
young men and women each year. Its staff give advisory, technical and
administrative help wherever required, but particularly to the headquarters,
regional, county and local branches of the constituent organisations and to
local education authorities and industrial concerns.
The Scottish Council of Physical Recreation (SCPR) was formed as a fully
autonomous body in 1953. It is the counterpart in Scotland of the CCPR, and
has 118 affiliated organisations, including the governing bodies of all the Scottish
sports; it receives a grant-in-aid from the Scottish Education Department.
The main aim of the National Playing Fields Association (NPFA), founded
in 1925, is to stimulate the provision of playing fields and playgrounds,
especially for children, by publicity and financial assistance. Since its inception

it has distributed some million in the form of grants for playing field
and playground schemes and about £90,000 in the form of loans. It assists
more than 400 schemes a year.
The NPFA council is composed of representatives of the governing bodies
of 16 sports, and of other sports bodies, of the British Olympic Association
and the CCPR, and of a number of educational bodies, voluntary youth
organisations, physical education associations and local authorities. The
national headquarters in London employs a small full-time staff, including a
technical and research department which gives advice on all aspects of
playing field provision, design and maintenance. It also advises on matters
relating to children’s playgrounds, play leadership schemes, and the play and
recreational needs of children from their earliest years.
The NPFA works in close co-operation with the Ministry of Education,
the Ministry of Housing and Local Government and local authorities; it
derives its funds mainly from voluntary contributions but has recently been
in receipt of a small contribution towards administrative costs from the
Ministry of Education and the Ministry of Education for Northern Ireland.
The NPFA has branches in Scotland and Northern Ireland; there are also
branches in nearly every English and Welsh county; administration is
carried out, in the main, on a voluntary basis, in many cases in association
with a county Rural Community Council.
There are five National Recreation Centres in Britain—two in England, one
in Wales and two in Scotland—administered by the CCPR and the SCPR.
The purpose of the centres, all but one of which were established by voluntary
funds, is to provide residential facilities for leadership and personal perform¬
ance training in a wide range of games, sports and outdoor activities.
A further National Recreation Centre, built by the London County
Council at a cost of over £2 million on a 36-acre site at Crystal Palace, will
open in 1964. This centre will include a stadium with seating for 12,000
spectators; a sports hall in which there will be a large gymnasium divisible
into three, with seating for 1,320 spectators, and a swimming hall with
racing and diving pools of Olympic dimensions, a teaching pool and a gallery
for 1,750 spectators; practice rooms for cricket and lawn tennis; a lecture
theatre, two first-aid rooms and six changing rooms; a hostel for 140 residents;
and staff housing. The centre will be administered by the CCPR; its main
purpose will be training, but it is also designed for international competitions.
Outdoor games played in Britain include team games such as football,
cricket, and hockey, and games such as lawn tennis and golf, in which
individuals or couples match their skill. Judged by the number of participants
and spectators, the most popular of the team games are football and cricket,
and the most popular of the individual games is lawn tennis.
Although football of a kind was played in the Middle Ages or even earlier,
as an organised game it dates from just over a century ago. One type of
football, in which only the feet are used, was adopted at Cambridge in 1855;
the other type, in which the ball is handled as well as kicked, was first played
at Rugby School, whence it derives its name, and was adopted by the Black-
heath football club in 1859.
In England the controlling body of the non-handling game, Association
Football (colloquially known as ‘soccer’), is the Football Association (FA),
which was formed in 1863. Its chief function is to promote the interests of
the game and to prevent infringement of the agreed rules; it also arranges
502
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
for the instruction of promising young players (some ,£10,000 is spent
annually on coaching); organises various matches and competitions, including
the international matches played by England, the Amateur Cup competition,
two national youth competitions, and the competition for its own leading
trophy, the Football Association Challenge Cup; and chooses and manages
English international teams. Over 350 clubs are registered with the FA, more
than 200 as full members and between 130 and 140 as associate members.
There are also some 25,000 clubs affiliated to county fi.e. district or regional)
associations. The FA derives its main income from subscriptions and ad¬
mission charges to international and cup matches, and ploughs back a large
portion of the money into the game. Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales
have their own controlling bodies: the Scottish Football Association, the
Irish Football Association and the Football Association of Wales.
The principal professional matches in England and Wales (played once or
twice weekly) are controlled by the Football League, which comprises over
90 professional clubs in these countries. The funds of the League are derived
largely from contributions paid by member clubs in the form of a levy of
4 per cent of the net gate receipts from league matches, after allowable
expenses have been deducted, and from annual payments (approximately
,£250,000 of which some £80,000 is passed to the Scottish League) from the
leading football pools promoters for the use of league fixture lists.
In Scotland the Scottish Football League is in charge of the weekly games;
Northern Ireland has its own league. Clubs belonging to the English and
Scottish Leagues are organised in divisions, the members of which compete
against one another for the respective league championships. Their positions
in the divisional tables are decided at the end of the season by the number
of points gained for wins or draws. In the season 1962-63 a total of over
28 million people watched league football matches and the gate receipts in
all amounted to just over £5 million.
Several million people stake small weekly sums on the results of the league
matches by filling in what are known as ‘pools’ coupons. The odds against
winning anything in the pools are very great, but the prizes are high and
individual payments of £300,000 may occasionally be made. The promoters
of the pools deduct varying amounts from the stakes for commission and
expenses.
The annual competition for the FA Cup is organised on a knock-out basis
and the Cup Final is one of the most important football matches of the year
in England; it is always played at Wembley Stadium, near London, which
can accommodate some 100,000 spectators. The Scottish Cup Final is played
at Hampden Park, Glasgow. The international matches between England,
Scotland, Wales and Ireland also excite great interest, as do the matches
between British teams and teams from European and South American
countries.
There are many more amateur association football players than there are
professionals (the comparative figures are about 650,000 amateurs, including
schoolboys and members of the armed forces, to 7,000 or 8,000 professionals),
but with one or two notable exceptions their teams cannot compete on equal
terms, since professional teams are more systematically and intensively
trained. Amateur teams compete against each other for the Football Associa¬
tion Amateur Challenge Cup.
Rugby football, or ‘rugger’, is played under the auspices of the Rugby
Football Union, established in 1871. The rules of the game are completely
different from those that govern soccer, and there are 15 players, instead of 11,

in a side. International matches between England, Scotland, Wales, Ireland,
and France are played regularly at the leading rugby football grounds of each
country, including Twickenham, London—the headquarters of the Rugby
Football Union—and there are tours by international teams to and from
New Zealand, Australia and South Africa. Other important rugger matches
are the county championship competitions, the annual match between the
universities of Oxford and Cambridge, the Hospitals’ Cup final, and the
Inter-Services tournament.
Seven-a-side football (a variant of Rugby football) is also played by clubs
and schools to a limited extent. Membership of the Rugby Union is strictly
confined to amateur clubs. In the north of England Rugby League Football
is played. This is a thirteen-a-side game played by professionals as well as
amateurs. The Rugby Football League (instituted in 1895) regularly sends
touring teams to Australia and New Zealand and has annual international
games, professional and amateur, against France. The major match of the
season—the Rugby League Challenge Cup Final—has attracted crowds of
95,000 at Wembley Stadium in recent years.
Cricket is often called the English national game. The exact date of its origin
is not recorded, but it is known that the game was played by the boys of
Guildford Grammar School during the sixteenth century, and by the begin¬
ning of the eighteenth century it had gained greatly in popularity both in
the villages of England and on the larger country estates. The game has
been played more or less as it is played today since the adoption of a generally
accepted set of laws in 1744. About 1750 a cricket club was formed in the
little Hampshire village of Hambledon; within 20 years it had made an
outstanding name for itself and acquired a membership representative of
patrons of cricket from all over England. In 1787 the Marylebone Cricket
Club (MCC), now the governing body of cricket, was founded, with its
headquarters in London on a site rented by a Yorkshireman called Thomas
Lord. In the year 1810-n the MCC moved its headquarters to a ground
near Regent’s Park, keeping the name Lord's', four years later Lord's trans¬
ferred to another ground, at St. John’s Wood, in the same neighbourhood,
where it has remained ever since.
Following the establishment of the MCC, the laws of cricket became
stabilised; other clubs that sprang up all over England during the nineteenth
century recognised its authority, and nowadays all cricket is played according
to the ‘laws of cricket’ as laid down by the MCC in consultation with cricketing
organisations in Britain and the overseas Commonwealth.
In England cricket is played in schools and universities, and almost all
towns and villages have their cricket teams which play at least one match a
week during the season—roughly May to September; in the London area
nearly 400 pitches are provided by the county council, besides many leased
or owned by clubs.
Apart from the university match between Oxford and Cambridge and
certain representative games, the greater part of first-class cricket is played
in a county championship between seventeen ‘first-class counties’. (The
other counties have a ‘minor counties championship’ of their own.) Famous
grounds besides Lord's are the Oval, Kennington, London, headquarters of
the Surrey Cricket Club; Old Trafford, Manchester; Headingley, Leeds; and
Trent Bridge, Nottingham.
In the late nineteenth century more amateurs played cricket than economic
conditions in the twentieth century allow: with first-class matches lasting

three days and each county playing up to thirty matches in a season, the
number of cricketers who can afford to play as true amateurs has declined
to such a degree that the distinction between amateur and professional in
the first-class game has now been abolished. League cricket, which is a
feature of the game in the north of England, is played by teams mainly con¬
sisting of amateur Saturday afternoon players with one or more professionals,
many of whom are distinguished players from other Commonwealth countries.
The MCC is an entirely amateur body, although retired professional cricketers
of ‘the highest merit’ are elected to honorary membership.
In addition to county championships, matches known as ‘test matches’
are played regularly between a number of Commonwealth countries. The first
of these matches was played at Melbourne, Australia, in 1877* between
England and Australia. Present-day test matches last 30 hours (spread over
five or six days); they arouse great popular interest and are widely reported
in the press and on radio and television.
Variants of hockey (as distinct from ice-hockey) have been played in Britain
for at least five centuries. Modern hockey, however, dates from the formation
(in 1886) of the Hockey Association, which standardised the rules relating
to men’s hockey. Nowadays there are some 1,100 hockey clubs affiliated to
the Hockey Association. Although there are no professional county teams and
no cup ties, a county championship was instituted in I9571 ^ addition,
regular amateur international matches (inaugurated in 1894) are played.
There are over 35,000 adult and some 50,000 schoolboy hockey placers
in Britain.
In Britain hockey is more commonly played by women than by men. The
controlling bodies are: the All England Women’s Hockey Association
(founded 1895) to which are affiliated the Irish Ladies Hockey Union, the
Scottish Women’s Hockey Association, the Welsh Women’s Hockey Associa¬
tion, some 1,900 girls’ schools and about 900 clubs. The first international
women’s hockey match took place in 1896. Nowadays such a match is played
annually at Wembley Stadium and attracts some 56,000 spectators.
Lacrosse, adapted from the game played by the Iroquois Indians of North
America, is played mainly by women—in girls’ schools, at lacrosse clubs, and
at universities. International matches are played, as well as regional matches,
by women’s teams representing the East, West, South, North and Midlands
of England, under the auspices of the All England Ladies Lacrosse Association.
The men’s game, of which the controlling body is the English Lacrosse
Union, is played in seven universities, and by clubs and schools, mainly in
and around London and Manchester. County matches are played and there
is an annual fixture between the North of England and the South.
Netball is a popular game for girls and women. The controlling body is the
All England Netball Association to which are affiliated the English county
associations, the netball clubs of the three Women s Services and sections of
the national youth organisations for girls and women. Inter-county and home
international matches are played regularly and inter-Commonwealth tours
are arranged.
Polo, of which the earliest records are Persian, was first played by the British
in India, and brought to England in 1869. The governing body of British
polo is the Hurlingham Polo Association to which all the Commonwealth
polo associations and that of South Africa are affiliated. Polo players are a
very small section of the community, for the cost of keeping polo ponies is
high. However, many of the clubs now own trained ponies which are hired

out to members at moderate cost. There are about 300 players handicapped
by the Hurlingham Polo Association, but many novices and less expert
players take part in club games for which they may be locally handicapped.
Public interest in polo has increased in recent years and large numbers of
spectators attend inter-club tournaments and matches between high-handicap
teams composed of players from several countries.
A form of tennis has been played out of doors from the earliest times; but
modern lawn tennis dates from about 1873, when it began to take its place
with cricket as one of the British national summer games. In 1877 the wTords
‘and lawn tennis’ were added to the title of the All England Croquet Club
at Wimbledon, near London, and in the same year the first championships
were played; the Lawn Tennis Association, the controlling body of the game
in Britain, was founded in 1888. The governing body of the game in the
world is the International Lawn Tennis Federation (founded in 1913), with
headquarters in London and Paris.
The number of people who play lawn tennis has greatly increased during
the present century, particularly since the game has spread to practically
every country in the world. In Britain the game is played in almost all girls’
schools and in very many boys’ schools where the pupils are of secondarv
school age. It is also played on private courts, in parks and recreation grounds
and at several thousand tennis clubs.
The annual championships held at Wimbledon for two weeks at the end
of June and beginning of July are the main event of the lawn tennis season
in Britain and, in fact, in the world. These championships, in which men and
women of many nationalities compete, draw large crowds; there is accom¬
modation for over 30,000 spectators in the grounds of the All England Club
—14,000 can be accommodated round the centre court where the finals are
played. Other tournaments which attract a good deal of attention are: the
British Hardcourt Championships, the British Junior Championships, and
the County Championships. There are also competitions for boys’ and girls’
schools on a national basis, and the Foundation Cup (for women). The most
important international event is the Davis Cup (for men). Women players
from Britain and the United States of America also compete annually for the
Wightman Cup.
Golf originated in Scotland, where for centuries it has borne the title of the
Royal and Ancient Game, but it did not become really well known in the
other countries of the United Kingdom until towards the end of the nine¬
teenth century. Since then, however, it has gained steadily in popularity and
nowadays there are golf courses in the vicinity of many towns and villages—
some owned by local authorities, but the majority owned by golf clubs. The
headquarters of the Royal and Ancient Golf Club is St. Andrews, Scotland.
The main event of the golfing year is the British Open Golf Championship,
which was first played in i860; other important matches include the Walker
Cup (for amateurs) and the Ryder Cup (for professionals), both played
between Britain and America; the Amateur Championship; and the Ladies
Championship.
The game of bowls has been played in Britain since the thirteenth century.
Nowadays the flat green game is regulated, as far as the English Bowling
Association is concerned, by the International Bowling Board (IBB), founded
in 1905. The Bowling Associations of Ireland, Scotland and Wales also come
under and play to the laws as laid down by the IBB, but there are other
bowling associations in England—the English Bowling Federation, the Crown
5°6
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Athletics
Highlatid Games
Green Association and the English Women’s Bowling Association—which are
not under the IBB’s control.
During the summer bowls is played on bowling greens in the open; in
winter it is played on indoor greens, which are increasing in number. At one
time regarded as a pastime for the elderly, the game is now played by people
of all ages. Over 2,550 bowling clubs in 34 counties of England are affiliated
to the English Bowling Association alone, and international and inter-county
matches are played.
Amateur athletics, which include running (track, road and cross-country),
relay racing, jumping, hurdling, throwing and race-walking, are governed by
the Amateur Athletic Association (AAA), which was founded in 1880 to
encourage, promote and control amateur athletics, to improve the management
of amateur athletic meetings by the establishment of uniform regulations,
and to promote annual championship meetings. The association, whose
membership increased rapidly from small beginnings, is now organised from
club to national level by honorary officers and managed by representative
members appointed by the Northern, Midland, Southern and Welsh areas
and by affiliated clubs and associations (amateur athletic clubs, schools and
youth organisations), of which there are hundreds throughout England and
Wales. The AAA administers a coaching scheme, with a constant expenditure
of nearly £15,000 a year, under which six full-time national coaches, working
mainly in separate regions, lecture, demonstrate and coach in schools, youth
clubs, evening institutes, training colleges and universities and at special
courses organised by the national associations, by regional associations or by
the Central Council of Physical Recreation. Some of the work of the national
coaches is directly concerned with coaching young athletes but their main
duties are to instruct men who wish to qualify by examination as honorary
coaches; some 2,000 qualified honorary coaches give voluntary services in
the counties and districts of England and Wales. Scotland and Northern
Ireland have their own amateur athletic associations, with similar functions;
there are also separate Women’s AAAs for each country.
International athletics and the selection of teams representing the United
Kingdom are dealt with by the British Amateur Athletic Board, which is
composed of representatives of the three national associations for men and
of the Women’s Council, and is affiliated to the International Amateur
Athletic Federation.
Track meetings of athletics are held throughout Britain from April to
October. The main events in England and Wales are: the AAA champion¬
ships for men and international matches held at the White City, London;
area and county championships; and the universities, Services, business
houses and schools championship meetings. Clubs usually compete in cross¬
country running from October to March, and international, county and area
cross-country championships are held.
Teams representing Britain compete in the Olympic Games (held every
four years), and separate teams representing England, Wales, Scotland, and
Northern Ireland compete in the Commonwealth Games, held at four-yearly
intervals between the Olympic Games.
The Highland games are traditional gatherings of local people in the High¬
lands of Scotland, at which sports (including tossing the caber, putting the
weight, and throwing the hammer) and dancing and piping competitions
take place. Among the better known Highland games are the Northern

Country Sports

Meeting at Inverness, the Braemar Gathering on Deeside (traditionally
attended by the royal family), the Argyllshire Gathering at Oban, and the
meeting at Aboyne. The Highland games attract large numbers of spectators
from all over the world.
The most popular country sports are hunting, shooting and fishing; these are
old-established sports with a long history, and they still play a considerable
part in the life of the countryside. The organisation which looks after their
interests is the British Field Sports Society.
In Britain hunting means primarily fox hunting on horseback with a pack of
hounds especially bred for the purpose; but it also includes stag hunting,
which preceded fox hunting and still goes on, mainly in Devon and Somerset;
hunting the hare, either on foot with beagles or with harriers when the
followers are mounted; and otter hunting along the banks of rivers. Hunting
depends not on right but on permit: most landowners and farmers allow
followers of recognised hunts to cross their property.
Fox hunting originated some 200 years ago. Originally a sport mainly for
the landed gentry and local farmers, it has gradually widened its appeal, in
spite of the fact that it is an expensive pastime for those who ride to hounds.
The sport is not without its critics, but a large number of people, including
many townsmen, take a keen interest in it and follow the hunt in cars, on
bicycles or on foot. The fox hunting season proper starts in early November
and lasts until April; it is preceded by cub hunting, i.e. the hunting of young
foxes, when young hounds are trained. At the end of the season most hunts
organise steeplechases, known as point-to-points, which are patronised by
large crowds.
There are between 190 and 200 packs of hounds in England and Wales,
13 in Northern Ireland, and 10 in-Scotland. The packs range in size from
the large establishments in the ‘shires’, i.e. the Midlands of England (for
instance, the Belvoir, the Cottesmore, the Quorn, and the Fernie) where
mounted followers may be two hundred or more, to small kennels in the
west and north, where hunting is sometimes on foot.
Hunts are financed mainly by the subscriptions of their members and with
the aid of the farmers, whose support enables fox hunting to continue to
flourish; sometimes however, the Master of Fox-hounds (MFH), who is in
charge of the hunt, must bear a proportion of the cost.
Game shooting as an organised country sport may be said to date from the
early part of the nineteenth century; nowadays, game consists mainly of
grouse, partridge, pheasant, snipe and woodcock.
There is virtually no free shooting in any part of the United Kingdom. In
the first place, a gun licence or a game licence must be applied for and pur¬
chased annually and secondly, nearly all game birds are to be found on
privately owned land, shot over either by the owner and his friends or by
syndicates which have leased the shooting. However, in some parts of the
more remote countryside, rough shooting may be enjoyed in a less formal
way. Much of the country’s wildfowling is controlled by the Wildfowling
Association of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, through its numerous
clubs.
Grouse, partridge, pheasant and certain other birds are ‘preserved’; that
is to say, there is a ‘close season’ during which they are protected by law and
allowed to breed in security, often under the care of privately employed
gamekeepers on numerous estates. The grouse, partridge and pheasant
508

seasons open on 12th August, ist September and ist October, severally, and
last for between four and five months. Grouse shooting takes place mostly
in Scotland, northern England and North Wales, where the main grouse
moors are to be found; partridge and pheasant shooting in nearly every
county in England, Wales and Scotland, the former mainly over farm land,
and the latter in or near woodland; and wildfowling on the marshes and
fenlands of the coastal areas.
The Game Research Association, founded in i960 by a group of landowners,
farmers and others interested in game conservation to take over part of the
work on game research previously carried out by Imperial Chemical Industries,
collects and collates information on a national scale and makes a detailed
study of factors controlling game population, including diseases to which
game birds are subject, game ecology and density, survival rates and move¬
ments of game in changing environments.
Deer stalking, which derives its name from the fact that, in order to get
an effective shot, a very cautious approach is needed (since red deer have a
keen scent, are far-sighted, and take alarm at the slightest sound), is mainly
a sport of the Highlands of Scotland. The deer are preserved on privately
owned tracts of land known as ‘deer forests’, ranging in size from 9,000 to
over 30,000 acres. The statutory closed seasons are October to June, inclusive,
for stags and February to October, inclusive, for hinds.
Fishing is the most popular of the country sports in that it is within the reach
of everyone in some form or another (from the small boy with his hook and
line to the experienced fly-fisherman), and that many more people fish in
their leisure hours than hunt or shoot.
The outstanding forms of the sport in Britain are salmon and trout fishing.
Trout streams are to be found in most parts of the country, and in Scotland
there are also many hundreds of lochs which provide good sport. Salmon
fishing may be enjoyed on many rivers in England, North Wales and Northern
Ireland, but the best salmon rivers are to be found in Scotland. In England
and Wales the most widely practised form of fishing is for coarse fish (e.g.,
pike, perch, carp, roach, dace, tench, chub and bream), and the National
Federation of Anglers (NFA) has some 390,000 members. Match angling—
competitive fishing for coarse fish by weight—is a feature of the many angling
clubs affiliated to the NFA, particularly in the midlands and north of England;
a national angling championship, composed of no teams of 12 anglers, is
organised annually by the NFA; and the NFA enters a team in the Inter¬
national Angling Competition.
Fishing around the coasts is another popular pastime, while deep-sea
fishing for tuna and shark has gained many adherents during the past fifteen
years.
Coastal and deep-sea fishing is free to all (except for salmon and sea trout
fishing in Scotland) but, as a rule, freshwater fishing has to be paid for and
local inquiries made about any permit or licence required. Most coarse
fishing is let to angling clubs; trout and salmon fishermen either rent a
stretch of river, join a club, stay at an hotel with its own fishing rights, or
pay for the right to fish by the day, week or month. The cost of salmon
fishing is often high.
Aquatic sports include rowing, sailing, swimming, canoeing, punting and
water ski-ing. The first three are the most commonly practised in Britain
and are included in the Olympic events and the Commonwealth Games.
SPORT
509
Rowing
Sailing
Rowing as a pastime is enjoyed by people from all sections of the community,
and as a sport it arouses considerable public interest. The two most popular
annual rowing events are the University Boat Race, which originated in 1820
and has been rowed annually on the Thames in the early spring since 1836;
and Henley Regatta, founded in 1839, which takes place each July at Henley-
on-Thames in Oxfordshire. The University Boat Race, which provides one
of the sights of London, is between eight-oared crews from Oxford and
Cambridge over a course of some 4J miles between Putney and Mortlake;
it is watched by many thousands of rival supporters gathered on both sides
of the river. Considerable interest is also shown in the Head of the River
Race from Mortlake to Putney, in March, in which between 200 and 300
eights row in procession—the largest assembly of racing craft in the world.
Crews from all over the world compete at Henley Regatta, where various
kinds of races are rowed over a straight course of 1 mile 550 yards; for
instance, for the Grand Challenge Cup, open to eight-oared crews from any
nation, the Silver Goblets for pair oars, the Diamond Sculls for single
scullers, and the Ladies Challenge Plate open to crews from schools and
colleges in the United Kingdom. Many other riverside resorts arrange
regattas every summer.
The oldest annual event in the English racing calendar is Daggett's Coat
and Badge, founded in 1716 and organised since by the Worshipful Company
of Fishmongers. Originally for professional watermen and limited to six
entrants, the race is now open to amateurs (who must, however, still be
apprentice watermen) and, if necessary, it may be rowed in heats. The course
is from London Bridge to Chelsea.
The art of oarsmanship is taught in many schools, universities and rowing
clubs, including women’s rowing clubs, throughout Britain; and women as
well as men compete in the European rowing championships. The Amateur
Rowing Association is the governing body of the sport.
Enthusiasts have always devoted much of their leisure to yachting on the
inland waters and round the coasts of Britain, but during the last fifteen years
the sport, and in particular small boat sailing, has greatly widened its appeal.
Sail numbers registered in the Royal Yachting Association’s small boat
classes in May 1963 were: International Fourteen Foot, 338; National
Flying Fifteens, 361; Eighteen Foot, 176; Hornets, 311; Swordfish, 134;
Albacores, 212; Merlin Rocket, 1,199; Redwings, 158; Enterprise, 3,870;
Solo, 155; Twelve Foot, 1,620; Firefly, 1,958; and there is an even greater
number of still smaller sailing boats not included in the register.
Most British yacht racing is administered by the Royal Yachting Associa¬
tion, subject to the rules of the International Yacht Racing Union, founded
in 1907. The main event of the inshore yachting season is the annual regatta
at Cowes in the Isle of Wight, the headquarters of the Royal Yacht Squadron,
founded in 1812. Other events include the Round the Isle of Wight race and
the races arranged during the special yachting weeks (or fortnights) held at
such sailing centres as Poole in Dorset, Bembridge in the Isle of Wight,
Lowestoft in Suffolk, Harwich and Burnham-on-Crouch in Essex, Plymouth
in Devon, Falmouth in Cornwall, and on the Scottish river Clyde.
Off-shore, or ocean, racing is based on rating and measurement rules
drawn up by the Royal Ocean Racing Club, founded in 1925. Typical courses
are: Cowes to Jersey (Channel Islands), Plymouth to La Rochelle (Charente
Maritime, France) and Harwich to the Hook of Holland.
Many children in Britain learn to swim at school, or during holidays at the

seaside, and swimming as a summer pastime is enjoyed by millions of people.
The existence of indoor swimming baths makes all-the-year swimming
possible, and instruction and coaching is provided in some places by qualified
teachers who hold certificates for elementary or advanced teaching and coach¬
ing awarded by the Amateur Swimming Association (ASA). (The Scottish
counterpart is the Scottish Amateur Swimming Association.) The objects of
the ASA are to promote the art of swimming and encourage its teaching to
schoolchildren; to stimulate public opinion in favour of providing proper
accommodation and facilities for learning to swim; to promote the game of
water polo and the art of diving; and to draw up, publish and enforce uniform
laws for the control and regulation of amateur swimming and water polo
championships and competitions.
Attempts to swim the Channel between various points on the coasts of
France and England—some of which are successful—are made by swimmers
of many nationalities every summer.
Racing is a term which, in Britain, is taken to mean first and foremost,
horse-racing. Other forms of racing include greyhound racing, coursing,
pony-racing, trotting races, and pigeon hying.
The history of the English turf proper began with the formation of the
Jockey Club in 1750, although horse-racing was known in Tudor times and
even earlier. The Jockey Club and the National Hunt Committee (founded
in 1866) now exercise control over all horse-racing in England and indirectly
in many other countries, and their rules are the basis of universal turf
procedure.
There are two forms of racing: flat racing carried on from late March till
November under the authority of the Jockey Club; and steeple-chasing,
conducted under the rules of the National Hunt Committee.
The classic flat races are: the Two Thousand Guineas for colts and fillies,
run on the Newmarket course, owned by the Jockey Club; the One Thousand
Guineas for fillies only, also run at Newmarket; the Derby for colts and
fillies, run at Epsom; the Oaks for fillies only, also run at Epsom; and the
St. Leger for colts and fillies, run at Doncaster. The Derby is the outstanding
event in the racing calendar; it takes place annually in early June and the
scene on Epsom Downs on Derby Day is one of the most colourful and
exciting of the sporting year. The most fashionable race-meeting of the flat
racing season takes place on the course at Ascot in Berkshire. This meeting,
which is held in mid-June, is known as ‘Royal Ascot’ and is traditionally
attended by the Sovereign; it includes the races for the Gold Cup and the
Royal Hunt Cup.
The best known steeple-chase is the Grand National, first run in 1839,
and run annually since then over the Aintree course near Liverpool. The race,
which draws immense crowds and arouses widespread interest (and some
criticism) tests the skill, stamina and courage of both horse and rider to the
utmost. Most steeple-chase meetings are held during the period September
to May, one of the most important being the National Hunt Festival Meeting
at Cheltenham, in Gloucestershire, early in March.
In England and Wales there is racing on 63 racecourses (excluding point-
to-point courses), at which there are approximately 650 days’ racing annually;
Scotland has seven racecourses, where racing takes place on an average of
50 days in the year. There are approximately 7,500 horses in training in
Great Britain, at an average cost of 10 to 11 guineas a week each.

Horse racecourses must be licensed by the Jockey Club or the National
Hunt Committee. On-course facilities for both cash and credit betting are
provided by bookmakers who must have personal permits, and by totalisators
operated by the Horserace Totalisator Board, which is empowered to deduct
from money staked with the totalisator such percentage as it may determine.
The practice is to deduct 15 per cent from the losing stakes in the win, place
and forecast pools and 10 per cent of the double and treble pools; this
provides an average yield of approximately 11 per cent of the total annual
turnover. Facilities for off-the-course betting are provided in licensed betting
offices, of which there are some 11,500 throughout Great Britain. People
under 18 years old are forbidden by law to place bets.
The Horserace Betting Levy Board has been established recently to collect
a levy from both bookmakers and the Horserace Totalisator Board and to
distribute the revenue for purposes conducive to the improvement of horse
breeding and racing and for the advancement and encouragement of veterinary
science and education; it is estimated that in the financial year 1963-64 the
amount available for distribution will be £2-3 million.
The racing of greyhounds after a mechanical hare started in Britain in 1926,
when the first modern greyhound track was opened at Belle Vue, Manchester.
There are now some 140 licensed tracks in operation, nearly all of which are
situated in or on the outskirts of large towns. Racing usually continues
throughout the year (although betting is limited by law to 104 days in any
year), and meetings (which usually consist of eight races) are generally held
two or three times a week. The licensing authorities for greyhound racing
tracks are the county and county borough councils. Some fourteen million
people a year attend the tracks.
The main authority of the sport is the National Greyhound Racing Club,
founded in 1928; its functions include drawing up the rules of greyhound
racing and exercising strict discipline over all aspects of the sport. The
National Greyhound Racing Society—an association of 62 of the leading
tracks—accepts the rules of the National Greyhound Racing Club and
controls the general policies of greyhound racing. Most of the classic grey¬
hound races, including the Derby at the White City, the Laurels at Wimbledon,
the St. Leger at Wembley, and the Cesarewitch at West Ham, take place in
the London area, although many other large centres have their ‘big’ nights.
There is a considerable volume of betting at greyhound race-meetings,
both with bookmakers and on the totalisator which may be operated by the
occupier of any licensed greyhound track on the 104 ‘betting days’. Ten per
cent of the money staked on the totalisators must be paid to the Government;
up to 6 per cent may be deducted for operational expenses before successful
backers are paid. The ‘copyright* in tote odds granted to the Horserace
Totalisator Board in respect of horse-racing also applies to the occupiers of
licensed greyhound tracks on which totalisators are operated.
Interest in the art of horsemanship continues to increase rapidly, and many
more people have learned to enjoy riding as a pastime since the end of the
second world war than at any time since the advent of the motor car. There
are some 1,200 riding schools in Britain, many of a high standard, and about
50 new schools are opened each year; membership of the British Horse
Society has risen to about 12,000; there are some 180 riding clubs with
varied membership; and the Pony Club (open to young people up to the
age of seventeen years) now has an overall membership of about 77,000
5!2

Boxing
members. There are over 900 branches of the Pony Club throughout the world,
of which 250 are attached to hunts in Britain, and the remainder are overseas.
The British Horse Society, as the national equestrian federation of Great
Britain, is the authority on all matters relating to horses and ponies, including
breeding, training, riding, showjumping and dressage, and is responsible for
preparing equestrian teams for the Olympic Games and all international events.
The Society is also the parent body of the Pony Club and the riding clubs,
and organises and provides tests, lectures, demonstrations, courses and
examinations to promote horsemanship and horsemastership.
Horse trials of all kinds are held throughout Britain during the spring and
summer. The three-day trials held each year—in April at Badminton Park,
Gloucestershire, and in September at Burghley House, Lincolnshire—are
among the outstanding equestrian events of the year. These trials include
dressage, cross-country riding, and show jumping; some 25 one-day trials
on similar lines are held annually.
Show jumping competitions are held each year at over 1,000 shows. The
main events take place during the Royal International Horse Show (held at
the White City, London, under the auspices of the British Horse Society
towards the end of July)—the outstanding contest being the individual
jumping championship for the King George V Gold Cup. Jumping competi¬
tions are also a feature of the Horse of the Year Show, which takes place in
October at Wembley and is acknowledged to be one of the finest indoor
horse shows in the world.
In recent years show jumping has attracted vast audiences. Its popularity
may be gauged from the fact that the total membership of the British Show
Jumping Association has risen to over 6,000. The number of horses and
ponies registered is approximately 4,500 and over ^140,000 is distributed
annually in prize money.
The selection of British riders and horses taking part in international
competitions (whose successes have materially contributed to the increased
popularity of show jumping) is the responsibility of the executive committee
of the Association.
Boxing as an English sport probably originated in Saxon times. Its modern
form, and the one that has been adopted in many overseas countries, dates
from 1865 when the Marquess of Queensberry drew up a set of rules which
eliminated much of the brutality that had hitherto characterised prize fighting,
and made the basis of the sport a trial of strength and skill.
Nowadays, many boys learn to box at school and in boys’ clubs, and there
are various amateur boxing competitions carried out according to the rules
of the Amateur Boxing Association (ABA), which controls all amateur
boxing, including schoolboy boxing, club and association boxing, and boxing
in the three Services.
Professional boxing is covered by the British Boxing Board of Control,
founded in 1929. The board has strict medical regulations which provide
for the examination of boxers before each contest, and the appointment of
inspectors to ensure that the regulations are observed and that all contests
are ‘vetted’ to safeguard against over-matching and exploitation.
Championships at fixed weights have been the rule in boxing contests
since the presentation of the Championship Challenge Belts by the late
Lord Lonsdale in 1909. Competitions organised by the ABA are decided at
ten weights: flyweight, bantamweight, featherwreight, lightweight, light welter-

weight, welterweight, light middleweight, middleweight, light heavyweight
and heavyweight. In professional boxing there are no light welterweight
or light middleweight classes.
Fencing, as a sport, has made considerable progress throughout Britain during
the past 20 years. The Amateur Fencing Association (founded 1902) has some
450 clubs, and many classes are organised and financed by local authorities.
Fencing is now practised in schools of all kinds and among the annual
championships held under the auspices of the Association are the National
Schoolboys’ Championships, organised on a regional basis and attracting a
large number of entrants.
Wrestling is one of the oldest sports in the world. Nowadays the style most
commonly used in Britain is the ‘free’ style, which evolved from the Catch-
as-Catch-Can or Lancashire style, but Cumberland and Westmorland
wrestling is still practised in the north of England and in Scotland, and Cornish
style wrestling (in which the contestants wear rough canvas jackets by which
all the holds must be taken) takes place in Cornwall. Wrestling in the free
and Graeco-Roman styles are used at the Olympic Games; in the Common¬
wealth Games only free style is wrestled.
Amateur wrestling in Britain is governed by the British Amateur Wrestling
Association, which is affiliated to the International Amateur Wrestling
Federation, under the rules of which all wrestling is conducted. Professional
wrestling is usually in the ‘all-in’ or ‘free’ style, which is not the same as the
free style used in amateur wrestling. Judo, a Japanese form of wrestling, has
a large following, and is governed by the British Judo Association which has
coaching schemes assisted by the Ministry of Education.
The popularity of mountaineering has greatly increased in recent years. The
number of clubs in the British Mountaineering Council and the Association
of Scottish Climbing Clubs, the representative bodies of the sport, has
doubled to over 140 in the last six years, mainly by the addition of smaller
town and district clubs to the older larger clubs such as the Alpine Club
(founded in 1857, the oldest mountaineering club in the world), the Climbers’
Club, the Scottish Mountaineering Club and the Fell and Rock Climbing
Club. A number of local education authorities, as well as national bodies
such as the YMCA, the Scouts and the Central Council for Physical Recreation,
have established mountaineering training centres in the hills. Training courses
are also run by the Mountaineering Association, the Youth Hostels Associa¬
tion and other bodies, while many schools now have mountaineering sections.
Membership of the known clubs is about 15,000, but several times this
number take part in climbing and mountaineering.
British mountaineers have taken a leading part in exploring most of the
great ranges of the world and in climbing their peaks; for example, the first
ascent of the Matterhorn in 1865, of Everest in 1953, and of Kangchenjunga
in 1955. In recent years frequent expeditions have gone to far off mountains,
to Greenland, Alaska, the Andes, Patagonia, the Caucasus and the Pamirs,
as well as the Himalayas.
Motor racing is one of the most popular spectator sports in Britain; more
racing and sports cars have been built in Britain than in any other country;
and British drivers (including women drivers) have an international reputation
second to none.

British cars and British drivers take part in the international rallies and
world classic races which are the main features of the sport. They include the
British classic races—the British Grand Prix (to be held at Brands Hatch
in 1964), and the Tourist Trophy for sports cars (first held in 1905 in the
Isle of Man, later at Dundrod in Northern Ireland, and now at Goodwood).
There are also British national race meetings and British national rallies, as
well as several thousand day and night rallies and trials, endurance tests,
hill climbs and other events, arranged by various driving clubs, of which there
are over 500 in Great Britain.
The best-known motor racing circuits are those at Goodwood, Sussex;
Silverstone, Northamptonshire; Crystal Palace, London; Brands Hatch,
Kent; Snetterton, Norfolk; Mallory Park, Leicestershire; Oulton Park,
Cheshire; Aintree, near Liverpool; and Charterhall, Berwickshire, in
Scotland. The controlling body of motor racing in Britain is the Royal
Automobile Club (RAC), founded in 1897; the RAC is represented on the
Federation Internationale de PAutomobile, which draws up the regulations
for international motor racing.
In addition to motor car racing, there are motor cycle races—the most
important contest of the year is for the Isle of Man Tourist Trophy—and
motor cycle speedway racing, introduced into Britain in 1928, and governed
by the Speedway Control Board. There is also go-kart racing.
The internationally recognised body for cycle racing in the United Kingdom
is the British Cycling Federation. It controls track and massed start road
racing in Britain, and is concerned with the cycling events in the Olympic
and Commonwealth Games and the annual world championship. Time trials
are organised by the Road Time Trials Council.
Touring by bicycle is also a popular pastime, and both the British Cycling
Federation and the Cyclists’ Touring Club (CTC) cater for this. The CTC
is the oldest touring club in the world and has a membership of some 25,000.
Its representatives in all parts of the United Kingdom give advice and practical
help to touring cyclists; its fifty district associations arrange holiday and week¬
end tours, and competitions, rallies and rides of all kinds; and its travel
department gives CTC members every facility, both at home and abroad,
from the provision of itineraries to the supplying of tickets, maps and other
essential requirements.
Full-bore (*303) rifle shooting is organised by the National Rifle Association
(NRA), founded in i860. The Imperial Meeting held annually at Bisley Camp,
Surrey, is open to subjects of the Queen, and, for certain competitions, to
all-comers. The meeting, which is attended by some 2,500 competitors from
Great Britain and other Commonwealth countries, including cadets from
schools, lasts for just over a fortnight: the first week consists of team and
individual competitions for members of the armed forces, and there are three
days for schools only. The premier award of the meeting is the Queen s Prize,
which attracts about 1,250 entries. The NRA also organises postal matches
for British and overseas teams, and periodically sends rifle teams to shoot in
overseas countries of the Commonwealth.
Small-bore (• 22) rifle shooting—carried out either on indoor ranges of
15 to 25 yards in length or on open ranges up to 200 yards is also widely
practised in Britain. Some 4,000 clubs throughout the country are affiliated to
county rifle associations and the National Small-Bore Rifle Association
(NSRA), which arranges inter-club and inter-county competitions of various
SPORT
515
kinds for teams and individuals. The NSRA also organises a National Bisley
Meeting (usually attended by about 1,500 competitors), a Scottish meeting
(some 600 competitors), and a pistol shooting competition (some 400 competi¬
tors) at Bisley. International small-bore rifle matches are fired against teams
from overseas countries, and British teams are entered for the world champion¬
ships and the competitions in the Olympic Games.
Indoor Games Indoor games played in Britain include billiards, table tennis, and badminton,
which are enjoyed by large numbers of people, and for which facilities are
provided in social clubs of every kind, including youth clubs; and games
such as real tennis (a game which originated in thirteenth-century France),
squash rackets, rackets and fives, which are less national games than games of
the schools, universities and specialised clubs. Annual championships are
held in all these games, the controlling bodies of which are: the Billiards
Association and Control Council; the Badminton Association of England and
the Scottish Badminton Union; the Tennis, Rackets and Fives Association
and the Squash Rackets Association. Basket-ball, an indoor variant of
netball which originated in the United States of America, is also played in
Britain, primarily by men. Matches in the game are included among the
Olympic events. The controlling body in Britain is the Amateur Basket Ball
Association.

Ireland banks issue £1, £5, £10, £50 and £100 notes.
Postage Minimum postage rates for letters are: 3d. (inland) and 6d. (overseas). Details
of all postal rates are given in leaflets obtainable at any post office and are
summarised in the books of stamps sold there.
Persons coming to the United Kingdom may bring in notes in any currency,
travellers’ cheques, letters of credit, etc., without limit; and although visitors
leaving the United Kingdom may normally only take with them sterling notes
to the value of £50, they can make arrangements for up to £100 to be changed
into travellers’ cheques available in their own country. Currency can be ex¬
changed at banks and there are bureaux de change at all the main ports and at
London and Prestwick airports, the main London air terminals and Victoria

Regulations relating to exchange control in the United Kingdom are some¬
what complex and are subject to modification from time to time. Accordingly,
any person who is going to live in the United Kingdom or who desires informa¬
tion affecting his own particular circumstances is advised to consult his own
or a United Kingdom bank; banks in Britain are experienced in all aspects of
exchange control.
In general, persons visiting the country for a limited period are regarded as
non-resident; any sterling account which they open with a United Kingdom
bank will be designated an External Account and funds in it may be used
without formality to make payments anywhere in the world. Persons intending
to reside permanently in the United Kingdom are subject to the provisions of
the Exchange Control Act, 1947, and will require permission to make payments
outside the Scheduled Territories.
Income Tax The question of when a visitor to the United Kingdom who is not domiciled
there is chargeable for income tax as a ‘resident’ is complicated. The main
qualifications are:
1. A visitor is resident in the United Kingdom for any income tax year
(beginning 6th April) in which he is in the United Kingdom for a period or
periods equal, in the whole, to six months.
2. Even if a visitor does not stay six months in any one year he is regarded
as being resident if he visits the United Kingdom regularly for substantial
periods of time.
3. If a person maintains a place of abode in the United Kingdom available
for his use, he is regarded as resident for any year in which he pays a visit, of
whatever length.

travel agents in the tourist’s own country): Belgium, France, Germany (Federal
Republic and West Berlin), Liechtenstein, Luxembourg, Monaco, Netherlands,
and Switzerland. A passport must, however, still be used where the purpose of
the visit is other than touristic, or where a stay of longer than three months is
intended.
Foreign visitors who are sixteen years of age or over must register with the
police three months after their arrival.
The personal baggage of persons entering the United Kingdom is subject to
Customs examination. Many articles are liable to Customs Duty and a number
to purchase tax. Failure to make a complete declaration may result in
penalties; but, although there is no legal entitlement to them, certain concessions
are given to travellers who properly declare their belongings.
Used personal effects, including tools of trade and articles of professional
use, which have been in the ownership and use of a traveller for a considerable
period and are not intended for other persons or for sale, may be admitted free
of duty and purchase tax, as may also used furniture and domestic articles
belonging to persons transferring residence to the United Kingdom. Small
quantities of dutiable goods, including tobacco, wine and spirits, and perfume,
carried by travellers for their personal use are allowed to pass free of duty
within fixed limits.
Inquiries on importing personal and household effects should be addressed
to the Secretary, H.M. Customs and Excise, King’s Beam House, London, E.C.3.
There are purchase tax concessions for overseas visitors shopping in Britain.
Many of the principal stores are able to send goods to an address abroad free
of purchase tax; and under the Personal Exports scheme, if the tax-free value
of goods bought at one time is £5 or more, a visitor may have them delivered
free of tax to the seaport or airport by which he is leaving the country.
All cats and dogs brought into the United Kingdom have to undergo six
months’ quarantine; and the landing of the animals must be authorised by a
licence issued by the appropriate Agricultural Department for England and
Wales, Scotland or Northern Ireland (see Chapter 12). The department will
provide a list of approved carrying agents and quarantine kennels. An annual
licence (costing 7s. 6d. and obtainable at any post office) is needed for a house¬
hold dog aged 6 months or more.
The import of birds of the parrot family, if they are personal pets, is allowed
under licence, subject to certain conditions, by the Agricultural Departments.
Imports of live poultry are permitted only from certain countries.
Regulations concerning the temporary import of motor vehicles by visitors to
Britain are best obtained from the national motoring organisations in the visitor’s
country of residence. If a visitor is given a Temporary Importation Permit by
the customs officer at the port of entry, exemption from the need to pay vehicle
excise licence duty will be granted for the same period as stated on the Permit
(maximum, 365 days). Insurance against third party risks is compulsory; a visitor
must produce evidence in the form of either an International Motor Insurance
Card {green card) or a certificate of insurance issued by a British insurer.
A visitor holding a current International Driving Permit or a current domestic
driving licence for his own country is entitled to drive without obtaining a
British driving licence during the currency of his own permit or licence, subject
to a maximum of 12 months. Any person taking up permanent residence must
take a driving test to secure a British licence which costs 15s. and is valid for
three years.
The rule of the road is to keep LEFT. Road signs are illustrated and explained
in The Highway Code (published by H.M. Stationery Office).

Eligibility for the main social security benefits is dependent on (a) sufficient
National Insurance contributions having been paid under the United Kingdom
schemes or (b) the existence of a reciprocal agreement between the United
Kingdom and the previous country of residence of the claimant (see p. 139).
Information on specific points may be obtained from the Ministry of Pensions
and National Insurance, 10 John Adam Street, London, W.C.2.
To qualify for family allowances, a residence qualification must be fulfilled,
varying in length according to the nationality and previous country of residence
of the applicant.
The services provided under the National Health Service are available to
everyone in Great Britain without regard to residence, nationality or insurance
qualification. Immigration authorities have been instructed, however, to refuse
admission to the country to any person coming solely for the purpose of securing
free treatment under the Health Service.
Persons from countries other than members of the British Commonwealth and
the Irish Republic are admitted to the United Kingdom to take up employment
with a particular employer only if they have a permit issued by the Ministry of
Labour (see p. 454). Until 1st July, 1962, citizens of the Commonwealth and of
the Irish Republic had free entry into the United Kingdom, but since that date
they have been subject to control under the Commonwealth Immigrants Act,
1962 (see p. 454), and must obtain an employment voucher issued by the
Ministry of Labour before entering Britain for full-time employment.
Visitors of foreign nationality wishing to set up in any business or profession
in Britain must ask for permission from the Under-Secretary of State, Home
Office, Aliens Department, Princeton House, 271 High Holborn, London, W.C.l.
