Foreword
Britain 1994 is the 45th in the series of
Handbooks prepared by the Central Office of
Information (COI). Drawing on a wide range
of official and other authoritative sources, it
provides a factual overview of Government
policy and developments in Britain.
The Handbook is widely recognised as an
established work of reference, not only in
Britain but overseas, where it is an important
element of the information service provided
by British diplomatic posts. It is sold by
HMSO and its agents throughout the world.
New Features
The text has, of course, been fully updated
and revised. The structure has been altered
and chapters are now grouped in sections.
Other new features introduced, some at the
suggestion of readers, include:
• a list of Charters produced under the
Government’s Citizen’s Charter initiative;
• a brief reading list at the end of most
chapters; and
• a guide to the contents of each chapter at
the head of the chapter itself.
Coverage
Every effort is made to ensure that the
information given in the Handbook is
accurate at the time of going to press. The
text, generally, is based on information
available up to September 1993.
As far as possible, the Handbook presents
information that applies to Britain as a whole.
However, this is not always possible. Care
should be taken when using the Handbook to
note whether the information given refers to:
• Britain, formally the United Kingdom of
Great Britain and Northern Ireland;
• Great Britain, which comprises England,
Wales and Scotland;
• England and Wales, which are grouped
together for many administrative and
other purposes; or, in some instances,
• England alone.
Aspects of Britain
COI also produces the Aspects of Britain
series of paperbacks, which covers in depth
Britain’s political, economic and social
structure, and its place in the international
community. Some titles are extended versions
of the chapters in the Britain Handbook, but
most are completely new texts. Appropriate
titles are given in the list of further reading
at the end of most chapters and a selection is
listed on the back cover. For further
information please write to COI Reference
Services or phone 071 261 8310.
Acknowledgments
The Handbook has been compiled with the
co-operation of around 250 organisations,
including other government departments and
agencies. The editor would like to thank all
those who have contributed their comments.

Introduction
Britain comprises Great Britain (England,
Wales and Scotland) and Northern Ireland,
and is one of the 12 member states of the
European Community (EC). Its full name is
the United Kingdom of Great Britain and
Northern Ireland.
Physical Features
Britain constitutes the greater part of the
British Isles. The largest of the islands is
Great Britain. The next largest comprises
Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic.
Western Scotland is fringed by the large
island chain known as the Hebrides and to
the north east of the Scottish mainland are
Orkney and Shetland. All these have
administrative ties with the mainland, but the
Isle of Man in the Irish Sea and the Channel
Islands between Great Britain and France are
largely self-governing, and are not part of the
United Kingdom.
With an area of some 242,000 sq km
(93,000 sq miles), Britain is just under 1,000
km (some 600 miles) from the south coast to
the extreme north of Scotland and just under
500 km (some 300 miles) across in the widest
part.
The climate is generally mild and
temperate. Prevailing winds are south¬
westerly and the weather from day to day is
mainly influenced by depressions moving
eastwards across the Atlantic. The weather is
subject to frequent changes. In general, there
are few extremes of temperature, with the
temperature rarely above 32°C (90°F) or
below -10°C (14°F).
In recent years, however, there have been
some notable extremes of weather, including:
• the highest temperature officially
recorded in Britain—37.1°C (98.8°F) at
Cheltenham (Gloucestershire) in August
1990;
• the great storm of October 1987, which
in southern England resulted in about 15
million trees being blown down; and
• a long period of low rainfall in the
southern and eastern areas of England,
which ended in 1992—in January 1992
London experienced its driest January
since records began in 1838.
The average annual rainfall is more than
1,600 mm (over 60 inches) in the
mountainous areas of the west and north but
less than 800 mm (30 inches) over central
and eastern parts. Rain is fairly well
distributed throughout the year, but, on
average, March to June are the driest months
and September to January the wettest.
During May, June and July (the months of
longest daylight) the mean daily duration of
sunshine varies from five hours in northern
Scotland to eight hours in the Isle of Wight;
during the months of shortest daylight
(November, December and January) sunshine
is at a minimum, with an average of an hour
a day in northern Scotland and two hours a
day on the south coast of England.
Historical Outline
The name ‘Britain’ derives from Greek and
Latin names probably stemming from a
Celtic original. Although in the prehistoric
timescale the Celts were relatively late
arrivals in the British Isles, only with them
does Britain emerge into recorded history.
The term ‘Celtic’ is often used rather
generally to distinguish the early inhabitants
of the British Isles from the later Anglo-
Saxon invaders.
After two expeditions by Julius Caesar in
55 and 54 BC, contact between Britain and
the Roman world grew, culminating in the
Roman invasion of AD 43. Roman rule was

gradually extended from south-east England
to include Wales and, for a time, the lowlands
of Scotland. The final Roman withdrawal in
409 followed a period of increasing disorder
during which the island began to be raided by
Angles, Saxons and Jutes from northern
Europe. It is from the Angles that the name
‘England’ derives. The raids turned into
settlement and a number of small English
kingdoms were established. The Britons
maintained an independent existence in the
areas now known as Wales and Cornwall.
Among these kingdoms more powerful ones
emerged, claiming overlordship over the
whole country, first in the north
(Northumbria), then in the midlands (Mercia)
and finally in the south (Wessex). However,
further raids and settlement by the Vikings
from Scandinavia occurred, although in the
tenth century the Wessex dynasty defeated
the invading Danes and established a wide-
ranging authority in England.
Some of the main dates in present day
Britain’s history are given on p. 6. The early
histories of England, Wales, Scotland and
Northern Ireland are included in Chapters 2
to 5, which also deal with the main aspects of
their social, economic and political life.
Additional material is included on the
political situation in Northern Ireland. Table
1.1 gives a selection of some of the main
statistics for each of the four lands.
Channel Islands and Isle of Man
Although the Channel Islands and the Isle of
Man are not part of the United Kingdom,
they have a special relationship with it. The
Channel Islands were part of the Duchy of
Normandy in the 10th and 11th centuries and
remained subject to the English Crown after
the loss of Normandy to the French. The Isle
of Man was under the nominal sovereignty of
Norway until 1266, and eventually came
under the direct administration of the Crown
in 1765. Today the territories have their own
legislative assemblies and systems of law. The
British Government is responsible for their
defence, their international relations and,
ultimately, their good government.

England is predominantly a lowland country, although there are upland
regions in the north (the Pennine Chain, the Cumbrian mountains and the
Yorkshire moorlands) and in the south west, in Cornwall, Devon and
Somerset. Central southern England has the downs—low chalk hill ranges.
The greatest concentrations of population (see Table 2.1) are in London and
the South East, the West Yorkshire and north-west industrial cities, the
Midlands conurbation around Birmingham, the north-east conurbations on
the rivers Tyne and Tees, and along the Channel coast.
Early History
In 1066 the last successful invasion of
England took place. Duke William of
Normandy defeated the English at the Battle
of Hastings. Normans and others from
France came to settle. French became the
language of the nobility for the next three
centuries and the legal and, to some extent,
social structure was influenced by that
prevailing across the Channel. The English
language, which descended from the German
tongue spoken by the Anglo-Saxons in the
fifth and sixth centuries, was transformed
with the Norman Conquest. English re-
emerged as a literary language in the 14th
century, and it became the universal tongue
for all segments of English society—although
strong regional variations continued to
flourish.
With the final loss of the English Crown’s
possessions in France during the late Middle
Ages, and the union of England and Scotland
in 1707, England’s position as the most
populous part of the nation state was
established.
Government
England has no government minister or
department exclusively responsible for its
central administration in domestic affairs, in
contrast to Wales, Scotland and Northern
Ireland. Instead, there are a number of
government departments, whose
responsibilities in some cases also cover
aspects of affairs in Wales and Scotland.
There are 524 Members of Parliament for
England in the House of Commons. In
September 1993 England had 317
Conservative Members of Parliament, 194
Labour, 12 Liberal Democrat and the
Speaker of the House of Commons.
Conservative support is to be found
particularly in suburban and rural areas and
the Conservatives have a large majority of the
parliamentary seats in the southern half of
England and in East Anglia. The Labour
Party derives its main support from urban
industrialised areas.
Local government is mainly administered
through a two-tier system of counties (see
map, p. 4) Subdivided into districts.

ENGLAND
However, there are some single-tier
authorities—32 boroughs in London and 36
metropolitan districts in other conurbations.
The Local Government Commission has
begun its review of the structure of local
government in England (see p. 69).
The English legal system comprises on the
one hand a historic body of conventions
known as ‘common law’ and ‘equity’, and, on
the other, parliamentary and EC legislation.
In the formulation of common law since the
Norman Conquest, great reliance has been
placed on precedent. Equity law derives from
the practice of petitioning the King’s
Chancellor in cases not covered by common
law.
The Church of England, which was
separated from the Roman Catholic Church
at the time of the Reformation, is the
Established Church; the Sovereign must
always be a member of the Church and
appoints its two archbishops and 42 other
diocesan bishops.
The Economy
Considerable changes in the economy of
England have occurred during the 20th
century. In the second half of the century,
jobs in service industries have grown and now
account for over two-thirds of employees in
employment, with expansion having been
particularly noticeable in financial and
business services. Services account for over
three-quarters of gross domestic product
(GDP) in London and the South East, and
over 20 per cent of people in Greater London
work in banking and finance.
London is one of the world’s leading
centres of banking, insurance and other
financial services. It is also the main English
media centre; the national press is published
there, and the national radio and television
networks have their headquarters there. After
London and the South East, the South West
has the next highest concentration of service
industries.
Manufacturing, although declining as a
proportion of the employment base, remains
important in a number of areas. It is most
significant in the West Midlands (where
manufacturing accounted for 29 per cent of
the region’s GDP in 1991) and the North.
East Anglia has been the fastest-growing
English region in terms of both population
and employment since the 1960s. Although
largely agricultural, high-technology industry
has in recent years developed in the region.
In agriculture, dairying is most common in
the west of England; sheep and cattle are
reared in the hilly and moorland areas of the
North and South West. Arable farming, pig
and poultry farming and horticulture are
concentrated in the east and south.
Horticulture is also important in the West
Midlands. The principal fishing ports are on
the east coast and in the South West.
England has plentiful energy resources in
its coalfields and has access to offshore oil
and gas reserves. Important mineral deposits
include sand, gravel and crushed rock used
by the construction industry; industrial
minerals include clay, salt from the North
West, china clay from Cornwall and gypsum
from the Midlands, North and South East.
Transport
The motorway network comprises four long¬
distance routes linking London and the cities
of the Midlands, the North and North West,
and the South West, the London orbital
route (M25), and over 30 shorter motorways.
On the railways a major development will
be the inauguration of services through the
Channel Tunnel in early 1994. The tunnel
will link Britain with the European rail
system and also provide a vehicle shuttle
service on specially designed trains. The
major airports are Heathrow (the busiest
international airport in the world) and
Gatwick, both serving London; and
Manchester, Birmingham, Stansted and
Luton.
Tourism
Tourism and the leisure industries have
expanded in recent years. Over half the
expenditure by overseas visitors in Britain
takes place in London. The South West is
the most popular region for domestic
tourism. Of the many tourist attractions in
England, the most popular of those charging
9
BRITAIN 1994: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
for admission in 1992 were Alton Towers
(Staffordshire), Madame Tussaud’s waxworks
in London, and the Tower of London, with
2.5, 2.3 and 2.2 million visitors respectively.
Cultural and Social Life
London has a concentration of cultural
features, including four major art galleries
and many renowned museums, together with
theatrical, opera, ballet and concert venues.
Other major cities and towns also have a
broad range of cultural interests. Many
theatres outside London are used for touring
by the national theatre, dance and opera
companies. Many regions and towns have
associations with great English writers and
artists, such as William Shakespeare
(Stratford-upon-Avon), William Wordsworth

(Lake District), Arnold Bennett (Stoke-on-
Trent), the Bronte sisters (Yorkshire),
Thomas Hardy (Dorset) and John Constable
(Essex and Suffolk).
Despite the relatively high population
density and degree of urbanisation, there are
still many unspoilt rural and coastal areas.
There are seven National Parks, six forest
parks, 34 designated ‘areas of outstanding
natural beauty’, 16 environmentally sensitive
areas, almost 200 country parks approved by
the Countryside Commission, over 6,000
conservation areas, 800 km (500 miles) of
designated heritage coastline, and about
2,000 historic buildings and some 3,600
gardens open to the public. There are also
safari and wildlife parks, and ‘theme’ parks,
all offering family activities and
entertainment.

Cultural and Social Life 15
About half of the 1.5 million people in Northern Ireland are settled on the
eastern seaboard, the centre of which is Belfast, with a population of some
287,100. Most industry is situated in this eastern part of the province.
Agriculture is one of the most important sectors of the economy.
Just under two-thirds of the population are descendants of Scots or English
settlers who crossed to north-eastern Ireland mainly in the 17th century; most
are Protestants, British by culture and tradition and committed to
maintaining the constitutional link with the British Crown. The remainder,
just over a third, are Roman Catholics, Irish by culture and history, and
favour union with the Irish Republic.
Early History
During the tenth century Ireland was
dominated by the Vikings.
In 1169 Henry II of England launched an
invasion of Ireland. He had been granted its
overlordship by the English Pope Adrian IV,
who was anxious to bring the Irish church
into full obedience to Rome. Although a large
part of the country came under the control of
Anglo-Norman magnates, little direct
authority was exercised from England during
the Middle Ages.
The Tudor monarchs showed a much
greater tendency to intervene in Ireland.
During the reign of Elizabeth I, a series of
campaigns was waged against Irish
insurgents. The main focus of resistance was
the northern province of Ulster. With the
collapse of this resistance and the flight of its
leaders in 1607, Ulster was settled by
immigrants from Scotland and England.
The English civil wars (1642-51) led to
further risings in Ireland and these were
crushed by Cromwell. There was more
fighting after the deposition of James II in
1688.
During most of the 18th century there was
an uneasy peace; towards its end various
efforts were made by British governments to
achieve stability. In 1782 the Irish Parliament
(dating from medieval times) was given
legislative independence; the only
constitutional tie with Great Britain was the
Crown. The Parliament only represented the
privileged Anglo-Irish minority and Catholics
were excluded from it. An abortive rebellion
took place in 1798, and in 1801 Ireland was
unified with Great Britain.
The Irish question was one of the major
problems of British politics during the 19th
century. In 1886 the Liberal Government
introduced a Home Rule Bill designed to give
an Irish Parliament authority over most
internal matters while reserving control over
external affairs to Britain. This led to a split
in the Liberal Party and the failure of the
11
BRITAIN 1994: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Bill. In 1914 Home Rule was enacted by the
Government of Ireland Act. Its
implementation was prevented by the threat of
armed resistance on the part of the Protestant
majority in Ulster and by the outbreak of the
First World War.
Although a nationalist rising in Dublin in
1916 was suppressed, a guerrilla force known
as the Irish Republican Army (IRA) began
operations against the British administration at
the end of the First World War. The
Government of Ireland Act 1920 provided for
the establishment of two Home Rule
parliaments, one in Dublin and the other in
Belfast. The Act was implemented in 1921 in
Northern Ireland, when six of the nine
counties of the province of Ulster received
their own Parliament and remained
represented in, and subject to the supreme
authority of, the British Parliament. In the
South the IRA continued to fight for
independence from the British administration.
After the signature of a truce in June 1921,
the Anglo-Irish Treaty of December 1921
established the Irish Free State, which became
a republic in 1949.
For 50 years from 1921 Northern Ireland
had its own devolved Parliament in which the
mainly Protestant Unionists consistently
formed the majority and therefore
constituted the Government after successive
elections. Nationalists resented this domination
and their effective exclusion from political
office.
An active and articulate civil rights
movement emerged during the late 1960s.
Although reforms were made in response
(see p. 13), sectarian disturbances developed
and this required the introduction of Army
troops in 1969 to support the police in keeping
order. Subsequently, sectarian divisions were
exploited by the actions of terrorists from both
sides, but most notably by the Provisional
Irish Republican Army, who claimed to be
protecting the Roman Catholic minority.
Despite the reform programme, the inter-
communal violence continued, leading to a
decision by the British Government to take
over responsibility for law and order in 1972.
The Northern Ireland Government resigned in
protest against this decision and direct rule
from Westminster began.
Geography
Northern Ireland is at its nearest point only
21 km (13 miles) from Scotland. It has a
488-km (303-mile) border in the south and
west with the Irish Republic. At its centre
lies Lough Neagh, Britain’s largest freshwater
lake (381 sq km, 147 sq miles). Many of the
principal towns lie in valleys leading from the
Lough, including the capital, Belfast, which
stands at the mouth of the river Lagan. The
Mourne Mountains, rising sharply in the
south-east, include Slieve Donard, Northern
Ireland’s highest peak (852 m, 2,796 ft).
Government
Northern Ireland continues to be governed
by direct rule under legislation passed in
1974. This allows the Parliament in
Westminster to approve all laws for Northern
Ireland and places its government
departments under the direction and control
of the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland,
who is a Cabinet minister (see p. 500).
Northern Ireland returns 17 members to
the United Kingdom Parliament. In the most
recent general election in April 1992 the
Ulster Unionists won 9 seats, the Democratic
Unionists 3, the Ulster Popular Unionists 1
and the Social and Democratic Labour Party
4. The Alliance Party, set up to offer an
alternative to unionist and nationalist parties,
did not obtain a seat.
Efforts to Achieve Devolved Government
Legislation passed in 1973 provided for a
measure of devolved government in Northern
Ireland. This was implemented in January
1974 following agreement between Northern
Ireland political parties to form a power¬
sharing Executive. The Executive, however,
collapsed in May 1974 as a result of a protest
strike by ‘loyalists’.
Attempts have been made by successive
British governments to find a means of
restoring a widely acceptable form of
devolved government to Northern Ireland. A
78-member Assembly was elected by
proportional representation in 1982. Four
years later this was dissolved after it ceased to
12
NORTHERN IRELAND
discharge its responsibilities to make
proposals for the resumption of devolved
government and to monitor the work of the
Northern Ireland government departments.
One of the reasons for the Assembly’s
dissolution was in part the Unionists’
reaction to the Anglo-Irish Agreement
between the British and Irish governments in
November 1985.
The objectives of the Agreement are to:
• promote peace and stability in Northern
Ireland;
• create a new climate of friendship and
co-operation between the peoples of
Britain and the Irish Republic; and
• improve co-operation in fighting
terrorism.
It commits both governments to the
principle that Northern Ireland shall remain
part of Britain for as long as that is the wish
of a majority. It recognises that at present a
majority there wishes to remain part of
Britain. Both governments have undertaken
that, should a majority in Northern Ireland
formally consent to the establishment of a
united Ireland, they would introduce and
support the necessary legislation. The
Agreement binds Britain and the Irish
Republic to these commitments in
international law.
The Agreement also established an Inter¬
governmental Conference through which the
Irish Government can put forward views and
proposals on specified matters affecting
Northern Ireland affairs. This only applies if
these matters are not the responsibility of a
devolved administration in Northern Ireland
and where cross border co-operation can be
promoted in the interests of both countries.
Each government retains sovereignty and full
responsibility for decisions and administration
within its own jurisdiction.
The British Government remains
committed to the principle of a locally
accountable administration acceptable to, and
enjoying the support of, both sections of the
community. Following lengthy consultations
with the four main constitutional parties—the
Ulster Unionists, Democratic Unionists,
Alliance Party and Social Democratic and
Labour Party—the Northern Ireland
Secretary announced in March 1991 that
agreement had been reached on a basis for
formal political talks.
The talks, which took place in 1991 and
1992, had as their aim the achievement of a
political accommodation taking into account
the three sets of relationships relevant to the
Northern Ireland problem: those within
Northern Ireland, within the island of
Ireland, and between the two governments.
The British and Irish governments also made
clear that they were prepared to consider a
new and more broadly based Anglo-Irish
Agreement if one could be arrived at through
direct discussion and negotiation between all
the parties concerned. Although the talks
ended in November 1992 without full
agreement, all the parties agreed that further
dialogue was necessary and desirable.
Human Rights
The Government is committed to the
protection of human rights.
From 1969 the Northern Ireland
Government enacted a number of reforms
aimed at securing the minority’s right to an
effective voice on public bodies. These
reforms included:
• the creation of a police authority
representative of all sections of the
community;
• the appointment of commissioners to
investigate complaints of
maladministration, including
discrimination, against government
departments and local authorities; and
• the creation of a central housing
executive with responsibility for all
public sector house-building and for
allocating housing according to need.
Legislation passed in 1973 outlaws
discrimination by public bodies, including the
Government, on the grounds of religious
belief or political opinion. It also set up the
independent Standing Advisory Commission
on Human Rights, which advises the
Government on the effectiveness of anti-
discrimination legislation and on other human
rights issues. In 1987 a central community
13
BRITAIN 1994: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
relations unit was established within the
Government to advise on the impact of
government policies and programmes on
community relations and to bring forward
ideas on future action.
Direct and indirect discrimination in
employment by public and private employers
is also illegal. Legislation passed in 1976
made discrimination on the grounds of
religion or politics unlawful and established a
Fair Employment Agency to promote equal
opportunities and work towards the
eradication of discrimination.
New laws came into effect in 1990.
These strengthened the 1976 measures
by requiring employers to:
• monitor the religious affiliations
of their workforce and job
applicants;
• take firm action, where necessary,
to provide for a fair distribution
of jobs between the two
communities; and
• review their employment practices
every three years.
Employers found guilty of bad
practice can be fined and economic
sanctions can be imposed.
The Fair Employment Agency was
renamed as the Fair Employment
Commission, which has increased powers and
resources to enable it to investigate
employment practices, prescribe affirmative
measures and offer advice and guidance. The
Fair Employment Tribunal deals with
individual complaints of alleged
discrimination and appeals by employers
against directions of the Commission. The
effectiveness of the legislation has to be
reviewed after five years.
Security Policy
While terrorism continues, certain emergency
powers are in force. These include special
powers of arrest in respect of certain serious
crimes, non-jury courts to try certain terrorist
offences (see p. 85), and the banning of
terrorist organisations (see p. 77). Terrorists
are tried for the criminal offences they
commit, and not for political beliefs. The
powers are balanced by specific safeguards;
the measures are temporary, need annual
renewal by Parliament, and are subject to
annual independent review.
The Government has restricted the
broadcasting on television and radio of direct
statements made by representatives of
terrorist organisations or their supporters.
The security forces are accountable to the
law; if they break it, their members are liable
to prosecution like any other members of the
community. An independent police
complaints commission supervises police
investigations into more serious complaints
and, at its discretion, the investigation of
others. Northern Ireland’s legal system, and
the safeguards it enshrines, are broadly
similar to those in England and Wales
(see Chapter 8).
The use of violence has been condemned
by the overwhelming majority of people
living in Northern Ireland and, although
terrorism continues, the overall level of
violence is lower than in the early 1970s.
Since 1969 over 3,000 people have been killed
as a result of terrorist campaigns.
The police are responsible for maintaining
law and order, and are assisted by the Army.
The Economy
Northern Ireland had a gross domestic
product of some £10,470 million in 1991 and
a working population of some 722,000 in
June 1992. Trends in output, employment
and unemployment tend to reflect overall
trends in Britain. Almost half of
manufacturing output is sold to the rest of
Britain and a quarter is sold locally.
In the 1980s employment fell in
manufacturing and rose in services.
Unemployment is higher than in the rest of
Britain and reached 14 per cent in June 1993,
compared with 10.3 per cent in Great Britain.
An economic development strategy
published by the Government in 1990
concluded that long-term growth could only
be generated by improvements in
international competitiveness led by the
14
NORTHERN IRELAND
private sector. Its main features include:
• helping companies to identify and remove
obstacles to growth;
• an intensified drive for inward
investment;
• building up management and workforce
skills;
• stimulating the development of an
enterprise culture;
• giving a new impetus to support for
innovation and for research and
development;
• increasing the contribution made by
tourism to economic development; and
• targeting programmes, where necessary,
on areas of social and economic
deprivation and on the needs of long¬
term unemployed people.
Industrial development policy is carried
out by five agencies associated with the
Department of Economic Development:
• the Industrial Development Board deals
with companies with more than 50
employees and with inward investment;
• the Local Enterprise Development Unit
promotes enterprise and the development
of small businesses employing up to 50
employees;
• the Training and Employment Agency is
responsible for training the workforce;
• the Northern Ireland Tourist Board
promotes tourism; and
• the Industrial Research and Technology
Unit provides advice and assistance to
encourage research and development and
technology transfer.
Considerable public expenditure is devoted
to urban renewal in Belfast and Londonderry.
The Department of the Environment has a
grant scheme which has generated over
£256 million of private investment at a
private/public funding ratio of over 3:1. In
addition, under the Making Belfast Work
programme for the period from 1988 to 1994,
over £100 million is being used to promote
jobs and businesses, improve training, and
make improvements to the environment and
living conditions. There is also a government
and private sector scheme designed to
redevelop the banks of the river Lagan in
the heart of the city. In Londonderry there
is a town centre development programme
as well as community action to create more
jobs.
Northern Ireland has parity with England,
Scotland and Wales on taxation and services.
The British Government makes a
contribution (£3,300 million in 1992-93) to
maintain social services at the level of those
in Great Britain, to meet the cost of security
measures and to compensate for the natural
disadvantages of geography and lack of
resources. Resources are focused on those
suffering the highest level of social and
economic disadvantage.
In 1986 the British and Irish governments
established the International Fund for Ireland
to promote social and economic advance.
Some three-quarters of the Fund is spent in
Northern Ireland, the rest going to border
areas in the Republic. Programmes financed
by the Fund cover business enterprise,
tourism, community relations, urban
development, agriculture and rural
development. Donors include the United
States, the European Community, Canada
and New Zealand.
Cultural and Social Life
Northern Ireland’s heritage is preserved and
portrayed by the Ulster Museum in Belfast
and the Ulster Folk and Transport Museum
in County Down, and by a number of smaller
museums and interpretive centres. The
Ulster-American Folk Park in Omagh
specialises in the history of Irish emigration
to America; it is developing an extensive
computer database on emigrants which will
be available to the public.
Local arts festivals are an important
feature of the arts calendar, the highlight
being the Belfast Festival, based at Queen’s
University. The Ulster Orchestra is a major
musical force. Government support for the
arts is channelled through the Northern
Ireland Arts Council, which gives financial
help and advice to opera and drama
companies, orchestras and festivals, arts
15
BRITAIN 1994: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
centres, writers and artistic groups; the
Council has its own gallery in Belfast.
The Government funds local district
councils, which provide leisure facilities
including 50 centres and 40 swimming pools.
It finances the Sports Council for Northern
Ireland, which promotes sport and physical
recreation.
Health and personal social services
correspond fairly closely to those in the rest
of Britain, although the administrative system
is different.
Although publicly maintained schools
must be open to children from all religions,
in practice Roman Catholic and Protestant
children are mainly educated in separate
schools. There are 21 integrated schools
providing education for some 3,500
Protestant and Roman Catholic children and
this process is being encouraged by the
Government. A common curriculum
applicable to all publicly financed schools is
being introduced (see p. 409).
In the last ten years the housing stock has
increased by about 12 per cent and owner-
occupation from 54 per cent to 65 per cent.
The Housing Executive is the sole public
housing authority and allocates homes to
those in greatest need.
Local television and radio programmes are
broadcast and there is a local press
(see p. 454). National television and radio
broadcasts are also received and the national
press is sold widely.

Three-quarters of the population of Scotland and most of the industrial towns
are in the central lowlands. The chief cities are Edinburgh (the capital),
Glasgow, Aberdeen and Dundee. However, just over half of Scotland consists
of the sparsely populated highlands and islands in the north.
Scotland contains large areas of unspoilt and
wild landscape, and the majority of Britain’s
highest mountains—nearly 300 peaks over
913 m (3,000 ft). The highest are the
Grampians in the central highlands, with Ben
Nevis (1,343 m, 4,406 ft) the tallest peak.
The predominant Church of Scotland is a
Protestant church which is Presbyterian in
form; it is governed by a hierarchy of church
courts, each of which includes lay people.

BRITAIN 1994: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Early History
At the time of the Roman invasion of
Britain, what is now Scotland was mainly
inhabited by the Piets. Despite a long
campaign by the governor Julius Agricola,
Roman rule was never permanently
extended to most of Scotland. In the sixth
century, the Scots from Ireland settled in
what is now Argyll, giving their name to
the present-day Scotland. Lothian was
populated by the Angles, while Britons
moved north to Strathclyde. In the ninth
century parts of Scotland were subject to
raids by the Vikings; a united Scottish
kingdom dated from that era. The powerful
monarchy which existed in England
threatened Scottish independence in the
Middle Ages, particularly under Edward I,
and war between the two kingdoms was
frequent. There were also, however, strong
links with England; several Scottish kings
held land and titles in England and there
was intermarriage between the Scottish and
English royal families. Cultural influences
on Scotland were also strong. Despite
reverses such as the defeat of William
Wallace’s uprising in 1298, Robert the
Bruce’s victory over Edward II of England
at Bannockburn ensured the survival of a
separate kingdom of Scotland.
The two crowns were eventually united
when Elizabeth I of England was succeeded
in 1603 by James VI of Scotland (James I of
England), who was her nearest heir. Even
so, England and Scotland remained separate
political entities during the 17th century,
apart from an enforced period of unification
under Oliver Cromwell in the 1650s.
Religiously, too, the two kingdoms had
developed in different directions, with
England retaining an Episcopalian church
and Scotland embracing a Presbyterian
system. In 1707 both countries, realising the
benefits of closer political and economic
union, agreed on a single parliament for
Great Britain. Scotland retained its own
system of law and church settlement. The
union became strained during the reigns of
the Hanoverians George I and George II,
when Jacobite risings in 1715 and 1745
attempted to restore the Stuart line.
Government
There are special arrangements for the
conduct of Scottish affairs within the British
system of government and separate Acts of
Parliament are passed for Scotland where
appropriate. There are 72 Scottish seats in
the House of Commons. The General
Election in April 1992 resulted in the
election of 49 Labour Members of
Parliament, 11 Conservative, 9 Liberal
Democrat and 3 Scottish Nationalist.
Scottish administration is the
responsibility of the Secretary of State for
Scotland, a member of the Cabinet, working
through The Scottish Office, which has its
headquarters in Edinburgh and an office in
London.
Review of Scottish Government
In March 1993 the Government issued a
White Paper, Scotland in the Union: A
Partnership for Good, which set out its
conclusions following a wide-ranging
examination of Scotland’s place in Britain and
the role of Parliament in Scottish affairs. A
series of initiatives was announced to improve
the parliamentary arrangements for handling
Scottish business. This would involve the
widening of the range of business to be
handled by the Scottish Grand Committee
(which consists of all 72 Scottish MPs),
meeting in Scotland as well as at
Westminster; improved scrutiny of Scottish
legislation through special standing
committees; and greater accountability of
Scottish Office ministers through
parliamentary question time (see p. 55).
Other proposals include a number of
changes in the responsibilities of the
Secretary of State and The Scottish Office.
For example, from April 1994 responsibility
for training policy in Scotland, within the
framework of the Government’s overall policy
on training, will be transferred to the
Secretary of State and responsibility for the
Scottish Arts Council will be transferred
from the Department of National Heritage to
The Scottish Office. A more accessible
Scottish Office is planned through
establishing a series of information points and
18
SCOTLAND
a central enquiry unit. Opportunities for a
broader spread of Scottish Office activities
around Scotland will be investigated.
Local Government
Local government generally operates on a
two-tier basis broadly similar to that in
England and Wales. The three islands
councils (for Orkney, Shetland and the
Western Isles) are single-tier authorities.
In July 1993 the Government issued its
proposals for the reform of local government.
The main proposal envisages the creation of a
single-tier structure of 28 councils. Existing
regional and district councils would be
replaced by 25 new councils, while the three
islands councils would be unchanged. Each of
the four cities of Edinburgh, Glasgow, Dundee
and Aberdeen would have its own single-tier
council. The new councils would be required
to devise plans for decentralisation to increase
the involvement of local people in council
activities. Subject to the passage of the
necessary legislation, it is envisaged that the
existing councils would be wound up on 31
March 1996, with the new authorities
assuming full control on 1 April 1996.
Legal System
The principles and procedures of the Scottish
legal system differ in many respects from
those of England and Wales. These
differences stem, in part, from the adoption
of elements of other European legal
systems, based on Roman law, during the
16th century. One difference is in the
verdicts which a jury may give—in Scotland a
jury can give a verdict of ‘not proven’ when,
as with a ‘not guilty’ verdict, the accused is
acquitted.
The Economy
Scotland has experienced the same pressure
on its traditional industries as the north of
England and Wales. However, since 1987
economic growth in Scotland has been greater
than in Britain as a whole and it has been
less affected by the recent recession than
other areas.
The most significant economic
development has been the impact since the
early 1970s of the discovery of oil and gas
under the North Sea. Up to about 100,000
jobs are estimated to have arisen directly or
indirectly as a result of North Sea activities.
Industry
As traditional industries, such as coal, steel
and shipbuilding, have declined, there has
been growth in industries such as chemicals,
electronic engineering and lighter forms of
mechanical and instrument engineering. The
electronics industry, which includes many
of the world’s leading companies in this
field, provides 13 per cent of jobs in
manufacturing and about 20 per cent of
manufacturing output and investment. By
1991 over 200 plants were employing some
44,300 workers, one of the biggest
concentrations of the electronics industry in
Western Europe. Scotland accounts for more
than half of Britain’s output of integrated
circuits and for over 10 per cent of European
output.
Some traditional industries, such as high-
quality tweeds and other textiles, and food
and drink products, remain important. There
are over 100 whisky distilleries, mostly in the
north-east. Whisky exports, valued at over
£1,800 million in 1991, represent about one-
fifth of Scotland’s exports of manufacturing.
Services
A marked expansion has occurred in
services, which now employ about 70 per
cent of the workforce. Financial services are
of growing importance, and over 200,000
people are now employed in the sector.
There are four Scottish-based clearing banks
and they have limited rights to issue their
own banknotes. About one-third of
investment funds in Britain are managed
from Scotland, which is also a base for a
large number of insurance companies.
Tourism and leisure also make a significant
contribution to the economy, directly
providing over 180,000 jobs. In 1992,
10.8 million visitors spent some £1,750
million in Scotland.
19
BRITAIN 1994: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Industrial Developments
Government measures have helped to attract
firms to Scotland, and investment by
overseas companies has helped to make a
significant contribution to the growth of
modern technologically based industries. In
1992 about 81,400 people were employed in
overseas-owned manufacturing units,
representing almost 25 per cent of
manufacturing employment in Scotland.
Recent changes to the mechanism for
government support for enterprise and
training led in 1991 to the creation of
Scottish Enterprise and Highlands and
Islands Enterprise, which both have general
functions in economic development, training
and environmental improvement in the
Scottish lowlands and the Highlands and
Islands respectively. They contract with 22
Local Enterprise Companies (led by the
private sector), which arrange the provision
of training and business support.
Agriculture, Forestry and Fishing
About 80 per cent of the land area of
Scotland is devoted to agriculture. Hill and
upland farms account for about two-thirds
of the agricultural area. Much of this is
rough grazing (including common grazing)
for cattle and sheep. Scotland’s cattle
industry has a worldwide reputation, both
for the quality of meat and for pedigree
breeds. Arable farms are highly productive,
and the principal crop is barley, which is
used in the making of whisky and beer.
Scotland accounts for nearly half of
Britain’s forest area and for over one-
third of timber production. The bulk
of new planting in Britain takes place
in Scotland, mostly in the upland and
mountain areas.
Fishing remains an important activity,
particularly in the north-east and the
islands. Scottish boats land about 70 per
cent by weight and over 60 per cent by
value of total landings of fish in Britain by
British vessels.
Energy and Water Resources
Nuclear and hydroelectric generation supply a
higher proportion of energy than in any other
part of Britain. About 40 per cent of
Scotland’s electricity comes from nuclear
power, with hydro-power and other
renewables contributing a further 10 per cent.
With abundant rainfall, there is an
extensive supply of water from upland
sources. Water supply is currently the
responsibility of the regional and islands
councils, although the Government plans to
create three public water authorities which
would own and operate the water and
sewerage services. They would be able to
attract private capital to help to fund major
investment projects.
Transport
Communications, both domestic and
international, have improved in many parts of
Scotland. The electrification scheme of the
Edinburgh to London rail line was completed
in 1991. The A74 road linking Glasgow and
Carlisle is being upgraded to provide a
northward extension of the M6 motorway,
while the Central Scotland motorway network
is to be completed.
Environment
Scotland’s countryside contains a rich variety
of wildlife, with some species not found
elsewhere in Britain. There are 71 national
nature reserves and over 1,300 Sites of
Special Scientific Interest. Four regional
parks and 40 national scenic areas have been
designated, covering 13 per cent of the land
surface. Four of the 11 forest parks in Great
Britain are in Scotland, and a fifth spans the
border between Scotland and England.
Housing and Urban Regeneration
The tenure pattern is somewhat different
from that in the rest of Britain. Home
ownership is increasing but, at 53 per cent, is
still lower than in other areas of Britain.
Some 38 per cent of housing is rented from
the public sector, compared with 22 per cent
20
SCOTLAND
for Britain as a whole. Some areas,
particularly peripheral housing estates and
inner city areas, have been affected by urban
deprivation. A number of projects are in
hand to tackle the problems, including a
series of partnerships between The Scottish
Office and other groups, including local
communities and the private sector.
Cultural and Social Life
One of the major contributions to the arts is
the annual Edinburgh International Festival,
one of the world’s leading cultural events.
Held annually in August and September, it is
the largest of its kind in the world. Since
1982 Glasgow has also held its own
international arts festival, the Mayfest, which
is now the second largest festival in Britain.
Scotland possesses a number of major
collections of the fine and applied arts such
as the Burrell Collection in Glasgow. A new
Museum of Scotland is to be built in
Edinburgh to house the National Museums’
Scottish collection.
Gaelic, a language of ancient Celtic origin,
is spoken by some 80,000 people; the greatest
concentration of Gaelic speakers is in the
islands of the Hebrides.
An active press includes six national daily
morning newspapers, six local evening
newspapers and four national Sunday
newspapers. Television programmes are
produced by BBC Scotland and by three
independent companies, covering the highland,
lowland and border regions. BBC Radio
Scotland covers most of the population.
The concept of universal education was
accepted in Scotland as early as the 16th
century. The Scottish education system has a
number of distinctive features, for example,
in examinations. There are 12 universities, of
which four—St Andrews, Glasgow, Aberdeen
and Edinburgh—were established in the 15th
century, four in the 1960s and four were
accorded university status in 1992-93. Many
Scots have achieved eminence in arts and
sciences.
The sport of golf originated in Scotland,
and there are over 400 golf courses, including
St Andrews, Gleneagles, Turnberry,
Muirfield, Troon and Prestwick, which are
internationally renowned. A wide range of
outdoor activities, such as mountaineering
and hill walking, and fishing, are also pursued.
Winter sports are becoming increasingly
popular in the Cairngorm Mountains,
Glencoe and a number of other areas.

Two-thirds of the population of Wales live in the southern valleys and the
lower-lying coastal areas. The chief urban centres are Cardiff (with a
population of nearly 300,000), Swansea, Newport and Wrexham. However,
much of Wales is hilly or mountainous. The highest mountains are in
Snowdonia and the tallest peak is Snowdon (1,085 m, 3,560 ft).
Wales is a principality; Prince Charles, the heir to the throne, was invested
by the Queen with the title of Prince of Wales at Caernarfon Castle in 1969,
when he was 20. The Welsh name of the country is Cymru.
Early History
After the collapse of Roman rule in Britain
(see p. 5), Wales remained a Celtic
stronghold, although often within the
English sphere of influence. For much of
the period, it was divided into a number of
separate principalities, and unity was
achieved only sporadically. In 1267 Llywelyn
ap Gruffudd, who had achieved control over
a large portion of Wales, was recognised as
Prince of Wales by the English. However,
on his death in 1282, Edward I launched a
successful campaign to bring Wales under
English rule. The series of great castles that
he built in north Wales remain among
Britain’s finest historic monuments

(see p. 348). Edward Fs eldest son—later
Edward II—was born at Caernarfon in 1284
and was given the title Prince of Wales,
which continues to be borne by the eldest son
of the reigning monarch to this day.
Continued strong Welsh national feeling
was indicated by the rising led by Owain
Glyndwr at the beginning of the 15th
century. The Tudor dynasty, which ruled
England from 1485 to 1603, was of Welsh
ancestry. The Acts of Union of 1536 and
1542 united England and Wales
administratively, politically and legally.
Language
At the 1991 census Welsh speakers made up
19 per cent of the population. Welsh speakers
are concentrated in the rural north and west,
where Welsh remains the first language of
most of the population. Welsh has equal
validity with English in law courts; bilingual
education in schools is encouraged, and there
has been an extended use of Welsh for
official purposes and in broadcasting. Since
the 1960s both the Government and
voluntary groups have taken steps to revive
the use of Welsh. There are now many more
bilingual publications than previously, and
most road signs are bilingual. A Welsh
Language Board advises on matters relating
to the Welsh language.
The Government has reaffirmed its
commitment to enhancing Welsh culture and
developing greater use of the Welsh language.
The Welsh Language Bill, now being
considered by Parliament, would ensure that
Welsh speakers are able to use Welsh when
dealing with public authorities. The Welsh
Language Board would be placed on a
statutory basis and would have wide-ranging
advisory powers. Its function would be to
promote the Welsh language. The Bill would
also remove legal obstacles to the use of
Welsh and amend legislation which has been
seen as granting a lesser status to Welsh than
to English in Wales.
Religion
There is no established church, the Anglican
church having been disestablished in 1920
following decades of pressure from adherents
of the Methodist and Baptist churches.
Methodism in particular spread rapidly in
Wales in the 18th century, assuming the
nature of a popular movement among Welsh
speakers and finding strong support later in
industrial communities.
Government
The country returns 38 Members of
Parliament. For the last 60 years the
industrial communities have tended to
support the Labour Party in elections,
ensuring a Labour majority of seats.
Following the 1992 General Election, Wales
has 27 Labour Members of Parliament, 6
Conservative, 4 Plaid Cymru (Welsh
Nationalist) and 1 Liberal Democrat. Special
arrangements exist for the discussion of
Welsh affairs in the Welsh Grand
Committee, whose function is to consider
matters relating exclusively to Wales and Bills
referred to it at second reading stage
(see p. 55).
The Secretary of State for Wales, who is a
member of the Cabinet, has wide-ranging
responsibilities relating to the economy,
education, welfare services and the provision
of amenities. The headquarters of the
administration is the Welsh Office in Cardiff,
which also has an office in London.
Local government is exercised through a
system of elected authorities similar to that in
England, and the legal system is identical
with the English one. Fundamental changes
in the structure of local government were
announced in 1992 and in March 1993 a
White Paper was published. A Bill is planned
to implement the reorganisation. The plans
involve replacing the existing eight county
councils and 37 district councils by a single
tier of authorities from April 1995; elections
for these authorities would be held in 1994.
The Economy
Recent decades have seen fundamental
changes in the basis of the Welsh economy.
The most notable features have been
expansion in service industries and the
development of a more diverse range of
23
BRITAIN 1994: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
manufacturing industries, including many at
the forefront of technology. For example,
Wales is now an important centre for
electronics, information technology,
automotive components, chemicals and
materials, and new high-technology businesses
in related industries have been established.
The traditional industry of steelmaking
remains important, and Wales accounts for
about a third of steel production in Britain.
In services (which account for two-thirds
of employment) the most marked growth has
been in financial and business services, and
leisure services. Tourism is estimated to
employ some 95,000 people, with annual
earnings of about £1,300 million. The
National Garden Festival Wales, a major
national tourism and leisure event, was held
at Ebbw Vale in spring and summer 1992,
and attracted 2 million visitors.
Although south Wales remains the
principal industrial area, new industries and
firms have been introduced in north-east
Wales and light industry attracted to the
towns in the rural areas of mid- and north
Wales.
The Government has recently established
a Welsh Economic Council, chaired by the
Secretary of State. It is looking at a range of
economic issues, including training, inward
investment, exports, creation of an enterprise
culture, and diversification and expansion of
the economy.
Inward Investment
Wales has been particularly successful in
attracting investment by overseas companies.
In recent years it has regularly obtained about
20 per cent of overseas inward investment
into Britain. Some 200 new projects were
secured from abroad and the rest of Britain in
1992-93 and are expected to lead to nearly
14,000 new jobs and £950 million of capital
investment.
Economic Development
The economic programmes of the Welsh
Office are complemented by the work of the
Welsh Development Agency, which has wide
powers to promote industrial and
environmental change. Its budget in 1993-94
is £171 million. One of its main areas of
activity is providing accommodation for
business, increasingly in partnership with the
private sector. It has also undertaken the
largest land reclamation programme in
Europe, and all the significant remaining
industrial dereliction in Wales is expected to
have been removed by 1997.
The south Wales valleys is one of the
main areas to have been affected by the
decline in traditional industries. The
Programme for the Valleys was the most
extensive programme of economic and urban
regeneration undertaken in Wales. In April
1993 this was succeeded by a new five-year
Programme for the Valleys. The emphasis of
the new programme will^iove away from
centralised initiatives towards local
partnerships, and greater emphasis will be
placed on links with Europe.
As well as the extensive clearance of
derelict land, achievements of the
original Programme for the Valleys
included:
• additional private sector investment
of nearly £700 million, involving
24,000 jobs;
• the creation of 240,000 sq m
(2.6 million sq ft) of new industrial
floorspace; and
• the improvement of over 7,000
homes.
A development corporation has been set
up to stimulate the regeneration of the
Cardiff Bay area and its proposals include a
new barrage across the harbour mouth. The
regeneration is expected to attract over
£1,200 million of private investment and to
create over 23,000 new jobs.
Agriculture and Forestry
Agriculture occupies nearly 80 per cent of the
land area. The main activities are sheep and
cattle rearing in the hill regions and dairy
farming in the lowlands. About 12 per cent
of Wales is covered by woodland.
24
WALES
Transport
Improvements to road and rail links, such as
the upgrading of the north Wales coast road,
have helped the Welsh economy in recent
years. In the south there are motorway links
across the Severn Bridge to southern England
and the Midlands, and high-speed rail
services to a number of destinations in
England. A second major motorway crossing
of the Severn is under construction, with
completion planned in 1996. Work on
motorway links to the new bridge started in
early 1993.
Environment
There are extensive areas of picturesque hill,
lake and mountain country, and the
countryside supports a variety of plants and
wildlife. There are three National Parks
(Snowdonia, the Brecon Beacons and the
Pembrokeshire Coast), five Areas of
Outstanding Natural Beauty and two national
trails as well as 31 country parks and large
stretches of heritage coast. There are about 50
National Nature Reserves and over 800 Sites
of Special Scientific Interest. Nearly all of the
rivers and canals are classified as having water
of good or fair quality, and a significant
improvement has been achieved in the quality
of bathing waters.
Cultural and Social Life
Welsh literature is one of the oldest and
richest in Europe, and there is a national
library. The Welsh people also have strong
musical traditions; the country is well known
for its choral singing and the Welsh National
Opera has an international reputation. Special
festivals, known as eisteddfodau, encourage
Welsh literature and music. The largest is the
annual Royal National Eisteddfod, consisting
of competitions in music, singing, prose and
poetry entirely in Welsh. Artists from all over
the world come to the town of Llangollen for
the annual International Musical Eisteddfod.
A major expansion scheme at the National
Museum of Wales, in Cardiff, has been
completed and the galleries were opened in
October 1993.
An active local press includes a number of
Welsh language publications. The fourth
television channel, Sianel Pedwar Cymru
(S4C), broadcasts most of its programmes in
Welsh during peak viewing hours and is
required to see that a significant amount of
programming is in Welsh.
The education system is similar to that in
England. Welsh and English are both used as
media of instruction in a number of schools.
Most Welsh-medium schools are situated in
the traditionally Welsh-speaking, largely
rural, areas. There are also designated
bilingual schools in the anglicised, mainly
industrial areas to cater for children whose
parents want them to be educated through
the medium of both languages. Welsh is a
core subject in Welsh-speaking schools and a
foundation subject elsewhere under the
National Curriculum. The collegiate
University of Wales, founded in 1893,
comprises six member institutions.
Among many sporting activities, there is
particular interest in rugby union football,
which has come to be regarded as the Welsh
national game. The provision of sports
facilities, such as indoor sports halls and
swimming pools, has increased.

Among the main social changes during the second half of the 20th century are
longer life expectancy, reflected in a growing proportion of elderly people; a
lower birth rate; a higher divorce rate; wider educational opportunities;
technological progress and a higher standard of living.
POPULATION
According to mid-1991 estimates, Britain’s
population is 57.8 million. It ranks 17th in
the world in terms of population. Statistics
are derived from the census of population
(taken every ten years), with allowance for
subsequent births and deaths (obtained from
compulsory registration), and migration.
The 1991 census counted 54.9 million
people as resident in Great Britain.
Some 98.5 per cent lived in private
households and the number of such
households totalled 21.9 million. The
most densely populated region was
the North West, with 8.5 people per
hectare, and the least densely
populated was Scotland, with 0.6
people per hectare. Some 20 per cent
were children (aged under 16) and
nearly 19 per cent were of pensionable
age—60 and over for women and 65
and over for men.
The population has been growing slowly
since the early 1980s. On mid-1991-based
projections, the population in Britain is
forecast to rise to 59.7 million in 2001 and
61.1 million in 2011.
Birth Rates
In 1992 there were 781,000 live births,
slightly fewer than in 1990 or 1991,
compared with 634,200 deaths. The total
period fertility rate (an indication of the
average family size) remains below 2.1, the
level leading to the long-term replacement of
the population, although it is projected to
increase from 1.8 in 1989 to 2 for women
born in or after 1980.
Contributory factors to the relatively low
birth rate in recent years (13.5 live births per
1,000 population in 1992) include:
• the trends towards later marriage and
towards postponing births, which have
led to an increase in the average age of
women having children—27.9 years in
England and Wales in 1992 compared
with 26.8 in 1981;
• the current preference for smaller
families than in the past, which has led
to a significant decline in the proportion
of families with four or more children.
In 1991, 66 per cent of families consisted
of a married couple with one or two
dependent children, compared with 15
per cent of families consisting of a
married couple with three or more
dependent children; and
26
THE SOCIAL FRAMEWORK
• more widespread and effective
contraception, making it easier to plan
families. Voluntary sterilisation for men
and women has also become more
common.
Mortality
At birth the expectation of life for a man is
about 73 years and for a woman 78 years,
compared with 49 years for men and 52 years
for women in 1901. There has been only a
small increase in life expectancy in the older
age groups.
The general death rate has remained
roughly the same for the past 40 years, at
about 12 per 1,000 population, although in
recent years it has been nearer to 11 per
1,000 population. There has been a decline
in mortality at most ages, particularly among
children. The infant mortality rate (deaths of
infants under one year old per 1,000 live
births) was 6.6 in 1992; neonatal mortality
(deaths of infants under four weeks old per
1,000 live births) was 4.3 in 1992; and
maternal mortality is about 0.07 per 1,000
total births. The decline in mortality reflects
better nutrition, rising standards of living, the
advance of medical science, the growth of
medical facilities, improved health measures,
better working conditions, education in
personal hygiene and the smaller size of
families.
Deaths caused by circulatory diseases
(including heart attacks and strokes) now
account for nearly half of all deaths, and
mortality from heart disease in England
and Wales remains high compared with
that of other developed countries. The
next largest cause of death is cancer, which
is responsible for nearly one-quarter of
deaths.
Cigarette smoking is the greatest
preventable cause of illness and death in
Britain. However, there has been a significant
decline in the prevalence of smoking, with
31 per cent of adult males and 29 per cent of
adult females smoking cigarettes in 1990, as
against 52 and 41 per cent respectively in
1972. In 1992 the Government set out
strategies in England and Scotland for
continuing the overall improvement in health,
emphasising disease prevention and health
promotion.
The Government is pursuing a
comprehensive strategy against drug misuse
in Britain. Initiatives are aimed at reducing
both the supply of, and demand for, drugs.
A number of government priorities, aimed
at supporting the overall goals of improving
the country’s health and providing high-
quality care for those who need it, have been
listed.
Marriage and Divorce
Britain has one of the highest marriage and
divorce rates in the European Community.
In 1991 there were 340,500 marriages in
Great Britain, of which 37 per cent were
remarriages of one or both parties. Some
35 per cent of marriages in 1991 were
remarriages where one or both parties had
been divorced. Of the population aged 16 or
over in England and Wales in 1991, 58 per
cent were married, 27 per cent single, 9 per
cent widowed and 7 per cent divorced. The
average age for first marriages in England
and Wales is now about 27.5 for men and
25.5 for women.
In 1991 about 13 decrees of divorce were
made absolute for every 1,000 married
couples in England and Wales. The rates are
lower in Scotland and Northern Ireland. In
1991, 158,700 divorces were granted in
England and Wales. The average age of
people at the time of divorce in England
and Wales is now about 38.5 for men and 36
for women.
Another feature, common to many other
Western European countries, has been an
increase in cohabitation. Some 23 per cent of
non-married women aged 18-49 were
cohabiting in 1991, compared with 11 per
cent in 1979. Cohabitation is particularly high
(30 per cent) among divorced women, but
recently the largest increase has been for
single women.
There is some evidence of a growing
number of stable non-married relationships.
Half of all births outside marriage (which
now account for 31 per cent of live births in
Britain) are registered by both parents giving
a single address as their place of residence.

BRITAIN 1994: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Age and Sex Structure
The most significant changes in the age
structure of the population have been the
growing numbers of elderly people and the
decline in the proportion of young people.
The proportion of young people aged under
16 fell from 25.5 per cent in 1971 to 20.3 per
cent in 1991. During the same period the
proportion of elderly people (those aged 65
and over) increased from 13.2 to 15.7 per
cent. Some 18.3 per cent of the population
were over the normal retirement ages (65 for
men and 60 for women), compared with 14.7
per cent in 1961.
There is a ratio of about 105 females to
every 100 males. There are about 3 per cent
more male than female births every year.
Because of the higher mortality of men at all
ages, there is a turning point, at about 50
years of age, beyond which the number of
women exceeds the number of men. This
imbalance increases with age so that there are
many more women among the elderly.
Distribution of Population
The population density is about 239
inhabitants per sq km, which is well above
the EC average of about 146 per sq km. Of
the four lands, England is the most densely
populated, with 370 people per sq km.
Scotland is the least densely populated, with
66 people per sq km. Wales and Northern
Ireland have 139 and 118 people per sq km
respectively.
Since the 19th century there has been a
trend, especially in London, for people to
move away from congested urban centres into
the suburbs. Between 1981 and 1991 all
metropolitan counties (with the exception of
West Yorkshire) experienced small decreases
in population, the largest being in Merseyside
(5 per cent). There has also been a
geographical redistribution of the population,
away from Scotland and the northern regions
of England. The regions with the highest
rates of increase in population between 1981
and 1991 were East Anglia (10 per cent) and
the South West (8 per cent). Retirement
migration is also a feature of population
movement, the main recipient areas (where in
some towns the retired constitute over one-
quarter of the population) being the south
coast of England and East Anglia.
The population of the main urban
areas in mid-1991 was:
Greater London 6,889,900
Birmingham 1,006,500
Leeds 717,400
Glasgow 688,600
Sheffield 529,300
Liverpool 480,700
Bradford 475,400
Edinburgh 439,700
Manchester 438,500
Bristol 397,000
Coventry 305,600
Cardiff 293,600
Belfast 287,100
Migration
From 1988 to 1992 some 1.1 million people
left Britain (excluding the Channel Islands
and the Isle of Man) to live abroad and about
1.2 million came from overseas to live in
Britain, so that net immigration increased the
population by about 75,500. (These figures
exclude migration to and from the Irish
Republic.)
In 1992 the total inflow of people
intending to stay in Britain was 215,900,
some 20 per cent less than in 1991. The
outflow of people leaving to live abroad, at
227,000, was 5 per cent lower than in 1991.
Of the 227,000 departing residents in
1992:
• 30 per cent for other EC countries;
• 20 per cent left for Australia, Canada or
New Zealand;
• 10 per cent for other Commonwealth
countries;
• 20 per cent for the United States;
• 10 per cent for the Middle East; and
• 2 per cent for South Africa.
Of the 215,900 new residents in 1992:
• 20 per cent came from Australia, Canada
or New Zealand;
28
THE SOCIAL FRAMEWORK
• 20 per cent from other Commonwealth
countries;
• 30 per cent from other EC countries;
• 8 per cent from the United States;
• 3 per cent from the Middle East; and
• 3 per cent from South Africa.
Nationality
Under the British Nationality Act 1981 there
are three main forms of citizenship:
• British citizenship for people closely
connected with Britain, the Channel
Islands, and the Isle of Man;
• British Dependent Territories citizenship
for people connected with the dependent
territories (see p. 292); and
• British Overseas citizenship for those
citizens of the United Kingdom and
Colonies who did not acquire either of
the other citizenships when the 1981 Act
came into force.
British citizenship is acquired
automatically at birth by a child born in
Britain if his or her mother or father is a
British citizen or is settled in Britain. A child
adopted in Britain by a British citizen is a
British citizen. A child born abroad to a
British citizen born, adopted, naturalised or
registered in Britain is generally a British
citizen by descent. The Act safeguards the
citizenship of a child born abroad to a British
citizen in Crown service, certain related
services, or in service under an EC
institution.
British citizenship may also be acquired:
• by registration for certain children,
including those born in Britain who do
not automatically acquire such citizenship
at birth or who have been born abroad to
a parent who is a citizen by descent;
• by registration for British Dependent
Territories citizens, British Overseas
citizens, British subjects under the Act,
British Nationals (Overseas) and British
protected persons after five years’
residence in Britain, except for people
from Gibraltar, who may be registered
without residence;
• by registration for stateless people and
those who have previously renounced
British nationality; and
• by naturalisation for all other adults aged
18 or over.
Naturalisation is at the Home Secretary’s
discretion. It requires five years’ residence or
three years if the applicant’s spouse is a
British citizen. Other requirements include
good behaviour and sound mind. Those who
are not married to a British citizen are also
required to have a sufficient knowledge of
English, Welsh or Scottish Gaelic; they must
also intend to have their main home in
Britain or be employed by the Crown, by an
international organisation of which Britain is
a member, or by a company or association
established in Britain.
Legislation passed in 1983 conferred
British citizenship on Falkland Islanders who
did not acquire it under the 1981 Act.
Special arrangements covering the status of
British Dependent Territories citizens
connected with Hong Kong when the
territory returns to the People’s Republic of
China in 1997 are made by the Hong Kong
(British Nationality) Order 1986. Under this,
such citizens are entitled, before 1997, to
acquire a status known as British National
(Overseas) and to hold a passport in that
status. In addition, the British Nationality
(Hong Kong) Act 1990 made provision for
the registration as British citizens before 30
June 1997 of up to 50,000 people who are
able to meet certain criteria and who are
recommended by the Governor.
In 1992, 42,000 people acquired British
citizenship by naturalisation or registration in
Britain.
Immigration
Immigration into Britain is controlled under
the Immigration Rules made in accordance
with legislation passed in the 1970s and
1980s, and the Asylum and Immigration
Appeals Act 1993. These set out the
requirements to be met by those, excluding
British citizens, who seek entry to or leave to
remain in Britain. British citizens and those
Commonwealth citizens who had the right of
abode before 1 January 1983 maintain the
29
BRITAIN 1994: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
right of abode and are not subject to
immigration control.
Under the Immigration Rules nationals of
certain specified countries or territorial
entities must obtain a visa before they can
enter Britain. Other nationals subject to
immigration control require entry clearance
when coming to work or settle in Britain.
Visas and other entry clearances are normally
obtained from the nearest or other specified
British diplomatic post in a person’s home
country.
In accordance with Britain’s obligations
under the Treaty of Rome, EC nationals do
not require entry clearances, nor are they
subject to restrictions on their freedom to
take or seek work in Britain. Britain similarly
respects its obligations under the United
Nations Convention and Protocol relating to
the Status of Refugees. These provide that
refugees lawfully resident in a contracting
state should enjoy treatment as least as
favourable as that accorded to other foreign
nationals in similar circumstances.
In 1992, 9.2 million foreign and
Commonwealth nationals (excluding EC
nationals) were admitted to Britain. Some
53,000 people were accepted for settlement.
ETHNIC AND NATIONAL
MINORITIES
For centuries people from overseas have
settled in Britain, either to escape political or
religious persecution or in search of better
economic opportunities.
The Irish have long formed a large

section of the population. Jewish refugees
who came to Britain towards the end of
the 19th century and in the 1930s were
followed by other European refugees after
1945. Substantial immigration from the
Caribbean and the South Asian sub-continent
dates principally from the 1950s and 1960s.
There are also sizeable groups from the
United States and Canada, as well as
Australians, Chinese, Greek and Turkish
Cypriots, Italians and Spaniards. More
recently people from Latin America, Indo-
China and Sri Lanka have sought refuge in
Britain.
The 1991 census included for the first
time a question on ethnic grouping. This
found that 94.5 per cent of the population
belonged to the ‘white’ group, while just over
3 million people (5.5 per cent) described
themselves as belonging to another ethnic
group (see Table 6.1). Members of other
ethnic groups were heavily concentrated in
industrial and urban areas, and over half lived
in the South East. The highest proportion
was in the London borough of Brent: nearly
45 per cent of the population. Ethnic
minority groups also accounted for over a
third of the population in the London
boroughs of Newham, Tower Hamlets and
Hackney.
Outside London the main concentrations
were in Leicester, Slough, Bradford, the
West Midlands and the Pennine conurbation.
Regional concentrations varied among the
ethnic groups. About three-fifths of people
from black ethnic groups lived in London,
compared with about two-fifths of Indians
and 18 per cent of Pakistanis, who were
concentrated in other metropolitan areas such
as West Yorkshire.
According to the results of the Labour
Force Survey, nearly half of ethnic minority
groups were born in Britain. A higher
proportion is under 16 than for the white
group, but a much lower proportion
(4 per cent) is over pensionable age.
Economic activity rates for men of working
age in Great Britain tend to be similar to
those for the white groups. In spring 1993
they were 76 per cent for the black and
Indian groups, 73 per cent for the white
population and 69 per cent for the
30
THE SOCIAL FRAMEWORK
Pakistani/Bangladeshi group. The variations
are much greater for women: 62 per cent of
those from the black ethnic group were
economically active, compared with 57 per
cent in the Indian group, 53 per cent in the
white group and only 23 per cent in the
Pakistani/Bangladeshi group.
Alleviating Racial Disadvantage
Although many members of the black and
Asian communities are concentrated in the
inner cities, where there are problems of
deprivation and social stress, progress has
been made over the last 20 years in tackling
racial disadvantage in Britain.
Many individuals have achieved
distinction in their careers and in public life,
and the proportion of ethnic minority
members occupying professional and
managerial positions is increasing. There are
at present six ethnic minority Members of
Parliament, and the number of ethnic
minority councillors in local government is
growing. There has also been an expansion of
commercial enterprise, and numerous self-
help projects in ethnic minority communities
have been established. Black competitors have
represented Britain in a range of sporting
activities (such as athletics and football), and
ethnic minority talents in the arts and in
entertainment have increasingly been
recognised.
The principal means of combating
disadvantage is through the economic,
environmental, educational and health
programmes of central government and local
authorities. There are also special allocations,
mainly through Home Office grants and the
Urban Programme, which channel extra
resources into projects of specific benefit to
ethnic minorities. These include, for
example, the provision of specialist teachers
for children needing English language tuition,
business support services, and measures to
revive local economies and improve the inner
city environment. Cultural and recreational
schemes and the health and personal social
services also take account of the particular
needs of ethnic minorities.
The Government is promoting equal
opportunities for ethnic minorities through
training programmes, including greater
provision for unemployed people who
need training in English as a second
language.
In recognition of the tensions that can
arise between the police and ethnic
minorities, there is statutory consultation
between the police and the community.
Liaison work is also undertaken in schools.
Race Relations Act 1976
The Race Relations Act 1976 strengthened
previous legislation passed in the 1960s. It
makes discrimination unlawful on grounds of
colour, race, nationality or ethnic or national
origin in the provision of goods, facilities and
services, in employment, in housing and in
advertising. The 1976 Act also gave
complainants direct access to civil courts and,
for employment complaints, to industrial
tribunals.
It is a criminal offence to incite racial
hatred under the provisions of the Public
Order Act 1986.
Commission for Racial Equality
The Commission for Racial Equality was
established by the 1976 Act. It has power to
investigate unlawful discriminatory practices
and to issue non-discrimination notices,
requiring such practices to cease. It has an
important educational role and has issued
codes of practice in employment, education,
health care and housing. It also provides the
main advice to the general public about the
Race Relations Act and has discretion to
assist individuals with their complaints about
racial discrimination. In 1992 the Commission
registered 1,557 applications for assistance
and handled successfully 113 litigation cases.
It can also undertake or fund research.
The Commission supports the work of
over 80 racial equality councils. These are
autonomous voluntary bodies set up in most
areas with a significant ethnic minority
population to promote equality of
opportunity and good relations at the local
level. It helps pay the salaries of the racial
equality officers employed by the councils,
most of whom also receive funds from their
31
BRITAIN 1994: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
local authorities. It also gives grants to ethnic
minority self-help groups and to other
projects run by or for the benefit of the
minority communities.
THE ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL
PATTERN
Marked improvements in the standard of
living have taken place during the 20th
century. According to a United Nations
report on human development published
in 1993, Britain ranked tenth out of 173
countries on a human development index
that combines life expectancy, education
levels and basic purchasing power.
Britain has also performed well
economically. Growth between 1980 and 1990
was higher than in all other major EC
countries except Spain.
In the early 1990s Britain and many other
industrialised countries were affected by¬
recession, but Britain has been one of the
first countries to experience recovery from
the recession. Gross domestic product in
Britain declined by 0.4 per cent in 1992, but
there are signs of a recovery in 1993, with an
increase in manufacturing output and growth
in retail sales. Inflation levels have recently
been below 2 per cent.
Income and Wealth
Earnings from employment remain the main
source of household income for most people,
although the proportion of household income
(58 per cent in 1991) has been declining.
Sources which have become more important
are income from self-employment (10 per
cent in 1991) and private pensions and
annuities (9 per cent), as the numbers of
self-employed and the elderly respectively
have grown.
The distribution of pre-tax income has

Percent of households with goods
THE SOCIAL FRAMEWORK
remained relatively stable over a long period,
the lower 50 per cent of income earners
accounting for some 22 to 26 per cent of
pre-tax income since 1949. The combined
effect of the tax system and the receipt of
benefits is to redistribute incomes on a more
equal basis.
Wealth is less evenly distributed, with the
richest 1 per cent of the population aged 18
or over owning 18 per cent of marketable
wealth in 1991, and the richest 10 per cent
having 50 per cent. The inclusion of ‘non-
marketable’ rights in occupational and state
pension schemes reduces these shares
substantially, to 11 and 36 per cent
respectively. Since the mid-1970s there has
been little change in the distribution of
marketable wealth.
A growing proportion of personal wealth—
36 per cent in 1989—is in dwellings. The
proportion of net wealth held in shares
declined up to 1984, but has since increased.
The Government’s privatisation programme
has contributed to the growth in share
ownership. In early 1992 over one-fifth of the
adult population in Great Britain owned
shares, compared with one in 13 people in
1979.
Eating and Drinking Habits
The general level of nutrition remains high.
There has been a significant shift in eating
patterns over the last decade, reflecting
greater emphasis on convenience foods and
processed products. Changes in household
consumption of selected foods between 1982
and 1992 are shown in the diagram on p. 34.
Consumption of several items, such as packet
sugar, eggs, fresh potatoes and fresh green
vegetables, has declined substantially. Other
changes include:
• a decline in consumption of beef, lamb
and pork, which has been partly offset by
a continuing increase in poultry
consumption, which is now at a record
level;
• an increase in purchases of semi-skimmed
milk, so that skimmed milks now
constitute half of the total household
consumption of liquid milk;
• a rapid rise in consumption of vegetable
and salad oils and of low fat and dairy
spreads, while consumption of butter,
margarine and lard has been declining
substantially;
• a trend away from consumption of some
fresh green vegetables such as cabbages
and beans towards leafy salads and
cauliflowers;
• a large increase in purchases of fruit juice;
and
• a switch in fish consumption away from
fresh white fish towards canned fish and
shellfish.
Average mineral and nutrient intakes are
generally above the daily amounts
recommended by the Department of Health.
There has been a steady fall in fat intakes, and
a small increase in the intake of fibre. There is
some evidence that health considerations
influence food consumption, as in the move
away from whole milk and the growth in
wholemeal bread consumption. The
Government encourages the widest availability
of wholesome food, while giving high priority
to consumer safety.
There has been an increase in the number
of meals eaten away from home, for example,
in restaurants or at work, and a growth in the
consumption of food from ‘take-away’ and
‘fast-food’ shops.
There has been little change in alcohol
consumption in recent years. Beer and lager
(now estimated to account for over half of
beer sales) are the most popular drinks among
male drinkers, whose overall consumption is
significantly higher than that of women. The
largest consumers of alcohol are those aged 18
to 24, with consumption generally declining
with age. Consumption of table wine has
grown, although there has been little change
in the consumption of higher strength wines
such as sherry and port. The pattern of spirits
consumption has also been changing, with a
decline in whisky and gin, and higher
consumption of some other spirits.
A high proportion of beer is drunk in
public houses (‘pubs’), a traditional social
centre for many people, and in clubs. The
Licensing Act 1988 relaxed restrictions on the
opening hours of public houses, but this has
33

not resulted in a significant increase in
consumption. There are signs that they are
becoming more popular with families: more
meals are being served and the consumption
of non-alcoholic drinks is increasing.
Households
The average size of households in Great
Britain has fallen from over four people in
1911 to 3.09 in 1961 and 2.48 in 1992. The
fall reflects a greater number of people living
on their own (11 per cent of adults in 1991),
or in one-parent families, the increasing
number of old people (more of whom are
living alone) and the preference for smaller
families.
A large proportion of households, 67 per
cent, own or are buying their own homes.
Owner-occupation is higher among married
couples than for single, divorced or widowed
household heads. The number of owner-
occupied dwellings rose from over 4 million
in 1951 to nearly 16 million in 1992. Four-
fifths of British households live in houses
rather than flats.
Transport and the Environment
An important influence on the planning of
housing and services has been the growth of
car ownership; in 1991, 67 per cent of
households had the use of at least one car or
van, including 23 per cent with the use of
34
THE SOCIAL FRAMEWORK
two or more. Greater access to motorised
transport and the construction of a network
of modern trunk roads and motorways have
resulted in a considerable increase in personal
mobility and changed leisure patterns. Most
detached or semi-detached houses in new
suburban estates have garages. Out-of-town
shopping centres, often including large
supermarkets and do-it-yourself stores, are
usually planned with the motorist in mind.
Although the growth in car ownership has
brought benefits, there have been a number
of problems, notably, in many towns and
cities, increased congestion, noise and air
pollution arising from motor vehicle
emissions. Cars, taxis and motor cycles
accounted for 87 per cent of all passenger
transport in Great Britain in 1992, compared
with 55 per cent in 1961. To relieve road
congestion, the Government regards carefully
targeted improvements to the road system as
essential.
Women
The economic and domestic lives of women
have been transformed in the 20th century.
These changes are due partly to the removal
of much of sex discrimination in political and
legal rights. A major feature has been the rise
in the number of women, especially married
women, at work. With later marriages and
the availability of effective contraception
there has been a decline in family size.
Women are involved in childbearing for a
shorter time and this, together with
technological advances which have made
some tasks, such as housework, less onerous
and time-consuming, has made it possible for
women with children to combine child-
rearing with paid employment. The growth
of part-time and flexible working patterns,
and training and retraining schemes, allows
more women to take advantage of
employment opportunities.
Women make up more than two-fifths of
the workforce. Over two-thirds of non-
married working women aged 16-59 work full
time, compared with half of married women.
Married women are most likely to be in
ful-time work if they are aged 16 to 29 with
no children. More than two-fifths of all
women in employment work part time,
representing almost nine-tenths of all part-
time workers.
Although equal pay legislation was
intended to narrow the gap, there is still a
difference between men’s and women’s
earnings. In 1993 women’s average hourly
earnings were 79 per cent of men’s. Women’s
wages remain relatively low because they tend
to work in the lower-paid sectors of the
economy and work fewer hours than men
(the latter because of their domestic
commitments). A major reform in the
taxation of women came into effect in 1990,
when their earnings began to be taxed
separately rather than being treated as part of
their husbands’ income for tax purposes.
In April 1992 the Department of
Employment assumed responsibility for co¬
ordinating policy and strategy on women’s
issues. The Secretary of State set up a
working group to advise on practical
measures to extend equal opportunities for
women in the workplace and elsewhere.
In 1993 the Department launched ‘New
Horizons for Women’, a programme of
regional events. The objectives
include:
• raising awareness of the
opportunities available to women
in employment, training, and
public and community life;
• encouraging employers to be
flexible in their working practices
to enable women to contribute
fully in the workplace; and
• highlighting priority areas of
government policy.
One of these areas is a new childcare
initiative introduced to provide out-of-
school and holiday childcare. The
Government is to spend £45 million to
help set up over 50,000 out-of-school
childcare places in Great Britain over
the next three years.
In October 1991 the Government, as an
employer, joined the ‘Opportunity 2000’
35
BRITAIN 1994: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
campaign, an employer-led initiative to
increase the quantity and quality of women’s
participation in the workforce. Membership
stands at some 200 employers, with
organisations employing nearly a quarter of
the workforce being committed to the
campaign.
Equal Opportunities
The Sex Discrimination Acts 1975 and 1986
make discrimination between men and
women unlawful, with certain limited
exceptions, in employment, education,
training and the provision of housing, goods,
facilities and services. Discriminatory job
recruitment advertisements are also
unlawful. Complaints of discrimination
concerning employment are dealt with by
industrial tribunals; other complaints are
taken before county courts in England and
Wales or the Sheriff Court in Scotland.
Under the Equal Pay Act 1970, as amended
in 1984, women in Great Britain are entitled
to equal pay with men when doing work that
is the same or broadly similar, or work
which is rated as equivalent or work which
is of equal value. Parallel legislation on sex
discrimination and equal pay is in operation
in Northern Ireland.
The Equal Opportunities Commission,
set up in 1975 (1976 in Northern Ireland
under separate laws), has powers to
enforce some parts of the Sex
Discrimination and Equal Pay Acts. Its
statutory duties are to work towards the
elimination of sex discrimination, to promote
equality of opportunity, and to keep
legislation on sex discrimination and equal
pay under review, submitting proposals for
amending it to the Government. The
Commission may advise people of their
rights under the Acts and may give financial
or other assistance to help individuals
conduct a case before a court or tribunal. It
is empowered to carry out formal
investigations and issue notices requiring
discriminatory practices to stop. The
Commission also keeps sex discrimination
and equal pay legislation under review and
submits proposals for amending it to the
Government.
Voluntary Organisations
There is a long tradition in Britain of
voluntary service to the community, and
partnership between the voluntary and
statutory sectors is encouraged by the
Government. It has been estimated that about
half of all adults take part in some form of
voluntary work during the course of a year.
There are hundreds of thousands of
voluntary organisations, ranging from national
bodies to small local groups. ‘Self-help’
groups have been the fastest expanding area
over the last 20 or so years. Examples include
bodies which provide playgroups for pre¬
school children, or help their members to
cope with a particular disability. Groups
representing ethnic minorities and women’s
interests have also developed in recent years.
Many organisations belong to larger
associations or are represented on local or
national co-ordinating councils or committees.
Organisations may be staffed by professional
and/or voluntary workers.
A large proportion of volunteers are
involved in work which improves the quality
of life in their communities or more widely,
giving their time to help organise events or
groups in the arts and sport. A very large
number of volunteers are involved in
activities to protect or improve the
environment, working, for example, for the
National Trust, which has over 2 million
members (see p. 342). Voluntary
organisations are also important partners
as providers of government-supported
employment and training services for
unemployed people.
The Home Office Voluntary Services Unit
co-ordinates government interests in the
voluntary sector throughout Britain.
Funding
Voluntary organisations receive income from
several sources, including contributions from
individuals, businesses and trusts; central and
local government grants; and earnings from
commercial activities and investments. They
also receive fees (from central and local
government) for those services which are
provided on a contractual basis. In 1991-92
36
THE SOCIAL FRAMEWORK
direct grants to voluntary organisations from
government amounted to £490 million.
Tax changes in recent budgets have
helped the voluntary sector secure more
funds from industry and individuals. The
Gift Aid scheme, introduced in 1990,
provides tax relief on gifts of more than £250
in any one year. By the end of 1992 charities
had received donations of more than £351
million under the scheme and had claimed
tax repayments of £117 million on them.
Employees can now make tax-free donations
to charity from their earnings. The Payroll
Giving scheme provides tax relief on
donations of up to £900 a year.
Charities
There are over 170,000 charities registered in
England and Wales with the Charity
Commission. The Commission also gives
advice to trustees of charities on their
administration. Organisations may qualify for
charitable status if they are established for
purposes such as the relief of poverty, the
advancement of education or religion, or the
promotion of certain other purposes of public
benefit. These include good community
relations, the prevention of racial
discrimination, the protection of health and
the promotion of equal opportunity.
Legislation was passed in 1992 to strengthen
the Charity Commissioners’ powers of
investigation and supervision, and increase
the public accountability of charities.
The Charities Aid Foundation, an
independent body, is one of the main
organisations that aid the flow of funds to
charity from individuals, companies and
grant-making trusts.
Umbrella Organisations
The National Council for Voluntary
Organisations is the main co-ordinating body
in England, providing close links between
voluntary organisations, government
departments, local authorities, the European
Commission and the private sector; around
650 national voluntary organisations are
members. It also protects the interests and
independence of voluntary agencies, and
provides them with advice, information and
other services. Councils in Scotland, Wales
and Northern Ireland perform similar
functions. The National Association of
Councils for Voluntary Service is another
umbrella organisation providing resources,
with over 230 local councils for voluntary
service throughout England encouraging the
development of local voluntary action,
mainly in urban areas. The rural equivalent
is Action with Communities in Rural
England, representing 38 rural community
councils.
Leisure Trends
Some 15 per cent of total household
expenditure went on leisure goods and
services in 1992. The most common leisure
activities are home-based, or social, such as
visiting relatives or friends. Television
viewing is by far the most popular leisure
pastime, and nearly all households have a
television set, with 95 per cent in 1991
having a colour set. Average viewing time is
about 26 hours a week. Television viewing
has been declining slightly, but there has
been a significant increase in watching video
cassettes. Some 69 per cent of households
now have at least one video recorder,
compared with 30 per cent in 1985.
Listening to radio has been increasing,
and averages over 10 hours a week.
Purchases of compact discs have risen very
rapidly, and in 1992 for the first time
exceeded the sales of audio cassettes. The
proportion of households with a compact
disc player has grown considerably, from 15
per cent in 1989 to 27 per cent in 1991.
Other popular pursuits include: reading,
do-it-yourself home improvements,
gardening and going out for a meal, for a
drink or to the cinema. About half of
households have a pet, the most common
being dogs and cats, of which there are
thought to be roughly 7 million of each in
Britain.
Holidays
In 1991, over 90 per cent of full-time
manual employees were entitled to more
37
BRITAIN 1994: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
than four weeks paid holiday and 30 per cent
to five weeks; in 1961, 97 per cent were
entitled to only two weeks. In 1992, 59 per
cent of the adult population took at least one
long holiday of four or more nights away
from home. The number of long holidays
taken by British residents was nearly 54
million in 1992 (compared with 48 million in
1978), of which 32 million were taken in
Britain. The most frequented free attraction
in 1992 was Blackpool Pleasure Beach
(Lancashire), with 6.5 million visitors. The
most popular destinations for summer
holidays are the West Country, Scotland, and
Wales.
In 1992 the most popular destinations for
overseas holidays by British residents were:
• Spain (24 per cent);
• France (13 per cent);
• Greece (9 per cent); and
• the United States (8 per cent).
In all, British residents took nearly 22 million
holidays overseas in 1992, of which 60 per
cent involved ‘package’ arrangements. About
77 per cent of all holidays abroad are taken
in Europe. The proportion of adults taking
two or more holidays a year was 15 per cent
in 1992.

The system of parliamentary government in Britain is not based on a written
constitution, but is the result of gradual evolution over many centuries. The
monarchy is the oldest institution of government, dating back to at least the
ninth century. Parliament is one of the oldest representative assemblies in the
world. In government one of the most significant recent developments has
been the establishment of the Citizen’s Charter, designed to raise the
standards of public service.
Development of the British
System of Government
The growth of political institutions in
England can be traced back to the period of
Saxon rule, which lasted from the fifth
century AD until the Norman Conquest in
1066 (see p. 15). This period saw the origins
of the institution of kingship, and of the idea
that the king should seek the advice of a
council of prominent men.
The period of Norman rule after 1066 saw
a considerable strengthening of royal control.
However, the monarchy eventually
experienced difficulties in controlling the
growing machinery of government. The
actions of King John (1199-1216) led to
opposition from feudal barons and leading
figures in the Church. In 1215 the barons
forced the King to agree to a series of
concessions embodied in a charter which
became known as Magna Carta. The charter,
which provided for the protection of the
rights of feudal proprietors against the abuse
of royal power, came to be regarded as the
key expression of the rights of the
community against the Crown.
The term ‘Parliament’ was first officially
used in 1236 to describe the gathering of
feudal barons and representatives of counties
and towns which the king summoned if
extraordinary taxation was required. By the
15th century Parliament had acquired the
right to make laws (see p. 46).
A clash between the monarchy and
Parliament led to the outbreak of the Civil
War in 1642. Following the defeat of the
royalist armies and the execution of King
Charles I in 1649, the monarchy and the
House of Lords were abolished and the
country was proclaimed a republic. However,
the republican experiment came to an end in
1660, two years after the death of the ‘Lord
Protector’, Oliver Cromwell. Charles Fs son
was restored to the throne as King Charles II.
Charles IPs successor, King James II
(1685-88), attempted to rule without the
consent of Parliament. As a result, in 1688 a
group of leading men invited William of
41
BRITAIN 1994: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Orange (a grandson of Charles I and the
husband of Mary, James IPs eldest daughter)
to ‘secure the infringed liberties’ of the
country. James II fled into exile. Following
the success of the revolution of 1688,
Parliament in 1689 passed the Bill of Rights,
which made it impracticable for the Sovereign
to ignore the wishes of Parliament. To enable
the Sovereign and Parliament to work
together, a group of ministers, or cabinet,
became the link between the executive and
the legislature. Although the ministers were
appointed by the Sovereign, they had to have
sufficient support in the House of Commons
to enable them to persuade Parliament to pass
legislation and vote for taxation.
A few years after the accession to the
throne of George I in 1714, the monarch
ceased to attend Cabinet meetings and none
of his successors did thereafter. Instead, the
Cabinet was presided over by the First Lord
of the Treasury, who came to be known as
the Prime Minister. After that the individual
influence of the monarch in exercising
executive power declined with a
corresponding increase in that of the Cabinet
as a whole. Sir Robert Peel, Prime Minister
from 1841 to 1846, was probably the first
holder of his office to perform a role similar
to that of a modern Prime Minister. Since the
mid-19th century the Prime Minister has
normally been the leader of the party with a
majority in the House of Commons.
The Reform Act 1832 reformed the system
of parliamentary representation, which dated
from medieval times. It also standardised the
qualifications for the right to vote. The Act
started a train of events which led to all
adults (with a few exceptions—see p. 49)
receiving the vote and direct popular control
over the House of Commons, a process which
was completed early in the 20th century.
The British Constitution
The British constitution is to a large extent a
product of the historical events described
above. Unlike the constitutions of most other
countries, it is not set out in any single
document. Instead it is made up of statute
law, common law and conventions.
(Conventions are rules and practices which
are not legally enforceable but which are
regarded as indispensable to the working of
government.)
The constitution can be altered by Act of
Parliament, or by general agreement. The
constitution is thus adaptable to changing
political conditions.
The organs of government overlap but can
be clearly distinguished. Parliament is the
legislature and the supreme authority. The
executive consists of:
• the Government—the Cabinet and other
ministers responsible for national policies;
• government departments, responsible for
national administration;
• local authorities, responsible for many
local services; and
• public corporations, responsible for
operating particular nationalised
industries or other bodies, subject to
ministerial control.
The judiciary (see Chapter 8) determines
common law and interprets statutes.
The Monarchy
The monarchy is the oldest institution of
government, going back to at least the ninth
century. Queen Elizabeth II is herself directly
descended from King Egbert, who united
England under his rule in 829. The only
interruption in the history of the monarchy
was the republic, which lasted from 1649 to
1660 (see p. 41).
Today the Queen is not only head of
State, but also an important symbol of
national unity. The royal title in Britain is:
‘Elizabeth the Second, by the Grace of God
of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and
Northern Ireland and of Her other Realms
and Territories Queen, Head of the
Commonwealth, Defender of the Faith’.
In the Channel Islands and the Isle of
Man the Queen is represented by a
Lieutenant-Governor.
The Commonwealth
Although the seat of the monarchy is in
Britain, the Queen is also head of state of a
42
BRITAIN 1994: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
number of Commonwealth states.1 In each
such state the Queen is represented by a
Governor-General, appointed by her on the
advice of the ministers of the country
concerned and completely independent of the
British Government. In each case the form of
the royal title varies. Other member states are
republics or have their own monarchies.
In British dependent territories the Queen
is usually represented by governors, who are
responsible to the British Government for the
administration of the countries concerned.
Succession
The title to the Crown is derived partly from
statute and partly from common law rules of
descent. Despite interruptions in the direct
line of succession, the hereditary principle
upon which it was founded has always been
preserved.
Sons of the Sovereign have precedence
over daughters in succeeding to the throne.
When a daughter succeeds, she becomes
Queen Regnant, and has the same powers as
a king. The consort of a king takes her
husband’s rank and style, becoming Queen.
The constitution does not give any special
rank or privileges to the husband of a Queen
Regnant, although in practice he fills an
important role in the life of the nation, as
does the Duke of Edinburgh.
Under the Act of Settlement of 1700,
which formed part of the Revolution
Settlement following the events of 1688 (see
p. 42), only Protestant descendants of a
granddaughter of James I of England and VI
of Scotland (Princess Sophia, the Electress of
Hanover) are eligible to succeed. The order
of succession can be altered only by common
consent of the countries of the
Commonwealth.
Accession
The Sovereign succeeds to the throne as soon
as his or her predecessor dies: there is no
The other Commonwealth countries of which the Queen is head
of state are: Antigua and Barbuda, Australia, Bahamas, Barbados,
Belize, Canada, Grenada, Jamaica, New Zealand, Papua New
Guinea, Saint Christopher and Nevis, Saint Lucia, Saint Vincent
and the Grenadines, Solomon Islands and Tuvalu.
interregnum. He or she is at once
proclaimed at an Accession Council, to
which all members of the Privy Council (see
p. 61) are summoned. The Lords Spiritual
and Temporal (see p. 48), the Lord Mayor
and Aldermen and other leading citizens of
the City of London are also invited.
Coronation
The Sovereign’s coronation follows the
accession after a convenient interval. The
ceremony takes place at Westminster
Abbey in London, in the presence of
representatives of the Houses of Parliament
and of all the great public organisations in
Britain. The Prime Ministers and leading
members of the other Commonwealth
nations and representatives of other
countries also attend.
The Monarch’s Role in Government
The Queen personifies the State. In law, she
is head of the executive, an integral part of
the legislature, head of the judiciary, the
commander-in-chief of all the armed forces
of the Crown and the ‘supreme governor’ of
the established Church of England. As a
result of a long process of evolution, during
which the monarchy’s absolute power has
been progressively reduced, the Queen acts
on the advice of her ministers. Britain is
governed by Her Majesty’s Government in
the name of the Queen.
Within this framework, and in spite of a
trend during the past hundred years towards
giving powers directly to ministers, the
Queen still takes part in some important
acts of government. These include
summoning, proroguing (discontinuing until
the next session without dissolution) and
dissolving Parliament; and giving Royal
Assent to Bills passed by Parliament. The
Queen also formally appoints many
important office holders, including
government ministers, judges, officers in the
armed forces, governors, diplomats, bishops
and some other senior clergy of the Church
of England. She is also involved in
pardoning people convicted of crimes; and
in conferring peerages, knighthoods and
44
GOVERNMENT
other honours.2 An important function is
appointing the Prime Minister: by convention
the Queen invites the leader of the political
party which commands a majority in the
House of Commons to form a government. In
international affairs the Queen, as head of
State, has the power to declare war and make
peace, to recognise foreign states and
governments, to conclude treaties and to
annex or cede territory.
With rare exceptions (such as appointing
the Prime Minister), acts involving the use of
‘royal prerogative’ powers are now performed
by government ministers, who are responsible
to Parliament and can be questioned about
particular policies. Parliamentary authority is
not required for the exercise of these
prerogative powers, although Parliament may
restrict or abolish such rights.
The Queen continues to play an important
role in the working of government. She holds
Privy Council meetings, gives audiences to her
ministers and officials in Britain and overseas,
receives accounts of Cabinet decisions, reads
dispatches and signs state papers. She must
be consulted on every aspect of national life,
and must show complete impartiality.
Provision has been made to appoint a
regent to perform these royal functions
should the Queen be totally incapacitated.
'The regent would be the Queen’s eldest son,
the Prince of Wales, then those, in order of
succession to the throne, who are of age. In
the event of the Queen’s partial incapacity or
absence abroad, the Queen may delegate
certain royal functions to the Counsellors of
State (the Duke of Edinburgh, the four adults
next in line of succession, and the Queen
Mother). However, Counsellors of State may
not, for instance, dissolve Parliament (except
on the Queen’s instructions), nor create peers.
Ceremonial and Royal Visits
Ceremonial has always been associated with
the British monarchy, and, in spite of changes
in the outlook of both the Sovereign and the
people, many traditional ceremonies continue
2 Although most honours are conferred by the Queen on the
advice of the Prime Minister, a few are granted by her
personally—the Order of the Garter, the Order of the Thistle,
the Order of Merit and the Royal Victorian Order.
to take place. Royal marriages and royal
funerals are marked by public ceremony, and
the Sovereign’s birthday is officially
celebrated in June by Trooping the Colour
on Horse Guards Parade. State banquets take
place when a foreign monarch or head of
State visits Britain; investitures are held at
Buckingham Palace and the Palace of
Holyroodhouse in Scotland to bestow
honours; and royal processions add
significance to such occasions as the state
opening of Parliament.
Each year the Queen and other members
of the royal family visit many parts of
Britain. Their presence at events of national
and local importance attracts considerable
interest. They are also closely involved in the
work of many charities. The Queen pays state
visits to foreign governments, accompanied
by the Duke of Edinburgh. She also tours the
other countries of the Commonwealth. Other
members of the royal family pay official visits
overseas, occasionally representing the Queen,
or often in connection with an organisation
with which they are associated.
Royal Income and Expenditure
Until 1760 the Sovereign had to provide for
payment of all government expenses,
including the salaries of officials and the
expenses of the royal palaces and households.
These were met from hereditary revenues,
mainly income from Crown lands, and
income from some other sources granted to
the monarch by Parliament. The income
from these sources eventually proved
inadequate and in 1760 King George III
turned over to the Government most of the
hereditary revenue. In return he received an
annual grant (Civil List) from which he
continued to pay the royal expenditure of a
personal character and also the salaries of
government officials and certain pensions.
The latter charges were removed from the
Civil List in 1830.
Present Arrangements
Today the expenditure incurred by the
Queen in carrying out her public duties is
financed from the Civil List and from
45
BRITAIN 1994: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
government departments (which meet the
cost of, for example, the Royal Yacht and the
aircraft of the Queen’s Flight). All such
expenditure is approved by Parliament. In
1991 Civil List payments were fixed at
£7.9 million a year for ten years. About
three-quarters of the Queen’s Civil List
provision is required to meet the cost of staff.
These deal with, among other things, state
papers and correspondence and the
organisation of state occasions, visits and
other public engagements undertaken by the
Queen in Britain and overseas. The Queen’s
private expenditure as Sovereign is met from
the Privy Purse, which is financed mainly
from the revenue of the Duchy of Lancaster;3
her expenditure as a private individual is met
from her own personal resources.
Since April 1993 the Queen has
voluntarily paid income tax on all her
personal income and on that part of
the Privy Purse income which is used
for private purposes. The Queen also
pays tax on any realised capital gains
on her private investments and on the
private proportion of assets in the
Privy Purse. Inheritance tax will not,
however, apply to transfers from one
sovereign to his or her successor,
although any personal bequests other
than to the successor will be subject to
inheritance tax. In line with these
changes the Prince of Wales pays
income tax on the income from the
Duchy of Cornwall to the extent that it
is used for private purposes.
Under the Civil List Acts, other members
of the royal family also receive annual
parliamentary allowances to enable them to
carry out their public duties. The Prince of
Wales, however, receives no such allowance,
since as Duke of Cornwall he is entitled to
the income of the estate of the Duchy of
Cornwall. Each year the Queen pays the
Government a sum equivalent to that
provided by Parliament for all members of
3 The Duchy of Lancaster is an inheritance which, since 1399,
has alw'ays been enjoyed by the reigning Sovereign. It is kept
quite apart from his or her other possessions and is separately

the royal family except the Queen Mother
and the Duke of Edinburgh.
Parliament
Origins of Parliament
The medieval kings were expected to meet all
royal expenses, private and public, out of
their own revenue. If extra resources were
needed for an emergency, such as a war, the
Sovereign would seek to persuade his barons,
in the Great Council—a gathering of leading
men which met several times a year—to grant
an aid. During the 13th century several kings
found the private revenues and baronial aids
insufficient to meet the expenses of govern¬
ment. They therefore summoned not only the
great feudal magnates but also representatives
of counties, cities and towns, primarily to get
their assent to extraordinary taxation. In this
way the Great Council came to include those
who were summoned by name (those who,
broadly speaking, were to form the House of
Lords) and those who were representatives of
communities—the commons. The two parts,
together with the Sovereign, became known
as ‘Parliament’ (the term originally meant a
meeting for parley or discussion).
Over the course of time the commons
began to realise the strength of their position.
By the middle of the 14th century the
formula had appeared which in substance was
the same as that used nowadays in voting
supplies to the Crown—that is, money to the
Government—namely, ‘by the Commons
with the advice of the Lords Spiritual and
Temporal’. In 1407 Henry IV pledged that
henceforth all money grants should be
approved by the House of Commons before
being considered by the Lords.
A similar advance was made in the
legislative field. Originally the King’s
legislation needed only the assent of his
councillors. Starting with the right of
individual commoners to present petitions,
the Commons as a body gained the right to
submit collective petitions. Later, during the
15th century, they gained the right to
participate in giving their requests—their
‘Bills’—the form of law.
46
GOVERNMENT
The subsequent development of the power
of the House of Commons was built upon
these foundations. The constitutional
developments of the 17th century (see p. 42)
led to Parliament securing its position as the
supreme legislative authority.
The Powers of Parliament
The three elements which make up
Parliament—the Queen, the House of Lords
and the elected House of Commons—are
constituted on different principles. They
meet together only on occasions of symbolic
significance such as the state opening of
Parliament, when the Commons are
summoned by the Queen to the House of
Lords. The agreement of all three elements is
normally required for legislation, but that of
the Queen is given as a matter of course to
Bills sent to her.
Parliament can legislate for Britain as a
whole, or for any part of the country. It can
also legislate for the Channel Islands and the
Isle of Man, which are Crown dependencies
and not part of Britain. They have local
legislatures which make laws on island affairs.
As there are no legal restraints imposed by
a written constitution, Parliament may
legislate as it pleases, subject to Britain’s
obligations as a member of the European
Community. It can make or change any law,
and overturn established conventions or turn
them into law. It can even prolong its own
life beyond the normal period without
consulting the electorate.
In practice, however, Parliament does not
assert its supremacy in this way. Its members
bear in mind the common law and normally
act in accordance with precedent. The House
of Commons is directly responsible to the
electorate, and in this century the House of
Lords has recognised the supremacy of the
elected chamber. The system of party
government helps to ensure that Parliament
legislates with its responsibility to the
electorate in mind.
The European Community
As a member of the European Community,
Britain recognises the various types of
Community legislation and wider policies. It
sends 81 elected members to the European
Parliament (see pp. 290-1).
The Functions of Parliament
The main functions of Parliament are:
• to pass laws;
• to provide, by voting for taxation, the
means of carrying on the work of
government;
• to scrutinise government policy and
administration, including proposals for
expenditure; and
• to debate the major issues of the day.
In carrying out these functions Parliament
helps to bring the relevant facts and issues
before the electorate. By custom, Parliament
is also informed before all important
international treaties and agreements are
ratified. The making of treaties is, however, a
royal prerogative exercised on the advice of
the Government and is not subject to
parliamentary approval.
The Meeting of Parliament
A Parliament has a maximum duration of five
years, but in practice general elections are
usually held before the end of this term. The
maximum life has been prolonged by
legislation in rare circumstances such as the
two world wars. Parliament is dissolved and
writs for a general election are ordered by the
Queen on the advice of the Prime Minister.
The life of a Parliament is divided into
sessions. Each usually lasts for one year—
normally beginning and ending in October or
November. There are ‘adjournments’ at
night, at weekends, at Christmas, Easter and
the late Spring Bank Holiday, and during a
long summer break starting in late July or
early August. The average number of ‘sitting’
days in a session is about 160 in the House of
Commons and about 145 in the House of
Lords. At the start of each session the
Queen’s speech to Parliament outlines the
Government’s policies and proposed
legislative programme. Each session is ended
by prorogation. Parliament then ‘stands
47
BRITAIN 1994: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
prorogued’ for about a week until the new
session opens. Prorogation brings to an end
nearly all parliamentary business: in
particular, public Bills which have not been
passed by the end of the session are lost.
The House of Lords
The House of Lords consists of the Lords
Spiritual and the Lords Temporal. The
Lords Spiritual are the Archbishops of
Canterbury and York, the Bishops of
London, Durham and Winchester, and the 21
next most senior diocesan bishops of the
Church of England. The Lords Temporal
consist of:
• all hereditary peers and peeresses of
England, Scotland, Great Britain and the
United Kingdom (but not peers of
Ireland);
• life peers created to assist the House in
its judicial duties (Lords of Appeal or
‘law lords’);4 and
• all other life peers.
Hereditary peerages carry a right to sit in
the House provided holders establish their
claim and are aged 21 years or over.
However, anyone succeeding to a peerage
may, within 12 months of succession, disclaim
that peerage for his or her lifetime.
Disclaimants lose their right to sit in the
House but gain the right to vote and stand as
candidates at parliamentary elections. When a
disclaimant dies, the peerage passes on down
the family in the usual way.
Peerages, both hereditary and life, are
created by the Sovereign on the advice of the
Prime Minister. They are usually granted in
recognition of service in politics or other
walks of life or because one of the political
parties wishes to have the recipient in the
House of Lords. The House also provides a
place in Parliament for people who offer
useful advice, but do not wish to be involved
in party politics.
Some peers with a writ of summons to the
House of Lords never claim it. (In mid-1993
there were 85 peers without writs.) Nor do all
4The House of Lords is the final court of appeal for civil cases in
Britain and for criminal cases in England, Wales and Northern
Ireland.
peers with writs regularly attend the sittings.
Peers who attend the House (the average
daily attendance is some 375) receive no
salary for their parliamentary work, but can
claim for expenses incurred in attending the
House (for which there are maximum daily
rates) and certain travelling expenses. Some
peers (86 in mid-1993) apply for Leave of
Absence, indicating that they do not intend
to come to the House at all.
Officers of the House of Lords
The House is presided over by the Lord
Chancellor, who takes his place on the
woolsack1 as ex-officio Speaker of the House.
In his absence his place is taken by a deputy.
The first of the deputy speakers is the
Chairman of Committees, who is appointed
at the beginning of each session and normally
chairs most committees. The Chairman and
the Principal Deputy Chairman of
Committees are the only Lords who receive
salaries as officers of the House.
In mid-1993 there were 1,183 members
of the House of Lords, including the
two archbishops and 24 bishops. The
Lords Temporal consisted of 760
hereditary peers who had succeeded to
their titles, 15 hereditary peers who
had had their titles conferred on them
(including the Prince of Wales), and
382 life peers, of whom 19 were ‘law
lords’.
The Clerk of the Parliaments is
responsible for the records of proceedings
of the House of Lords and for the text of
Acts of Parliament. He is the accounting
officer for the cost of the House, and is in
charge of the administrative staff of the
House, known as the Parliament Office.
The Gentleman Usher of the Black Rod,
usually known as ‘Black Rod’, is responsible
for security, accommodation and services in
the House of Lords’ part of the Palace of
Westminster.
The woolsack is a seat in the form of a large cushion stuffed
with wool from several Commonwealth countries; it is a tradition
dating from the medieval period, when wool was the chief source
of the country’s wealth.
48
GOVERNMENT
The House of Commons
The House of Commons is elected by
universal adult suffrage (see below) and
consists of 651 Members of Parliament
(MPs). At present there are 60 women, three
Asian and three black MPs. Of the 651 seats,
524 are for England, 38 for Wales, 72 for
Scotland, and 17 for Northern Ireland.
General elections are held after a
Parliament has been dissolved and a new one
summoned by the Queen. When an MP dies
or resigns,6 or is given a peerage, a by-
election takes place. Members are paid an
annual salary of £30,854 (from January 1993)
and an office costs allowance of up to
£40,380. There are also a number of other
allowances, including travel allowances, a
supplement for London members and, for
provincial members, subsistence allowances
and allowances for second homes. (For
ministers’ salaries see p. 59.)
Officers of the House of Commons
The chief officer of the House of Commons
is the Speaker, elected by MPs to preside
over the House. Other officers include the
Chairman of Ways and Means and two
deputy chairmen, who act as Deputy
Speakers. They are elected by the House on
the nomination of the Government but are
drawn from the Opposition as well as the
government party. They, like the Speaker,
neither speak nor vote other than in their
official capacity. Overall responsibility for the
administration of the House rests with the
House of Commons Commission, a statutory
body chaired by the Speaker.
Permanent officers (who are not MPs)
include the Clerk of the House of Commons,
who is the principal adviser to the Speaker on
its privileges and procedures. The Clerk’s
departmental responsibilities relate to the
conduct of the business of the House and its
committees. The Clerk is also accounting
officer for the House. The Serjeant-at-Arms,
who waits upon the Speaker, carries out
6 An MP who wishes to resign from the House can only do so by
applying for an office under the Crown as Crown Steward or
Bailiff of the Chiltern Hundreds, or Steward of the Manor of
Northstead.
certain orders of the House. He is also the
official housekeeper of the Commons’ part
of the building, and is responsible for
security. Other officers serve the House in
the Library, the Department of the Official
Report (Hansard), the Finance and
Administration Department and the
Refreshment Department.
Parliamentary Electoral System
For electoral purposes Britain is divided
into constituencies, each of which returns
one member to the House of Commons. To
ensure that constituency electorates are kept
roughly equal, four permanent
Parliamentary Boundary Commissions, one
each for England, Wales, Scotland and
Northern Ireland, keep constituencies under
review. They recommend any adjustment of
seats that may seem necessary in the light
of population movements or other changes.
The Government has introduced legislation
to shorten the intervals at which reviews are
carried out. Elections are by secret ballot.
Voters
British citizens, together with citizens of
other Commonwealth countries and citizens
of the Irish Republic resident in Britain,
may vote provided they are aged 18 or over,
included in the annual register of electors
for the constituency and not subject to any
disqualification. People not entitled to vote
include members of the House of Lords,
patients detained under mental health
legislation, sentenced prisoners and people
convicted within the previous five years of
corrupt or illegal election practices.
Members of the armed forces, Crown
servants and staff of the British Council
employed overseas (together with their
wives or husbands if accompanying them)
may be registered for an address in the
constituency where they would live but for
their service. The Representation of the
People Act 1989 extended the right to vote
for British citizens living abroad by
increasing from 5 to 20 years the period
during which they may apply to be
registered to vote.

BRI TAIN 1994: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Voting Procedures
Each elector may cast one vote, normally in
person at a polling station. Electors whose
circumstances on polling day are such that
they cannot reasonably be expected to vote in
person at their local polling station—for
example, electors away on holiday—may
apply for an absent vote at a particular
election. Electors who are physically
incapacitated or unable to vote in person
because of the nature of their work or
because they have moved to a new area may
apply for an indefinite absent vote. People
entitled to an absent vote may vote by post
or by proxy, although postal ballot papers
cannot be sent to addresses outside Britain.
Voting is not compulsory; 76.9 per cent
of a total electorate of 43.3 million
people voted in the general election in
April 1992. The simple majority
system of voting is used. Candidates
are elected if they have more votes
than any of the other candidates
(although not necessarily an absolute
majority over all other candidates).
Candidates
British citizens and citizens of other
Commonwealth countries, together with
citizens of the Irish Republic, may stand for
election as MPs provided they are aged 21 or
over and are not disqualified. Those
disqualified include undischarged bankrupts;
people sentenced to more than one year’s
imprisonment; clergy of the Church of
England, Church of Scotland, Church of
Ireland and Roman Catholic Church; peers;
and holders of certain offices listed in the
House of Commons Disqualification Act
1975. The latter include holders of judicial
office, civil servants, some local government
officers, members of the regular armed
forces, police officers, some members of
public corporations and government
commissions, and British members of the
legislature of any country outside the
Commonwealth. A candidate’s nomination for
election must be proposed and seconded by
two electors registered as voters in the
constituency and signed by eight other
electors.
Candidates do not have to be backed by a
political party. A candidate must also deposit
£500, which is returned if he or she receives
5 per cent or more of the votes cast.
The maximum sum a candidate may
spend on a general election campaign is
£4,330 plus 3.7 pence for each elector in a
borough constituency, or 4.9 pence for each
elector in a county constituency. Higher
limits have been set for by-elections in order
to reflect the fact that they are often regarded
as tests of national opinion in the period
between general elections. The maximum
sum is £17,323 plus 14.7 pence for each
elector in borough seats, and 19.4 pence for
each elector in county seats. A candidate may
post an election address to each elector in the
constituency, free of charge. All election
expenses, apart from the candidate’s personal
expenses, are subject to the statutory limit.
The Political Party System
The party system, which has existed in one
form or another since the 18th century, is an
essential element in the working of the
constitution. The present system depends
upon the existence of organised political
parties, each of which presents its policies to
the electorate for approval. The parties are
not registered nor formally recognised in law,
but in practice most candidates in elections,
and almost all winning candidates, belong to
one of the main parties.
For the last 150 years a predominantly
two-party system has existed. Since 1945
either the Conservative Party, the origins of
which go back to the 18th century, or the
Labour Party, which emerged in the last
decade of the 19th century, has held power.
A new party—the Liberal Democrats—was
formed in 1988 when the Liberal Party,
which could trace its origins to the 18th
century, merged with the Social Democratic
Party, which was formed in 1981. Other
parties include two nationalist parties, Plaid
Cymru (founded in Wales in 1925) and the
Scottish National Party (founded in 1934). In
Northern Ireland there are a number of
50
GOVERNMENT
parties. They include the Ulster Unionist
Party, formed in the early part of this century;
the Democratic Unionist Party, founded in
1971 by a group which broke away from the
Ulster Unionists; and the Social Democratic
and Labour Party, founded in 1970.
Since 1945 eight general elections have
been won by the Conservative Party and six
by the Labour Party; the great majority of
members of the House of Commons have
belonged to one of these two parties. The
number and percentages of votes cast for the
main political parties in the last general
election of April 1992 and the resulting
distribution of seats in the House of
Commons are shown in Table 7.1.
The party which wins most seats (although
not necessarily the most votes) at a general
election, or which has the support of a
majority of members in the House of
Commons, usually forms the Government. By
tradition, the leader of the majority party is
asked by the Sovereign to form a government.
About 100 of its members in the House of
Commons and the House of Lords receive
ministerial appointments (including
appointment to the Cabinet—see p. 60) on
the advice of the Prime Minister. The largest
minority party becomes the official
Opposition, with its own leader and ‘shadow
cabinet’.
The Party System in Parliament
Leaders of the Government and Opposition
sit on the front benches of the Commons
with their supporters (the backbenchers)
sitting behind them.
Similar arrangements for the parties also
apply to the House of Lords; however, Lords
who do not wish to be associated with any
political party may sit on the ‘cross-benches’.
The effectiveness of the party system in
Parliament rests largely on the relationship
between the Government and the opposition
parties. Depending on the relative strengths
of the parties in the House of Commons, the
Opposition may seek to overthrow the
Government by defeating it in a vote on a
‘matter of confidence’. In general, however,
its aims are to contribute to the formulation
of policy and legislation by constructive
criticism; to oppose government proposals it
considers objectionable; to seek amendments
to government Bills; and to put forward its
own policies in order to improve its chances
of winning the next general election.
Government business arrangements are
settled, under the direction of the Prime
Minister and the Leaders of the two Houses,
by the Government Chief Whip in
consultation with the Opposition Chief Whip.
The Chief Whips together constitute the
‘usual channels’ often referred to when the
question of finding time for a particular item
of business is discussed. The Leaders of the
two Houses are responsible for enabling the
Houses to debate matters about which they
are concerned.
Outside Parliament, party control is
exercised by the national and local
organisations. Inside, it is exercised by the

Chief Whips and their assistants, who are
chosen within the party. Their duties include
keeping members informed of forthcoming
parliamentary business, maintaining the
party’s voting strength by ensuring members
attend important debates, and passing on to
the party leadership the opinions of
backbench members. The Whips indicate the
importance their party attaches to a vote on a
particular issue by underlining items of
business (once, twice or three times) on the
notice sent to MPs. Failure to comply with a
‘three-line whip’ (the most important) is
usually seen as a rebellion against the party.
Party discipline tends to be less strong in the
Lords than in the Commons, since Lords
have less hope of high office and no need of
party support in elections.
The formal title of the Government Chief
Whip in the Commons is Parliamentary
Secretary to the Treasury. Of the other
Government Whips, three are officers of the
Royal Household (one of these is Deputy
Chief Whip), five hold titular posts as Lords
Commissioners of the Treasury and five are
Assistant Whips. The Opposition Chief Whips
in both Houses and two of the Opposition
Assistant Whips in the Commons receive
salaries. The Government Whips in the
Lords hold offices in the Royal Household;
they also act as government spokesmen.
Financial Assistance to Parties
Annual assistance from public funds helps
opposition parties carry out parliamentary
work at Westminster. It is limited to parties
which had at least two members elected at
the previous general election or one member
elected and a minimum of 150,000 votes cast.
The amount is £2,550 for every seat won at
the previous general election, plus £5.10 for
every 200 votes.
Parliamentary Procedure
Parliamentary procedure is based on custom
and precedent, partly codified by each House
in its Standing Orders. The system of debate
is similar in both Houses. Every subject starts
off as a proposal or ‘motion’ by a member.
After debate, in which each member may
speak only once, the Speaker or Chairman
‘puts the question’ whether to agree with the
motion or not. The question may be decided
without voting, or by a simple majority vote.
The main difference of procedure between
the two Houses is that the Speaker or
Chairman in the Lords has no powers of
order; instead such matters are decided by
the general feeling of the House.
In the Commons the Speaker has full
authority to enforce the rules of the House
and must guard against the abuse of
procedure and protect minority rights. The
Speaker has discretion on whether to allow a
motion to end discussion so that a matter
may be put to the vote and has powers to put
a stop to irrelevance and repetition in debate,
and to save time in other ways. In cases of
grave disorder the Speaker can adjourn or
suspend the sitting. The Speaker may order
members who have broken the rules of
behaviour of the House to leave the Chamber
or he or she can initiate their suspension for
a period of days.
The Speaker supervises voting in the
Commons and announces the final result. In
a tied vote the Speaker gives a casting vote,
without expressing an opinion on the merits
of the question. The voting procedure in the
House of Lords is broadly similar.
Financial Interests
The Commons has a public register of MPs’
financial interests. Members with a financial
interest in a debate in the House must
declare it when speaking. To act as a
disqualification from voting the interest must
be direct, immediate and personal. In other
proceedings of the House or in dealings with
other members, ministers or civil servants,
MPs must also disclose any relevant financial
interest.
There is no register of financial interests
in the Lords, but Lords speaking in a debate
in which they have a direct interest are
expected to declare it. Lords by custom speak
‘on their honour’.
Public Access to Parliamentary Proceedings
Proceedings of both Houses are normally
52
GOVERNMENT
public. The minutes and speeches
(transcribed verbatim in Hansard) are
published daily.
The records of the Lords from 1497 and
of the Commons from 1547, together with the
parliamentary and political papers of a
number of former members of both Houses,
are available to the public through the House
of Lords Record Office.
The proceedings of both Houses of
Parliament may be broadcast on television
and radio, either live or, more usually, in
recorded or edited form. Complete coverage
is available on cable television.
The Law-making Process
The law undergoes constant reform in the
courts as established principles are clarified or
reapplied to meet new circumstances.
Fundamental changes are the responsibility of
Parliament and the Government through the
normal legislative process.
Draft laws take the form of parliamentary
Bills. Most are public Bills involving
measures relating to public policy. Public
Bills can be introduced, in either House, by a
government minister or by an ordinary
(‘private’ or ‘backbench’) member. Most
public Bills that become law are sponsored by
the Government.
Before a government Bill is drafted, there
may be consultation with professional bodies,
voluntary organisations and other agencies
interested in the subject, and interest and
pressure groups which seek to promote
specific causes. Proposals for legislative
changes are sometimes set out in government
‘White Papers’, which may be debated in
Parliament before a Bill is introduced. From
time to time consultation papers, sometimes
called ‘Green Papers’, set out government
proposals which are still taking shape and
seek comments from the public.
Bills must normally be passed by both
Houses. Government Bills likely to raise
political controversy usually go through the
Commons before being discussed in the
Lords, while those of a technical but non¬
political nature often pass through the Lords
first. A Bill with a mainly financial purpose is
nearly always introduced in the Commons,
and a Bill involving taxation must be based
on resolutions agreed by that House, often
after debate, before it can be introduced. If
the main object of a Bill is to create a public
charge (that is, new taxation or public
spending), it must be introduced by a
government minister in the Commons or, if
brought from the Lords, be taken up by a
government minister. This gives the
Government considerable control over
financial legislation.
Private Members’ Bills
At the beginning of each session private
members of the Commons ballot (or draw
lots) for the opportunity to introduce a Bill
on one of the Fridays specially allocated; the
first 20 are successful. Private members may
also present a Bill after question time (see
p. 56). They may also seek to introduce a Bill
under the ‘ten minute rule’. This allows two
speeches, one in favour of and one against
the measure, after which the House decides
whether to allow the Bill to be brought in.
These Bills often do not proceed very far,
but a few become law each session. Private
members’ Bills do not often call for the
expenditure of public money; but if they do
they cannot proceed to committee stage
unless the Government decides to provide
the necessary money resolution. Private
Peers’ Bills may be introduced in the House
of Lords at any time, but when they come to
the Commons they do not proceed further
unless taken up by a private member. They
must then take their turn behind private
members’ Bills which have already obtained a
second reading in the Commons.
Passage of Public Bills
The process of passing a public Bill is similar
in both Houses. On introduction, the Bill
receives a first reading, without debate, and is
printed. After between one day and several
weeks, depending on the nature of the Bill, it
is given a second reading after a debate on its
general principles. In the Commons a non-
controversial Bill may be referred to a second
reading committee for its second reading
debate. After a second reading in the
53
BRITAIN 1994: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Commons, a Bill is usually referred to a
standing committee for detailed examination
(see p. 55). If the House so decides, the Bill
may be referred to the whole House sitting in
committee. The committee stage is followed
by the report stage in the whole House,
during which further amendments may be
considered.
At the third reading a Bill is reviewed in
its final form and may be debated again. The
House may vote to limit the time devoted to
examining a Bill by passing a government
timetable motion, commonly referred to as a
‘guillotine’.
After the third reading a Commons Bill is
sent to the Lords. After the second reading
in the Lords, a Bill is considered by a
committee of the whole House, unless the
House takes the rare decision to refer it to a
Public Bill Committee. It is then considered
on report and read a third time. At all these
stages amendments may be made.
A Bill which starts in the Lords and is
passed by that House is then sent to the
Commons for all its stages there.
Amendments made by the second House
must generally be agreed by the first, or a
compromise reached, before a Bill can
become law.
Royal Assent
When a Bill has passed through all its
parliamentary stages, it is sent to the Queen
for Royal Assent, after which it is part of the
law of the land and known as an Act of
Parliament. Royal Assent takes the form of an
announcement rather than any signature or
mark on a copy of the Bill. The Royal Assent
has not been refused since 1707. A list of the
main public Bills receiving Royal Assent since
autumn 1992 is given on pp. 503-H.
Limitations on the Power of the Lords
Most government Bills introduced and passed
in the Lords pass through the Commons
without difficulty, but a Lords Bill which was
unacceptable to the Commons would not
become law. The Lords, on the other hand,
do not generally prevent Bills insisted upon
by the Commons from becoming law, though
they will often amend them and return them
for further consideration by the Commons.
By convention the Lords pass Bills
authorising taxation or national expenditure
without amendment. Under the Parliament
Acts 1911 and 1949, a Bill that deals only
with taxation or expenditure must become
law within one month of being sent to the
Lords, whether or not they agree to it, unless
the Commons directs otherwise. If no
agreement is reached between the two Houses
on a non-financial Commons Bill the Lords
can delay the Bill for a period which, in
practice, amounts to at least 13 months.
Following this the Bill may be submitted to
the Queen for Royal Assent, provided it has
been passed a second time by the Commons.
The Parliament Acts make one important
exception: any Bill to lengthen the life of a
Parliament requires the full assent of both
Houses in the normal way.
The limits to the power of the Lords,
contained in the Parliament Acts, are based
on the belief that nowadays the main
legislative function of the non-elected House
is to act as a chamber of revision,
complementing but not rivalling the elected
House.
Delegated Legislation
In order to reduce unnecessary pressure on
parliamentary time, primary legislation often
gives ministers or other authorities the power
to regulate administrative details by means of
‘delegated’ or secondary legislation. To
minimise any risk that delegating powers to
the executive might undermine the authority
of Parliament, they are normally only
delegated to authorities directly accountable
to Parliament. Moreover, the Acts of
Parliament concerned usually provide for
some measure of direct parliamentary control
over the delegated legislation, by giving
Parliament the opportunity to affirm or annul
it. Certain Acts also require that certain
organisations affected must be consulted
before rules and orders can be made.
A joint committee of both Houses reports
on the technical propriety of these ‘statutory
instruments’. In order to save time on the
floor of the House, the Commons uses
54
GOVERNMENT
standing committees to debate the merits of
instruments; actual decisions are taken by the
House.
Private Legislation
Private Bills are promoted by people or
organisations outside Parliament (often local
authorities) to give them special legal powers.
They go through a similar procedure to
public Bills, but most of the work is done in
committee, where procedures follow a semi¬
judicial pattern. The promoter must prove
the need for the powers sought and the
objections of opposing interests are heard.
Both sides may be legally represented. Hybrid
Bills are public Bills which may affect private
rights. As with private Bills, the passage of
hybrid Bills through Parliament is governed
by special procedures which allow those
affected to put their case.
Parliamentary Committees
Committees of the Whole House
Either House may pass a resolution setting
itself up as a committee of the whole House
to consider Bills in detail after their second
reading. This permits unrestricted discussion:
the general rule that an MP or Lord may
speak only once on each motion does not
apply in committee.
Standing Committees
House of Commons standing committees
debate and consider amendments to public
Bills at the committee stage and, in certain
cases, discuss them at the second reading
stage. They include two Scottish standing
committees, and the Scottish and Welsh
Grand Committees. Ordinary standing
committees do not have names but are
referred to simply as Standing Committee A,
B, C, and so on; a new set of members is
appointed to them to consider each Bill. Each
committee has between 16 and 50 members,
with a party balance reflecting as far as
possible that in the House as a whole.
The Scottish Grand Committee comprises
all 72 Scottish members (and may be
convened anywhere in Scotland). It may
consider the principle of Scottish Bills
referred to it at second reading stage. It also
debates Scottish estimates and other matters
concerning Scotland only which may be
referred to it. Under government proposals
announced in March 1993, there would be
provision for more debates by the Scottish
Grand Committee, meeting at locations other
than London or Edinburgh, and from time to
time sessions of questions to Scottish Office
ministers would be held in the Committee. It
might also occasionally be appropriate for
statements to be made by Scottish Office
ministers to the Committee. In addition, a
new procedure would enable the Committee
to invite the Scottish Office Minister in the
House of Lords and the Lord Advocate to
give evidence before it on matters within
their fields of responsibility.
The Welsh Grand Committee, with all
38 Welsh members and up to five others,
considers Bills referred to it at second
reading stage, and matters concerning Wales
only.
There is also provision for a Northern
Ireland committee to debate matters relating
specifically to Northern Ireland.
The Lords’ equivalent to a standing
committee, a Public Bill Committee, is rarely
used; instead the committee stage of a Bill is
taken by the House as a whole.
Select Committees
Select committees are appointed to examine a
subject and to report their conclusions and
recommendations. A select committee may be
appointed for a Parliament, or for a session,
or for as long as it takes to do its job. To
help Parliament with the control of the
executive by examining aspects of public
policy and administration, 15 committees
have been established by the House of
Commons to examine the work of the main
government departments. The Foreign
Affairs Committee, for example, ‘shadows’
the work of the Foreign & Commonwealth
Office. The committees are constituted on a
basis which is in approximate proportion to
party strength in the House.
Other regular Commons committees
55
BRITAIN 1994: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
include those on Public Accounts, European
Legislation, Members’ Interests, and the
Parliamentary Commissioner for
Administration (the ‘Parliamentary
Ombudsman’—see p. 58). ‘Domestic’ select
committees also cover the internal workings
of Parliament. On rare occasions a
parliamentary Bill is examined by a specially
appointed select committee, in addition to the
usual legislative process: this occurs, for
example, every few years for the Armed
Forces Bill.
In their examination of government
policies and administration, committees may
question ministers, senior civil servants and
interested bodies and individuals. Through
hearings and published reports, they bring
before Parliament and the public an extensive
body of fact and informed opinion on many
issues, and build up considerable expertise in
their subjects of inquiry.
In the House of Lords, besides the Appeal
and Appellate Committees, in which the bulk
of the House’s judicial work is transacted,
there are two major select committees (with
several sub-committees), on the European
Communities and on Science and
Technology.
Joint Committees
Joint committees, with a membership drawn
from both Houses, are appointed in each
session to deal with Consolidation Bills and
delegated legislation. The two Houses may
also agree to set up joint select committees on
other subjects.
Party Committees
In addition to the official committees of the
two Houses there are several unofficial party
organisations or committees. The
Conservative and Unionist Members’
Committee (the 1922 Committee) consists of
the backbench membership of the party in the
House of Commons. When the Conservative
Party is in office, ministers attend its
meetings by invitation and not by right.
When the party is in opposition, the whole
membership of the party may attend
meetings. The leader appoints a consultative
committee, which acts as the party’s
‘shadow cabinet’.
The Parliamentary Labour Party
comprises all members of the party in both
Houses. When the Labour Party is in office,
a parliamentary committee, half of whose
members are elected and half of whom are
government representatives, acts as a
channel of communication between the
Government and its backbenchers in both
Houses. When the party is in opposition,
the Parliamentary Labour Party is organised
under the direction of an elected
parliamentary committee, which acts as the
‘shadow cabinet’.
Other Forms of Parliamentary Control
House of Commons
In addition to the system of scrutiny by
select committees, the House of Commons
offers a number of opportunities for the
examination of government policy by both
the Opposition and the Government’s own
backbenchers. These include:
1. Question time, when for an hour on
Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday and
Thursday, ministers answer MPs’
questions. The Prime Minister’s question
time is on Tuesday and Thursday.
Parliamentary questions are one means of
seeking information about the
Government’s intentions. They are also a
way of raising grievances brought to
MPs’ notice by constituents. MPs may
also put questions to ministers for
written answer; the questions and
answers are published in Hansard, the
official report. There are some 50,000
questions every year.
2. Adjournment debates, when MPs use
motions for the adjournment of the
House to raise constituency cases or
matters of public concern. There is a
half-hour adjournment period at the end
of the business of the day, while
immediately before the adjournment for
each recess (Parliament’s Christmas,
Easter, spring and summer breaks) a full
day is spent discussing issues raised by
56
GOVERNMENT
private members. There are also
adjournment debates following the passage,
three times a year, of Consolidated Fund7
or Appropriation Bills.8 These take place
after the House has voted the necessary
supplies (money) for the Government.
In addition, an MP wishing to discuss a
‘specific and important matter that should
have urgent consideration’ may, at the end
of question time, seek leave to move the
adjournment of the House. If the Speaker
accepts the terms of the motion, the MP
asks the House for leave for the motion to
be put forward. Leave can be given
unanimously, or it can be given if 40 or
more MPs support the motion or if fewer
than 40 but more than ten support it and
the House (on a vote) is in favour. If leave
is given, the matter is debated for three
hours in what is known as an emergency
debate, usually on the following day.
3. The 20 Opposition days each session,
when the Opposition can choose subjects
for debate. Of these days, 17 are at the
disposal of the Leader of the Opposition
and three at the disposal of the second
largest opposition party.
4. Debates on three days in each session on
details of proposed government
expenditure, chosen by the Liaison
Committee.
Procedural opportunities for criticism of
the Government also arise during the debate
on the Queen’s speech at the beginning of
each session, during debates on motions
of censure for which the Government
provides time, and during debates on
the Government’s legislative and other
proposals.
House of Lords
Similar opportunities for criticism and
examination of government policy are
provided in the House of Lords at daily
question time and during debates.
7 At least two Consolidated Fund Acts are passed each session
authorising the Treasury to make certain sums of money available
for the public service.
8 The annual Appropriation Act fixes the sums of public money
provided for particular items of expenditure.
Control of Finances
The main responsibilities of Parliament, and
more particularly of the House of Commons,
in overseeing the revenue of the State and
payments for the public service, are to
authorise the raising of taxes and duties and
the various objects of expenditure and the
sum to be spent on each. It also has to satisfy
itself that the sums granted are spent only for
the purposes which Parliament intended. No
payment out of the central government’s
public funds can be made and no taxation or
loans authorised, except by Act of Parliament.
However, limited interim payments can be
made from the Contingencies Fund.
The Finance Act is the most important of
the annual statutes, and authorises the raising
of revenue. The legislation is based on the
Chancellor of the Exchequer’s Budget
statement. It includes a review of the public
finances of the previous year, and proposals
for future expenditure. From November 1993
public expenditure and taxation plans have
been announced in a single annual statement
(see p. 116). Scrutiny of public expenditure is
carried out by House of Commons select
committees (see p. 55).
European Community Affairs
To keep the two Houses informed of EC
developments, and to enable them to
scrutinise and debate Community policies and
proposals, there is a select committee in each
House (see p. 56) and two Commons
standing committees debate specific European
legislative proposals. Ministers also make
regular statements about Community business.
The Commons ’ Ability to Force the
Government to Resign
The final control is the ability of the House
of Commons to force the Government to
resign by passing a resolution of ‘no
confidence’. The Government must also
resign if the House rejects a proposal which
the Government considers so vital to its
policy that it has declared it a ‘matter of
confidence’ or if the House refuses to vote
the money required for the public service.
57
BRI TAIN 1994: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Parliamentary Commissioner for
Administration
The post of Parliamentary Commissioner for
Administration (the ‘Parliamentary
Ombudsman’) was established by the
Parliamentary Commissioner Act 1967. He
or she investigates, independently,
complaints of alleged maladministration
when asked to do so by MPs on behalf of
members of the public. Powers of
investigation extend to administrative actions
by staff in central government departments
and certain executive non-departmental
bodies. They do not include policy decisions
(which can be questioned in Parliament) and
matters affecting relations with other
countries. Complaints by British citizens
arising from dealings with British diplomatic
posts overseas are open to investigation in
some circumstances. The Commissioner has
access to departmental papers and reports
the findings of his or her investigation to the
MP who presented the complaint. The
Commissioner is also required to report
annually to Parliament. He or she publishes
details of selected investigations at quarterly
intervals and may submit other reports
where necessary. A Commons select
committee oversees the Commissioner’s
work.
Parliamentary Privilege
Each House of Parliament has certain rights
and immunities to protect it from
obstruction in carrying out its duties. The
rights apply collectively to each House and
to its staff and individually to each member.
For the Commons the Speaker formally
claims from the Queen ‘their ancient and
undoubted rights and privileges’ at the
beginning of each Parliament. These include
freedom of speech; first call on the
attendance of its members, who are therefore
free from arrest in civil actions and exempt
from serving on juries, or being compelled to
attend court as witnesses; and the right of
access to the Crown, which is a collective
privilege of the House. Further privileges
include the rights of the House to control its
own proceedings (so that it is able, for
instance, to exclude ‘strangers’9 if it wishes);
to decide upon legal disqualifications for
membership and to declare a seat vacant on
such grounds; and to punish for breach of
its privileges and for contempt.
The privileges of the House of Lords are
broadly similar to those of the House of
Commons.
Her Majesty’s Government
Her Majesty’s Government is the body of
ministers responsible for the administration
of national affairs. The Prime Minister is
appointed by the Queen, and all other
ministers are appointed by the Queen on the
recommendation of the Prime Minister.
Most ministers are members of the
Commons, although the Government is also
fully represented by ministers in the Lords.
The Lord Chancellor is always a member of
the House of Lords.
The composition of governments can vary
both in the number of ministers and in the
titles of some offices. New ministerial offices
may be created, others may be abolished,
and functions may be transferred from one
minister to another.
Prime Minister
The Prime Minister is also, by tradition,
First Lord of the Treasury and Minister for
the Civil Service. The head of the
Government became known as the Prime
Minister during the 18th century. The
Prime Minister’s unique position of
authority derives from majority support in
the House of Commons and from the power
to appoint and dismiss ministers. By modern
convention, the Prime Minister always sits in
the House of Commons.
The Prime Minister presides over the
Cabinet, is responsible for the allocation of
functions among ministers and informs the
Queen at regular meetings of the general
business of the Government.
The Prime Minister’s other
responsibilities include recommending a

number of appointments to the Queen.
These include:
• Church of England archbishops, bishops
and deans and some 200 other clergy in
Crown ‘livings’;
• senior judges, such as the Lord Chief
Justice;
• Privy Counsellors; and
• Lord-Lieutenants.
They also include certain civil
appointments, such as Lord High
Commissioner to the General Assembly of
the Church of Scotland, Poet Laureate,
Constable of the Tower, and some
university posts; and appointments to
various public boards and institutions, such
as the BBC (British Broadcasting
Corporation), as well as various royal and
statutory commissions. Recommendations
are likewise made for the award of many
civil honours and distinctions and of Civil
List pensions (to people who have achieved
eminence in science or the arts and are in
financial need). The Prime Minister also
selects the trustees of certain national
museums and institutions.
The Prime Minister’s Office at 10
Downing Street (the official residence in
central London) has a staff of civil servants
who assist the Prime Minister. The Prime
Minister may also appoint special advisers
to the Office from time to time to assist in
the formation of policies.
Departmental Ministers
Ministers in charge of government
departments are usually in the Cabinet; they
are known as ‘Secretary of State’ or
‘Minister’, or may have a special title, as in
the case of the Chancellor of the Exchequer.
Non-Departmental Ministers
The holders of various traditional offices,
namely the Lord President of the Council,
the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster,
the Lord Privy Seal, the Paymaster General
and, from time to time, Ministers without
Portfolio, may have few or no departmental
duties. They are thus available to perform
any duties the Prime Minister may wish to
give them.
Lord Chancellor and Law Officers
The Lord Chancellor holds a special position,
as both a minister with departmental
functions and the head of the judiciary
(see p. 497). The four Law Officers of the
Crown are: for England and Wales, the
Attorney General and the Solicitor General;
and for Scotland, the Lord Advocate and the
Solicitor General for Scotland.
Ministers of State
Ministers of State usually work with
ministers in charge of departments. They
normally have specific responsibilities, and
are sometimes given titles which reflect these
functions. More than one may work in a
department. A Minister of State may be
given a seat in the Cabinet and be paid
accordingly.
Junior Ministers
Junior ministers (generally Parliamentary
Under-Secretaries of State or, where the
senior minister is not a Secretary of State,
simply Parliamentary Secretaries) share in
parliamentary and departmental duties. They
may also be given responsibility, directly
under the departmental minister, for specific
aspects of the department’s work. The
Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasury and
other Lords Commissioners of the Treasury
are the formal titles of the Government
Whips (see p. 52).
Ministerial Salaries
The salaries of ministers in the House of
Commons range from ^44,611 a year for
junior ministers to ^63,047 for Cabinet
ministers. In the House of Lords salaries
range from £37,689 for junior ministers to
£50,558 for Cabinet ministers. The Prime
Minister receives £76,234 and the Lord
Chancellor £110,940. (The Leader of the
Opposition receives £59,736 a year; two
Opposition whips in the Commons and the
59
BRITAIN 1994: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Opposition Leader and Chief Whip in the
Lords also receive salaries.)
The Cabinet
The Cabinet is composed of about 20
ministers (the number can vary) chosen by
the Prime Minister and may include
departmental and non-departmental ministers.
The functions of the Cabinet are to
initiate and decide on policy, the supreme
control of government and the co-ordination
of government departments. The exercise of
these functions is vitally affected by the fact
that the Cabinet is a group of party
representatives, depending upon majority
support in the House of Commons.
Cabinet Meetings
The Cabinet meets in private and its
proceedings are confidential. Its members are
bound by their oath as Privy Counsellors not
to disclose information about its proceedings,
although after 30 years Cabinet papers may
be made available for inspection in the Public
Record Office at Kew, Surrey.
Normally the Cabinet meets for a few
hours once a week during parliamentary
sittings, and rather less often when
Parliament is not sitting. To keep its
workload within manageable limits, a great
deal of work is carried on through the
committee system. This involves referring
issues either to a standing Cabinet committee
or to an ad hoc committee composed of the
ministers directly concerned. The committee
then considers the matter in detail and either
disposes of it or reports upon it to the
Cabinet with recommendations for action.
The membership of all ministerial Cabinet
committees is published. Where appropriate,
the Secretary of the Cabinet and other senior
officials of the Cabinet Office attend meetings
of the Cabinet and its committees.
Diaries published by several former
ministers have given the public insight into
Cabinet procedures in recent times.
The Cabinet Office
The Cabinet Office, headed by the Secretary
of the Cabinet (who is also Head of the
Home Civil Service) under the direction of
the Prime Minister, comprises the Cabinet
Secretariat and the Office of Public Service
and Science (OPSS).
The Cabinet Secretariat serves ministers
collectively in the conduct of Cabinet
business, and in the co-ordination of policy at
the highest level.
The Chancellor of the Duchy of
Lancaster is in charge of the Office of
Public Service and Science and is a
member of the Cabinet. The OPSS is
responsible for:
• raising the standard of public
services across the public sector
through the Citizen’s Charter (see
P- 64);
• improving the effectiveness and
efficiency of central government,
through, among other things, the
establishment of executive agencies
and the market testing programme
(see p. 66); and
• advice—through its Office of Science
and Technology—on science and
technology policy, expenditure and
the allocation of resources to the
research councils.
It also promotes openness in government.
The Historical and Records Section of the
Cabinet Office is responsible for Official
Histories and managing Cabinet Office
records.
Ministerial Responsibility
‘Ministerial responsibility’ refers both to the
collective responsibility for government policy
and actions, which ministers share, and to
ministers’ individual responsibility for their
departments’ work.
The doctrine of collective responsibility
means that the Cabinet acts unanimously
even when Cabinet ministers do not all agree
on a subject. The policy of departmental
ministers must be consistent with the policy
of the Government as a whole. Once the
Government’s policy on a matter has been
60
GOVERNMENT
decided, each minister is expected to support
it or resign. On rare occasions, ministers
have been allowed free votes in Parliament
on government policies involving important
issues of principle.
The individual responsibility of ministers
for the work of their departments means that
they are answerable to Parliament for all
their departments’ activities. They bear the
consequences of any failure in administration,
any injustice to an individual or any aspect of
policy which may be criticised in Parliament,
whether personally responsible or not. Since
most ministers are members of the House of
Commons, they must answer questions and
defend themselves against criticism in person.
Departmental ministers in the House of
Lords are represented in the Commons by
someone qualified to speak on their behalf,
usually a junior minister.
Departmental ministers normally decide
all matters within their responsibility.
However, on important political matters they
usually consult their colleagues collectively,
either through the Cabinet or through a
Cabinet committee. A decision by a
departmental minister binds the Government
as a whole.
On assuming office ministers must resign
directorships in private and public
companies, and must ensure that there is no
conflict between their public duties and
private interests.
The Privy Council
The Privy Council was formerly the chief
source of executive power in the State; its
origins can be traced back to the Curia Regis
(or King’s Court), which assisted the
Norman monarchs in running the
government. As the system of Cabinet
government developed in the 18th century,
however, much of the role of the Privy
Council was assumed by the Cabinet,
although the Council retained certain
executive functions. Some government
departments originated as committees of the
Privy Council.
Nowadays the main function of the Privy
Council is to advise the Queen on the
approval of Orders in Council, including
those made under prerogative powers, such as
Orders approving the grant of royal charters
of incorporation and those made under
statutory powers. Responsibility for each
Order, however, rests with the minister
answerable for the policy concerned,
regardless of whether he or she is present at
the meeting where approval is given.
The Privy Council also advises the
Sovereign on the issue of royal proclamations,
such as those summoning or dissolving
Parliament. The Council’s own statutory
responsibilities, which are independent of the
powers of the Sovereign in Council, include
supervising the registration authorities of the
medical and allied professions.
Membership of the Council (retained for
life, except for very occasional removals) is
accorded by the Sovereign, on the
recommendation of the Prime Minister (or
occasionally, Prime Ministers of
Commonwealth countries) to people eminent
in public life—mainly politicians and
judges—in Britain and the independent
monarchies of the Commonwealth. Cabinet
Ministers must be Privy Counsellors and, if
not already members, are admitted to
membership before taking their oath of office
at a meeting of the Council. There are about
400 Privy Counsellors. A full Council is
summoned only on the accession of a new
Sovereign or when the Sovereign announces
his or her intention to marry.
Committees of the Privy Council
There are a number of Privy Council
committees. These include prerogative
committees, such as those dealing with
legislation from the Channel Islands and the
Isle of Man, and with applications for
charters of incorporation. Committees may
also be provided for by statute, such as those
for the universities of Oxford and Cambridge
and the Scottish universities. Membership of
such committees is confined to members of
the current administration. The only
exceptions are the members of the Judicial
Committee and the members of any
committee for which specific provision
authorises a wider membership.
61
BRITAIN 1994: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Administrative work is carried out in the
Privy Council Office under the Lord
President of the Council, a Cabinet minister.
The Judicial Committee of the Privy
Council is the final court of appeal for
certain independent members of the
Commonwealth, the British dependent
territories, the Channel Islands and the Isle
of Man. It also hears appeals from the
disciplinary committees of the medical and
allied professions and certain ecclesiastical
appeals.
Government Departments
Government departments and their agencies
are the main instruments for implementing
government policy when Parliament has
passed the necessary legislation, and for
advising ministers. They often work
alongside local authorities, statutory boards,
and government-sponsored organisations
operating under various degrees of
government control.
A change of government does not
necessarily affect the number or general
functions of government departments,
although major changes in policy may be
accompanied by organisational changes.
The work of some departments (for
instance, the Ministry of Defence) covers
Britain as a whole. Other departments, such
as the Department of Employment, cover
England, Wales and Scotland, but not
Northern Ireland. Others, such as the
Department of the Environment, are mainly
concerned with affairs in England. Some
departments, such as the Department of
Trade and Industry, maintain a regional
organisation, and some which have direct
contact with the public throughout the
country (for example, the Department of
Employment) also have local offices.
Departments are usually headed by
ministers. Certain departments in which
questions of policy do not normally arise are
headed by permanent officials, and ministers
with other duties are responsible for them to
Parliament. For instance, ministers in the
Treasury are responsible for HM Customs
and Excise, the Inland Revenue, the National
Investment and Loans Office and a number
of other departments as well as executive
agencies such as the Royal Mint.
Departments generally receive their funds
directly out of money provided by Parliament
and are staffed by members of the Civil
Service.
The functions of the main government
departments are set out on pp. 495-502.
Non-Departmental Public Bodies
A number of bodies with a role in the
process of government are neither
government departments nor part of a
department (in April 1992 there were 1,412).
Non-departmental public bodies are of three
kinds: executive bodies, advisory bodies and
tribunals. The last of these are a specialised
group of judicial bodies (see p. 98).
Executive Bodies
Executive bodies normally employ their own
staff and have their own budget. They are
public organisations whose duties include
executive, administrative, regulatory or
commercial functions. They normally operate
within broad policy guidelines set by
departmental ministers but are in varying
degrees independent of government in
carrying out their day-to-day responsibilities.
Examples include the British Council, the
Commonwealth Development Corporation
and the Commission for Racial Equality.
Advisory Bodies
Many government departments are assisted
by advisory councils or committees which
undertake research and collect information,
mainly to give ministers access to informed
opinion before they come to a decision
involving a legislative or executive act. In
some cases a minister must consult a standing
committee, but usually advisory bodies are
appointed at the discretion of the minister.
Examples include the Industrial Injuries
Advisory Council and the Committee on
Safety of Medicines.
The membership of the advisory councils
and committees varies according to the nature
62
GOVERNMENT
of the work involved, but normally includes
representatives of the relevant interests and
professions.
In addition to the standing advisory
bodies, there are committees set up by the
Government to examine specific matters and
make recommendations. For certain
important inquiries, Royal Commissions,
whose members are chosen for their wide
experience, may be appointed. Royal
Commissions examine evidence from
government departments, interested
organisations and individuals, and submit
recommendations; some prepare regular
reports. Examples include the standing Royal
Commission on Environmental Pollution, set
up in 1970, and the Royal Commission on
Criminal Justice, which issued its report in
July 1993 (see Chapter 8). Inquiries may also
be undertaken by departmental committees.
Government Information Services
Each of the main government departments
has its own information division, public
relations branch or news department. These
are normally staffed by professional
information officers responsible for
communicating their department’s activities
to the news media and the public (sometimes
using publicity services provided by the
Central Office of Information—see p. 500).
They also advise their departments on the
public’s reaction.
The Lobby
As press adviser to the Prime Minister, the
Prime Minister’s Press Secretary and other
staff in the Prime Minister’s Press Office
have direct contact with the parliamentary
press through regular meetings with the
Lobby correspondents. The Lobby
correspondents are a group of political
correspondents who have the special privilege
of access to the Lobby of the House of
Commons where they can talk privately to
government ministers and other members of
the House. The Prime Minister’s Press Office
is the accepted channel through which
information about parliamentary business is
passed to the media.
Administration of Scottish, Welsh and
Northern Ireland Affairs
Scotland
Scotland has its owm system of law and w ide
administrative autonomy. The Secretary of
State for Scotland, a Cabinet minister, has
responsibility in Scotland (with some
exceptions) for a wide range of policy
matters (see p. 501). Following an
examination of Scotland’s place in Britain
which began after the general election in
April 1992 the Government has proposed a
number of changes to the responsibilities of
The Scottish Office. These would make it
responsible for more areas of policy.
The distinctive conditions and needs of
Scotland and its people are also reflected in
separate Scottish legislation on many
domestic matters. Special provisions
applying to Scotland alone are also inserted
in Acts which otherwise apply to Britain
generally.
British government departments with
significant Scottish responsibilities have
offices in Scotland and work closely with
The Scottish Office.
Wales
Since 1964 there has been a separate
Secretary of State for Wales, who is a
member of the Cabinet and is responsible
for many aspects of Welsh affairs. (For
further details see p. 502.)
Northern Ireland
Since the British Government’s assumption
of direct responsibility for Northern Ireland
in 1972 (see p. 12), the Secretary of State
for Northern Ireland has been the Cabinet
minister responsible for Northern Ireland
affairs. Through the Northern Ireland
Office the Secretary of State has direct
responsibility for constitutional
developments, law and order, security, and
electoral matters. The work of the Northern
Ireland departments is also subject to the
direction and control of the Secretary of
State (see p. 500).

BRITAIN 1994: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Citizen’s Charter
The Citizen’s Charter aims to raise the
standard of public services and make them
more responsive to those who use them. It is
closely linked to other reforms, including the
Next Steps initiative, efficiency measures
and the Government’s contracting out and
market testing programmes (see p. 66). The
Citizen’s Charter is a long-term programme
which is intended to be at the heart of the
Government’s policy-making throughout
the 1990s.
The Citizen’s Charter White Paper was
published in July 1991 and contained
government proposals to raise standards in the
public sector. The proposals cover all public
services, at both national and local levels, and
the privatised utilities. All major public
services are expected to publish separate
charters, and so far 37 have been issued. In
many cases separate charters have been
published for services in Northern Ireland,
Scotland and Wales. (Details of many of the
charters can be found in the relevant chapters;
a full list, together with other information
about the charters, appears on pp. 508-9.)
The Principles of Public Service
The Charter sets out a number of key
principles which users of public services are
entitled to expect:
Standards
Setting, monitoring and publication of explicit
standards for the services that individual users
can reasonably expect. Publication of actual
performance against these standards.
Information and Openness
Full and accurate information should be
readily available in plain language about how
public services are run, their cost and
performance, and who is in charge.
Choice and Consultation
There should be regular and systematic
consultation with those who use services.
Users’ views about services, and their
priorities for improving them, should be
taken into account in final decisions about
standards.
Courtesy and Helpfulness
Courteous and helpful service from public
servants who will normally wear name
badges. Services available equally to all who
are entitled to them and run to suit their
convenience.
Putting Things Right
If things go wrong, an apology, a full
explanation and a swift and effective remedy
should be given. Well publicised and easy to
use complaints procedures with independent
review wherever possible should be available.
Value for Money
Efficient and economical delivery of public
services within the resources the nation can
afford, and independent validation of
performance against standards.
Implementing the Charter
In April 1992 the Prime Minister appointed a
Cabinet minister, the Chancellor of the
Duchy of Lancaster, with responsibility for
the Charter programme. The Chancellor of
the Duchy is supported by the Citizen’s
Charter Unit within the OPSS (see p. 495).
The Prime Minister also receives advice on
the Charter from a Panel drawn from
business, consumer affairs and education.
The Panel works with the Citizen’s Charter
Unit and officials in all the departments to
implement and develop the Citizen’s Charter
programme. The Prime Minister holds
regular Citizen’s Charter seminars with
Advisory Panel members and Cabinet
ministers to report on progress and plan
further action.
Executive agencies (see p. 66) are
expected to comply fully with the principles
of the Citizen’s Charter, and the pay of
agency chief executives is normally directly
related to their agency’s performance.
64
GOVERNMENT
Performance-related pay is being introduced
throughout the public service.
The mechanisms for implementing the
Charter cover:
• more privatisation;
• wider competition;
• further contracting-out of service
provision to private sector organisations;
• more performance-related pay for public
sector staff;
• published performance targets, both local
and national;
• comprehensive publication of information
on standards achieved;
• more effective complaints procedures;
• tougher and more independent
inspectorates; and
• better redress for the citizen if things go
wrong.
Charter Mark Awards
A Charter Mark Scheme has been introduced
to reward excellence: winners are judged by
the Prime Minister’s Citizen’s Charter
Advisory Panel. Applicants have to
demonstrate that they have achieved
measurable improvements in the quality of
services over the previous two years, and that
their customers are satisfied with their
services. They must also have plans to
introduce at least one new improvement to
their services which can be implemented
without increasing the cost to taxpayers or
users.
The first awards were made in September
1992 to 36 of over 300 public service
organisations and privatised utilities which
had applied. Winners ranged from water
companies to schools, local authority services
and executive agencies such as the United
Kingdom Passport Agency. The Government
has increased the potential number of awards
from 50 to 100 in 1993. Award winners can
use the Charter Mark on their products and
equipment, and on stationery, vehicles and
promotional material for up to three years.
Progress on the Charter
The Citizen’s Charter Tint Report, published
in November 1992, described the
programme’s achievements in its first year. It
showed that over 90 per cent of the
commitments in the original White Paper had
been met or tackled. The Government has
also piloted a telephone information service—
Charterline—to enable people to dial one
telephone number to obtain information and
help about the Charter and public service
organisations. In June 1993 a task force was
launched to review and recommend
improvements to public service complaints
systems.
Open Government
The Government has announced proposals
for a substantial increase in the amount of
information about the working of
Government. Its White Paper, published in
July 1993, proposes:
• a new code of practice on the provision
of government information, to be
independently policed by the
Parliamentary Ombudsman;
• statutory rights of access to health and
safety information, and to personal files;
and
• a reduction in the number of public
records withheld from release beyond 30
years.
The Civil Service
The Civil Service is concerned with the
conduct of the whole range of government
activities as they affect the community. These
range from policy formulation to carrying out
the day-to-day duties of public
administration.
Civil servants are servants of the Crown.
For all practical purposes the Crown in this
context means, and is represented by, the
Government of the day. There are special
cases in which certain functions are conferred
by law upon particular members of the public
service. However, in general the executive
powers of the Crown are exercised by, and
on the advice of, Her Majesty’s Ministers,
who are in turn answerable to Parliament.
65
BRITAIN 1994: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
The Civil Service as such has no
constitutional responsibility separate from
that of the duly constituted Government of
the day. The duty of the individual civil
servant is first and foremost to the Minister
of the Crown who is in charge of the
Department concerned. A change of
minister, for whatever reason, does not
involve a change of staff. Ministers
sometimes appoint special advisers from
outside the Civil Service. The advisers are
normally paid from public funds, but their
appointments come to an end when the
Government’s term of office finishes, or
when the Minister concerned leaves the
Government or moves to another
appointment.
The number of civil servants has fallen
from 732,000 in April 1979 to 554,000 in
April 1993, reflecting the Government’s
policy of controlling the cost of the Civil
Service and of improving its efficiency.
About half of all civil servants are
engaged in the provision of public services.
These include paying sickness benefits and
pensions, collecting taxes and contributions,
running employment services, staffing
prisons, and providing services to industry
and agriculture. Around a quarter are
employed in the Ministry of Defence. The
rest are divided between central
administrative and policy duties; support
services; and largely financially self-
supporting services, for instance, those
provided by the Department for National
Savings and the Royal Mint. The total
includes about 51,000 ‘industrial’ civil
servants, mainly manual workers in
government industrial establishments. Four-
fifths of civil servants work outside London.
Equality of Opportunity
The Government is committed to achieving
equality of opportunity for all its staff. In
support of this commitment, the Civil
Service is actively pursuing policies to
increase career opportunities for women,
ethnic minorities and people with
disabilities. The proportion of ethnic
minority staff has been in proportion to, or
better than, their representation in the
working population since the Civil Service
began ethnic monitoring in 1989. Progress is
monitored and results published annually by
the Cabinet Office (OPSS).
Management Reforms
Civil Service reforms are being implemented
to ensure improved management
performance, in particular through the
increased accountability of individual
managers, based on clear objectives and
responsibilities. These reforms include
performance-related pay schemes and other
incentives.
Executive Agencies: Next Steps Initiative
The Next Steps Initiative, launched in 1988,
aims to deliver government services more
efficiently and effectively within available
resources to the benefit of taxpayers,
customers and staff. This has involved setting
up, as far as is practicable, separate units or
agencies to perform the executive functions
of government. Agencies remain part of the
Civil Service but under the terms of
individual framework documents they enjoy
greater delegation on financial, pay and
personnel matters. Agencies are headed by
chief executives who are accountable to
ministers but who are personally responsible
for the day-to-day operations of the agency.
By mid-1993 more than 90 agencies had been
set up, together with 30 Executive Units of
Customs and Excise and 33 Executive Offices
of the Inland Revenue. Almost 348,000 civil
servants work in organisations run on Next
Steps lines.
Efficiency Measures
In 1991 the Government announced further
proposals to extend competition and choice in
the provision of public services. Savings in
public expenditure are being sought by
market testing and competitive tendering of
many services carried out by government
departments. Services are contracted out to
the private sector whenever the evaluation of
tenders indicates that better value for money
can be achieved.
66
GOVERNMENT
Central Management and Structure
Responsibility for central co-ordination and
management of the Civil Service is divided
between the Treasury and the Cabinet Office
(OPSS). In addition to its other functions,
the Treasury is responsible for the structure
of the Civil Service. It is also responsible for
recruitment policy and for controlling
staffing, pay, pensions and allowances. The
OPSS, which is under the control of the
Prime Minister, as Minister for the Civil
Service, is responsible for the organisation,
non-financial aspects of personnel
management and overall efficiency of the
Service. The function of official Head of the
Home Civil Service is combined with that of
Secretary to the Cabinet.
At the senior levels, where management
forms a major part of most jobs, there are
common grades throughout the Civil Service.
These unified grades 1 to 7 are known as the
Open Structure and cover grades from
Permanent Secretary level to Principal level.
Within the unified grades each post is filled
by the person best qualified, regardless of
the occupational group to which he or she
previously belonged.
Below this the structure of the non¬
industrial Civil Service is based on a system
of occupational groups. These groups assist
the recruitment and matching of skills to
posts and offer career paths in which
specialist skills can be developed.
Departments and agencies are being
encouraged to develop their own pay and
grading arrangements. These are expected to
produce value-for-money benefits which are
greater than those available through centrally
controlled negotiation.
The Diplomatic Service
The Diplomatic Service, a separate service of
some 6,650 or so people, divided between
Diplomatic Service and Home Civil Service
grades, provides the majority of the staff for
the Foreign & Commonwealth Office (see
p. 498) and at British diplomatic missions
and consular posts abroad.
The Service has its own grade structure,
linked lor salary purposes w ith that of the
Home Civil Service. Terms and conditions of
service are in many ways comparable, but
take into account the special demands of the
Service, particularly of postings overseas.
Members of the Home Civil Service and the
armed forces, and individuals from the
private sector, may also serve in the Foreign
& Commonwealth Office and at overseas
posts on loan or attachment.
Civil Service Recruitment and
Training
Recruitment is based on the principle of
selection on merit by fair and open
competition. Independent Civil Service
Commissioners are responsible for approving
the selection of people for appointment to the
higher levels and to the fast-stream entry to
the Home Civil Service and the Diplomatic
Service. Recruitment of middle-ranking and
junior staff is the responsibility of
departments and executive agencies; it is
monitored by the Commissioners.
Departments and agencies can choose
whether to undertake this recruitment work
themselves, to employ a private sector
recruitment agency or to use the
Recruitment and Assessment Services
Agency (an executive agency) to recruit on
their behalf.
People from outside the Civil Service may
be recruited directly to all levels, including
the higher levels in the Open Structure,
particularly to posts requiring skills and
experience more readily found in the private
sector. The exchange of staff between the
Civil Service and industry is also encouraged.
Training
Individual government departments and
agencies are responsible for the performance
of their own staff. They provide training and
development to meet their business needs, to
improve performance, and to help staff
respond effectively to changing demands.
The majority of training and development
takes place within departments and agencies.
In addition, the Civil Service College
provides high-quality management and
professional training, mainly for those who
67
BRITAIN 1994: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
occupy, or hope to occupy, relatively senior
positions. Considerable use is made of other
providers in the private and public sectors.
Civil servants under the age of 18 may
continue their general education by
attending courses, usually for one day a
week (‘day release’ schemes). All staff may
be entitled to financial support to continue
their education, mainly in their own time.
There are also opportunities for civil
servants to undertake research and study in
areas of interest to them and to their
department or agency.
Promotion
Departments are responsible for promotion
up to and including Grade 4. Promotion or
appointment to Grades 1 and 2 and all
transfers between departments at these
levels are approved by the Prime Minister,
who is advised by the Head of the Home
Civil Service. Promotions and appointments
to Grade 3 are approved by the Cabinet
Office.
Political and Private Activities
Civil servants are required to perform
loyally the duties assigned to them by the
Government of the day, whatever its
political persuasion. It is essential that
ministers and the public should have
confidence that the personal views of civil
servants do not influence the performance of
their official duties, given the role of the
Civil Service in serving successive
governments formed by different parties.
The aim of the rules which govern political
activities by civil servants is to allow them,
subject to these fundamental principles, the
greatest possible freedom to participate in
public affairs consistent with their rights
and duties as citizens. The rules are
therefore concerned with activities liable to
give public expression to political views
rather than with privately held beliefs and
opinions.
The Civil Service is divided into three
groups for the purposes of deciding the
extent to which individuals may take part in
political activities:
• Those in the ‘politically free’ group,
consisting of industrial staff and non-
office grades, are free to engage in any
political activity outside official time,
including adoption as a candidate for the
British or the European Parliament
(although they would have to resign from
the Service before standing for election).
• Those in the ‘politically restricted’ group,
which comprises staff in Grade 7 and
above as well as Administration Trainees
and Higher Executive Officers (D), may
not take part in national political
activities but may apply for permission to
take part in local political activities.
• The ‘intermediate’ group, which
comprises all other civil servants, may
apply for permission to take part in
national or local political activity, apart
from candidature for the British or the
European Parliament.
Where required, permission is granted to
the maximum extent consistent with the Civil
Service’s reputation for political impartiality
and the avoidance of any conflict with official
duties. A code of discretion requires
moderation and the avoidance of
embarrassment to ministers.
Generally, there are no restrictions on the
private activities of civil servants, provided
that these do not bring discredit on the Civil
Service, and that there is no possibility of
conflict with official duties. For instance, a
civil servant must comply with any
departmental instruction on the need to seek
authority before taking part in any outside
activity which involves official experience.
Security
Each department is responsible for its own
internal security. As a general rule the
privately-held political views of civil servants
are not a matter of official concern. However,
no one may be employed in connection with
work which is vital to the security of the
State who is, or has been involved in, or
associated with, activities threatening national
security. Certain posts are not open to people
who fall into this category, or to anyone
whose reliability may be in doubt for any
other reason.
68
GOVERNMENT
The Security Commission may investigate
breaches of security in the public service and
advise on changes in security procedure if
requested to do so by the Prime Minister
after consultation with the Leader of the
Opposition.
Local Government
Although the origins of local government in
England can be traced back to Saxon times,
the first comprehensive system of local
councils was established in the late 19th
century. Over the years the range of services
for which local authorities are responsible has
grown and this has been one of the factors
which has led to reforms in the pattern of
local government.
Local Government Reform
A major reform of local government took
place in 1974 in England and Wales and in
1975 in Scotland. It was felt at the time that,
while for some services it was more efficient
for local authorities to cover large areas or
serve many people, other services were best
organised through smaller units in order to
meet the needs of individual communities. In
England and Wales functions were therefore
allocated to two main tiers of local authority:
outside London these were counties and the
smaller districts. In Scotland functions were
allocated on the mainland to regions and
districts; single-tier authorities were
introduced for the three Islands areas. In
Northern Ireland changes were made in 1973
which left local authorities with fewer
functions than in the rest of Britain.
'The Local Government Act 1985 abolished
the Greater London Council and the six
metropolitan county councils in England. In
1986 most of their functions were transferred
to the London boroughs and metropolitan
district councils respectively (see below).
More recently the Local Government Act
1992 made provision for the establishment of
a Local Government Commission to review
the structure, boundaries and electoral
arrangements of local government in England.
The Commission was set up in July 1992. It
will review the structure of local government
in all the shire counties of England over the
next three to four years. The first changes
are likely to be implemented in April 1995. It
is expected that, as a result of the reviews,
there will be a substantial increase in the
number of unitary or single-tier authorities in
England. In some areas the existing two-tier
structure may remain. The Government is
also looking at ways of improving the internal
management of local authorities.
Consultation on these subjects is also
taking place in Scotland and in Wales. A
White Paper published in July 1993 has
proposed legislation to introduce a single-tier
structure throughout Scotland. In Wales the
Government has announced plans to establish
21 new unitary authorities. These would be
elected in 1994 and would replace the
existing local authorities in 1995.
Local Authorities’ Powers
Local authorities’ powers and duties are
conferred on them by Parliament, or by
measures taken under its authority.
Administration is the responsibility of the
local authority. In the case of certain services,
however, ministers have powers to secure
some national uniformity in standards in
order to safeguard public health or to protect
the rights of individual citizens. For some
services the minister concerned has wide
powers of supervision; in other cases the
minister’s powers are strictly limited.
Relations with Central Government
The main link between local authorities and
central government in England is the
Department of the Environment, although
other departments such as the Department
for Education and the Home Office are
concerned with various local government
functions. In the rest of Britain the local
authorities deal with the Scottish and Welsh
Offices and the Department of the
Environment for Northern Ireland.
Principal Types of Local Authority
At present England and Wales (outside
69
BRITAIN 1994: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Greater London) are divided into 53
counties, sub-divided into 369 districts. All
the districts and 47 of the counties—the
‘non-metropolitan’ counties—have locally
elected councils with separate functions.
County councils provide large-scale services,
while district councils are responsible for the
more local ones (see p. 71).
Greater London—with a population of
some 6.9 million—is divided into 32
boroughs, each of which has a council
responsible for local government in its area;
in addition, there is the Corporation of the
City of London. In the six metropolitan
counties there are 36 district councils; there
are no county councils. A number of services,
however, require a statutory authority over
areas wider than the individual boroughs and
districts. These are waste regulation and
disposal (in certain areas); the police and fire
services, including civil defence, and public
transport (in all metropolitan counties); and
the fire service, including civil defence (in
London). All are run by joint authorities
composed of elected councillors nominated by
the borough or district councils.
In addition to the two-tier local authority
system in England, there are over 8,000
parish councils or meetings. They may
provide and manage local facilities such as
allotments and village halls and may act as
agents for other district council functions.
They also provide a forum for discussion of
local issues. In Wales community councils
have similar functions.
On the mainland of Scotland local
government is at present on a two-tier basis:
nine regions are divided into 53 districts,
each of which has an elected council. There
are three virtually all-purpose authorities for
Orkney, Shetland and the Western Isles.
Provision is also made for local community
councils: although these have no statutory
functions, they can draw attention to matters
of local concern.
The areas and electoral arrangements of
local authorities are kept under review by the
Local Government Boundary Commissions
for Wales and Scotland. In 1992 the respon¬
sibilities of the Local Government Boundary
Commission for England passed to the Local
Government Commission (see p. 69).
In Northern Ireland 26 district councils
are responsible for local environmental and
certain other services. Statutory bodies, such
as the Northern Ireland Housing Executive
and area boards, are responsible to central
government departments for administering
other major services (see below).
Election of Councils
Local authority councils consist of elected
unpaid councillors. Councillors may,
however, be entitled to a basic flat rate
allowance and to certain expenses when
attending meetings or taking on special
responsibilities. Parish and community
councillors cannot claim allowances for duties
undertaken within their own council areas.
In England, Wales and Northern Ireland
each council elects its presiding officer and
his or her deputy annually. Some districts
have the ceremonial title of borough, or city,
both granted by royal authority. In boroughs
and cities the presiding officer is normally
known as the Mayor. In the City of London
and certain other large cities, he or she is
known as the Lord Mayor. In Scotland the
presiding officer of the district council of
each of the four cities is called the Lord
Provost. No specific title is laid down for
those of other councils; some are known as
conveners, while others continue to use the
old title of ‘provost’.
Councillors are elected for four years. All
county councils in England and Wales,
London borough councils, and about two-
thirds of non-metropolitan district councils
are elected in their entirety every four years.
In the remaining districts (including all
metropolitan districts) one-third of the
councillors are elected in each of the three
years between county council elections. In
Scotland local elections are held every two
years, alternately for districts and for regions
and islands authorities. Each election covers
the whole council so that councillors are
elected for four years at a time.
Voters
Anyone may vote at a local government
election in Britain provided he or she is:
70
GOVERNMENT
• aged 18 years or over;
• is a citizen of Britain or another
Commonwealth country, or a citizen of
the Irish Republic;
• is not subject to any legal incapacity; and
• is on the electoral register.
To qualify for registration a person must
be resident in the council area on the
qualifying date. In Northern Ireland there are
slightly different requirements.
Candidates
Many candidates at local government
elections stand as representatives of one of
the national political parties, although there
are some independent candidates, and some
represent local interests. Candidates must be
British citizens, other Commonwealth citizens
or citizens of the Irish Republic, and aged 21
or over. In addition, they must either:
• be registered as local electors in the area
of the local authority to which they seek
election; or
• have lived in or occupied (as owner or
tenant) land or other premises in that
area during the whole of the 12 months
preceding the day on which they are
nominated as candidates; or,
• have had their main or only place of work
in the area throughout this 12-month
period.
No one may be elected to a council of
which he or she is an employee, and there are
some other disqualifications. All candidates
for district council elections in Northern
Ireland are required to make a declaration
against terrorism.
Electoral Divisions
Counties in England and Wales are divided
into electoral divisions, each returning one
councillor. Districts in England, Wales and
Northern Ireland are divided into ‘wards’,
returning one councillor or more. In Scotland
the electoral areas in the regions and islands
areas are called electoral divisions, each
returning a single member; the districts are
divided into wards, similarly returning a
single member. Parishes (in England) and
communities (in Wales) may be divided into
wards. Wards return at least one councillor.
The minimum parish/community council
size is five councillors.
Voting Procedure
The procedure for local government voting in
Great Britain is similar to that for
parliamentary elections. In Northern Ireland
local government elections are held on the
basis of proportional representation, and
electoral wards are grouped into district
electoral areas.
Council Functions and Services
At present in England county councils are
responsible for strategic planning, transport
planning, highways, traffic regulation,
education (although schools may ‘opt out’ of
local government control—see p. 402),
consumer protection, refuse disposal, police,
the fire service, libraries and the personal
social services. District councils are
responsible for local services such as
environmental health, housing, decisions on
most local planning applications, and refuse
collection. Both tiers of local authority have
powers to provide facilities like museums, art
galleries and parks; arrangements depend on
local agreement.
In the metropolitan counties the district
councils are responsible for all services apart
from the police, the fire service and public
transport and, in some areas, waste regulation
and disposal (see p. 352).
In Greater London the boroughs and the
City Corporation have similar functions, but
London’s metropolitan police force is directly
responsible to the Home Secretary.
Responsibility for public transport lies with
London Transport (see p. 251).
In Wales the division of functions between
county and district councils is much the same
as that between county and district councils
in non-metropolitan areas of England.
Local authorities in England and Wales
may arrange for any of their functions to
be carried out on their behalf by another
local authority, other than those relating
71
BRITAIN 1994: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
to education, police, the personal social
services and National Parks.
In Scotland the functions of regional and
district authorities are, at present, divided up
in a similar way to the counties and districts
in England and Wales. Because of their
isolation from the mainland, Orkney,
Shetland and the Western Isles have single,
virtually all-purpose authorities; they take
part in wider-scale administration for their
police and fire services, however, and rely
on the mainland for assistance in the
more specialised aspects of education and
social work.
In Northern Ireland local environmental
and certain other services, such as leisure and
the arts, are administered by the district
councils. Responsibility for planning, roads,
water supply and sewerage services is
exercised in each district through a divisional
office of the Department of the Environment
for Northern Ireland. Area boards,
responsible to central departments, administer
education, public libraries and the health and
personal services locally. The Northern
Ireland Housing Executive, responsible to the
Department of the Environment, administers
housing.
Internal Organisation of Local
Authorities
Local authorities have considerable freedom
to make arrangements for carrying out their
duties. The main policies are decided by the
full council; other matters concerning the
various services are the responsibility of
committees composed of members of the
council. A council may delegate to a
committee or officer any function except
those concerned with raising loans, levying
local taxes or making financial demands on
other local authorities liable to contribute.
These powers are legally reserved to the
council as a whole. Some councils have policy
advisory or co-ordinating committees which
originate policy for implementation by the
full council. The powers and duties of local
authority committees are usually laid down
in formal standing orders. Parish and
community councils in England and Wales
are often able to do their work in full
session, although they appoint committees
from time to time as necessary.
Committees have to reflect the political
composition of the council. In England and
Wales people who are not members of the
council may be appointed to decision-making
committees and are able to speak and take
part in debates; they cannot normally vote.
The legislation also prevents senior officers
and others in politically sensitive posts from
being members of another local authority or
undertaking public political activity. Some of
these provisions have not been introduced in
Northern Ireland.
Public Access
The public (including the press) are admitted
to council, committee and sub-committee
meetings, and have a right of access to
agendas, reports and minutes of meetings and
certain background papers. Local authorities
may exclude the public from meetings and
withhold these papers only in limited
circumstances.
Employees
Almost 3 million people are employed by
local authorities in Great Britain. These
include administrative, professional and
technical staff, teachers, firefighters, those
engaged in law and order services, and
manual workers. Nearly half of all local
government workers are employed in the
education service.
Although a few appointments must be
made by all the authorities responsible for the
functions concerned, councils are individually
responsible within national policy
requirements for determining the size and
duties of their workforces. In Northern
Ireland each council must by law appoint a
clerk of the council as its chief officer.
As a general rule, employees are of three
kinds: heads of departments or chief officers;
administrative, professional, clerical and
technical staff; and manual workers. Senior
staff appointments are usually made on the
recommendation of the committee or
committees involved. Most junior
appointments are made by heads of

CITIZEN’S CHARTER
T he Citizen’s Charter commits all sectors of government
to provide better services; many departments and agencies
have made significant improvements in their standards.

Royal Hospital for Sick Children,

THE NATIONAL HYPERBARIC CENTRE
The National Hyperbaric Centre,
in Aberdeen, Scotland, provides onshore
facilities simulating conditions for
deep-sea divers. Throughout April
and May 1993 it was the venue for
Aurora ’93, a research project funded
largely by the European Commission.
The research included trials of
breathing apparatus and
communications equipment, and
observations of psychological and
physiological performance at depths
of up to 470 metres.
Life support technicians in the control room
monitor conditions in the pressure chamber
continuously, ensuring, for example, that the
pressure and temperature are maintained
at safe levels.

GOVERNMENT
departments, who are also responsible for
engaging manual workers. Pay and conditions
of service are usually a matter for each
council, although there are scales
recommended by national negotiating
machinery between authorities and trade
unions.
Authorities differ in the degree to which
they employ their own permanent staff to
carry out certain functions or use private
firms under contract. The Government’s
policy of promoting value for money is
encouraging the use of private firms where
savings can be made.
Local Authority Finance
Local government expenditure accounts for
about 27 per cent of public spending. The
Government has sought to influence local
government spending as part of a general
policy of controlling the growth of public
expenditure. Since 1984 the Government has
had powers to limit or ‘cap’ local authority
budgets by setting a maximum amount for
local authorities which have, in its view, set
budgets which are excessive.
In 1992-93 expenditure by local
authorities in Britain was about £69,800
million. Current expenditure amounted to
£58,095 million, and capital expenditure, net
of capital receipts, was £6,370 million and
debt interest £5,300 million.
Local authorities in Great Britain raise
revenue through the new council tax, which
replaced the community charge system in
April 1993 (see p. 121).
Expenditure
In 1992-93 education accounted for 44 per
cent of local authorities’ current expenditure
in England, Scotland and Wales. Most of the
remainder was spent on roads and transport;
housing and other environmental services;
law, order and protective services; and
personal social services.
Local government capital expenditure is
financed primarily by borrowing and from
capital receipts from the disposal of land and
buildings. These are supplemented mainly by
capital grants from central government.
Control of Finance
Local councils normally have a finance
committee to keep their financial policy
under constant review. Their annual accounts
must be audited by independent auditors
appointed by the Audit Commission in
England and Wales, or by the Commission
for Local Authority Accounts in Scotland. In
Northern Ireland this role is exercised by a
local government audit section appointed by
the Department of the Environment for
Northern Ireland.
Local Government Complaints System
Citizens’ allegations of injustice resulting
from local government maladministration may
be investigated by independent statutory
Commissions for Local Administration. The
English Commission has three local
commissioners (or local government
ombudsmen). Wales and Scotland each have
a single commissioner.
A report is issued on each complaint
investigated and, if injustice caused by
maladministration is found, the local
ombudsman normally suggests a remedy. The
council must consider the report and tell the
commissioner what action it proposes to take.
In Northern Ireland a Commissioner
for Complaints deals with complaints
alleging injustices suffered as a result of
maladministration by district councils and
certain other public bodies.

Concern about levels of crime and about the administration of the law has
been high on the Government’s agenda in recent years. As a result, proposals
have been put forward for the reform of the police service (see p. 78), and in
1991, following a series of miscarriages of justice, a Royal Commission on
Criminal Justice in England and Wales was set up. In July 1993, the
Commission reported its findings for consideration by the Government. They
included the following recommendations:
• a new independent review authority to consider allegations of miscarriage
of justice, with the power to refer a case to the Court of Appeal;
• new rules for disclosure of the prosecution and defence cases before trial;
• preparatory court hearings to clarify and define the issues at stake in a
trial before a jury is empanelled;
• a system under which defendants pleading guilty could secure a smaller
sentence;
• defendants to lose the right to insist on trial by jury for offences triable
in either the magistrates’ court or the Crown Court; and
• all public sector forensic science laboratories to be equally available to
defence and prosecution.
England and Wales, Scotland, and Northern
Ireland all have their own legal systems,
with considerable differences in law,
organisation and practice. All three have
separate prosecution, prison and police
services. Crime prevention policy and non¬
custodial treatment for offenders is very
similar throughout Britain. There are
different civil court and civil law systems in
England and Wales and in Scotland;
Northern Ireland’s system is in many ways
similar to the English and Welsh model.
Common Law and Statute Law
One of the main sources of law in England
and Wales and in Northern Ireland is
common law, which has evolved over
centuries from judges’ decisions. It forms the
basis of the law except when superseded by
legislation. In Scotland, too, the doctrine of
legal precedent has been more strictly applied
since the end of the 18th century.
Much of the law, particularly that relating
to criminal justice, is statute law passed by
74
JUSTICE AND THE LAW
Parliament. If a court reaches a decision
which is contrary to the intentions of
Parliament, then Parliament must either
accept the decision or pass amending
legislation. Some Acts create new law, while
others are passed to draw together existing
law on a given topic. Parliament can repeal a
statute and replace it with another.
European Community Law
European Community (EC) law, deriving
from Britain’s EC membership, is confined
mainly to economic and social matters; in
certain circumstances it takes precedence over
domestic law. It is normally applied by the
domestic courts, but the most authoritative
rulings are given by the EC’s Court of Justice
(see p. 291).
Certain changes to United Kingdom law
have been made to bring it in line with
rulings of Strasbourg’s European Court of
Human Rights.
Branches of the Law
There are two main branches of the law-
criminal and civil. Criminal law is concerned
with acts punishable by the state. Civil law
covers:
• disputes about the rights, duties and
obligations of individuals between
themselves; and
• dealings between individuals and
companies and between one company and
another.
Criminal Justice
Crime Statistics
Differences in the legal systems, police
recording practices and statistical
classifications make it impracticable to
analyse in detail trends in crime for the
country as a whole. Nevertheless, there has,
as in Western Europe generally, been a
substantial increase in crime since the early
1950s. Annual official statistics cover crime
recorded by the police and can be affected
by changes in unreported crime.
Recorded crimes in England and Wales
in 1992 are detailed in Table 8.1. In the
same year the Scottish police recorded
589.500 crimes, of which 190,600 were
cleared up. In Northern Ireland, of the
67.500 recorded crimes about 23,250 were
cleared up.
Crime tends to be concentrated in large
cities and urban areas. About 94 per cent of
crime recorded by the police is directed
against property but only 5 per cent
involves violence. Rising affluence has
provided more opportunities for casual
property crime. In 1957, for example, car
crime was only one-tenth of total crime but
this has risen to about a third. Most crime
is committed by young males, is opportunist
and is not planned by hardened professional
criminals, although these do exist.
Another source of information about
crime is the regular crime surveys
undertaken in England and Wales, Scotland
and in Northern Ireland. The 1992 survey

BRITAIN 1994: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
in England and Wales asked respondents for
information about how crime had affected
them in 1991. It estimated a total of 15
million crimes in 1991, the majority of which
were against property. Violent crime
accounted for only 5 per cent of the total,
while 36 per cent involved vehicles, 9 per
cent were burglaries and 30 per cent other
forms of theft. These surveys
indicate that many crimes go unrecorded by
the police, mainly because not all victims
report them.
Crime Prevention
National publicity campaigns, such as the
‘Car Crime Prevention Year’ campaign
during 1992, are a regular feature of the
Government’s programmes. The Home
Office’s Crime Prevention Unit encourages
local agencies to implement anti-crime
measures and to assess the results.
Local panels assisted by the police try to
prevent crime through publicity, marking
goods and equipment, and fund-raising to
buy security devices. The police have been
closely involved in setting up 115,000
neighbourhood watch schemes in England
and Wales. There are some 2,000 watch
schemes in Scotland. Crime Concern, a
national independent organisation, encourages
local initiatives and business participation in
crime prevention.
The Safer Cities programme tackles crime
and the fear of crime in inner city and urban
areas through joint action by local
government, private businesses, the police
and voluntary agencies. By the end of 1992,
with projects in 20 local authority areas, the
programme had supported over 2,800 crime
prevention initiatives with over £17.6 million
of grant funds from central government. Each
project is led by a committee, drawn from
local agencies and supported by a
co-ordinator funded by the Home Office.
There is a Safer Cities programme in
Scotland and similar projects are being
funded by the Government in Northern
Ireland.
In January 1993 the Government
announced new crime prevention measures,
including:
• doubling the number of Safer Cities
projects;
• a National Board for Crime Prevention to
seek new ways of involving all sections of
the community, including business, in
crime prevention; and
• increased support for local communities’
crime prevention initiatives.
Helping the Victim
There are some 400 victim support
schemes—with over 8,000 volunteer visitors
and covering 98 per cent of the population in
England and Wales—providing practical help
and emotional support to victims of crime.
They are co-ordinated by a national
organisation, Victim Support, which receives
a government grant (£8.4 million in 1993-94).
Most of the grant goes to local schemes to
meet either the salaries of co-ordinators or
running costs. Similar schemes operate in
Scotland and Northern Ireland.
In 1990 the Government published its
Victims' Charter, setting out the standards of
service that victims of crime are entitled to
expect from criminal justice agencies.
Blameless victims of violent crime in
England, Wales and Scotland, including
foreign nationals, may be eligible for
compensation assessed on the common law
damages awarded in the civil courts.
In Northern Ireland there is statutory
provision in certain circumstances for
compensation to be paid from public funds
for criminal injuries, and for malicious
damage to property, including any resulting
loss of profits.
In 1990 Britain ratified a European
Convention under which mutual
arrangements for compensation apply to
citizens of those countries in which the
Convention is in force.
Strengthening the Law
Measures to strengthen the criminal justice
system have been taken in recent years. The
courts, for instance, have powers to confiscate
the proceeds of drug trafficking. A court can
require the offender to pay an amount equal
to the full value of the proceeds arising from
76
JUSTICE AND THE LAW
the trafficking. The laundering of illegal
money associated with trafficking is unlawful.
Restraint and confiscation orders made by
courts can be enforced against assets held
overseas, and vice versa, if a mutual
enforcement agreement has been made
between Britain and another state. A court
may also confiscate the proceeds from
offences such as robbery, fraud, blackmail
and insider dealing in shares. Under new
legislation the onus will be placed on the
offender to prove that the property is
legitimately acquired.
In September 1992 Britain became the
first country to ratify the European
Convention on the Tracing, Freezing and
Confiscation of Assets, which provides for
international co-operation in the investigation,
search, seizure and confiscation of the
proceeds of all crimes.
Legislative controls on firearms have been
increased. The private ownership of certain
highly dangerous types of weapon, such as
high-powered self-loading rifles and burst-fire
weapons, is banned. The police license the
possession of firearms and have increased
powers to regulate their safekeeping and
movement. Similar legislation applies in
Northern Ireland. The Government has
proposed that responsibility for firearms
licensing in England, Wales and Scotland
should pass from the police to a national
civilian control board.
It is unlawful to manufacture, sell or
import certain weapons such as
knuckledusters or to carry a knife in a public
place without good reason.
The Criminal Justice Act 1991 has made a
number of reforms to the criminal law in
England and Wales. They mainly concern
sentencing and the system for early release of
prisoners (see p. 91). Similar reforms in
Scotland took effect from October 1993.
The Government has announced proposals
for reform of the police (see p. 78) and is
considering the recommendations made by
the 1993 Royal Commission report.
Measures to Combat Terrorism
The Government has certain exceptional
powers for dealing with and preventing
terrorist activities. These take account of the
need to achieve a proper balance between
the safety of the public and the rights of the
individual.
Northern Ireland
The security forces in Northern Ireland have
special powers to search, question and arrest.
I he police can hold a suspected terrorist on
their own authority for up to 48 hours;
detention for up to a further five days must
be approved by the Northern Ireland
Secretary. A person who is detained under
emergency provisions is entitled to consult a
solicitor privately.
Nobody may be imprisoned for political
beliefs. All prisoners, except those awaiting
trial, have been found guilty in court of
criminal offences. The legislation is reviewed
annually by an independent person whose
reports are presented to Parliament, which
has to renew the legislation each year.
Other Legislation
Other legislation applies throughout Britain
and is renewable annually by Parliament. It
provides for the exclusion from Great
Britain, Northern Ireland or the United
Kingdom of people connected with terrorism
related to Northern Ireland affairs and for
the banning of terrorist organisations in
Great Britain. It also gives the police powers
to arrest suspects without warrant and hold
them for 48 hours and, with ministerial
approval, for up to a further five days. This
provision also applies to suspected
international terrorists.
It is a criminal offence to finance
terrorism or receive funds for use in the
furtherance of terrorism. Police can apply
for a court order to freeze a suspect’s assets
once he or she has been charged. Funds can
be confiscated if a person is convicted. The
legislation allows for reciprocal enforcement
agreements with other countries.
The Government maintains that there
should be no concessions to terrorist
demands and that international co-operation
is essential in tracking down terrorists and
impeding their movement between countries.

BRITAIN 1994: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
THE POLICE SERVICE
Organisation
There are 52 police forces in Britain, mainly
organised on a local basis: 43 in England and
Wales, eight in Scotland and one (the Royal
Ulster Constabulary) in Northern Ireland. The
Metropolitan Police Force and the City of
London force are responsible for policing
London. The police service is financed by
central and local government.
At the end of 1992 police strength in Britain
was about 140,200, of which the Metropolitan
Police numbered over 27,800. The
establishment of the Royal Ulster Constabulary
was nearly 8,500. Each force has volunteer
special constables who perform police duties in
their spare time, without pay, acting mainly as
auxiliaries to the regular force. In Northern
Ireland there is a 5,000-strong part-time and
full-time paid reserve.
Police forces are maintained in England and
Wales by the local police authority, of which
two-thirds of the members are local councillors
and one-third magistrates. The Government is
proposing to reduce the percentage of local
councillors to 50 per cent; each authority
would have 16 members—eight local
councillors, three local magistrates and five
local people. The Home Secretary is
responsible for London’s Metropolitan Police
Force.
The police authorities in Scotland are the
regional and islands councils. In Northern
Ireland the police force is responsible to a
body appointed by the Government.
Chief constables run their police forces and
are responsible for the appointment,
promotion and discipline of all ranks below
assistant chief constable. They are generally
answerable to the police authorities, and must
submit an annual report. The police
authorities appoint the chief constable and
other top officers. They also fix the maximum
strength of the force, subject to approval by
the Government, and provide buildings and
equipment.
London’s Metropolitan Police
Commissioner and his immediate subordinates
are appointed on the recommendation of the
Home Secretary.
Central Authorities
The Home Secretary and the Scottish and
Northern Ireland Secretaries approve the
appointment of chief, deputy and assistant
chief constables. Where necessary they can:
• approve a police authority’s decision to
retire a chief constable in the interests of
efficiency;
• call for a report from a chief constable on
matters relating to local policing; and
• institute a local inquiry.
These ministers can also make regulations
covering:
• qualifications for appointment, promotion
and retirement;
• discipline;
• hours of duty, leave, pay and allowances;
and
• uniform.
Many of these are discussed with the staff
associations representing police officers.
Police forces are inspected by inspectors of
constabulary whose reports to central
government are published. New inspectors
are being appointed from outside the police
service for the first time.
Police officers are not allowed to join a
trade union or to go on strike. All ranks,
however, have their own staff associations.
Reforms
A reform programme for the police service in
England and Wales has been proposed by the
Government. This will require police
authorities to:
• ensure that policing meets local and
national priorities;
• set their own budgets and develop local
policing plans in consultation with the
public; and
• inform the public about the performance
of the force.
Under the proposals management will be
streamlined and responsibility for local
policing devolved to local commanders. Police
authorities and forces will be free to decide
for themselves how many officers are needed
78
JUSTICE AND THE LAW
without having to seek central government
approval.
There will be new procedures to ensure
that poor performance by officers is dealt
with fairly and effectively. Changes to the
police disciplinary system aim to reduce
lengthy procedures.
An inquiry, set up by the Government to
investigate police responsibilities and rewards
throughout Britain, reported in July 1993. Its
main recommendations included:
• a reduction in the number of ranks from
nine to six;
• a pay system designed to reward
individual officers while also reflecting
their responsibilities and skills, and the
nature of the policing environment;
• additional bonuses for exceptional
performance;
• fixed term appointments of ten years
initially, followed by periods of five years;
and
• the replacement of national statutory
regulations on most conditions of service
by a limited National Code of Standards
and by local arrangements decided by
chief police officers in consultation with
officers and their representatives.
Co-ordination of Police Operations
Certain police services are provided centrally
either by the Government or through co¬
operation between forces. In England and
Wales these include criminal intelligence,
telecommunications, and research and
development. In Scotland the main common
services are centralised police training, the
Scottish Crime Squad and the Scottish
Criminal Record Office.
The National Criminal Intelligence
Service, with five regional offices, provides
police forces with information about major
criminals and serious crime. Its Drugs
Division co-ordinates the police and Customs
response to drug trafficking. The Service is
also linked with the International Criminal
Police Organisation, which promotes
international co-operation between police
forces.
Britain has taken the lead in developing,
with other EC countries, a European police
organisation designed to provide Community¬
wide intelligence about serious crime.
(see p. 304)
The services of the Fraud Squad, which is
run jointly by the Metropolitan Police and
City of London Police to investigate company
frauds, are available in England and Wales.
Regional crime squads, co-ordinated at
national level in England and Wales, deal
with serious crimes, such as drug trafficking,
and are used whenever operations cannot be
dealt with by individual police forces alone.
The National Identification Bureau,
located at Metropolitan Police headquarters
but financed by all police forces, maintains
records on criminals. The Police National
Computer holds a summary of this data and
other essential information which is available
to police forces. The National Criminal
Records System will, from 1994, provide full
details of arrests and convictions, thereby
replacing paper records at the Bureau. The
Police National Network will, from 1994,
provide integrated voice and data
communications.
Scottish criminal records are held on
computer at the Scottish Criminal Record
Office, which has an automatic national
fingerprint record system; plans for a similar
national system in England and Wales are far
advanced and the Royal Commission has
recommended that it should be set up as
soon as possible.
Forensic Science Service
The Forensic Science Service (FSS) provides
scientific support primarily for forces in
England and Wales. It has 600 staff, of whom
about 400 are scientists. There are six
operational laboratories and a research
establishment.
London’s Metropolitan Police Force has
its own forensic science laboratory, which is
the largest in Europe.
Among the most important FSS customers
are the 41 provincial police forces in England
and Wales. Others include the Crown
Prosecution Service (see p. 83), defence
lawyers, coroners and civil litigants.
The Royal Commission has recommended
79
BRITAIN 1994: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
that all public sector forensic laboratories
should be equally available to prosecution and
defence. It also proposes that a new Forensic
Science Advisory Council should report to the
Home Secretary on laboratories’ efficiency.
In Scotland forensic science services are
also provided by forces’ own laboratories.
Police Discipline
A police officer may be prosecuted if
suspected of a criminal offence. Officers are
also subject to a disciplinary code designed to
deal with abuse of police powers and maintain
public confidence in police impartiality. If
found guilty of breaching the code, an officer
can be dismissed from the force.
Members of the public have the right to
make complaints against police officers if they
feel that they have been treated unfairly or
improperly. In England and Wales the
investigation and resolution of complaints is
scrutinised by the independent Police
Complaints Authority. In Scotland complaints
against police officers involving allegations of
any form of criminal conduct are referred to the
procurator fiscal for investigation (see p. 83).
In Northern Ireland the Independent
Commission for Police Complaints is required
to supervise the investigation of a complaint
regarding death or serious injury and has the
power to supervise that of any other
complaint. In certain circumstances, the
Secretary of State may direct the Commission
to supervise the investigation of matters that
are not the subject of a formal complaint.
Community Relations
Police/community liaison consultative groups
operate in every police authority; they consist
of representatives from the police, local
councillors and community groups.
Particular efforts are made to develop
relations with young people through greater
contact with schools. Schools governing bodies
and head teachers have to describe in their
annual reports the steps taken to strengthen
their schools’ links with the community,
including the police.
The Government is committed to
improving relations between the police and
ethnic minorities. Central guidance
recommends that all police officers should
receive thorough training in community and
race relations issues.
Several Home Office initiatives are
designed to tackle racially motivated crime
and to ensure that the issue is treated as a
police priority. These include the issue of
guidance to forces on their response to such
crimes and the production of a booklet for
victims. In addition, forces’ arrangements for
responding to racial incidents are monitored
by the Inspectorate of Constabulary.
Discriminatory behaviour by police officers,
either to other officers or to members of the
public, is an offence under the Police
Discipline Code.
All police forces recognise the need to
recruit women and members of the ethnic
minorities in order to ensure that the police
represent the community. At the end of 1992
there were 1,755 ethnic minority officers and
15,820 women police officers in England and
Wales. Scottish police forces had 1,465
women officers. Every force has an equal
opportunities policy.
Police Powers
Officers in Great Britain do not normally
carry firearms, although in an emergency
they can be issued on the authority of a
senior officer. In Northern Ireland police
officers are issued with firearms for personal
protection and other firearms are available for
duty purposes.
The Government can authorise
interception of postal and telephone services
by the police in order to:
• prevent and detect serious crime;
• protect national security; or
• safeguard Britain’s economic well-being.
Any interception outside these procedures
is a criminal offence.
A police officer in England and Wales has
a general power of stop and search if he or
she has reasonable grounds for suspicion
that a person is carrying stolen goods,
offensive weapons or implements that could
be used for theft, burglary and other
offences. The officer must, however, state
80
JUSTICE AND THE LAW
and record the grounds for taking this action
and what, if anything, was found.
Arrest
In England and Wales the police have wide
powers to arrest suspects with or without a
warrant issued by a magistrate. For serious
offences, known as ‘arrestable offences’, a
suspect can be arrested without a warrant; this
covers all offences for which a maximum period
of five years’ imprisonment can be imposed.
For lesser offences, arrest without warrant
exists if it is not possible or appropriate to
send out a summons to appear in court.
Detention, Treatment and Questioning
A government code of practice regulates
detention, treatment and questioning of
suspects by the police in England and Wales.
A police officer can be disciplined if he or
she fails to comply with the code. Evidence
obtained in breach of the code may be ruled
inadmissible in court.
An arrested person has a statutory right to
consult a solicitor and to ask the police to
notify a relative or other named person.
Where a person has been arrested in
connection with a serious arrestable offence,
but not yet charged, the police may delay for
up to 36 hours the exercise of these rights in
the interests of the investigation if certain
strict criteria are met.
The police must caution a suspect before
any questions are put for the purpose of
obtaining evidence. The caution informs the
suspect that he or she is entitled to refuse to
answer questions—-the so-called ‘right of
silence’. Questions relating to an offence may
not normally be put to a person after he or
she has been charged or informed that he or
she may be prosecuted.
The time a suspect is held in police
custody before charge is strictly regulated.
For lesser offences this may not exceed 24
hours. A person suspected of committing a
serious arrestable offence, such as murder,
rape, or kidnapping, can be detained for up
to 96 hours without charge but only beyond
36 hours if a warrant is obtained from a
magistrates’ court. Reviews must be made of
a person’s detention at regular intervals—six
hours after initial detention and thereafter
every nine hours as a maximum—to check
whether the criteria for detention are still
satisfied. If they are not, the person must be
released immediately.
Tape recording of interviews with
suspected offenders takes place at police
stations; a code of practice governing these
tape recordings has been approved by
Parliament.
The Royal Commission believes that
there should be continuous video
recording of activity in police station
areas where suspects are being held.
A person who thinks that the grounds for
detention are unlawful may apply to the High
Court for a writ of habeas corpus, requiring
the person who detained them to appear
before the court to justify the detention.
Habeas corpus proceedings take precedence
over others. Similar procedures apply in
Northern Ireland and a similar remedy is
available to anyone who is unlawfully
detained in Scotland.
Charging
Once there is sufficient evidence, the police
have to decide whether to charge the person
with the offence. As an alternative, they can,
for example, decide to defer charging or to
take no further action and release the person
with or without bail. They may also issue a
formal caution, which may be taken into
account if the person reoffends.
If charged, a person may be kept in
custody if there is a risk that they might fail
to appear in court or might interfere with the
administration of justice. When no such
considerations apply, the person must be
released on or without bail. Where someone
is detained after charge, they must be
brought before a magistrates’ court quickly.
This is usually no later than the next
working day.
Scotland
In Scotland the police have common law
81
BRITAIN 1994: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
powers of arrest and may search an arrested
person. A police officer may also search a
person for stolen property if he or she has
reasonable grounds for suspicion.
The police may detain and question a
suspected person for up to six hours. After
this period the person must either be released
or charged. Tape recording of interviews with
suspects is common practice. A court will
only allow as evidence statements fairly
obtained by the police. Anyone arrested must
be brought before a court as soon as possible
(generally on the day after being taken into
custody). In less serious cases the police may
release a person who gives a written
undertaking to attend court.
Where the charges involve serious crime,
the accused is brought before the sheriff in
private, either to be committed for a period not
exceeding 8 days to allow further enquiries to
be made or to be committed for trial.
Awaiting Trial
There are time limits on the period a
defendant may be remanded in custody
awaiting trial in England and Wales. In cases
tried before a magistrates’ court these are 56
days from first appearance to trial or 70 days
between first appearance to committal for trial
(see p. 85) in the Crown Court. The limit in
Crown Court cases is 112 days from
committal to taking of the plea. When a time
limit expires, the defendant is entitled to bail
unless the court extends the limit; it can only
do this if satisfied that there is a good and
sufficient reason, and that the prosecution has
acted expeditiously.
Bail
Most accused people are released on bail
pending trial. They are not remanded in
custody except where strictly necessary. In
England and Wales, the court decides
whether a defendant should be released on
bail. Unconditional bail may only be withheld
if the court has substantial grounds for
believing that the accused would:
• abscond;
• commit an offence;
• interfere with witnesses; or
• otherwise obstruct the course of justice.
A court may also impose conditions
before granting bail. If bail is refused, the
defendant may apply to a High Court judge
or to the Crown Court for bail. An
application can also be made to the Crown
Court for conditions imposed by a
magistrates’ court to be varied.
In some cases a court may grant bail to
a defendant on condition that he or she
lives in an approved bail or probation/bail
hostel.
The probation service’s bail information
schemes provide the Crown Prosecution
Service with information about a defendant
which assists it to decide whether to
oppose bail and enables the courts to take
an informed decision on whether to grant
bail.
Scotland
Anyone accused of a crime, except murder
or treason, is entitled to apply for release on
bail. Even in murder cases, bail may
exceptionally be granted at the discretion of
the Lord Advocate or a quorum of the
High Court. There is a right of appeal to
the High Court by the accused person
against the refusal of bail, or by the
prosecutor against the granting of bail, or
by either party against the conditions
imposed.
If a person charged with a serious crime
has been kept in custody pending trial, the
trial must begin within 110 days of the date
of full committal. Where the person is not
in custody, the trial must begin within
12 months of first appearance before the
sheriff. The trial of a person charged with a
summary offence and held in custody must
begin within 40 days of the date of first
appearance in court.
Northern Ireland
In Northern Ireland bail may be granted by
a resident magistrate except in cases dealt
with under emergency provisions (see
p. 14), where the decision is made by a
judge of the High Court.
82
JUSTICE AND THE LAW
CRIMINAL COURTS
Prosecution
England and Wales
Once the police have instituted criminal
proceedings against a person, the independent
Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) assumes
control of the case, reviews the evidence and
decides whether the case should be continued.
The Service is divided into regional areas,
each of which is run by a locally based Chief
Crown Prosecutor. CPS lawyers prosecute in
the magistrates’ courts while barristers
instructed by the Service appear in the
Crown Court.
Under the Code for Crown Prosecutors, a
prosecution should not be started or
continued unless the Prosecutor is satisfied
that there is admissible, substantial and
reliable evidence that a criminal offence has
been committed. Once the Prosecutor is
satisfied that there is a realistic prospect of a
conviction, he or she must also consider
whether the public interest requires
proceedings to take place. In nearly all cases
the decision to prosecute is delegated to the
lawyers in the area offices. However, some
especially sensitive or complex cases,
including terrorist offences and breaches of
the Official Secrets Act, are dealt with by
CPS headquarters.
Scotland
The Lord Advocate is responsible for
prosecutions in the High Court of Judiciary,
sheriff courts and district courts. There is no
general right of private prosecution. The
permanent adviser to the Lord Advocate on
prosecution is the Crown Agent, who is head
of the Procurator Fiscal Service and is
assisted in the Crown Office by a staff of
legally qualified civil servants.
Prosecutions in the High Court of
Justiciary are prepared by procurators fiscal
and Crown Office officials. They are
conducted by the Lord Advocate, the
Solicitor General for Scotland (the Lord
Advocate’s ministerial deputy) and advocates
depute, collectively known as Crown Counsel.
Crimes tried before the sheriff and district
courts are prepared and prosecuted by
procurators fiscal. The police and other law
enforcement agencies investigate crimes and
offences and report to the fiscal, who decides
whether to prosecute, subject to the
directions of Crown Counsel.
When dealing with minor crime, the fiscal
can use alternatives to prosecution, such as
formal warnings, diversion to social work and
offers of fixed penalties. In the latter case,
the offender does not have to accept such an
offer; if he or she chooses to do so,
proceedings are not brought and the
payment does not count as a criminal
conviction. The Royal Commission has
recommended that a similar fixed penalty
system should be introduced in England and
Wales.
Northern Ireland
The Director of Public Prosecutions for
Northern Ireland, appointed by the Attorney
General, prosecutes all offences tried on
indictment and may do so in other
(summary) cases. Most summary offences are
prosecuted by the police.
Prosecutions for Fraud
The Serious Fraud Office prosecutes the
most serious and complex cases of fraud in
England, Wales and Northern Ireland.
Investigations are conducted by teams of
lawyers, accountants, police officers and other
specialists. In Scotland the Crown Office
Fraud Unit investigates and prepares—in co¬
operation with the police and other
agencies—prosecutions against fraud.
Courts
England and Wales
Very serious offences such as murder,
manslaughter, rape and robbery can only be
tried on indictment in the Crown Court,
where all contested trials are presided over by
a judge sitting with a jury. Summary
offences—the less serious offences and the
vast majority of criminal cases—are tried by
83
BRITAIN 1994: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
unpaid lay magistrates or, in a few areas, by
paid stipendiary magistrates; both sit without
a jury.
Offences in a third category (such as theft,
the less serious cases of burglary and some
assaults) are known as ‘either way’ offences.
They can be tried either by magistrates or by
jury in the Crown Court. Where magistrates
consider an ‘either way’ case to be too serious
for them to deal with, they may commit the
offender to the Crown Court for trial. If
magistrates are content to deal with the case,
the accused has the right to choose trial by
jury in the Crown Court; the Royal
Commission has proposed that this decision
on the trial court should only be taken by
magistrates.
All those charged with offences to be tried
in the Crown Court must first appear before
a magistrates’ court, which decides whether to
commit them to the Court for trial.
A magistrates’ court, which is open to the
public and the media, usually consists of
three lay magistrates—known as justices of
the peace—who are advised by a legally
qualified clerk or a qualified assistant.
There are about 29,400 lay magistrates.
The 79 full-time, legally qualified stipendiary
magistrates may sit alone and usually preside
in courts where the workload is heavy.
Most cases involving people under 18 are
heard in youth courts. These are specialist
magistrates’ courts which either sit apart from
other courts or are held at a different time.
Restrictions are placed on access by ordinary
members of the public. Media reports must
not identify a young person concerned in the
proceedings, whether as defendant, victim or
witness.
Where a young person under 18 is charged
jointly with someone of 18 or over, the case is
heard in an ordinary magistrates’ court or the
Crown Court. If the young person is found
guilty, the court may transfer the case to a
youth court for sentence unless satisfied that
it is undesirable to do so.
An independent inspectorate has been
established to assist in raising performance
standards within the magistrates’ courts service.
The Crown Court sits at 93 centres and is
presided over by High Court judges, full-time
Circuit Judges and part-time Recorders.
Courts Charter
A Courts Charter, setting out the standards
of service which court users can expect in
England and Wales, was published in
November 1992 and came into operation in
January 1993. A court user is defined in the
Charter as a victim of crime, a witness
giving evidence, a member of a jury, a
defendant in a criminal case, a party in civil
or family proceedings, a relative or friend of
someone involved in a case or a member of
the public wanting to observe justice in the
courts.
The Charter outlines arrangements to help
court users and ease the strains associated
with court attendance. The procedure for
dealing with complaints is displayed in all
courts.
The Charter also covers the conduct of
court business, and sets guideline time limits
covering, among other things, the period
between the start of proceedings and first
appearance in court. It does not cover judicial
decisions.
Scotland
The High Court of Justiciary tries the most
serious crimes and has exclusive jurisdiction
in cases involving murder, treason and rape.
The sheriff court is concerned with less
serious offences and the district court with
minor offences.
Criminal cases in Scotland are heard
under solemn or summary procedure. In
solemn procedure, the trial takes place
before a judge sitting with a jury of 15
people. Details of the alleged offence are set
out in a document called an indictment. In
summary procedure the judge sits without a
jury.
All cases in the High Court and the more
serious ones in sheriff courts are tried by a
judge and jury. Summary procedure is used
in the less serious cases in the sheriff courts,
and in all cases in the district courts. District
court judges are lay justices of the peace. In
Glasgow there are also stipendiary magistrates
who are full-time lawyers with the same
criminal jurisdiction in summary procedure
as the sheriff.
84
JUSTICE AND THE LAW
Children under 16 who have committed
an offence are normally dealt with by
children’s hearings (see p. 95).
The levels of service which citizens are
entitled to expect from the main criminal
justice agencies are set out in the Justice
Charter for Scotland, published in 1991.
Northern Ireland
Cases involving minor summary offences are
heard by magistrates’ courts presided over by
a full-time, legally qualified resident
magistrate. Young offenders under 17 are
dealt with by a juvenile court consisting of
the resident magistrate and two specially
qualified lay members (at least one of whom
must be a woman).
The Crown Court deals with criminal
trials on indictment. It is served by High
Court and county court judges. Contested
cases are heard by a judge and jury, although
people charged with terrorist offences are
tried by a judge sitting alone, because of the
possibility of jurors being intimidated by
terrorist organisations.
In non-jury Crown Court trials the onus
remains on the prosecution to prove guilt
beyond reasonable doubt and defendants have
the right to be represented by a lawyer of
their choice. The judge must set out in a
written statement the reasons for convicting
and there is an automatic right of appeal
against conviction and sentence on points of
fact as well as of law.
Trial
Criminal trials in Britain have two parties:
the prosecution and the defence. The law
presumes the innocence of an accused person
until guilt has been proved by the
prosecution. An accused person has the right
to employ a legal adviser and may be granted
legal aid from public funds (see p. 99). If
remanded in custody, he or she may be
visited by a legal adviser to ensure a properly
prepared defence.
Disclosure to the Defence
The prosecution has a duty to disclose to the
defence all information which might have
some bearing on the case.
In England and Wales, where cases are to
be tried in the Crown Court, the Crown
Prosecution Service must also disclose all the
statements from the prosecution witnesses
upon whom it proposes to rely. This must be
done before any committal proceedings begin.
This duty does not apply to offences tried in
the magistrates’ court, except when advance
information is requested by the defence in
either way cases (see p. 84)—in practice,
however, the CPS adopts a more generous
approach than is strictly required.
The Royal Commission has recommended
that the prosecution in England and Wales
should generally supply to the defence all
material relevant to the case and that
procedures should be governed by codes of
practice. The defence would have to disclose
the substance of its case in advance of the
trial.
The Commission has also suggested that
there should be trial preparatory hearings
before the jury is selected in order to clarify
and define the issues in advance.
In Scottish solemn cases the prosecution
must give the defence advance notice of the
witnesses it intends to call and of the
documents and other items on which it will
rely. In summary cases this is usually done as
a matter of practice, although there is no
obligation on the Crown to do so.
Trial Procedure
Criminal trials normally take place in open
court and rules of evidence, which are
concerned with the proof of facts, are
rigorously applied. If evidence is improperly
admitted, a conviction can be quashed on
appeal.
During the trial the defendant has the
right to hear and cross-examine witnesses for
the prosecution. He or she can call his or her
own witnesses who, if they will not attend
voluntarily, may be legally compelled to do
so. The defendant can also address the court
in person or through a lawyer, the defence
having the right to the last speech before the
judge sums up. The defendant cannot be
questioned without consenting to be sworn as
85
BRITAIN 1994: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
a witness in his or her own defence. When a
defendant does testify, he or she may be
cross-examined about character or other
conduct only in exceptional circumstances.
Generally the prosecution may not introduce
such evidence.
In Scotland cross examination about the
character or other conduct of the accused
may be made in certain circumstances.
In Northern Ireland the judge can draw
inferences from a refusal by a defendant to
give evidence.
Child Witnesses
In England, Wales and Northern Ireland,
child witnesses in cases involving offences of
sex, violence or cruelty may now give
evidence in Crown Court proceedings from
outside the courtroom by means of a live
television link. In this way the child need not
see his or her alleged attacker in court. In
Scotland similar provisions apply. A child’s
sworn statement no longer has to be
corroborated by other evidence for the court
to hear it.
The Criminal Justice Act 1991 extended
the availability of the live television link to
youth court proceedings, and made further
reforms to the law of evidence and procedure
relating to child witnesses in England and
Wales. The presumption that young children
are not competent to give evidence in
criminal proceedings has effectively been
removed, and video-recorded interviews have
become admissible as the main evidence of a
child witness.
Fraud Proceedings
In England, Wales and Northern Ireland the
judge in complex fraud cases may order a
preparatory open Crown Court hearing. This
provides an opportunity for the judge to
determine questions regarding admissibility
of evidence and any other questions of law.
The judge also has the power to order the
prosecution and the defence to serve certain
statements on each other and to prepare the
case in such a way that it is easier to
understand.
Appeals may be made to the Court of
Appeal from decisions of the judge in the
preparatory hearings. The law on evidence
has been changed to enable courts to have
before them a wider range of written
evidence in the form of business
documents. Information technology is
increasingly used in complex cases to present
the material to the jury in a more
comprehensible form.
The Jury
In jury trials the judge decides questions of
law, sums up the evidence for the jury, and
discharges or sentences the accused. The jury
is responsible for deciding questions of fact.
In England, Wales and Northern Ireland the
verdict may be ‘guilty’ or ‘not guilty’, the
latter resulting in acquittal. If the jury cannot
reach a unanimous decision the judge may
allow a majority verdict provided that, in the
normal jury of 12 people, there are no more
than two dissenters.
In Scotland the jury’s verdict may be
‘guilty’, ‘not guilty’ or ‘not proven’; the
accused is acquitted if either of the last two
verdicts is given. The jury consists of 15
people and a verdict of ‘guilty’ can only be
reached if at least eight members are in
favour. As a general rule no one may be
convicted without corroborated evidence from
at least two sources.
If the jury acquits the defendant, the
prosecution has no right of appeal and the
defendant cannot be tried again for the same
offence.
A jury is independent of the judiciary.
Any attempt to interfere with a jury is a
criminal offence. Potential jurors are put on a
panel before the start of the trial. In England
and Wales the prosecution and the defence
may challenge individual jurors on the panel,
giving reasons for doing so. In Scotland the
prosecution or defence may challenge up to
three jurors without reason. In Northern
Ireland each defendant has the right to
challenge up to 12 potential jurors without
giving a reason.
People between the ages of 18 and 70 (65
in Scotland) whose names appear on the
electoral register, with certain exceptions, are
liable for jury service and their names are
86
JUSTICE AND THE LAW
chosen at random. Ineligible people include,
for example, judges and people who have
within the previous ten years been members
of the legal profession or the police, prison or
probation services. People convicted of
certain offences within the previous ten years
cannot serve on a jury. Anyone who has
received a prison sentence of five years or
more is disqualified for life.
Sentencing
If a person is convicted, the magistrate or
judge (or their Scottish equivalent) decides
on the most appropriate sentence. Account is
taken of the facts of the offence, the
circumstances of the offender, any previous
convictions or sentences and any statutory
limits on sentencing. The defence lawyer may
make a speech in mitigation.
Courts in England and Wales must obtain
a ‘pre-sentence’ report from the probation
service before imposing a custodial
sentence or certain community sentences.
This applies unless the offence is one which
is triable only on indictment and the court
considers it unnecessary to obtain such a
report.
In Scottish cases where a custodial
sentence may be imposed, it is mandatory for
a court to obtain a pre-sentence report if the
accused is under 21, has never served a
custodial sentence or is a first offender. In
other cases the judge decides whether to
obtain such a report.
Appeals
England and Wales
A person convicted by a magistrates’ court
may appeal to the Crown Court against the
sentence if he or she has pleaded guilty. An
appeal may be made against both conviction
and sentence if a ‘not guilty’ plea has been
made. The Divisional Court of the Queen’s
Bench Division of the High Court hears
appeals on points of law and procedure—by
either prosecution or defence—in cases
originally dealt with by magistrates. If
convicted by the Crown Court, a defendant
can appeal to the Court of Appeal (Criminal
Division) against both the conviction and the
sentence imposed. The House of Lords is the
final appeal court, but it will only consider
cases that involve a point of law of general
public importance and where leave to appeal
is granted.
The Home Secretary may consider
representations and intervene in cases tried
on indictment where appeal rights have been
exhausted. This is normally done only if
there is new evidence or some other
consideration of substance which was not
before the original trial court. In such cases
the Home Secretary refers the matter to the
Court of Appeal.
The Royal Commission has recommended
that a new independent body should be set
up to refer cases to the Court of Appeal. Its
role would be to consider allegations of
miscarriage of justice, launch a new
investigation if necessary, supervise the
investigation if conducted by the police and
refer the case to the Court of Appeal if there
were reasons for supposing that a miscarriage
of justice had taken place.
The Attorney General may seek the
opinion of the Court of Appeal on a point of
law in a case where a person tried on
indictment is acquitted. The Court has power
to refer the point to the House of Lords if
necessary. The acquittal in the original case is
not affected.
The Attorney General may also refer a
case to the Court of Appeal if he considers
that a sentence passed by the Crown Court
for an offence triable only on indictment is
unduly lenient. If the Court of Appeal agrees,
it may increase the sentence within the
statutory maximum laid down by Parliament
for the offence.
Scotland
All appeal cases are dealt with by the High
Court of Justiciary and are heard by at least
three judges. In both solemn and summary
procedure, an appeal may be brought by the
accused against conviction, or sentence, or
both. The Court may authorise a retrial if it
sets aside a conviction. There is no further
appeal to the House of Lords. In summary
proceedings the prosecutor may appeal on a
87
BRITAIN 1994: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
point of law against acquittal or sentence.
The Lord Advocate may seek the opinion of
the High Court on a point of law in a case
where a person tried on indictment is
acquitted. The acquittal in the original case is
not affected.
Northern Ireland
In Northern Ireland, appeals from
magistrates’ courts against conviction or
sentence are heard by the county court. An
appeal on a point of law alone can be heard
by the Northern Ireland Court of Appeal,
which also hears appeals from the Crown
Court against conviction or sentence.
Procedures for a further appeal to the House
of Lords are similar to those in England and
Wales.
A person convicted of a terrorist offence in
a non-jury court has an automatic right of
appeal against conviction and sentence.
Coroners’ Courts
In England and Wales, the coroner must hold
an inquest if the deceased died a violent or
unnatural death, a sudden death where the
cause is unknown, or in prison or in other
specified circumstances. (In Northern Ireland
the coroner investigates the matter to decide
whether an inquest is necessary.) The
coroner’s court establishes how, when and
where the deceased died. A coroner may sit
alone or, in certain circumstances, with a jury.
In Scotland the local procurator fiscal
inquires privately into all sudden and
suspicious deaths and may report the findings
to the Crown Office. In a minority of cases a
fatal accident inquiry may be held before the
sheriff; this is mandatory in cases of death
resulting from industrial accidents and of
deaths in custody.
TREATMENT OF OFFENDERS
The Government considers that offenders who
commit very serious crimes, particularly crimes
of violence, should receive long custodial
sentences, but that many other crimes can
best be punished within the community
through compensation and reparation.
Legislation sets the maximum penalties for
offences, the sentence being entirely a matter
for the courts, subject to these maxima. The
Court of Appeal in England and Wales issues
guidance to the lower courts on sentencing
issues when points of principle have arisen on
individual cases which are the subject of
appeal.
The Royal Commission, noting that
people pleading guilty in the Crown Court
have usually been given a reduction of 25 per
cent to 30 per cent in their sentence,
recommends that there should be a more
open system of sentence discounts, with
earlier guilty pleas attracting higher
discounts.
In Scotland, where many offences are not
created by statute, the penalty for offences at
common law range from absolute discharge to
life imprisonment.
Custody
England and Wales
The Government maintains that custody
should be used for offenders convicted of
serious criminal offences. The Court of
Appeal requires sentencers in England and
Wales to ensure that terms of custody are as
short as possible, while remaining consistent
with the courts’ duty to protect the public
and to punish the criminal.
The Criminal Justice Act 1991 requires a
court in England and Wales to be satisfied
that an offence merits custody. The court
also has to give reasons if it considers a
custodial sentence to be necessary. Longer
custodial sentences—within the statutory
maxima—are available for persistent violent
and sexual offenders.
A magistrates’ court in England and Wales
cannot impose a term of more than six
months’ imprisonment for an individual
offence tried summarily. It can impose
consecutive sentences for ‘either way’
offences (see p. 84), subject to an overall
maximum of 12 months’ imprisonment. If an
offence carries a higher maximum penalty, the
court may commit the offender for sentence
at the Crown Court. The Crown Court may
impose a custodial sentence for any term up
JUSTICE AND THE LAW
to life, depending on the gravity of the
offence and the maximum penalty available.
If a court decides that an offence warrants
an immediate custodial sentence of not more
than two years, the sentence may be
suspended for a period of at least one year
and not more than two years; this occurs if
exceptional circumstances justify the
suspension. If the offender commits another
imprisonable offence during the period of
suspension, the court may order the
suspended sentence to be served in addition
to any punishment imposed for the second
offence. When passing a suspended sentence,
the court may consider the imposition of a
fine or the making of a compensation order at
the same time. The court may also order
supervision of the offender by a probation
officer if the suspended sentence is more than
six months.
There is a mandatory sentence of life
imprisonment for murder throughout Britain.
Life imprisonment is the maximum penalty
for a number of serious offences such as
robbery, rape, arson and manslaughter.
Scotland and Northern Ireland
In Scottish trials on indictment the High
Court of Justiciary may impose a sentence of
imprisonment for any term up to life, and the
sheriff court any term up to three years. The
latter may send any person to the High Court
for sentence if the court considers its powers
are insufficient. In summary cases, the sheriff
or stipendiary magistrate may normally
impose up to three months’ imprisonment or
six months’ for some repeated offences. The
district court can impose a maximum term of
imprisonment of 60 days.
In Northern Ireland the position is
generally the same as for England and Wales.
A magistrates’ court, however, cannot commit
an offender for sentencing at the Crown
Court if it has tried the case.
Non-custodial Treatment
The Government believes that more
offenders, particularly those convicted of
property crimes and less serious cases of
violence, should be punished in the
community by:
• fines levied on the offender and
compensation to the victim;
• probation;
• community service;
• a new combined order linking probation
and community service; or
• a new curfew order to be used by itself
or with other orders.
Fines
About 80 per cent of offenders are punished
with a fine. There is no limit to the fine
which the Crown Court (and High Court of
Justiciary in Scotland) may impose on
indictment. The Criminal Justice Act 1991
increased the maximum fine usually available
on summary conviction from £2,000 to
£5,000 in England and Wales. In fixing the
amount of a fine, courts take into account the
means of the offender.
Probation
The locally organised probation service in
England and Wales supervises offenders in
the community under direct court orders and
after release from custody. It also provides
offenders in custody with help and advice.
A court probation order can last between
six months and three years; if the offender
fails to comply with the order or commits
another offence while on probation, he or she
can be brought before the court again. A
probation order can be combined with a
community service order or a fine.
A probation order requires the offender to
maintain regular contact with the probation
officer. Special conditions attached to the
order may require the offender to attend a
day centre for up to 60 days. Although
intended as a punishment, the time spent by
offenders under supervision in the
community offers an opportunity for
constructive work to reduce the likelihood of
reoffending.
In England and Wales the probation
service also administers supervision orders,
the community service scheme and supervises
those released from prison on parole.
89
BRITAIN 1994: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
The statutory Probation Inspectorate
monitors the work of the voluntary and
private sectors with the probation service in
addition to its inspection and advisory duties.
National objectives for probation work are
being introduced.
In Scotland local authority social work
departments supervise offenders on probation
and supervision orders or on parole.
In Northern Ireland the service is
administered by a probation board, whose
membership is representative of the community
and which is funded by central government.
Community Service
Offenders aged 16 or over convicted of
imprisonable offences may, with their
consent, be given community service orders.
The court may order between 40 and 240
hours’ unpaid service to be completed within
12 months. Examples of work done include
decorating the houses of elderly or disabled
people and building adventure playgrounds.
National standards for community service
orders ensure that all orders meet a common
set of minimum requirements.
In England and Wales the court may make
an order combining community service and
probation. The maximum term for the
probation element is the same as a probation
order and the maximum period of community
service is 100 hours.
Curfew Order
Courts in England and Wales can issue a
curfew order confining offenders to their
homes at certain times to prevent them going
to places which may be associated with their
offending. It may also be combined with
probation, community service or the new
combination order.
Compensation
The courts may order an offender to pay
compensation for personal injury, loss or
damage resulting from an offence. In England
and Wales courts are required to give reasons
for not awarding compensation to a victim.
Compensation takes precedence over fines.
Other Measures
A court in England, Wales and Northern
Ireland may discharge a person if it believes
that punishment should not be inflicted and a
probation order is not appropriate. If he or
she is conditionally discharged, the offender
remains liable to punishment for the offence
if convicted of another offence within a
period specified by the court (not more than
three years).
The Crown Court may ‘bind over’ an
offender by requiring him or her to keep the
peace and/or be of good behaviour. If this
requirement is not complied with, the
offender may be brought before the court and
dealt with for the original offence.
Alternatively, a sum of money may be
forfeited if conditions stated by the court are
not met. Similar powers are available to
courts in Northern Ireland.
In Scotland and Northern Ireland there is
a system of deferral of sentence until a future
date. During this period the accused is
required to be of good behaviour and to meet
any other conditions stipulated by the court.
The court may also warn the offender or
grant an absolute discharge.
Police cautions are used particularly for
young offenders; the caution is a form of
warning and no court action is taken.
Prisons
The Prison Service in England and Wales
and the Scottish Prison Service became
executive agencies in April 1993. Government
ministers remain accountable for policy but
the Chief Executives are responsible for the
delivery of services.
The average prison population in 1992
was 44,718 in England and Wales, 1,810
in Northern Ireland, and 5,257 in
Scotland.
Prisoners may be housed in
accommodation ranging from open prisons to
high security establishments. In England,
Scotland and Wales sentenced prisoners are
classified into groups for security purposes.
There are separate prisons for women. There
90
JUSTICE AND THE LAW
are no open prisons in Northern Ireland,
where the majority of offenders are serving
sentences for terrorist offences. People
awaiting trial in custody are entitled to
privileges not granted to convicted prisoners.
Those under 21 are, where possible,
separated from convicted prisoners.
There are about 130 prison
establishments in England and Wales and
some 20 in Scotland, many of which were
built in the 19th century. Improvements are
in progress to eliminate cells without access
to integral sanitation, while overcrowding is
being relieved by a prison building
programme.
In Northern Ireland there is no
overcrowding in the four prisons and a
young offenders’ centre. Four of these
establishments have been built since 1972.
White Paper on the Prison Service in
England and Wales
Building on the recommendations of the
Woolf Report on the 1990 prison
disturbances, a White Paper published in
1991 set out a programme of reforms for the
prison service in England and Wales. The
aim is to provide a better prison system,
with more effective measures for security
and control, more constructive relationships
between prisoners and staff, and more
stimulating and useful programmes for
prisoners.
Private Sector Involvement
Under the Criminal Justice Act 1991 the
Home Secretary can contract out to the
private sector the management of prisons in
England and Wales, as well as escort and
guarding functions. A new privately-run
remand centre—the Wolds in Humberside—
came into use in April 1992. Blakenhurst
local prison in Worcestershire, also under
private management, opened in May 1993.
A plan for more private sector
involvement in the Prison Service was
announced by the Government in September
1993. In the initial phase about 10 per cent
of prisons in England and Wales (12 in total)
will be managed by the private sector.
Early Release of Prisoners
The Criminal Justice Act 1991 has reformed
the remission and parole systems in England
and Wales, with new arrangements since
October 1992 for the early release of
prisoners and for their supervision and
liabilities after release. The Parole Board
continues to advise the Home Secretary on
the early release or recall of long-term
prisoners.
Prisoners serving terms of less than four
years may be released once they have served
half of their sentences in custody. Long-term
prisoners (those serving more than four years)
may be released once they have served two-
thirds of their sentence; the Parole Board
may release them on licence half-way through
their sentence if they are serving between
four and seven years. The Home Secretary
has to give final consent to such parole if the
prisoner is serving more than seven years. All
prisoners sentenced to a year or more may be
supervised on release until three-quarters of
their sentence has passed. Certain sex
offenders may be supervised to the end of
their sentence.
If convicted of another offence punishable
with imprisonment and committed before the
end of the original sentence, a released
prisoner may be liable to serve all or part of
the original sentence outstanding at the time
the fresh offence was committed. Similar
changes have been adopted in Scotland.
Northern Ireland
In Northern Ireland prisoners serving a
sentence of more than five days are eligible
for remission of half their sentence. A
prisoner serving a sentence of more than 12
months who is given remission is liable to be
ordered to serve the remainder of this
sentence if convicted of fresh imprisonable
offences during this period.
Remission for those convicted of terrorist
offences and serving sentences of five years
or more is one-third. Any released prisoners
convicted of another terrorist offence before
the expiry of the original sentence must
complete that sentence before serving any
term for the second offence.
91
BRITAIN 1994: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Life Sentence Prisoners
The Criminal Justice Act 1991 provides for
the early release of prisoners serving life
sentences for offences other than murder.
The Home Secretary is required to release
such prisoners after an initial period set by
the trial judge if so directed by the Parole
Board, which has to be satisfied that the
protection of the public does not require their
further confinement. These provisions conform
with the requirements of the European
Convention on Human Rights. Similar
procedures have been adopted in Scotland.
People serving life sentences for the
murder of police and prison officers, terrorist
murders, murder by firearms in the course of
robbery and the sexual or sadistic murder of
children are normally detained for at least 20
years.
The release on licence of prisoners serving
mandatory life sentences for murder may
only be authorised by the Home Secretary on
the recommendation of the Parole Board. A
similar policy applies in Scotland. On release,
life sentence prisoners remain on licence for
the rest of their lives and are subject to recall
if their behaviour suggests that they might
again be a danger to the public.
In Northern Ireland the Secretary of
State reviews life sentence cases on the
recommendation of an internal review body.
At the end of 1991 there were about 3,100
life sentence prisoners in England and Wales,
of whom about 376 had been detained for
over 15 years.
Repatriation
Sentenced prisoners who are nationals of
countries which have ratified the Council of
Europe Convention on the Transfer of
Sentenced Persons or similar international
arrangements may apply to be returned to
their own country to serve the rest of their
sentence there.
Independent Oversight of the Prison System
Every prison establishment has a Board of
Visitors—a Visiting Committee in Scotland—
drawn from the local community. In order to
see that prisoners are being treated fairly,
members may go to any part of the prison
and interview any inmate at any time.
The independent Prisons Inspectorates
report on the treatment of prisoners and
prison conditions. Each establishment is
visited about every two years.
Prison Industries
Prison industries aim to give inmates work
experience which will assist them when
released and to secure a return which will
reduce the cost of the prison system. The
main industries are clothing and textile
manufacture, engineering, woodwork,
laundering, farming and horticulture. In
England and Wales most production caters
for internal needs and for other public
services, whereas in Scotland a greater
proportion is sold to the private sector. A few
prisoners are employed outside prison, some
in community service projects.
Prison Education
Full-time education of 15 hours a week is
compulsory for young offenders below school
leaving age. For older offenders it is
voluntary. Some prisoners study for public
examinations, including those of the Open
University. Competitive tendering for the
provision of education services in prisons is
taking place and it is hoped that the award of
contracts will be completed by January 1994.
The Prison Service in England and Wales is
placing increasing emphasis on the
development and implementation of National
Vocational Qualifications (see p. 415) for
inmates. Similar moves are underway in
Scotland.
All new prisons have purpose-built
education units, and schemes to build new
education accommodation or enhance existing
facilities are also underway or planned at
many other establishments.
Physical education is voluntary for adult
offenders but compulsory for young
offenders. Practically all prisons have physical
education facilities, some of which are
purpose-built. Opportunities are given for
inmates to obtain proficiency awards issued
92
JUSTICE AND THE LAW
by governing bodies of sport. Inmates also
compete against teams in the local community.
Health Care
The Health Care Service for Prisoners in
England and Wales is responsible for the
physical and mental health of all those in
custody. A Health Advisory Committee
provides independent medical advice to
government ministers, the Prison Service Chief
Executive and the Director of Health Care.
In Scotland psychiatric and psychological
services are bought in from local Health Boards
responsible for the National Health Service. A
review of medical services is taking place.
Privileges and Discipline
Prisoners may write and receive letters and be
visited by relatives and friends, and those in
some establishments may make telephone
calls. Privileges include a personal radio,
books, periodicals and newspapers, and the
opportunity to make purchases from the
canteen with money earned in prison.
Depending on facilities, prisoners may be
granted the further privileges of dining and
recreation in association, and watching
television.
Breaches of discipline are dealt with by the
prison governor. A Prisons’ Ombudsman for
England and Wales is being appointed as a
final appeal stage for prisoners’ grievances and
a code of standards governing conditions and
facilities is being developed.
A new grievance procedure for prisoners in
Scotland is under consideration.
Religion
Anglican, Church of Scotland, Roman
Catholic and Methodist chaplains provide
opportunities for worship and spiritual
counselling. They are supported by visiting
ministers of other denominations and faiths as
required.
Preparation for Release
The Prison Service has a duty to prepare
prisoners for release. Sentence planning is
being extended progressively to all prisoners
serving substantial sentences, in conjunction
with extended arrangements for aftercare (see
p. 94). Many medium- and long-term
prisoners in the later parts of their sentences
may be granted home leave for short periods.
The Pre-Release Employment Scheme in
England and Wales and the Training for
Freedom Scheme in Scotland enable selected
long-term prisoners to spend their last six
months before release in certain hostels
attached to prisons, to help them re-adapt to
society. Hostellers work in the outside
community and return to the hostel each
evening. Frequent weekend leave allows
hostellers to renew ties with their families.
In Northern Ireland prisoners serving
fixed sentences may have short periods of
leave near the end of their sentences and at
Christmas. Life-sentence prisoners are given
a nine-month pre-release programme which
includes employment outside the prison.
Aftercare
Professional support is given to offenders
following their release. Most young offenders
under the age of 22, adult offenders released
early and those released on licence from a
life sentence receive a period of compulsory
supervision from the probation service or,
in Scotland, local authority social work
services.
Young Offenders
England and Wales
Criminal proceedings cannot be brought
against children below the age of 10 years.
Arrangements for dealing with young
offenders above that age were amended by
the Criminal Justice Act 1991. In addition,
proposals to detain persistent 12- to 15-year-
old offenders in secure training centres were
announced by the Government in March
1993 (see below).
Since October 1992, 17-year-old offenders
have fallen within the jurisdiction of youth
courts (previously juvenile courts). Treated as
a coherent group by the Act, 16- and 17-
year-olds may be given the same probation,
93
BRITAIN 1994: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
curfew and community service orders as older
offenders. Also available to the court are the
same supervision orders or community
sentences given to younger offenders.
Under a supervision order—which may
remain in force for not more than three years
—a child (10-13 years old) or young person
(14-17 years old) normally lives at home
under the supervision of a social worker or a
probation officer. The order can be used to
provide for remedial activities through a short
residential course or, more usually,
attendance at a day or evening centre.
Anyone under 21 years of age found guilty
of an offence for which an adult may be
imprisoned can be ordered to go to an
attendance centre, as can an offender who
refuses to comply with another order (for
example, default in paying a fine or breach of
a probation order). The maximum number of
hours of attendance is 36 (or 24 if the
offender is aged under 16) spread over a
period; the minimum is 12 hours. The order
aims to encourage offenders to make more
constructive use of their leisure time.
A custodial sentence can be imposed on a
young offender if this is necessary to protect
the public from harm, or if the offence is so
serious that it cannot justify a non-custodial
sentence.
In the case of a very serious crime
committed by a young person aged 17 or
under, detention in a place approved by the
Home Secretary may be ordered, and must
be ordered in the case of murder. Detention
may be in a secure local authority residential
unit, a centre managed by the Youth
Treatment Service or a young offender
institution.
The custodial sentence for those aged
18-20 is also detention in a young offender
institution. Alternatives include fines and
compensation, attendance centre orders (for
up to 36 hours) and community service
orders (for between 40 and 240 hours).
The 1991 Act strengthened the courts’
duty and powers to involve the parents of
young offenders when their cases are heard.
If the offender is under 16:
• the parents must attend the hearing
unless there are exceptional
circumstances;
• the court has to consider whether the
parents should be bound over to exercise
proper control of the child; and
• the court has to take account of the
parents’ means when assessing fines
imposed on the offender.
Parents may be ordered to pay these fines.
In the case of 16- and 17-year-old
offenders, the court’s duty to involve parents
is replaced by a power. Where local
authorities have assumed parental
responsibility, the duty to attend court and
pay any fines also applies.
The 1991 legislation will allow the courts
to send juveniles to secure local authority
accommodation instead of adult prisons if
they need to be held in secure conditions
when awaiting trial or sentence.
Under the proposals announced in March
1993, courts would be able to impose a secure
training order on 12- to 15-year-olds
convicted of three imprisonable offences and
not complying with the requirements of
supervision in the community while on
remand or under sentence. This proposal is
designed to protect the public from persistent
reoffending by such juveniles. Before making
the order, the court would be required to
take account of a pre-sentence report. The
order could last for up to two years.
Scotland
Children under 16 who have committed an
offence or are considered to be in need of
care and protection may be brought before a
children’s panel, consisting of three lay
people, which determines in an informal
setting whether compulsory measures of care
are required and, if so, the form they should
take. An official known as the reporter
decides whether a child should come before a
hearing. If the grounds for referral are not
accepted by the child or parent, the case goes
to the sheriff for proof. If he finds the
grounds established, the sheriff remits the
case to the reporter to arrange a hearing.
The sheriff also decides appeals against a
hearing’s decision.
Young people aged between 16 and 21
serve custodial sentences in a young offender
institution. Remission of part of the sentence
94
JUSTICE AND THE LAW
for good behaviour, release on parole and
supervision on release are available.
Northern Ireland
Those aged between 10 and 16 who are
charged with a criminal offence are normally
brought before a juvenile court. If found
guilty'of an offence punishable in the case of
an adult by imprisonment, the court may
order the offender to be placed in care, under
supervision or on probation. The offender
may also be required to attend a day
attendance centre, be sent to a training school
or committed to residence in a remand home.
Non-custodial options are the same as in
England and Wales.
Offenders aged between 16 and 21 who
receive custodial sentences of less than three
years serve them in a young offenders’ centre.
Civil Justice
The Civil Law
The civil law of England, Wales and
Northern Ireland covers business related to
the family, property, contracts and torts (non¬
contractual wrongful acts suffered by one
person at the hands of another). It also includes
constitutional, administrative, industrial,
maritime and ecclesiastical law. Scottish civil
law has its own, broadly similar, branches.
CIVIL COURTS
England and Wales
In October 1991 the civil jurisdiction of
magistrates’ courts was reorganised. They
now have a concurrent jurisdiction with the
county courts and the High Court in cases
relating to children. The courts also have
jurisdiction regarding public health and the
recovery of local taxes.
I he jurisdiction of the 270 county courts
covers:
• actions founded upon contract and
tort;
• trust and mortgage cases;
• actions for the recovery of land;
• cases involving disputes between
landlords and tenants;
• complaints about race and sex
discrimination;
• admiralty cases (maritime questions
and offences) and patent cases; and
• divorce cases and other family matters.
Specialised work is concentrated in certain
designated courts. In some types of cases, for
example, admiralty cases, a county court is
restricted to an upper financial limit. There
are special arbitration facilities and simplified
procedures for small claims not exceeding
£1,000. There are also special care centres
and family hearing centres which deal with
contested family matters involving children.
The High Court, which is divided into
three divisions, deals with the more
complicated civil cases. Its jurisdiction
covers mainly civil and some criminal
cases; it also deals with appeals from tribunals
and from magistrates’ courts in both civil and
criminal matters. The three divisions are:
• the Family Division, which is concerned
with law affecting the family, including
adoption and uncontested wills;
• the Chancery Division, which deals with
corporate and personal insolvency;
disputes in the running of companies,
between landlords and tenants and in
intellectual property matters; and the
interpretation of trusts and contested
wills; and
• the Queen’s Bench Division, which is
concerned with contract and tort cases,
and deals with applications for judicial
review. Maritime law and commercial law
are the responsibility of the Division’s
admiralty and commercial courts.
In the event of overlapping jurisdiction
between the High Court, the county courts
and the magistrates’ courts, cases of
exceptional importance, complexity or
financial substance are reserved or transferred
for trial in the High Court.
Appeals
Appeals in matrimonial, adoption and
guardianship proceedings heard by
95
BRITAIN 1994: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
magistrates’ courts go to the Family
Division of the High Court. Since October
1991 appeals on child care cases have also
been dealt with by the High Court. Appeals
from the High Court and county courts
are heard in the Court of Appeal (Civil
Division), and may go on to the House
of Lords.
The Law Lords deal with cases
submitted to the House of Lords. They are
professional judges who are given life
peerages. In addition, peers who have held
high judicial office are qualified to sit as
Lords appeal judges. A group of five judges
usually deals with cases. The Lord
Chancellor is president of the House in its
judicial capacity.
Scotland
The civil courts are the Court of Session
and the sheriff court, which have the same
jurisdiction over most civil litigation,
although cases with a value of less than
£1,500 are dealt with only by the sheriff
court. Appeals from the sheriff court may
be made to the sheriff principal or directly
to the Court of Session in ordinary actions.
In summary actions (generally cases
where the value of the claim is between
£750 and £1,500) the case may be appealed
to the sheriff principal on a point of law and
to the Court of Session thereafter only if the
sheriff principal certifies the case as suitable.
In small claims (cases where the value of the
claim does not exceed £750) there may be
an appeal to the sheriff principal on a point
of law.
The Court of Session sits in Edinburgh,
and in general has jurisdiction to deal with
all kinds of action. It is divided into the
Outer House (a court of first instance) and
the Inner House (mainly an appeal court).
Appeals to the Inner House may be made
from the Outer House and from the sheriff
court. From the Inner House an appeal may
go to the House of Lords.
The Scottish Land Court deals
exclusively with matters concerning
agriculture. Its chairman has the status and
tenure of a judge of the Court of Session
and its other members are lay specialists.
Northern Ireland
Civil cases up to the value of £10,000 are
dealt with in county courts, although an
increase to £15,000 is under consideration.
The magistrates’ court in Northern Ireland
also deals with certain limited classes of civil
case. The superior civil law court is the High
Court of Justice, from which an appeal may
be made to the Court of Appeal. The House
of Lords is the final civil appeal court.
Appeals from county courts are dealt with by
the High Court or the Court of Appeal.
Civil Proceedings
England and Wales
Civil proceedings are started by the aggrieved
person. Actions in the High Court are usually
begun by a writ served on the defendant by
the plaintiff, stating the nature of the claim.
Before the case is set down for trial in the
High Court, documents (pleadings) setting
out the scope of the dispute are filed with the
court; the pleadings are also served on the
parties. County court proceedings are
initiated by a summons, usually served on the
defendant by the court. Child care cases are
initiated by an application.
In order to encourage parties to confine
the issues in dispute, the High Court and the
county courts have power to order pre-trial
exchange of witness statements. Courts may
impose penalties in costs on parties who
unreasonably refuse to admit facts or disclose
documents before trial.
Civil proceedings, as a private matter, can
usually be abandoned or ended by settlement
between the parties at any time. Actions
brought to court are usually tried without a
jury, except in defamation, false
imprisonment or malicious prosecution cases
or where fraud is alleged, when either party
may apply for trial by jury. The jury decides
questions of fact and determines damages to
be paid to the injured party; majority verdicts
may be accepted. The Court of Appeal is
able to increase or reduce damages awarded
by a jury if it considers them inadequate
or excessive.
A decree of divorce must be pronounced
96
JUSTICE AND THE LAW
in open court, but a procedure for most
undefended cases dispenses with the need to
give evidence in court and permits written
evidence to be considered by the county
court district judge.
In civil cases heard by a magistrates’ court,
the court issues a summons to the defendant
setting out details of the complaint and the
date oh which it will be heard. Parties and
witnesses give their evidence at the court
hearing. Domestic proceedings are normally
heard by not more than three lay justices,
including, where practicable, a woman.
Members of the public are not allowed to be
present. The court may make orders
concerning residence, contact and supervision
of children, as well as maintenance payments
for spouses and children.
The law has been changed recently to
speed up civil proceedings in magistrates’
courts by allowing written statements, expert
opinions and hearsay evidence to be
accepted in court without the presence of
the witness, unless the evidence is disputed
and the disputing party requests the presence
of the witness.
Most judgments are for sums of money
and may be enforced, in cases of non¬
payment, by seizure of the debtor’s goods or
by a court order requiring an employer to
make periodic payments to the court by
deduction from the debtor’s earnings. Other
court remedies may include an injunction
restraining someone from performing an
unlawful act. Refusal to obey a court order
may result in imprisonment for contempt.
Normally the court orders the costs of an
action to be paid by the party losing it, but,
in the case of family law maintenance
proceedings, a magistrates’ court can order
either party to pay the whole or part of the
other’s costs.
Scotland
Proceedings in the Court of Session or
ordinary actions in the sheriff court are
initiated by serving the defender with a
summons (an initial writ in the sheriff court).
A defender who intends to contest the action
must inform the court; if he or she fails to do
so, the court normally grants a decree in
absence in favour of the pursuer. Where a
case is contested, both parties must prepare
written pleadings. Time is allowed for either
party to adjust their pleadings in the light of
what the other has said. At the end of this
period a hearing will normally be arranged.
In summary cases (involving sums between
£750 and £ 1,500) in the sheriff court a
statement of claim is incorporated in the
summons. The procedure is designed to
enable most actions to be carried through
without the parties involved having to appear
in court. Normally they, or their
representatives, need appear only when an
action is defended.
Northern Ireland
There are differences between proceedings in
Northern Ireland and in England and Wales
—for example, procedures in the county
court start with the issue of a civil bill, which
is served by the plaintiff on the defendant.
Tribunals
Tribunals exercise separate judicial functions
and tend to be more accessible, less formal
and less expensive. They are normally set up
under statutory powers, which also govern
their constitution, functions and procedure.
Tribunals often consist of lay people, but
they are generally chaired by a legally
qualified person.
Some tribunals decide disputes between
private citizens. Industrial tribunals, for
example, have a major role in employment
disputes. Others, such as those concerned
with social security, resolve claims by private
citizens against public authorities. A further
group (including tax tribunals) decide
disputed claims by public authorities against
private citizens. Tribunals usually consist of
an uneven number of people so that a
majority decision can be reached.
In the case of some tribunals a two-tier
system operates, with an initial right of
appeal to a lower tribunal and a further right
of appeal, usually on a point of law, to a
higher one and thence to the Court of
Appeal. Appeals from single tier tribunals can
be made on a point of law only to the High
97
BRITAIN 1994: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Court in England and Wales, to the Court of
Session in Scotland, and to the Court of
Appeal in Northern Ireland.
The independent Council on Tribunals
exercises general supervision over many
tribunals. A Scottish Committee of the
Council exercises the same function in
Scotland.
Administration of the Law
GOVERNMENT RESPONSIBILITIES
England and Wales
The Lord Chancellor is the head of the
judiciary and is responsible for the
administration of all courts other than
coroners’ courts, and for a number of
administrative tribunals. The highest judicial
appointments are made by the Queen on the
advice of the Prime Minister. The Lord
Chancellor recommends all other judicial
appointments to the Crown and appoints
magistrates. He has general responsibility for
the legal aid and advice schemes and for the
administration of civil law reform.
The Home Secretary has overall
responsibility for:
• criminal law;
• the police service;
• the prison system;
• the probation and after-care service; and
• advising the Queen on the exercise of the
royal prerogative of mercy to pardon a
person convicted of a crime or to remit
all or part of a penalty imposed by a
court.
The Attorney General and the Solicitor
General are the Government’s principal legal
advisers and represent the Crown in
appropriate domestic and international cases.
They are senior barristers, elected members
of the House of Commons and hold
ministerial posts. The Attorney General is
also Attorney General for Northern Ireland.
As well as exercising various civil law
functions, the Attorney General has final
responsibility for enforcing the criminal law.
The Solicitor General is the Attorney’s
deputy. As head of the Crown Prosecution
Service, the Director of Public Prosecutions
is subject to superintendence by the Attorney
General, as are the Director of the Serious
Fraud Office and the Director of Public
Prosecutions for Northern Ireland.
Scotland
The Scottish Secretary recommends the
appointment of all judges other than the most
senior ones, appoints the staff of the High
Court of Justiciary and the Court of Session,
and is responsible for the administration and
staffing of the sheriff courts. (The district
and islands local authorities are responsible
for the district courts.)
The Scottish Secretary is also responsible
for Scottish criminal law, crime prevention,
the police, the penal system and legal aid; he
or she is advised on parole matters by the
Parole Board for Scotland.
The Lord Advocate and the Solicitor
General for Scotland are the chief legal
advisers to the Government on Scottish
questions and the principal representatives of
the Crown for the purposes of Scottish
litigation. Both are government ministers.
Northern Ireland
Court administration is the responsibility of
the Lord Chancellor, while the Northern
Ireland Office, under the Secretary of State,
deals with policy and legislation concerning
criminal law, the police and the penal system.
The Lord Chancellor has general
responsibility for legal aid, advice and
assistance.
THE PERSONNEL OF THE LAW
Judges, who are not subject to ministerial
direction or control, are normally appointed
from practising barristers, advocates (in
Scotland), or solicitors (see below). Lay
magistrates in England and Wales and
Scottish district court justices are trained to
give them sufficient knowledge of the law,
including the rules of evidence, and of the
nature and purpose of sentencing.
98
JUSTICE AND THE LAW
In Northern Ireland members of a lay
panel who serve in juvenile courts undertake
training courses; resident magistrates are
drawn from practising solicitors or barristers.
The Legal Profession
The legal profession has two branches:
barristers (advocates in Scotland) and
solicitors. Solicitors undertake legal business
for individual and corporate clients, while
barristers advise on legal problems submitted
through solicitors and present cases in the
higher courts. Certain functions are common
to both, for example, presentation of cases in
the lower courts. Although people are free to
conduct their own cases, most people prefer
to be legally represented, especially in more
serious cases.
Legislation in 1990 was designed to
stimulate the development of good quality
legal services for clients in Great Britain by
lifting restrictions on who can provide these
services. The Law Society, which represents
solicitors in England and Wales, has applied
to extend their rights of audience to the
higher courts.
In Scotland, solicitor-advocates were
introduced to the higher courts in
May 1993. Before first appearing there,
they have to complete satisfactorily
the relevant examination and training
requirements.
The 1990 legislation also contains
provisions which would allow building
societies, banks and other financial
organisations to offer conveyancing and
probate services under a scheme providing
new safeguards to clients. People will also
be able to negotiate a form of ‘no win, no
fee’ agreement with their legal advisers in
certain types of case in due course. The
implementation of these provisions is subject
to parliamentary approval.
Complaints systems against solicitors and
barristers are backed up by the Legal
Services Ombudsman for England and Wales,
who conducts investigations into the way the
professional bodies handle these complaints.
There is a separate Ombudsman for Scotland.
LEGAL AID
A person needing legal advice or legal
representation in court may qualify for help
with the costs out of public funds, either
free or with a contribution according to
means.
Green Form Scheme
People whose income and savings are within
certain limits are entitled to advice from a
solicitor on legal matters.
In England and Wales the scheme
provides for up to three hours’ work for
matrimonial cases where a petition is drafted
and two hours’ for other work. There are
cost limits in Northern Ireland.
Legal Aid in Civil Proceedings
Civil legal aid, which covers representation
before the court, may be available for most
civil proceedings to those who satisfy the
financial eligibility conditions. An applicant
for legal aid must also show that he or she
has reasonable grounds for taking or
defending proceedings or being a party to
proceedings. In England and Wales all
payments to lawyers are made through the
Legal Aid Fund administered by the Legal
Aid Board. Legal aid in Northern Ireland is
administered by the Law Society for
Northern Ireland.
In certain limited circumstances the
successful unassisted opponent of a legally
aided party may recover his or her costs in
the case from the Legal Aid Board. Where
the assisted person recovers or preserves
money or property in the proceedings, the
Legal Aid Fund will usually have a first
charge on that money or property to recover
money spent on the assisted person’s behalf.
Legal Aid in Criminal Proceedings
In criminal proceedings in England, Wales
and Northern Ireland legal aid may be
granted by the court if it appears to be in
the interests of justice and if a defendant is
considered to require financial assistance. A
legal aid order must be granted (subject to
99
BRITAIN 1994: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
means) when a person is committed for
trial on a murder charge or where the
prosecutor appeals or applies for leave to
appeal from the Court of Appeal to the
House of Lords. A financial contribution may
be payable.
The Legal Aid Board in England and
Wales makes arrangements for duty solicitors
to assist unrepresented defendants in the
magistrates’ courts. Solicitors are available, on
a 24-hour basis, to give advice and assistance
to suspects at police stations. The services of
a solicitor at a police station and of the duty
solicitor at court are free.
In Northern Ireland a voluntary duty
solicitor scheme has been introduced at the
main magistrates’ court in Belfast. Legal aid
for criminal cases is free.
Scotland
A duty solicitor is available to represent
people in custody on their first appearance in
the sheriff courts and the district courts
without enquiry into the person’s means. In
other cases, a person seeking legal aid in
summary criminal proceedings must apply to
the Scottish Legal Aid Board, which must be
satisfied that the costs of the case cannot be
met by the applicant without undue hardship,
and that it is in the interests of justice that
legal aid is awarded.
In solemn proceedings the court decides
on the availability of legal aid and must be
satisfied that the accused cannot meet the
costs of the defence without undue financial
hardship. Where legal aid is granted in
criminal proceedings to the accused, he or
she is not required to pay any contribution
towards expenses.
Free Representation Units
The Bar Council, the barristers’ professional
body, runs free representation units in
England and Wales for clients at a variety of
tribunals for which legal aid is not available.
Most of the representation in London is
carried out by Bar students supported and
advised by full-time case workers. Elsewhere
the work is carried out by barristers.
Law Centres
In some urban areas law centres provide free
legal advice and representation. Financed
from various sources, often including local
government authorities, they usually employ
full-time salaried lawyers and many have
community workers. Much of their time is
devoted to housing, employment, social
security and immigration problems.
Free advice is also available in Citizens
Advice Bureaux, consumer and housing
advice centres and in specialist advice centres
run by voluntary organisations.

Economic Strategy 107 Expenditure 109
From 1981 to 1989 the British economy experienced eight years of sustained
growth at an annual average rate of over 3 per cent. However, subsequently
Britain and other major industrialised nations were severely affected by
recession. In Britain growth slowed to 0.6 per cent in 1990, and in 1991 gross
domestic product (GDP) fell by 2.3 per cent. GDP fell in 1992 as a whole by
0.4 per cent, but it rose slightly in the second half of the year. The recovery
strengthened during the first part of 1993, with GDP in the second quarter
being 2 per cent higher than a year earlier; the European Commission
expects Britain to be the fastest growing of all the major European economies
in 1993 and 1994.
The economy is now benefiting from
substantially lower interest rates. In
September 1993 base interest rates were at
6 per cent. They had been cut by
9 percentage points since October 1990,
and were at their lowest since 1977.
ECONOMIC BACKGROUND
The economy is primarily based on private
enterprise, and government policy is aimed at
Recent indications that the recovery is under
way include:
• an increase in manufacturing output;
• a steady upward trend in retail sales;
• increases in new car registrations;
• record levels of exports (see p. 106);
• increased business and consumer
confidence; and
• signs of greater activity in the housing
market.

which accounts for about 80 per cent of total
output in the whole economy and around
three-quarters of total employment.
Values for some of the main economic
indicators in selected years since 1982 are
shown in Table 9.1. For further information
see the Statistical Annex on pp. 505-7.
Inflation
During most of the 1950s and the 1960s the
inflation rate in Britain rarely rose above 5
per cent. However, in 1971 inflation reached
double figures, climbing to 27 per cent in
1975. Contributory factors included oil price
rises in 1973 and increases in the money
supply and public spending. Inflation fell in
the early 1980s and stayed low for a number
of years. However, it picked up towards the
end of the decade and the annual rate rose to
10.9 per cent in September and October
1990.
Since this peak, inflation has fallen
substantially. In August 1993 the standard
Retail Prices Index (RPI)—which measures
the change in the price of goods and services
purchased by households in Britain—had
been below 2 per cent for eight consecutive
months, a performance not achieved since
1960. It has been below the European
Community average since August 1991.
Inflation, as measured by the RPI, reached
1.2 per cent in June 1993. This was the
lowest rate since February 1964.
Excluding mortgage interest payments, the
annual rate of inflation was 2.8 per cent in
June 1993. This was the lowest annual rate
for this series, which began in 1975. Latest
figures remain well within the target range of
1 to 4 per cent set by the Government.
Costs have been falling in a number of
areas:
• unit wage costs in manufacturing have
been falling, and the reduction in the
three months to March 1993 was the
largest since records began in 1970;
• the underlying increase in average
earnings has declined considerably and in
the year to July 1993 was 3.5 per cent,
the lowest since 1967.
Output
After the oil price rises of 1973-74,
manufacturing output dropped sharply. It
later increased from this trough, but in the
wake of another oil price rise and stagnation
in the world economy, it fell back again in
the late 1970s and early 1980s. A period of
steady growth occurred until 1990, but
output fell significantly during the recent
recession. Indications are that output is now
recovering, both for the economy as a whole
and for manufacturing.
Largely as a result of exploitation of North
Sea oil and gas, energy output in 1986 was
about twice the level of ten years earlier. Oil
output has now passed its peak of the mid-
1980s and has since fallen back by about 23
per cent. Oil output recovered strongly in the
second half of 1992 and rose by 3.3 per cent
in 1992.
Only 1 per cent of Britain’s workforce
is engaged in agriculture, a lower
proportion than in any other major
industrialised country. However,
Britain manages to produce over half
of its own food.
Recent decades have generally seen the
fastest growth in the services sector. Services
account for around two-thirds of GDP and of
employment, compared with about half of
GDP in 1950. Manufacturing contributes less
than a quarter of GDP, compared with over a
third in 1950. Table 9.2 compares output and
employment in 1991 and 1992.
Productivity
Growth in manufacturing productivity in
Britain in the 1980s was faster than in all
other leading industrialised countries.
Between 1980 and 1990 manufacturing
productivity in Britain grew by an average of
4.7 per cent a year. Productivity in the
economy as a whole fell very slightly in 1990.
However, it has been rising since the start of
1991, reflecting the decline in employment
relative to output. In 1992 it rose by 2.3 per
cent. Manufacturing productivity has been
growing at a higher rate, and in the three

months to June 1993 was 8.2 per cent higher
than in the same period of 1992.
Investment
From 1983 until 1989 fixed investment
increased by about 9 per cent a year on
average, with particularly rapid growth of
over 10 per cent a year occurring between
1986 and 1988. With the recession,
investment declined between 1990 and 1992,
but there are now indications of higher
investment. Over the decade 1980-90 the
private sector’s share of fixed investment
grew from 70 to 84 per cent, due in part to
privatisation (see pp. 143-4). Over the same
period there was a rise in the share of
investment undertaken by the services sector
and a fall in that carried out by
manufacturing.
An improvement in the quality of
investment contributed to the rise in the late
1980s in the net real rate of return on capital
employed in non-North Sea industrial and
commercial companies. Profitability declined
in 1990 and 1991, but there was a recovery in
1992 when net profitability amounted to 7
per cent. Table 9.3 shows investment by
industrial sector.

BRITAIN 1994: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
1990, reaching 26.9 million. It has
subsequently declined and in June 1993
amounted to 24.9 million. Nevertheless,
Britain has a higher proportion of the
population of working age in employment
than other EC countries except Denmark.
From 1979 to 1990 self-employment rose
every year, but between June 1991 and June
1993 it dropped by 320,000 to 3 million.
As in other industrialised countries, there
is serious concern about unemployment.
Seasonally adjusted unemployment rose to
just under 3 million at the start of 1993.
However, unemployment is now at a slightly
lower level: by August 1993 it was 2.9 million
—10.4 per cent of the workforce.
Overseas Trade
Britain has an open economy in which
international trade plays a vital part. The
proportion of GDP accounted for by exports
of goods and services has increased from
around one-fifth in the early 1960s to about a
quarter. Similar rises have occurred in most
other developed countries, reflecting the
growing importance of international trade in
an increasingly interdependent world
economy.
Britain is a major exporter of aerospace
products, electrical and electronic equipment,
chemicals, oil and many types of machinery.
It is also one of the world’s largest importers
of agricultural products, raw materials and
semi-manufactures. For the last ten years
Britain has had a deficit on visible trade.
This rose to some £13,000 million in 1992,
reflecting a higher rise in the volume of
imports than of exports and also short-run
adverse effects as import prices rose faster
than export prices following the depreciation
of sterling. However, exports were running at
record levels and were rising more strongly
than imports towards the end of 1992.
Substantial net earnings on invisible
transactions kept the current account of the
balance of payments1 in surplus in most years
up to 1986, but it has been in deficit since
then. The contribution made by invisibles to
For further information on trade and the balance of payments
see Chapter 15, Overseas Trade.
the current account partly reflects Britain’s
position as a major financial centre. The
surplus on invisibles was nearly £4,800
million in 1992, although this is still at a
lower level than in the mid-1980s. Britain’s
invisibles account has been affected by the
abolition of exchange controls in 1979 and
the growth in world markets for insurance,
banking, tourism, consultancy and other
services. In 1992 exports of services were
valued at around 30 per cent of exports of
goods.
Membership of the EC has had a major
impact on Britain’s pattern of trade,
increasing the proportion of trade with other
member countries. Between 1972 and 1992
the share of Britain’s exports of goods going
to other members of the Community rose
from 33 to 56 per cent. Imports followed a
similar trend, growing from 36 to 53 per
cent. Trade with Japan and with the newly
industrialised countries, including Singapore,
Korea, Taiwan and Malaysia, has also risen
significantly.
Inward Investment
Britain is recognised as an attractive location
for inward direct investment and some 13,000
overseas companies are currently operating in
Britain. This reflects its membership of the
EC and proximity to other European
markets, its stable labour relations and
comparatively low personal and corporate
taxation. Overseas-owned firms are offered
the same incentives as British-owned ones.
Britain attracts about a third of all inward
investment in the European Community. At
the end of 1992 total United States direct
investment in Britain was valued at
US$77,800 million, representing about two-
fifths of US investment in the EC. Britain
has for many years been the leading
destination for US manufacturing
investment in Europe. It also has around
two-fifths of Japanese manufacturing
investment in the EC.
Energy
With the exploitation of oil and natural gas
from the Continental Shelf under the North
106
NATIONAL ECONOMY
Sea, Britain is self-sufficient in energy in net
terms and expects to remain so for some
years. In 1992 it was the world’s ninth largest
oil producer and the extraction of oil and gas
accounted for some 4 per cent of GDP, while
crude oil and petroleum products accounted
for 6.4 per cent of visible exports.
The benefits to the balance of payments
began to appear in the second half of the
1970s and in 1980 Britain had its first surplus
on oil trade. The oil surplus reached its peak
in 1985, at £8,100 million. With the
reduction in oil prices the surplus has fallen
and amounted to some £1,500 million in
1992. Exports, mainly to other EC countries,
are equivalent to well over half of domestic
oil production. They are partly offset in
balance-of-payments terms by imports of
other grades of crude oil from the Middle
East and elsewhere.
ECONOMIC STRATEGY
The Government’s policy is to ensure
sustainable economic growth through low
inflation and sound public finances.
Following the suspension in September 1992
of sterling’s membership of the exchange rate
mechanism (ERM) of the European Monetary
System, the Government set out a new policy
framework for its counter-inflation strategy.
1 his includes a target of keeping underlying
inflation—as measured by the RPI excluding
mortgage interest payments—between 1 and 4
per cent, and of bringing it down to the
lower part of this range by the end of the
present Parliament.
The Government’s economic policy is set
in the context of a medium-term financial
strategy, which is reviewed each year. Within
this strategy, monetary and fiscal policies are
designed to defeat inflation. Short-term
interest rates remain the essential instrument
of monetary policy. Fiscal policy is set over a
medium-term horizon to support monetary
policy.
Macroeconomic policy is directed towards
keeping down the rate of inflation as the basis
for sustainable growth, while microeconomic
policies seek to improve the working of
markets and encourage enterprise, efficiency
and flexibility through measures such as
privatisation, deregulation and tax reforms
(see below).
Monetary Policy
Monetary policy is aimed at achieving the
Government’s objectives for inflation. The
main instrument of monetary policy is the
use of market operations to raise or lower
interest rates as appropriate to the
Government’s assessment of inflationary
trends in the economy.
In assessing the overall stance of monetary
conditions, the Government has set
monitoring ranges for the monetary
aggregates M0 and M4.2 For example, narrow
money, as measured by M0, has a monitoring
range of 0 to 4 per cent in 1993-94 and in
the medium term broad money (M4) has a
monitoring range of 3 to 9 per cent. The
Government also pays attention to a range of
indicators including the exchange rate index
and changes in asset prices (especially house
prices).
The Government’s view is that re-entry
into the ERM cannot be considered until
there has been greater convergence between
the monetary policy requirements of all EC
economies and the Government is satisfied
that the system will be operated to the
benefit of all its members. It believes that
these conditions are unlikely to apply for
some years.
Fiscal Policy
The objectives of the Government’s fiscal
policy are to ensure sound public finances,
return the budget towards balance over the
medium term, and reduce the share of public
expenditure in national income. The deficit is
expected to fall as the economy recovers, and
the tax measures in the March 1993 Budget
and tight control of public expenditure will
reinforce this trend.
Within the overall policy of moving
towards a balanced budget over the medium

England. M4 is notes and cash in circulation with the public,

BRITAIN 1994: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
term, the Government aims to reduce taxes
when possible so as to leave people with
more of their own money. The basic rate of
income tax has been cut from 33 to 25 per
cent, and in the 1992 Budget the
Government introduced a new lower rate of
income tax of 20 per cent on the first
£2,000 of taxable income (£2,500 from
1993-94).
In line with the Government’s policy, the
ratio of general government expenditure,
excluding privatisation proceeds, to GDP
fell from 47.5 per cent in 1982-83 to 42 per
cent in 1991-92. However, recently the ratio
has risen, due mainly to the impact of the
recession. The Public Sector Borrowing
Requirement (PSBR) has also grown since
1989-90 largely as a result of the recession,
and in 1993-94 is expected to peak at about
8 per cent of GDP. However, the PSBR is
expected to fall as the economy recovers and
as revenue-raising measures announced in
the March 1993 Budget begin to take effect.
Supply-side Policies
While macroeconomic policy is directed
towards ensuring sustainable growth through
low inflation and sound public finances, the
Government has sought to improve the
supply response, and thus the efficiency, of
the economy through microeconomic
policies. Action has been taken to expose
more of the economy to market forces.
Direct controls—for example, on pay, prices,
foreign exchange, dividend payments and
commercial credit—have been abolished and
competition in domestic markets
strengthened.
Steps have been taken to reduce
regulatory burdens on business and to
reduce the number of administrative
obstacles facing small firms and the self-
employed. Government support to industry
has become more selective. Where there is
evidence of market failure, particular efforts
have been made to improve the flow of
investment funds to small firms, assist
innovation in industry and attract industry
to the inner cities. Measures have been
implemented to encourage saving and share
ownership.
A substantial amount of activity has been
transferred from the public sector to the
private sector by privatisation and contracting
out. In addition, the Government is seeking
greater efficiency in the public sector through
market testing; it aims to have tested about
£1,500 million of public sector activities by
September 1993. Efforts have also been made
to improve value for money in the public
sector by, for example, transferring many of
the executive functions of government to new
executive agencies.
Labour Market
The Government has sought to improve
work incentives by reducing personal income
tax rates, raising tax thresholds and reforming
the benefits system. It has also, through the
tax system, encouraged the extension of share
ownership among employees. A scheme of
income tax relief has been introduced to
encourage the spread of profit-related pay.
The Government has taken steps to achieve a
more balanced legal framework for industrial
relations. It has expanded training
opportunities and put in place a new training
framework, with a greater role for employers,
so that training better reflects local needs.3
Obstacles to the mobility of labour have
been reduced. For example, the rights of
those leaving occupational pension schemes
early have been improved and new
arrangements for personal pensions
introduced; both of these changes will reduce
the pension disadvantage of changing jobs.
Reforms in the housing market have been
introduced to make it easier for people to
move house.
Economic Management
HM Treasury has prime responsibility for
the formulation and conduct of economic
policy, which it carries out in conjunction
with the Bank of England (the central bank)
and the Departments of Trade and Industry,
Employment, the Environment, Transport,
and the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries
and Food.

Note-. Differences between totals and the sums of their component parts are due to rounding.
A number of other bodies deal with
specific aspects of economic policy and the
regulation of certain sectors of the economy.
These include bodies such as the Office of
Fair Trading and the Monopolies and
Mergers Commission.
On major matters of public policy, such as
the broad economic strategy, and on the
economic problems it faces, the Government
makes known its policies and keeps in touch
with developments throughout the economy
by means of informal and continuous links
with the chief industrial, financial and other
interests. Final responsibility for the broad
lines of economic policy rests with the
Cabinet.
To assist in the process of economic
forecasting, the Government announced in
October 1992 the establishment of a Panel of
Independent Forecasters. The Panel
publishes a full range of forecasts on the
main economic indicators.
NATIONAL INCOME AND
EXPENDITURE
The value of all goods and services produced
in the economy is measured by gross
domestic product. This may be expressed
either in terms of market prices (the prices
people pay for the goods and services they
buy) or at factor cost (the cost of the goods
and services before adding taxes and
subtracting subsidies). It can also be
expressed in current prices or in constant
prices (that is, removing the effects of
inflation to measure the volume of growth in
the economy). In 1992 GDP at current factor

cost totalled £514,594 million. Between 1982
and 1992 the index of GDP at constant factor
cost increased by some 26 per cent.
Table 9.4 gives figures for GDP, at both
current market prices and current factor cost.
It also shows the components of two other
main aggregates, gross national product and
national income.
Table 9.5 shows the categories of total
final expenditure in 1992. Consumers’
expenditure accounted for one-half of total
final expenditure, and exports of goods and
services for nearly one-fifth.
Personal Incomes and Expenditure
Personal disposable income consists of
personal incomes after deductions—mainly
taxation and social security contributions.
This rose fairly steadily from £190,976
million in 1982 to £437,463 million in 1992.
Personal disposable income in 1992 was
2.7 per cent higher in real terms than in
1991. Consumers’ expenditure amounted to
69.5 per cent of pre-tax personal income in
1992, compared with 70.7 per cent in 1991.
Table 9.6 shows the changing pattern of
consumers’ expenditure. Housing, food,
alcoholic drink, clothing and footwear, and
fuel and power together accounted for 43 per
cent of the total in 1992. The changes in the
pattern between 1982 and 1992 in Britain
were paralleled in other industrialised
countries, with declining proportions being
spent on food, tobacco, clothing and
footwear, and fuel and power. Over the
longer term, as incomes rise, people tend to
spend increasing proportions on services.
Spending on leisure pursuits and tourism,
health and financial services have all shown
significant growth in recent years.
Consumers’ expenditure fell by 2 per cent in
real terms between 1990 and 1991, following
a long upward trend, and was virtually
unchanged in 1992.
The ratio of savings to personal disposable
income declined substantially during the
1980s, from a peak of 13.4 per cent in 1980
to 5.7 per cent in 1988. However, the savings
ratio has more than doubled since 1988,
reaching 12.5 per cent in 1992, reflecting a
number of factors such as the recession, and
government measures to encourage saving.
Sources of Income
The proportion of total personal pre-tax
income accounted for by income from
employment was 62 per cent in 1992; average

NATIONAL ECONOMY
Britain were £354 for full-time male workers
and £253 for full-time female workers. The
three other main sources of personal income
were self-employment (11 per cent), rent,
dividends and interest (13 per cent), and
social security benefits and other current
grants from government (14 per cent).
Current Government Expenditure
Final consumption by central government and
local authorities amounted to £132,378
million in 1992; it rose by 14 per cent in real
terms over the period 1982 to 1992. The
main cause of this was the growth over the
period in spending on the social services,
health, and law and order.
In addition to their expenditure on goods
and services, public authorities transfer large
sums to other sectors, mainly the personal
sector, in National Insurance and other social
security benefits, grants, and interest and
subsidies. Central government also makes
grants to local authorities to finance a
proportion of their current expenditure
(about 85 per cent in 1992-93).

Public Sector Finance 121
The Government’s policy is to maintain tight control on public expenditure.
Its programme of tax reform has sought to create a climate in which business
can thrive and individual initiative is rewarded. Plans for taxation and public
expenditure will in future be announced together. The first unified Budget
will be in November 1993.
INTRODUCTION
Public finance is concerned with taxation,
expenditure and borrowing or debt
repayment by central and local government;
management of the public sector’s assets and
liabilities; and the financing of public
corporations.
Central government raises money from
individuals and companies by direct and
indirect taxation and from National Insurance
contributions. It spends money on goods and
services, such as health and defence, and in
payments to people, for instance, social
security and pensions.
Local government raises revenue mainly
through the new council tax, introduced in
April 1993, and other taxes levied on
domestic and business properties. The
council tax has not been introduced in
Northern Ireland, where domestic rates
remain in operation. Local government
provides services such as education, police
and fire services, and refuse collection.
The diagram on p. 119 shows the relative
importance of the various items of receipts,
including borrowing, and expenditure for
general government.
The government department responsible
for broad control of public finance and
expenditure is HM Treasury. The Bank of
England—the central bank—advises the
Government on financial matters, executes
monetary policy and acts as banker to the
Government.
PUBLIC EXPENDITURE
The three main definitions of public
expenditure are general government
expenditure, the ‘new control total’ and
Supply expenditure.
General Government Expenditure
General government expenditure is the
spending of central and local government,
excluding transfers between them such as
central government grants to local authorities.
It is the key public spending aggregate and is
used in the medium-term financial strategy
(see p. 113), where public spending is set in
the context of broader economic policy. As it
is usually less affected by institutional
differences, it is the most appropriate measure
for making international comparisons.
112
PUBLIC FINANCE
New Control Total
The new control total is used by the
Government for the purposes of planning and
control. The Government seeks to achieve its
wider medium-term objective—expressed in
terms of general government expenditure—by
controlling spending within this total. The
new contror total covers:
• expenditure for which central government
is itself responsible;
• the support it provides or approves for
local authority expenditure;
• local authority self-financed expenditure;
• the external financing requirements of
public corporations, including nationalised
industries; and
• a reserve to cover unanticipated
expenditure.
It excludes the items of expenditure most
affected by the economic cycle—debt interest
and cyclical social security. By excluding these
items, the Government is able to set firm
limits on the growth of the new control total.
Supply Expenditure
Supply expenditure is financed out of money
voted by Parliament in the Supply Estimates
(see p. 115). More than four-fifths of all
Supply expenditure counts in the new control
total. The main element of the new control
total not funded through Supply Estimates is
expenditure financed from the National
Insurance Fund.
Medium-term Financial Strategy
The background to the Government’s
planning of public expenditure is the
medium-term financial strategy, which
provides a framework for monetary and fiscal
policy. The central objective of the strategy is
to achieve sustainable economic growth based
on permanently low inflation. Public
expenditure (measured by general government
expenditure, excluding privatisation proceeds)
is expected to grow by less than the economy
as a whole over time, and to provide
constantly improving value for money.
General government expenditure
(excluding privatisation proceeds), as a
proportion of gross domestic product (GDP),
fell from over 47 per cent in 1982-83 to
under 40 per cent in 1989-90. Since then,
recession has pushed up the ratio, which is
projected to peak at 45.5 per cent in 1993-94
before resuming a downward path. For
1993-94 taxes and social security
contributions are forecast to amount to 34.5
per cent of GDP.
Between 1987-88 and 1990-91 the public
sector was in surplus so that the Government
repaid debt. Following a Public Sector
Borrowing Requirement (PSBR) of £13,800
million—2.4 per cent of GDP—in 1991-92,
the PSBR for 1992-93 rose to £36,700
million—5.75 per cent of GDP—largely
reflecting the impact of the recession. Even
with economic recovery, the Government
expects that the recession will continue to
affect public finances for a while and it
forecasts a PSBR of £50,000 million—8 per
cent of GDP—for 1993-94.
The Government’s objective is to bring
the PSBR back towards balance over the
medium term. Tight control over public
expenditure and fiscal measures announced in
the March 1993 Budget are intended to
reinforce the tendency of the PSBR to fall as
the economy recovers.
Public Expenditure Control
In 1992 the Government announced a new
system of public expenditure control to
ensure that the share of national income
taken by public spending will fall over time.
Annual ceilings are set for the growth of
the new control total, in line with the
Government’s medium-term objectives. By
restricting real growth in the new control
total to below 1.5 per cent, the Government
will ensure that the ratio of general
government expenditure to national income
falls over time.
This ‘top-down’ approach separates
decisions on overall public expenditure levels
from the allocation between programmes.
Departmental spending decisions are based
on allocating available resources within agreed
ceilings for aggregate spending; resources are
devoted to priority areas, with an emphasis
113
BRITAIN 1994: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
on obtaining maximum value for money.
Together with the move to a unified budget
(see below), the new framework represents an
important reform of fiscal planning
procedures. In addition, a more fundamental
examination of spending programmes has
been started, which is intended to ensure
better targeting of public expenditure and to
identify areas where expenditure may no
longer be appropriate. This process started in
1993-94 with four of the larger programmes:
education, health, Home Office and social
security.
Table 10.1 gives projections for government
expenditure and receipts and the borrowing
requirement for 1993-94 and 1994—95.
Planning Cycle
Each year the Government conducts a review
of its spending plans for the forthcoming
three years, known as the ‘Public Expenditure
Survey’. The plans agreed in the Survey have
in recent years been announced by the
Chancellor of the Exchequer in the Autumn
Statement, usually in November. More
detailed analyses are published in the
following January or February in a Statistical
Supplement and in individual departmental
reports. In March or April the Chancellor has
presented his taxation proposals and forecast
for the economy in the Budget (see p. 116).
Revenue and expenditure have been brought
together in the Financial Statement and
Budget Report issued on the day of the
Budget.
The Chancellor announced that from
November 1993 the Government would
present taxation and spending proposals to
Parliament at the same time to allow
comparison. The Budget would, therefore,
cover both the Government’s taxation plans
for the coming financial year and its spending
plans for the next three years. It would also
give a review of recent developments in the
economy, an economic forecast and a
statement of the Government’s medium-term
financial strategy (see p. 113). The
Government would publish a second short¬
term economic forecast in the summer. The
Finance Bill, with details of the taxation
changes, would be published in January for
parliamentary consideration.
Public Expenditure Totals
Public expenditure is analysed in Table 10.2.
The largest departmental programmes are:
• the Department of Social Security (35.5
per cent of central government
expenditure in 1992-93);
• the Department of Health (17.6 per
cent); and
• the Ministry of Defence (15 per cent).
About 85 per cent of local authority
spending is financed by grants from central
government. The rest is met from the council
tax, domestic rates and business rates,
surpluses on trading, rents and borrowing.
Education accounts for about two-fifths of
local authority spending; law and order,
housing and other environmental services,
personal social services, social security, and
roads and transport take up most of the
remainder.

PUBLIC FINANCE
Reserve
Planned expenditure includes an unallocated
reserve to cover additions to departmental
spending, whether arising from policy
changes, new initiatives or revisions to the
estimated costs of demand-led programmes.
Estimates
The annual Public Expenditure Survey
conducted by HM Treasury provides the
basis for the Estimates which each
government department submits to the
Treasury, giving details of its cash
requirements for the coming financial year.
After Treasury approval, these Supply
Estimates are presented to Parliament.
Parliamentary authorisation is required for
the major part of the new spending plans for
the year ahead announced in the unified
Budget. Parliament approves them as part of
the annual Appropriation Act.
Supplementary Estimates may also be
presented to Parliament during the course of
the year.
If any Supply Estimate is overspent, the
Committee of Public Accounts (see p. 116)
may investigate before Parliament is asked to
approve any Excess Vote to balance the
account. In each parliamentary session, up to
three ‘Estimates days’ are available for
debates on the Supply Estimates, following
scrutiny by select committees of the House
of Commons.
Cash Limits
The Government sets cash limits on 60 per
cent of Supply expenditure. The imposition
of cash limits indicates that the Government
intends to avoid extra provision for
programmes even in the event of
unexpected increases in costs. It is
government policy to extend the coverage of
cash limits whenever possible. They cover
the major part of grants to local authorities,
which are financed out of Supply
expenditure. Cash limits also apply to some
expenditure not voted in the Estimates.
Running cost limits are imposed on the
administrative costs of central government,
which are identified separately in the
Estimates.
There is a facility for carrying forward
underspending on the capital components of
cash limits and on running cost limits. Any
overspending of cash or running cost limits
leads to an investigation into the causes and,
where appropriate, a reduction in the limits
in the following year.
Those Estimates not subject to cash
limits mainly finance demand-led services
like income support from the Department of

Social Security. In such cases, once policy
and rates of payment are determined,
expenditure depends on factors beyond the
direct control of government, such as the
number of eligible recipients.
Examination and Audit of Public
Expenditure
Examination of public expenditure is carried
out by select committees of the House of
Commons. These study in detail the activities
of particular government departments and
require the attendance of ministers and
officials for cross-examination. Audit of the
Government’s spending, which follows up the
control inherent in parliamentary approval of
the Estimates, is exercised through the
functions of the Comptroller and Auditor
General.
Comptroller and Auditor General
The Comptroller and Auditor General, an
officer of the House of Commons appointed
by the Crown, has two distinct functions. As
Comptroller General he or she is responsible
for ensuring that all revenue and other public
money payable to the Consolidated Fund and
the National Loans Fund (see below) is duly
paid and that all payments from these funds
are authorised by statute. As Auditor General
he or she must certify the accounts of all
government departments and executive
agencies and those of a wide range of other
public sector bodies; scrutinise the economy,
efficiency and effectiveness of their
operations; examine revenue accounts and
inventories; and report the results of these
examinations to Parliament.
Committee of Public Accounts
The Committee of Public Accounts considers
the accounts of government departments and
other public sector bodies; the Comptroller
and Auditor General’s reports on them; and
on departments’ use of their resources. The
Committee takes evidence from the heads of
departments and relevant public sector bodies
and submits reports to Parliament. The
Government’s formal replies to the reports
are presented to Parliament by the Treasury
in the form of Treasury minutes, and the
reports and minutes are usually debated
annually in the Commons.
Central Government Funds
The Government’s sterling expenditure is
largely met out of the Consolidated Fund, an
account at the Bank of England into which
tax receipts and other revenues are paid. Any
excess of expenditure over receipts is met by
the National Loans Fund, which is another
official sterling account at the Bank of
England and is the repository for funds
borrowed by the Government. The National
Insurance Fund, into which contributions are
paid by employers and employed people, is
used mainly to pay for social security
benefits.
BUDGET
The Budget in November 1993 will set out
the Government’s proposals for changes in
taxation and spending and will be the main
annual review of economic policy. The
proposals are announced to the House of
Commons by the Chancellor of the
Exchequer in the Budget statement and are
published in the Financial Statement and
Budget Report. This report also contains a
review of recent developments in the
economy, together with an economic forecast,
and sets out the fiscal and monetary
framework within which economic policy
operates. This is the medium-term financial
strategy (see p. 113).
The Budget statement is followed by the
moving of a set of Budget resolutions in
which the proposals are embodied. These
resolutions are the foundation of the Finance
Bill, in which the proposals are set out for
detailed consideration by Parliament. The
Provisional Collection of Taxes Act 1968
allows the tax authorities to collect taxes
provisionally, at the levels provided by the
Budget proposals, pending enactment of the
Finance Bill.
For two taxes—income tax and corporation
tax—annual Ways and Means resolutions
followed by Finance Bill clauses are required
116
PUBLIC FINANCE
to maintain their existence, since they are
annual rather than permanent taxes. Tax
changes can be made at other times, either
by specific legislation or by the use of the
regulator, which permits limited changes
between Budgets in the rates of VAT (value
added tax—by up to 25 per cent) and of the
main excise duties (by up to 10 per cent).
MAIN SOURCES OF REVENUE
The main sources of revenue are:
• taxes on income (including profits),
which include personal income tax,
corporation tax and petroleum revenue
tax; and
• taxes on expenditure, which include
VAT and customs and excise duties.
Other sources of revenue are stamp
duties; inheritance tax; capital gains tax;
National Insurance contributions, which give
entitlement to a range of benefits; and the
council tax and business rates.
The personal income tax allowances,
basic rate limit, capital gains tax
annual exempt amount and
inheritance tax threshold are
statutorily linked to the increase in the
Retail Prices Index (RPI), unless
Parliament decides otherwise. In the
March 1993 Budget the Chancellor
announced that in 1993-94 these
allowances and limits would be the
same as in 1992-93.
The Inland Revenue assesses and collects
the taxes on income, profits and capital, and
also stamp duty (see p. 120). Taxes on
individual incomes are generally progressive
in that larger incomes bear a proportionately
greater amount of tax. HM Customs and
Excise collects the most important taxes on
expenditure (VAT and most duties). Vehicle
excise duty is the responsibility of the
Department of Transport and National
Insurance contributions that of the
Department of Social Security (although the
latter are generally collected by the Inland
Revenue). The council tax and business rates
are collected by local authorities.
Taxes on Income
Income Tax
Income tax is imposed for the year of
assessment beginning on 6 April. In the
March 1993 Budget the new lower rate of 20
per cent was widened to the first £2,500 of
taxable income. The basic rate of 25 per cent
applies to the next £21,200 of taxable
income. A rate of 40 per cent is levied on
income above £23,700. These rates apply to
total income, including both earned and
investment income.
A number of allowances and reliefs reduce
the amount of a person’s taxable income
compared with gross income. All taxpayers,
irrespective of sex or marital status, are
entitled to a personal allowance against
income from all sources. Married women pay
their own tax on the basis of their own
income. In addition, there is a married
couple’s allowance, which may be allocated to
either partner or they may receive half each.
Wives are entitled to claim half of the
allowance as of right. For 1993-94, the values
of the main allowances are £3,445 for the
personal allowance and £1,720 for the
married couple’s allowance. From April 1994
tax relief for some allowances, including the
married couple’s allowance, will be restricted
to 20 per cent.
Among the most important of the reliefs is
that for mortgage interest payments on
borrowing for house purchase up to the
statutory limit of £30,000. Relief is restricted
to the basic rate of 25 per cent (and will be
further restricted to the lower rate of 20 per
cent from April 1994). It is usually given ‘at
source’, that is, repayments which the
borrower makes to the lender are reduced to
take account of tax at the basic rate and the
tax refund is then passed directly by the tax
authorities to the building society or bank
making the loan rather than to the individual
taxpayer.
Employees’ contributions to their pension
schemes also qualify for tax relief within
limits laid down by Parliament.
Most wage and salary earners pay their
income tax under a Pay-As-You-Earn
(PAYE) system whereby tax is deducted and
117
BRITAIN 1994: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
accounted for to the Inland Revenue by the
employer, in a way which enables employees
to keep as up to date as possible with their
tax payments.
In general, income tax is charged on all
income which originates in Britain—although
some forms of income are exempt, such as
certain social security benefits—and on all
income arising abroad of people resident
in Britain. Interest on certain British
government securities belonging to people
not ordinarily resident in Britain is exempt.
Britain has entered into agreements with
many countries to provide relief from double
taxation; where such agreements are not in
force unilateral relief is often allowed. British
residents working abroad for the whole year
benefit from 100 per cent tax relief.
The option of self-assessment will be
extended to all who fill in tax returns (some
8 million people) from 1996-97, and the
assessment of tax for the self-employed will
be simplified.
Corporation Tax
The rates of company tax in Britain are lower
than in most other industrialised countries.
Companies pay corporation tax on their
income and capital gains after deduction of
certain allowances. A company which
distributes profits to its shareholders is
required to pay advance corporation tax
(ACT) to the Inland Revenue. This ACT can
be set against the company’s liability to
corporation tax, subject to a limit. If resident
in Britain, a shareholder receiving dividends
from companies resident in Britain is entitled
to a tax credit, which satisfies some or all of
the shareholder’s liability to income tax on
his or her dividend income.
The main rate of corporation tax is 33 per
cent for 1993-94, with a reduced rate of 25
per cent for small companies (those with
profits below £250,000 in a year). Marginal
relief between the main rate and the small
companies’ rate is allowed for companies with
profits between £250,000 and £1.25 million.
Expenditure on plant and machinery, on
scientific research and on industrial and
agricultural buildings qualifies for annual
allowances.
Petroleum Revenue Tax
Petroleum revenue tax, deductible in
computing profits for corporation tax, is
charged on profits from the production, as
opposed, for example, to the refining, of oil
and gas under licence in Britain and on its
Continental Shelf. The rate of tax was
reduced from 75 to 50 per cent from 1 July
1993. New fields given consent for
development on or after 16 March 1993 are
not liable to this tax.
Each licensee of an oilfield is charged on
the profits from that field after deduction of
certain allowances and reliefs. There is no
distinction between capital and revenue
expenditure: both receive 100 per cent relief.
Inheritance Tax
Inheritance tax is charged on the value of
estates after death and is also immediately
chargeable on certain lifetime transfers. The
majority of business assets are now exempt
from inheritance tax, so that most family
businesses can be passed on without a tax
charge. Tax is charged at a single rate of 40
per cent above the threshold for inheritance
tax of £150,000.
There are several important exemptions.
Generally, transfers between spouses are
exempt, and gifts and bequests to British
charities, major political parties and heritage
bodies are also normally exempt.
Capital Gains Tax
Capital gains realised on the disposal of assets
are liable to capital gains tax or, in the case of
companies, to corporation tax. For 1993-94,
individuals are exempt from tax in respect of
total net gains of up to £5,800 in any one
year and most trusts on gains of up to
£2,900. Gains are treated as the taxpayer’s
top slice of income, and are therefore charged
at the individual’s highest income tax rate or
the company’s higher corporation tax rate.
Only gains arising since March 1982 are
subject to tax and the effects of inflation are
allowed for when measuring gains. Some
assets, including the principal private
residence, are normally exempt. Gains on
118
PUBLIC FINANCE
government securities and certain corporate
bonds are exempt from the tax, as are gains
on shares owned under personal equity plans.
This last exemption is designed to encourage
wider share ownership.
Taxpayers aged 55 or over, or retiring
earlier owing to ill-health, can get relief when
disposing of business assets. The March 1993
Budget extended this relief to include some
employees and full-time working directors
who have a minimum 5 per cent shareholding
in a company. The Budget also proposed a
new relief for entrepreneurs where gains from
the sale of shares in a person’s business are
reinvested in new unquoted trading
companies.
Taxes on Expenditure
Value Added Tax
VAT is a broadly based expenditure tax,
chargeable at 17.5 per cent. It is collected at
each stage in the production and distribution
of goods and services by taxable persons—
generally those whose business has a turnover
of more than £37,600 a year. The final tax is
borne by the consumer. When a taxable
person purchases taxable goods or services,
the supplier charges VAT—the taxable
person’s input tax. When the taxable person
supplies goods or services, the customers are
then in turn charged VAT, which is the
taxable person’s output tax. The difference
between the output tax and the input tax is
paid to, or repaid by, Customs and Excise.
Certain goods and services are relieved
from VAT, either by being charged at a zero
rate, in which case a taxable person does not
charge tax to a customer but reclaims any
input tax paid to suppliers, or by exemption,
in which case a taxable person does not
charge any output tax but is not entitled to
reclaim the input tax. Among the main
categories where zero-rating applies are goods
exported to other countries, and goods
shipped as stores on ships and aircraft; most
food; water and sewerage; domestic and
international passenger transport; books,
newspapers and periodicals; fuel and power
for domestic consumption (until April 1994);
construction of new residential buildings;

young children’s clothing and footwear; drugs
and medicines supplied on prescription;
specified aids for handicapped people; and
certain supplies by or to charities. VAT will
be charged on domestic fuel and power at 8
per cent from April 1994 and at the full
standard rate from April 1995. The main
categories where exemption applies are many
supplies of land and buildings; insurance;
postal services; betting; gaming (subject to
certain important exceptions); lotteries;
finance; much education and training; and
health and welfare.
A European Community agreement
established a Community-wide minimum
standard rate of VAT of 15 per cent for four
years from January 1993.
Customs Duties
Customs duties are chargeable on goods from
outside the EC in accordance with the EC’s
Common Customs Tariff. The introduction
of the single European market from 1 January
1993 means that goods can move freely across
internal frontiers between different member
states, without making customs entries at
importation or stopping for routine fiscal
checks. For commercial consignments, excise
duty and VAT are charged in the member
state of destination, at the rate in force in
that state.
Excise Duties
Hydrocarbon oils used as road fuel bear
higher rates of duty than those used for other
purposes, although the rate of duty on
unleaded petrol is lower than that on leaded.
Kerosene, most lubricating oils and other oils
used for certain industrial processes are free
of duty. There are duties on spirits, beer,
wine, made-wine (wine with added
constituents, such as fruit juice), cider and
perry, based on alcoholic strength and
volume. Spirits used for scientific, medical,
research and industrial processes are generally
free of duty. Cigarette duty is charged partly
as a cash amount per cigarette and partly as a
percentage of retail price. Duty on other
tobacco products is based on weight. Duties
are charged on off-course betting, pool
betting, gaming in casinos, bingo and gaming
machines. Rates vary with the particular form
of gambling. Duty is charged either as a
percentage of gross or net stakes or, in the
case of gaming machines, as a fixed amount
per machine according to the cost of playing
it and its prize level. A 12 per cent duty on
gross stakes will be levied on the new
National Lottery due to start in 1994 (see
p. 481); there will be no tax on winnings.
Vehicle excise duty (VED) on a privately
owned motor car, light van or taxi with less
than nine seats is £125 a year; for motor
cycles it is £15, £35 or £55 a year according
to engine capacity. The duty on goods
vehicles is levied on the basis of gross
weight and, if over 12 tonnes, according to
the number of axles; the duty is designed to
ensure that such vehicles at least cover
their share of road expenditure through the
tax paid (VED and fuel duty). Duty on taxis
and buses varies according to seating
capacity.
Stamp Duty
Certain kinds of transfer are subject to stamp
duty. These include purchases of houses, at
1 per cent on the total price if this exceeds
£60,000, and instruments such as declarations
of trust. The Government has plans to
abolish stamp duty on shares. Transfers by
gift and transfers to charities are exempt.
Taxpayer’s Charter
The Taxpayer’s Charter, relaunched in 1991,
was one of the first separate charters issued
following the publication of the Citizen’s
Charter (see p. 64). It sets out the standard
of service that people can expect from the
Inland Revenue and Customs and Excise.
Both departments should be fair, helpful,
courteous, efficient and accountable, and keep
taxpayers’ financial affairs private.
OTHER REVENUE
National Insurance Contributions
There are four classes of National Insurance
contribution:
120
PUBLIC FINANCE
• Class 1—paid by employees and their
employers;
• Class 2—paid by the self-employed;
• Class 3—paid voluntarily for pension
purposes; and
• Class 4—paid by the self-employed on
their taxable profits over a set lower
limit, cufrently £6,340 a year, and up to
a set upper limit, currently £21,840 a
year (in addition to their Class 2
contribution).
Details of the rates of contribution are
given in Chapter 26, Social Security, on
pp. 390-8.
Local Authority Revenue
Local authority revenue in Great Britain (but
not Northern Ireland) is obtained from three
main sources: central government grants,
non-domestic rates and the council tax. In
England, for example, these will provide 56,
28 and 16 per cent respectively of the
revenue of local authorities in 1993-94.
Non-domestic rates are a tax on the
occupiers of non-domestic property. The
rateable value of property is assessed by
reference to annual rents and reviewed every
five years. In England and Wales the non¬
domestic rate is set nationally by central
government and collected by local authorities.
It is paid into a national pool and
redistributed to local authorities in proportion
to their population. In Scotland non-domestic
rates are levied by local authorities. In
Northern Ireland rates are not payable on
industrial premises or on commercial
premises in enterprise zones. Certain other
properties in Northern Ireland, such as
freight transport and recreational premises,
are partially derated.
Domestic property is subject to the
council tax, which replaced the community
charge in April 1993. Each dwelling is
allocated to one of eight valuation bands,
depending on its estimated open market value
in April 1991. Tax levels are set by local
authorities, but the relationship between the
tax for each band is fixed. Discounts are
available for dwellings with fewer than two
resident adults. A council tax payer on a low
income may receive a rebate of up to 100 per
cent of his or her tax bill. There is a
transitional relief scheme to ensure that no
household faces an unreasonable increase in
its local tax bill as a result of the replacement
of the community charge by the council tax.
The average council tax per dwelling is £456
in England, £425 in Scotland and £276 in
Wales.
In Northern Ireland, rates—local domestic
property taxes—are payable; they are
collected by local authorities.
PUBLIC SECTOR FINANCE
The major government debt instrument is
known as gilt-edged stock as there is no risk
of default. Gilt-edged stock is marketable and
is widely traded. Individuals may also make
transactions through post offices in stocks
included on the National Savings Stock
Register. Pension funds and life insurance
companies have the largest holdings. On
behalf of the Government, the Bank of
England issues both conventional and indexed
stock (on which principal and interest are
linked to the movement in the Retail Prices
Index). Issues are mostly by auction or fixed
price ‘tap’ sales.
An important additional source of
government finance is the range of National
Savings products, which are non-marketable
and are designed to attract personal savings.
The chief products (see p. 184) are Income
Bonds, National Savings Certificates (which
may be index-linked), the Investment
Account, Capital Bonds, a Children’s Bonus
Bond and the First Option Bond.
Other central government debt
instruments are Treasury bills and certificates
of tax deposit. Sterling Treasury bills are sold
at a weekly tender; the majority have a
maturity of three months. The Government
has also issued bills denominated and payable
in European Currency Units (ECUs) since
1988 and longer-dated ECU notes since 1992.
The proceeds have been added to the official
foreign exchange reserves as opposed to being
used to finance public expenditure.
The bulk of public corporations’
borrowing is funded by central government,
although their temporary borrowing needs are
121
BRITAIN 1994: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
met largely from the market, usually under
Treasury guarantee. That part of local
authority borrowing met by central
government is supplied by authorisation of
Parliament through the Public Works Loan
Board from the National Loans Fund. The
Board remains an independent body even
though it is merged for administrative
purposes with the former National Debt
Office, forming the National Investment and
Loans Office. Local authorities may also
borrow directly from the market, both
short-term and long-term, through a range of
instruments. Some public corporations and
local authorities borrow on occasion, under
special statutory power and with Treasury
consent, in foreign currencies.
Public Sector Debt
Public sector borrowing, or debt repayment,
each year represents an addition to, or
subtraction from, the net debt of the public
sector. This debt is the consolidated debt of
the public sector less its holdings of liquid
assets. Public sector debt held outside the
public sector amounted to £207,600 million
at the end of March 1992. Net public sector
debt in 1993-94 is expected to be 39 per cent
of GDP, compared with 50 per cent in 1979.

Employment in Britain grew substantially during the 1980s, although during
the early 1990s it has declined as a result of the recession. There have, though,
been significant shifts in the pattern of work in recent years. One of the most
noticeable has been the continuing move towards employment in services.
Now nearly three-quarters of employees are engaged in the service sector,
compared with around one-fifth in manufacturing.
The Government has taken a number of
steps to improve the labour market, with the
aim of creating an economic climate in which
business can flourish and create more jobs.
These include:
• increasing the flexibility of the labour
market;
• removing burdens on employers and
workers, including regulatory barriers
which hinder recruitment; and
• encouraging better training, especially by
setting up employer-led Training and
Enterprise Councils and, in Scotland,
Local Enterprise Companies (see p. 126).
In February 1992 the Government set out
its proposals for action to widen the
opportunities and choices for people at work
in a White Paper People, Jobs and
Opportunity.
The Government supports a social
dimension to the European Community (see
p. 297) which gives priority to the creation
and development of jobs and takes into
account the different employment patterns
and practices in the 12 member states.
PATTERNS OF EMPLOYMENT
The total workforce in June 1992 was 28.2
million. The workforce in employment
totalled 25.5 million (see Table 11.1), of
whom 21.8 million (11.2 million men and
10.6 million women) were classed as
employees in employment.
Recent labour market trends have
included:
• a substantial growth in self-employment
which occurred in the 1980s;
• increasing participation by women,
especially married women, in the labour
market;
• a continuing increase in the proportion of
jobs in the service sector; and
• higher productivity arising out of the
growing use of information technology
and advanced manufacturing systems.
Between 1983 and 1990 employment
growth in Britain was nearly twice that in the
rest of the European Community (EC). Much
of the growth in jobs arose in small firms or
among the self-employed. In spring 1993,

according to the Labour Force Survey, 12.4
per cent of those in employment in Britain
were self-employed, compared with 11.2 per
cent in 1984.
Women account for a growing proportion
of the workforce in employment and in June
1992 they represented nearly 49 per cent of
employees in employment. The proportion of
women in work in Britain is well above the
EC average, being exceeded only by
Denmark. Many employers have developed
policies to help women to return to the
labour market. The Government is
encouraging voluntary action by employers to
increase the employment opportunities for
women, and in 1991 it joined the
‘Opportunity 2000’ campaign (see p. 35).
Part-time employment accounted for much
of the increase in employment during the
1980s. Some 5.8 million people were engaged
in part-time employment in their main jobs in
Great Britain in spring 1993. This
represented 24 per cent of those in
employment, compared with just under 21
per cent in 1984. The proportion in part-time
employment is much higher for women than
for men. About 50 per cent of married
women work part-time, compared with just
over 30 per cent of non-married women.
Employment by Sector
As in other industrialised countries, there has
been a marked shift in jobs from
manufacturing to service industries (see Table
11.2). Between 1955 and 1992 the proportion
of employees in employment engaged in
service industries doubled from 36 per cent
to 72 per cent as higher living standards and
technological developments stimulated the
growth of many service industries.
During the period 1982 to 1992 the
number of employees in service industries in
Great Britain rose by 2.2 million (17 per

cent) to 15.4 million (see Table 11.3). The
largest rise was in the banking, finance and
insurance sector, where employment grew by
46 per cent to 2.6 million. A substantial
increase, of 26 per cent, also occurred in
hotels and catering, mostly in part-time jobs.
Manufacturing industry accounted for 42
per cent of employees in employment in
1955, but by 1992 the proportion had halved
to 21 per cent. Nearly all manufacturing
industries have experienced a decline in
employment as productivity has increased and
as markets for manufactured goods have
changed. Some of Britain’s traditional
manufacturing industries, such as steel and
shipbuilding, have experienced particularly
large falls in employment. In June 1992
employment in the main sectors of
manufacturing industry in Great Britain
included:
• 649,000 in mechanical engineering;
• 627,000 in office machinery, electrical
engineering and instruments;
• 489,000 in food, drink and tobacco;
• 456,000 in timber, wooden furniture,
rubber and plastics;
• 453,000 in paper products, printing and
publishing; and
• 407,000 in textiles, leather, footwear and
clothing.
Occupational Changes
There has been a gradual move away from
manual occupations towards non-manual
occupations, which now account for nearly
three-fifths of jobs. The main growth areas
have been in managerial and professional
occupations, and in the personal and
protective service occupations.
Unemployment
So far during the 1990s unemployment has
generally risen. By January 1993 it had
reached just under 3 million on a seasonally
adjusted basis, which is below the previous
peak reached in 1986. However, subsequently
unemployment has been at a slightly lower
level, and in August 1993 it totalled 2.9
million, 10.4 per cent of the workforce.
Unemployment varies considerably by region,
ranging in August 1993 from 8.4 per cent in
East Anglia to 14.1 per cent in Northern
Ireland.
The Government has introduced a wide
range of measures to help combat

BRITAIN 1994: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
unemployment. A new series of measures
was announced in the Budget in March
1993, of particular relevance to the needs of
the long-term unemployed. The measures,
intended to provide over 100,000 extra
opportunities for individuals, include:
• Community Action, providing 60,000
opportunities for people to do voluntary
work of benefit to the community on a
part-time basis while they actively look
for work; and
• Learning for Work, offering 30,000
opportunities for unemployed people to
pursue vocationally relevant full-time
education.
TRAINING, EDUCATION AND
ENTERPRISE
Employers in Britain spend over £20,000
million a year on employee training and
development. The Labour Force Survey in
spring 1993 found that the number of
employees who had received recent training
was almost 70 per cent higher than it had
been in 1984. Individuals are being
encouraged to train by means of tax reliefs
and loan schemes.
The Government funds a number of
training, enterprise and vocational education
programmes. Expenditure by the
Department of Employment Group, The
Scottish Office and the Welsh Office in
Great Britain on training, enterprise and
vocational education programmes will be
some £2,800 million in 1993-94.
Government Policy
Responsibility for training policy in Great
Britain rests with the Secretary of State for
Employment, who draws up national
training guidelines in consultation with the
Secretaries of State for Scotland and Wales,
and in Northern Ireland with the Secretary
of State for Northern Ireland. The
Secretaries of State for Scotland and Wales
will assume responsibility for training policy
in Scotland and Wales respectively in
April 1994.
The Government’s strategic priorities for
training, vocational education and enterprise
are that:
• employers, the self-employed and
individual people in the workforce should
invest effectively in the skills needed for
business creation and growth, and for
individual success;
• people who are out of work or at a
disadvantage in the market should
acquire and maintain relevant skills and
obtain appropriate support to enable
them to compete better for employment,
and to contribute more effectively to the
economy;
• young people should be encouraged and
enabled to gain the skills and enterprising
attitudes needed for entry to the
workforce and to prepare them to realise
their full potential throughout working
life; and
• the market for vocational education and
training should be more responsive to the
changing needs of employers and
individuals.
Training and Enterprise Councils
A network of 82 employer-led Training and
Enterprise Councils (TECs) has been set up
throughout England and Wales. Their main
functions are:
• to promote more effective training by
employers and individuals;
• to develop innovative solutions to local
problems;
• to provide readily accessible, high quality
business and enterprise support;
• to deliver and develop Youth Training
and Training for Work (see below);
• to stimulate enterprise and economic
growth by providing support to new and
existing small firms; and
• to build relationships with the education
sector through Department of
Employment programmes and other
initiatives.
TECs are playing an increasingly
important role in the delivery of training
programmes and in influencing local
126
EMPLOYMENT
education provision. Each TEC has a local
initiative fund to allow it to develop new
ideas in support of the Department of
Employment’s objectives to improve skills
and promote individual choice and enterprise.
Local Enterprise Companies
A separate network of 22 Local Enterprise
Companies (LECs) exists in Scotland.
These have wider-ranging responsibilities
than the TECs, covering economic
development and environmental
improvement. LECs operate the same major
training programmes as TECs, but, unlike
them, have no responsibility for work-related
further education. They run under the
supervision of the two enterprise bodies:
Scottish Enterprise and Highlands and
Islands Enterprise (see p. 147).
Industry Training Organisations
Industry Training Organisations (ITOs) act as
the focal point for training matters in their
particular sector of industry, commerce or
public service. Their role is to ensure that the
skills needs of their sectors are being met and
that occupational standards are being
established and maintained for key
occupations. There are over 120 independent
ITOs, covering sectors employing about 85
per cent of the civilian workforce. The
National Council of Industry Training
Organisations, a voluntary body set up to
represent the interests of ITOs, aims to
improve the effectiveness of these bodies, for
example, by encouraging good practice.
National Education and Training
Targets
National Education and Training Targets
were launched by the Confederation of
British Industry in 1991 and were agreed by
over 100 national and local organisations,
including all TECs, LECs and ITOs, and
other major education, training and employer
bodies. The Government confirmed its
support for the targets, since they underpin
its aims and are a measure of action needed
to raise skill levels.
The targets cover both young people and
the workforce as a whole. Among the
‘foundation targets’ are:
• immediate moves to ensure that by 1997
at least 80 per cent of all young people
attain NVQ/SVQ_Level 2 (see p. 415) or
its academic equivalent in their
foundation education and training; and
• that by 2000, 50 per cent of young
people should attain NVQ/SVQJevel 3
or its academic equivalent, as a basis for
further progression.
A new National Advisory Council for
Education and Training Targets was
launched in March 1993. It is employer-led
and includes members from education and
trade unions. It is operating in parallel with a
separate advisory body for Scotland.
Training for Work
I raining for Work is a new programme
introduced in April 1993 to replace the
Employment Training and Employment
Action programmes. It has the objective of
helping long-term unemployed people to find
jobs and to improve their work-related skills
through the provision of relevant training and
structured work activity based on a careful
assessment of individual needs. Training is
carried out by training providers under
contract with the local TEC or LEC. Each
new participant receives an individually
adapted package of training and/or structured
work activities. The new programme focuses
more closely on the long-term unemployed
than did the previous Employment Training
programme. Over 150,000 places for Training
for Work will be available in Great Britain in
1993-94, when the programme is expected to
help up to 320,000 people.
Training for Young People
An estimated 71 per cent of 16- and 17-year-
olds in England leaving school to enter the
labour market go into Youth Training. Youth
Training gives young people who choose not
to stay on in full-time education and who are
not already employed the opportunity to
acquire a broad-based vocational education
127
BRITAIN 1994: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
and to achieve a vocational qualification or a
credit towards one. It is designed to:
• provide help for young people to acquire
the broadly based skills necessary for a
flexible and self-reliant workforce;
• meet skill needs, especially for technician
and craft-level training; and
• provide participants with training
leading to NVQs or equivalent
qualifications (see p. 415) at or above
Level 2.
Youth Credits, which operate within the
broad framework of Youth Training, give
young people who have left full-time
education to join the labour market an
entitlement to train to approved standards.
They carry a monetary face value and can be
presented to an employer or training
provider in exchange for high-quality
training. Pilot projects started in 1991, and
Youth Credits are now available in 20 areas
in Britain. Over 51,000 young people have
benefited from the scheme. The Government
aims to offer Youth Credits to all school-
leavers aged 16 and 17 by 1996. The
intention is that Youth Credits will
eventually replace Youth Training.
Investors in People
In 1990 the Government launched the
Investors in People initiative, developed by
employers. As its focus, it has a national
standard for effective investment in people,
and aims to encourage employers to develop
the potential of all employees in line with
business goals. Investors in People is
delivered locally by TECs and LECs, which
provide advice and information to help
organisations to work towards the standard.
By September 1993, nearly 380 employers
had achieved the Investors in People
standard, and nearly 4,000 had made a
formal commitment to work towards the
standard.
Improving the Training Market
The Improving the Training Market
programme is aimed at bringing about
change and improvements in the operation of
the vocational education and training systems.
It includes projects to strengthen the
institutional framework within which training
is delivered; helps to ensure the successful
establishment of NVQs; and develops
effective information, advice, assessment and
accreditation systems.
National Training Awards
The National Training Awards aim to
complement TEC/LEC activities and the
competition is designed to promote good
training practice by example, rewarding
companies which have carried out
exceptionally effective training. Around 80
corporate awards and approximately 20
individual awards are presented to national
winners, who are selected from 200 regional
commendations.
Skill Choice
A new Skill Choice initiative was introduced
in April 1993 and is intended to improve the
commitment of individuals, primarily those
already in employment, to training. Under
the initiative, people are offered credits which
they can use to buy guidance and assessment
services; part of the cost is being met by the
Government. In the initial stage, 15 TECs
and LECs are involved, providing credits to
250,000 people in the two years 1993-94 and
1994-95. If credits prove successful, the
Government intends to make them available
throughout Great Britain.
Career Development Loans
People who live in or intend to undertake
vocational training in Great Britain can apply
to one of three major banks for a Career
Development Loan. Loans of £200 to £5,000
can help to pay for vocational courses lasting
up to a year, or a year of a longer course.
Some 39,000 people have borrowed over
£100 million through the programme to pay
for training. A substantial expansion of the
programme is planned over the three years
from April 1993, with loan capacity
increasing from 30,000 in 1993-94 to 52,000
by 1995-96.
128
EMPLOYMENT
Education Initiatives
A major government objective is to raise the
motivation and attainment of young people to
achieve their full potential and develop the
skills needed by the economy. This requires
close working relationships between industry
and education. A number of education
initiatives ard being implemented, including
the Technical and Vocational Education
Initiative, Education Business Partnerships,
the Teacher Placement Service, Compacts
and the National Record of Achievement.
Details are given in Chapter 27.
Vocational Qualifications
The proportion of the workforce with quali¬
fications, gained either in school or further
education, is growing. Between 1984 and
1992 it rose from 63 per cent to 76 per cent.
The National Council for Vocational
Qualifications (NCVQ), established in 1986,
has been charged with reforming and
rationalising vocational qualifications. New
National Vocational Qualifications (NVQs)
have been established in England, Wales and
Northern Ireland (see p. 415). In Scotland
the Scottish Vocational Education Council
(SCOTVEC) has established parallel Scottish
Vocational Qualifications (SVQs).
NVQs and SVQs are designed mainly for
people in employment, although they can also
be studied full-time. They are job-specific,
based on national standards of competence
set by industry and are assessed in the
workplace. There are five levels within the
NVQand SVQ^framework (see p. 415).
NVQs and SVQs at levels 1 to 5 to cover 90
per cent of the employed workforce are
expected to be in place by the end of 1995.
Open Learning
Britain is acknowledged as an innovative
world leader in open and flexible learning,
for example, through the Open University
and the Open College (see p. 415). Open
Learning Credits are being tested during
1993-94, aimed primarily at the adult
unemployed. TECs and LECs are running
14 pilot schemes.
Northern Ireland
The Training and Employment Agency, an
executive agency within the Department of
Economic Development for Northern Ireland,
has primary responsibility for training and
employment services. Its overall aim is to
assist economic growth by ensuring the
provision and operation of training and
employment services that contribute to
Northern Ireland companies becoming more
competitive and individuals obtaining the
skills and competences needed to secure
worthwhile employment. The Agency works
closely with employers and is encouraging
each of the key sectors of industry to form a
sectoral representative body to represent the
opinions of employers and others on
individual sectoral training needs. It has also
established sectoral working groups to develop
training strategies for individual sectors.
Several new initiatives have been
implemented. For example, in 1992 the
Manpower Training Scheme, under which
assistance on training is given to businesses,
was changed to make it more relevant to
modern business needs—it became the
Company Development Programme. The
Agency’s Client Advisory Staff promote the
benefits of training and offer advice suited to
the needs of individual companies and
industrial sectors.
Northern Ireland has its own range of
training and employment programmes. These
include:
• the Action for Community Employment
programme, which provides temporary
jobs with a training input for long-term
unemployed people;
• the Job Training programme; and
• the Youth Training programme.
RECRUITMENT AND JOB-FINDING
There are a variety of ways in which people
can find jobs. In autumn 1992 the main
methods, according to the Labour Force
Survey, were:
• visiting a jobcentre (30 per cent);
• studying situations vacant columns (30
per cent);
129
BRITAIN 1994: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
• answering other adverts (12 per cent);
• personal contacts (11 per cent); and
• direct approaches to employers (10 per
cent).
Government Employment Services
The Government provides a range of services
to jobseekers through the Employment
Service, an executive agency within the
Department of Employment. These include:
• a network of local offices, at which
people can find details of job
opportunities;
• advice and guidance so that people can
find the best route back into
employment, for example, by training;
and
• a range of special programmes.
The Employment Service has over 1,300
jobcentres and unemployment benefit offices,
and employs about 48,000 staff. Jobcentres
are now being integrated with benefit offices
to provide a comprehensive service to
unemployed people. By April 1993 nearly 800
integrated offices had been established. In
1992-93 the Employment Service placed
some 1.42 million unemployed people into
jobs and conducted over 4 million advisory
interviews to help people find appropriate
work or places on employment and training
programmes.
The Jobseeker’s Charter contains a
number of provisions governing the standard
of service for users of the Service. Local
offices have introduced a number of
innovations under the charter to meet the
needs of users, for example, electronic
noticeboards and appointment control
systems.
Advisory Services
Help for unemployed people is provided
through the mainstream jobcentre services
which provide access to vacancies,
employment advice and training
opportunities. Advisers provide unemployed
people with information on employment and
training opportunities available locally. New
client advisers interview newly unemployed
people to check their eligibility for benefit.
Together with the unemployed person, they
agree a ‘Back to Work Plan’ which shows
them the best course of action to follow to
get back to work. These plans are reviewed at
every advisory interview.
Under the Restart programme, everyone
who has been unemployed for six months or
longer is asked to attend a Restart interview
with a claimant adviser. The adviser and
unemployed person discuss that person’s
circumstances, with the aim of helping him
or her back into work as soon as possible.
The Service has a number of programmes,
some of which are designed to help the long¬
term unemployed. These include:
• Jobclubs, where participants are given
training and advice in job-hunting skills
and have access to facilities to help an
intensive job search;
• Restart courses, designed to rebuild
self-confidence and motivation, and
including help with job-hunting skills;
and
• Jobplan workshops, introduced in
1993-94, which are designed to enable
those unemployed for a year to assess
their skills, qualities and training needs,
and to act as an introduction to future
job and training options.
Help for People with Disabilities
The Employment Service also aims to help
people with disabilities find work. All
Employment Service programmes make
provision for people with disabilities.
Services for people with disabilities are now
being delivered through local integrated
specialist teams—Placing Assessment and
Counselling Teams. They are supported by
nine regional Ability Development Centres,
which carry out training and development
work, and provide special advice for
employers who may be considering
employing people with disabilities. A wide
range of programmes, such as one offering
sheltered employment opportunities, is
available for people with disabilities who need
specialist help.
130
EMPLOYMENT
Employment Agencies
There are many private employment
agencies, including several large firms with
many branches. The total value of the
market has been estimated at about £7,000
million a year.
The main trade body for the employment
agency industry is the Federation of
Recruitment and Employment Services,
which regulates the activities of its members
by means of a Code of Good Recruitment
Practice and by specialist section codes of
practice. Agencies are less restricted by state
regulation in Britain than in most other EC
countries.
By law, employment agencies are allowed
to charge only the employer, not the
employee (except for specialist theatrical and
model agencies). They also have to register
with the Government for each branch they
operate. Their number increased from 7,800
in 1984-85 to 15,600 in 1991-92, although
recently there has been a fall in the number
of offices as a result of the recession.
TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF
EMPLOYMENT
Employment Rights
Employment protection legislation provides a
number of safeguards for employees. For
example, most employees are entitled to
receive from their employers written
information on their main terms and
conditions of employment, while minimum
periods of notice when employment is to be
terminated are laid down for both employers
and employees. The Trade Union Reform
and Employment Rights Act 1993 (see
p 136) includes provisions giving employees
who work eight hours or more a week a
right to a written statement setting out
details of the main conditions including pay,
hours of work and holidays.
Employees with the necessary period of
continuous employment with their employer
(currently two years for those working 16
hours a week or more, or five years for
those working at least eight but less than
16 hours a week) are entitled to lump-sum
redundancy payments if their jobs cease to
exist (for example, because of technological
improvements or a fall in demand) and their
employers cannot offer suitable alternative
work. Where employers are insolvent,
redundancy payments are met directly from
the National Insurance fund.
Most employees who believe they have
been unfairly dismissed have the right to
complain to an industrial tribunal, provided
they have the necessary qualifying period of
employment. If the complaint is upheld, the
tribunal may make an order for re¬
employment or award compensation.
Most pregnant women who have the
necessary qualifying period of
continuous employment have the right
to return to their former job, or a
suitable alternative, after maternity
absence. New rights for women in
employment are contained in the
Trade Union Reform and
Employment Rights Act 1993: the right
of a pregnant employee to have 14
weeks’ statutory maternity leave,
regardless of length of service or the
number of hours worked in a week,
and to be protected against dismissal
because of her pregnancy. Existing
rights are preserved.
Legislation forbids any employment of
children under 13 years of age, and
employment in any industrial undertaking of
children who have not reached the statutory
minimum school-leaving age, with some
exceptions for family undertakings.
Equal Opportunities
The Race Relations Act 1976 makes it
generally unlawful to discriminate on grounds
of colour, race, nationality (including
citizenship) or ethnic or national origin, in
employment, training and related matters.
The Department of Employment operates a
nationwide Race Relations Employment
Advisory Service. Its objective is to promote
the Government’s policies aimed at
eliminating racial discrimination in
employment and promoting fair treatment
131
BRITAIN 1994: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
and equality of opportunity in employment.
Advisers provide employers with advice
and practical help in developing and
implementing effective equal opportunity
strategies.
The Sex Discrimination Act 1975, as
amended, makes it generally unlawful in
Great Britain to discriminate on grounds of
sex or marital status when it comes to
recruiting, training, promoting, dismissing or
retiring staff. It also provides redress against
victimisation and may also do so against
sexual harassment. The Equal Pay Act 1970
makes it generally unlawful to discriminate
between men and women in pay and other
terms and conditions of employment. The
Act was significantly extended in 1984 to
meet EC requirements by providing for equal
pay for work of equal value. There is
equivalent legislation in Northern Ireland.
Practical advice to employers and others
on the best arrangements for implementing
equal opportunities policies in Great Britain
is given in codes of practice from the
Commission for Racial Equality and from the
Equal Opportunities Commission (see p. 36).
Northern Ireland
Similar legislation to that in Great Britain on
equal pay and sex discrimination applies in
Northern Ireland; there is at present no
legislation on race relations, but this is under
review. Discrimination, both direct and
indirect, in employment on grounds of
religious belief or political opinion is
unlawful. The Fair Employment Commission
has the task of promoting equality of
opportunity and investigating employment
practices, with powers to issue legally
enforceable directions. The Fair Employment
Tribunal adjudicates on individual complaints
of religious or political discrimination and
enforces the Commission’s directions. All but
the smallest employers are required to
monitor the religious composition of their
workforce and periodically to review their
employment practices. Where fair
participation is not being enjoyed by both
Protestants and Roman Catholics, the
introduction of ‘affirmative action’ measures
must be considered.
Earnings
According to the Department of
Employment’s New Earnings Survey, the
average weekly earnings, unaffected by
absence and including overtime payments, in
April 1993 of full-time employees on adult
rates were £317. Earnings were higher for
non-manual employees (£350) than for
manual employees (£257). Managerial and
professional groups are the highest paid. The
industries with the highest average weekly
earnings were energy and water supply
(£403) and banking, finance, insurance and
business services (£372).
Overtime and other additional payments
are particularly important for manual
employees, for whom such additional
payments represented over one-fifth of
earnings. Some 48 per cent of manual
employees and 18 per cent of non-manual
employees received overtime payments.
There has been a considerable fall in the
rate of increase in earnings in recent years. In
the year to July 1993 the underlying average
increase was about 3.5 per cent.
Fringe Benefits
A variety of fringe benefits are used by
employers in Britain to provide additional
rewards to their employees, including schemes
to encourage employee financial participation
in their companies, pension schemes, private
medical insurance, subsidised meals, company
cars and childcare schemes.
The Government has introduced tax
reliefs to encourage employers to set up
financial participation schemes, and give
employees a direct financial stake in the
business they work for.
Profit-related pay (PRP) schemes link part
of pay to changes in a business’s profits. By
the end of March 1993 nearly 1.2 million
employees were covered by over 4,600
registered PRP schemes. Employee share
schemes allow employees to receive low-cost
or free shares from their employer without
paying income tax. By the end of 1992 some
2.9 million employees had benefited from all¬
employee profit sharing and Save-As-You-
Earn (SAYE) share option schemes.
132
EMPLOYMENT
Many employees are covered by pension
schemes provided by their employers. Such
benefits are more usual among clerical and
professional employees than among manual
workers. Over 11 million people in Britain are
members of occupational schemes.
Company cars are provided for directors
and employees in a wide variety of
circumstances. It is estimated that 1.9 million
people had a company car in 1991-92, and
half of these received fuel for private
motoring in their cars.
Hours of Work
The basic working week (excluding overtime
and main meal breaks) in Great Britain is in
the range 37.5 to 40 hours for manual work
and 35 to 38 for non-manual work; a five-day
week is usually worked. While the basic
working week has been gradually shortening,
the general trend in total hours worked has
been rising since 1981. In April 1993 total
hours a week actually worked (including
overtime) for full-time adult employees were
41.3 for men, compared with 37.4 for women.
Men and women in non-manual occupations
generally work less overtime than manual
employees.
In general, there are no limits on hours
worked by adults except in a few occupations
(such as for drivers of goods vehicles and
public service vehicles).
The Government has opposed proposals in
a draft EC directive on working time for a
maximum of 48 hours for the working week.
Holidays with Pay
There are no general statutory entitlements to
holidays, and holiday entitlements are
frequently determined by collective
agreements. Recent decades have seen a
considerable increase in holiday entitlements.
In 1961, 97 per cent of full-time manual
employees were entitled to two weeks a year.
Nowadays, holiday entitlements (excluding
public holidays) generally provide for at least
four weeks’ paid holiday a year. Nearly all
manual employees covered by national
collective agreements have entitlements of
four weeks or more, with about 30 per cent
having five weeks or more. Non-manual
workers tend to have longer holidays than
manual workers. Holiday entitlements may
also be dependent upon length of service.
INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS
The structure of industrial relations in
Britain has been established mainly on a
voluntary basis. The system is based chiefly
on the organisation of employees and
employers into trade unions and employers’
associations, and on freely conducted
negotiations at all levels.
Trends in Collective Bargaining and Pay
There has been a considerable reduction in
the proportion of employees and workplaces
where pay is determined by collective
bargaining. The proportion of the workforce
covered by multi-employer national
agreements declined from 60 per cent in 1978
to 34 per cent in 1991. Private sector
employees are much less likely to be covered
by collective bargaining than are public sector
employees. National agreements covering over
1.2 million employees have ended since 1986
in sectors such as engineering, banking, the
multiple food trade, electricity supply and
water supply.
Where agreements in the private sector are
industry-wide, they are often supplemented
by local agreements in companies or factories
(plant bargaining). These company or plant
agreements frequently produce pay rates
which are higher than the minima set by
national agreements, as well as other detailed
terms and conditions of employment. Where
there is no collective bargaining, pay is
usually determined by management at local
level.
Another trend has been the growth in
systems linking pay to performance. A
substantial majority of medium to large
employers make some use of performance-
related pay systems such as merit pay,
financial participation (see p. 132) and
individual payment by results. Private sector
organisations are much more likely to use
performance-related pay than public sector
bodies.
133
BRITAIN 1994: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
The Government is committed to the
further development of performance-related
pay in the public sector as part of its wider
objectives for improving the quality of the
public services as set out in the Citizen’s
Charter (see p. 64). Performance-related pay
is being extended in areas such as the Civil
Service and education. Greater pay flexibility
is also being encouraged in other ways,
such as the facility for delegating pay
determination to individual departments and
agencies within central government, to self-
governing trusts in the National Health
Service and to grant-maintained schools.
A relatively recent feature has been the
development of ‘new style’ agreements, often
associated with overseas-owned companies,
although they are also found in British-owned
firms. These agreements often involve:
• the recognition of a single union for all
of a company’s employees (particularly
for companies recognising unions for the
first time);
• ‘single status’, involving the elimination
of the traditional distinction between
managers, supervisors and other
employees;
• a greater emphasis on employee
participation; and
• flexibility in working practices.
Employee Involvement
Employers practise a wide variety of methods
of informing and consulting their employees,
not only through committees but also
through direct communication between
management and employees. These methods
include:
• employee bulletins and reports;
• briefing systems;
• quality circles;
• financial participation schemes; and
• attitude surveys.
The Government is, however, opposed to
the proposals put forward by the EC, which
would impose statutory requirements on
some multinational employers to inform and
consult their employees, and provide for
worker participation in decision-making
through works councils. It believes that
companies should be free to develop
employee involvement arrangements which
are appropriate to their own circumstances
and the needs of their employees.
Trade Unions
Trade unions have members in nearly all
occupations. They are widely recognised by
employers in the public sector and in large
firms and establishments. As well as
negotiating pay and other terms and
conditions of employment with employers,
they provide benefits and services such as
educational facilities, financial services, legal
advice and aid in work-related cases. In
recent years several unions have extended
considerably the range of services for
members. Trade unions vary widely in the
composition of their membership, and may be
organised either by occupation (for example,
they may recruit clerical staff or managers
wherever employed) or by industry, while
some are based on a combination of both.
There has been a decline in trade union
membership, and by the end of 1991 total
union membership was about 9.5 million, of
whom 81 per cent were in the 23 largest
unions. The decline reflects the moves away
from manufacturing and public services, both
of which have a relatively high level of
membership. The number of unions has also
fallen, reflecting a number of mergers and the
absorption by larger unions of small unions
and of long-established craft unions. Several
unions are discussing possible mergers.
A merger of the Confederation of
Health Service Employees, the
National Union of Public Employees
and the National and Local
Government Officers Association to
form a new union, Unison, took effect
in July 1993. With some 1.5 million
members, it has become the biggest
union in Britain.
The other unions with over 500,000
members are:
134
EMPLOYMENT
• the Transport and General Workers
Union (with 1 million members);
• the Amalgamated Engineering and
Electrical Union (884,000);
• GMB (799,000); and
• Manufacturing Science Finance (552,000).
At the end of 1992 there were 302 trade
unions on the list maintained by the
Certification Officer, who, among other
duties, is responsible for certifying the
independence of trade unions. To be eligible
for entry on the list a trade union must show
that it consists wholly or mainly of workers
and that its principal purposes include the
regulation of relations between workers and
employers or between workers and employers’
associations.
Trade union organisation varies widely,
but the central governing body usually
consists of a national executive council or
committee, elected by a secret ballot of the
individual members and responsible to the
conference of delegates from local branches,
normally held annually. Many unions also
have regional and district organisations. At
the level of the individual member there are
local branches, covering one or more
workplaces. The organising of members in
individual places of work and the negotiation
of local pay agreements with management at
the workplace may be done by full-time
district officials of the union or, in many
cases, by elected workplace representatives,
often called ‘shop stewards’. Where two or
more unions have members in the same
workplace, shop stewards’ committees may be
formed to discuss matters of common concern.
Trades Union Congress
In Britain the national centre of the trade
union movement is the Trades Union
Congress (TUG), founded in 1868. Its
affiliated membership comprises 69 trade
unions, which together represent some 7.6
million people, or about 80 per cent of all
trade unionists in Britain.
The TUC’s objectives are to promote the
interests of its affiliated organisations and to
improve the economic and social conditions of
working people. The TUG deals with all
general questions which concern trade
unions, both nationally and internationally,
and provides a forum in which affiliated
unions can collectively determine policy.
There are eight TUG regional councils for
England and a Wales Trades Union Council.
The annual Congress meets in September
to discuss matters of concern to trade
unionists. A General Council represents the
TUC between annual meetings by:
• carrying out Congress decisions;
• watching economic and social
developments;
• providing educational and advisory
services to unions; and
• presenting in national debate the trade
union viewpoint on economic, social and
industrial issues.
The TUC plays an active part in
international trade union activity, through its
affiliation to the International Confederation
of Free Trade Unions and the European
Trade Union Confederation. It also
nominates the British workers’ delegation to
the annual International Labour Conference.
Scotland and Northern Ireland
Trade unions in Scotland also have their own
national central body, the Scottish Trades
Union Congress, which in many respects is
similar in constitution and function to the
TUC. Trade unions in Northern Ireland are
represented by the Northern Ireland
Committee of the Irish Congress of Trade
Unions (ICTU). Most trade unionists in
Northern Ireland are members of
organisations affiliated to the ICTU, while
the majority also belong to unions based in
Great Britain which are also affiliated to the
TUC. The Northern Ireland Committee of
the ICTU enjoys a high degree of autonomy.
Legal Framework
The Government’s reforms of industrial
relations and trade union law have helped to
change the balance of power between trade
unions and employers, and between trade
unions and their own members. Legislation is
consolidated in the Trade Union and Labour
135
BRITAIN 1994: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Relations (Consolidation) Act 1992, as
amended by the most recent Act, the Trade
Union Reform and Employment Rights Act
1993. These reforms have played a key role
in transforming Britain’s industrial relations.
The Trade Union Reform and
Employment Rights Act 1993 contains
several provisions, including:
• giving individuals greater freedom
to join the union of their choice;
• protecting against abuse of any
arrangements for deducting union
subscriptions directly from pay;
• giving union members the right to
a fully postal ballot before a strike
and before a union merger; and
• creating a right for anyone to seek
the protection of the law if he or
she were the victim of unlawful
industrial action.
The 1993 Act also strengthens and extends
the rights of individual employees, including
stronger rights on maternity leave (see
p. 131). Under the Act the 26 wages councils
in Great Britain were abolished on 30 August
1993, while the nine wages councils in
Northern Ireland are also to be abolished.
There were 528,000 working days lost in
253 stoppages of work as a result of
industrial action in 1992 (see Table 11.4),
the lowest calendar year totals since records
began in 1891.
Trade Union Recognition
The previous statutory recognition procedure
was repealed in 1980. Employers are now
free to decide whether or not they wish to
recognise, or continue to recognise, a
particular union, or unions, for collective
bargaining purposes.
Industrial Action
Under common law, it is unlawful to induce
workers to break a contract or to threaten to
do it. Thus, without special protection,
trade unions (or any other person or
organisation) would face the possibility of
legal action for inducing breaches of contract
every time they called a strike or other form
of industrial action. To prevent this,
‘statutory immunities’ were introduced,
which provide that trade unions and others
can, in certain circumstances, organise
industrial action without fear of being sued
in the courts. These immunities only protect
those who call for or organise industrial
action. They do not protect individuals who
choose to take industrial action from being
dismissed, or from legal action by their
employer.
Prior to the 1980s, the circumstances in
which these immunities applied were very
wide, so that the organisation of almost any
industrial action was protected. The
legislative reforms of the past decade have
restricted the scope of these immunities in a
number of ways. To have the benefit of
statutory immunity (that is, to be ‘lawful’),
the organisation of industrial action must
now be wholly or mainly in contemplation
or furtherance of a trade dispute between
workers and their own employer, and
must not:

POLLUTION CONTROL
Herbicides, pesticides and liquid
industrial wastes are among the
substances that can pollute
ground and surface water.
Researchers at the University of
Kent’s Biological Laboratory are
investigating the effectiveness of
naturally-occurring bacteria in
breaking down certain herbicides.
Lloyd’s Register operates a
mobile laboratory for assessing
air quality and identifying
pollution sources. The
laboratory can respond quickly
to air pollution incidents, and
the sensors on the taller mast
enable it to monitor weather
conditions.

EMPLOYMENT
• involve workers who have no dispute with
their own employer (so-called ‘secondary’
action);
• involve unlawful picketing;
• be done to establish or maintain a union-
only labour agreement (the ‘closed shop’);
or
• be done in support of any employee
dismissed while taking unofficial
industrial action.
Before calling for industrial action, a trade
union must first obtain the support of its
members in a fully postal secret ballot and
must notify employers of its intention to
conduct such a ballot. The union must also
provide employers, in writing, with at least
seven days’ notice of official industrial action
following a ballot, and with details of the
ballot result.
A trade union is responsible in law if
industrial action is called for or organised by
any of its officials. This means that if a trade
union acts unlawfully, for example, by calling
for industrial action without a proper secret
ballot, legal proceedings can be taken against
the union itself.
Any trade union member has the right to
restrain his union from calling on him, and
other members, to take action unless a
properly conducted secret ballot has
supported the action. Anyone deprived of
goods or services because of unlawful
organisation of industrial action has the right
to obtain a court order to stop this happening.
Trade Union Elections
The law requires a trade union to elect every
member of its governing body, its general
secretary and its president. Elections must be
held every five years and be carried out by
secret postal ballot of the union’s members.
The election must be held under independent
scrutiny. Any union member who believes
that the union has not complied with the
statutory requirements may complain to the
courts or to the Certification Officer.
Members ’ Rights
All individuals have the right under the law
not to be dismissed or refused employment
because they are, are not or will not become,
trade union members. They also have the
right not to be refused any of the services of
an employment agency because they are, or
are not, members of a union. Individuals who
believe that they have been dismissed or
refused employment on grounds related to
their union membership or non-membership
may complain to an industrial tribunal. Other
members’ rights include:
• a statutory remedy if unjustifiably
disciplined by their union; and
• the right to inspect their union’s
accounting records and obtain an annual
statement from the union about its
financial affairs.
Political Funds
A trade union may establish a political fund
if it wishes to use its money for what the law
defines as ‘political objects’. If a union wishes
to set up a political fund, its members must
first agree in a secret ballot a resolution
adopting those political objectives as an aim
of the union. The union must also ballot its
members every ten years to maintain the
fund. Union members have a statutory right
to opt out of contributing to a political fund.
Employers’ Organisations
Many employers in Britain are members of
employers’ organisations, some of which are
wholly concerned with labour matters,
although others are also concerned with
commercial matters or trade associations.
With the move away from national pay
bargaining, many employers’ associations have
looked at their functions and have moved
towards concentrating on areas such as
supplying information for bargaining
purposes and dealing with specialist
questions.
Employers’ organisations are usually
established on an industry basis rather than a
product basis, for example, the Engineering
Employers’ Federation. A few are purely
local in character or deal with a section of an
industry or, for example, with small
137
BRITAIN 1994: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
businesses; most are national and are
concerned with the whole of an industry. In
some of the main industries there are local or
regional organisations combined into national
federations. In others, within which different
firms are engaged in making different
principal products, there is a complex
structure with national and regional
federations for parts of an industry as well as
for the industry as a whole. At the end of
1992, 128 listed and 134 unlisted employers’
associations were known to the Certification
Officer.
Most national organisations belong to
the Confederation of British Industry (see
p. 142), which represents directly or
indirectly some 250,000 businesses.
Advisory, Conciliation and Arbitration
Service
The Advisory, Conciliation and Arbitration
Service (ACAS) is an independent statutory
body providing industrial relations services to
employers, employees and trade unions.
ACAS seeks to discharge its responsibilities
through the voluntary co-operation of
employers, employees and their
representatives. Its main functions are
collective conciliation, provision of arbitration
and mediation facilities, advisory services for
promoting the improvement of industrial
relations through the joint involvement of
employers and employees, and providing an
information service. ACAS also conciliates in
disputes on individual rights.
In 1992 ACAS:
• received some 1,200 requests for
collective conciliation, with a further 162
requests referred to arbitration, mediation
or investigation;
• dealt with over 72,000 individual
conciliation cases;
• made nearly 5,000 advisory visits;
• assisted with 225 joint working exercises;
and
• dealt with 488,000 enquiries through its
public enquiry points.
In Northern Ireland the Labour Relations
Agency, an independent statutory body,
provides services similar to those provided by
ACAS in Great Britain.
HEALTH AND SAFETY AT WORK
Recent statistics indicate a reduction in the
rate of major and other reported injuries to
employees. About 23 million working days a
year are lost as a result of work-related
injuries. Employers have a duty in law to take
reasonable care of their staff, as well as others
affected by their work activities. Employees
have a duty to take care of their own safety
and that of their fellow workers.
The principal legislation is the Health and
Safety at Work etc. Act 1974. It places
general duties on everyone concerned with
work activities, including employers, the self-
employed, employees, and manufacturers and
suppliers of materials for use at work.
Associated Acts and regulations deal with
particular hazards and types of work.
Employers with five or more staff must
prepare a written statement of their health
and safety policy and bring it to the attention
of their staff.
The 1974 Act provides for the Health and
Safety Commission (see p. 139) to develop
proposals to update earlier legislation, much
of which was not adaptable to technical
innovation. Reforms have since been
completed in many areas. Much of the old
law has been replaced by modern provisions,
supported as necessary by codes of practice
and other guidance material.
The Control of Substances Hazardous to
Health Regulations 1988 are one of the most
important sets of regulations made under the
1974 Act. They replaced a range of outdated
legislation by a comprehensive and systematic
approach to the control of exposure to
virtually all substances hazardous to health.
These include chemicals, fumes, dust and
micro-organisms.
Six new sets of health and safety
regulations came into force at the beginning
of 1993, giving effect in Britain to various EC
directives. They cover:
• the management of health and safety;
• the provision and use of work equipment;
• personal protective equipment;
138
EMPLOYMENT
• manual handling equipment;
• display screen equipment; and
• general health, safety and welfare in the
workplace.
These also replaced a number of old laws.
The regulations cover a wide range of basic
health, safety and welfare issues.
The Health and Safety Commission is
conducting a review, expected to be
substantially completed by April 1994, of all
health and safety legislation to assess whether
it is still relevant and necessary. The review
will look at the impact on business, and assess
whether repeal or simplification is possible
without endangering health and safety
standards.
Health and Safety Commission
The Health and Safety Commission (HSC),
which is accountable to Parliament through
the Secretary of State for Employment, has
responsibility for developing policy on health
and safety at work, including guidance, codes
of practice, or proposals for regulations. In
the case of proposals for changes in
legislation, the HSC has an obligation to
consult those who would be affected and
makes recommendations to the Secretary of
State concerned.
The HSC has seven advisory committees
covering subjects such as toxic substances,
genetic manipulation and the safety of nuclear
installations. There are also several industry
advisory committees, each of which deals with
a specific industry.
Health and Safety Executive
The Health and Safety Executive (HSE) is
the primary instrument for carrying out the
HSC’s policies and has day-to-day
responsibility for enforcing health and safety
law, except where other bodies, such as local
authorities, are responsible. Its field services
and inspections over the country as a whole
are carried out by the Field Operations
Division. This incorporates the Factory,
Agricultural and Quarries inspectorates,
together with the regional staff of the
Employment Medical Advisory Service
(which provides advice on medical aspects of
employment problems), and the Field
Consulting Groups, which provide technical
support to the inspectorates. The HSE also
includes:
• the policy divisions covering health,
safety and strategic considerations;
• the Technology and Health Services
Division, which provides technical
advice on industrial health and safety
matters; and
• the Research and Laboratory Services
Division, which provides scientific and
medical support and testing services,
and carries out research.
In premises such as offices, shops,
warehouses, restaurants and hotels, health
and safety legislation is enforced by
inspectors appointed by local authorities,
working under guidance from the HSE.
Some other official bodies work under
agency agreement with the HSE.
Northern Ireland
In Northern Ireland the Health and Safety
Agency, roughly corresponding to the HSC
but without its policy-making powers, and
an Employment Medical Advisory Service
were set up by the Health and Safety at
Work (NI) Order 1978. The general
requirements of the Northern Ireland
health and safety legislation are broadly
similar to those for Great Britain. They are
enforced mainly by the Department of
Economic Development through its Health
and Safety Inspectorate.

Private enterprises generate over three-quarters of total domestic income.
Since 1979 the Government has privatised 46 major businesses and reduced
the state-owned sector of industry by about two-thirds. The Government is
taking measures to cut unnecessary regulations imposed on business, and
runs a number of schemes which provide direct assistance or advice to small
and medium-sized businesses.
STRUCTURE AND ORGANISATION
In some sectors a small number of large
companies and their subsidiaries are
responsible for a substantial proportion of
total production, notably in the vehicle,
aerospace and transport equipment
industries. Private enterprises account for
the greater part of activity in the
agricultural, manufacturing, construction,
distributive, financial and miscellaneous
service sectors. The private sector
contributed 75 per cent of total domestic
final expenditure in 1992, general
government 24 per cent and public
corporations 1 per cent.
About 250 British industrial companies in
the latest reporting period each had an
annual turnover of more than £500 million.
The annual turnover of the biggest
company, British Petroleum (BP), makes it
the 11th largest industrial grouping in the
world and the second largest in Europe.
Five British firms are among the top 25
European Community (EC) companies.
Industrial Financing
Over half of companies’ funds for investment
and other purposes are internally generated.
Banks are the chief external source of finance,
but companies have increasingly turned to
equity finance. The main forms of short¬
term finance in the private sector are bank
overdrafts, trade credit and factoring (making
cash available to a company in exchange for
debts owing to it).
Types of medium- and long-term finance
include bank loans, mortgaging of property
and the issue of shares and other securities to
the public through the London Stock
Exchange. The leasing of equipment may also
be regarded as a form of finance. Other

expansion or the management buy-out or
buy-in (see below) of a company. Equity
capital is provided by major institutions and
is managed by both independent fund
managers and wholly owned subsidiaries or
divisions of large financial institutions such as
banks. Since 1985, members of the British
Venture Capital Association (BVCA) have
invested about ^8,800 million and currently
command an investment pool of some £2,000
million. The venture capital industry has
been growing substantially.
Buy-ms and Buy-outs
In the late 1980s there was a rise in the
number of buy-outs, in which the staff or
management of a company raise the finance
to purchase it, and buy-ins, whereby the staff
or management of one firm purchase another.
Since 1983 there have been over 4,300 buy¬
outs and buy-ins, with a total value of
£28,611 million. The amount invested in
management buy-outs and buy-ins in 1992
was £3,262 million. Buy-outs and buy-ins
accounted for 65 per cent of venture capital
investments by BVCA members in Britain in
1991.
Taxation
Rates of corporate taxation have been
progressively reduced. In the case of business
plant and machinery, an annual allowance is
available against profits for tax purposes of 25
per cent (on a reducing balance basis),
beginning in the year in which expenditure
occurs. For investment in industrial building,
there is an allowance of 4 per cent a year.
Special arrangements exist for short-life,
often high-technology, assets. There are 100
per cent allowances for capital expenditure on
scientific research, and, in designated
enterprise zones, for construction expenditure.

BRITAIN 1994: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
INDUSTRIAL ASSOCIATIONS
Confederation of British Industry
The Confederation of British Industry (CBI)
is the largest employers’ organisation in Britain,
representing about 250,000 companies from all
sectors, which together employ over 60 per
cent of Britain’s workforce. Membership
ranges from the smallest to the largest
companies, private sector and nationalised, and
includes companies in manufacturing,
agriculture, construction, distribution, mining,
finance, retailing and insurance. Most national
employers’ organisations, trade associations,
and some chambers of commerce are members.
The CBI aims primarily to ensure that the
Government, national and international
institutions and the public understand the
needs, intentions and problems of business, so
as to create a climate of opinion in which
business can operate efficiently and profitably.
It campaigns to lessen the burdens on
business, tackle handicaps on competition, and
help improve the performance of companies.
It offers members a forum, a lobby and a
range of advisory services. The CBI also
conducts surveys which provide a useful
barometer of activity in manufacturing,
distribution, financial services, the regions,
innovation, and pay and productivity. It has
12 regional offices and an office in Brussels.
The CBI is the British member of the Union
of Industrial and Employers’ Confederations
of Europe.
British Chambers of Commerce
The British Chambers of Commerce (BCC)
represents business views and interests to the
Government at national and local levels. It
promotes local economic development—-for
example, through regeneration projects,
tourism, inward investment promotion in
certain areas of Britain and business services,
including overseas trade missions, exhibitions
and training conferences. It also provides
member firms with information about overseas
buyers and product sourcing. The BCC
represents over 214,000 businesses in over 240
chambers of commerce and trade throughout
Britain.
Institute of Directors
The Institute of Directors (IOD) has more
than 49,000 members worldwide, including
33,600 members in Britain, many of whom
are in the small business sector. The IOD
provides business advisory services on a range
of matters affecting company directors, such
as corporate management, insolvency and
career counselling, and represents the
interests of members to authorities in Britain
and the EC. It also offers a full training
programme of courses and lectures.
Trade and Employers’ Organisations
Trade associations consist of companies
producing or selling a particular product or
group of products. They exist to supply
common services, regulate trading practices
and represent their members to government
departments.
Employers’ organisations are usually
concerned with the negotiation of wages and
conditions of work in a particular industry,
although sometimes one institution may
combine this function with that of a trade
association.
GOVERNMENT AND INDUSTRY
The Government believes that economic
decisions are best taken by those competing
in the market place, and that government
should encourage enterprise and create the
right climate for markets to work better.
The Department of Trade and Industry
(DTI) is the department mainly responsible
for the Government’s relations with industry
and commerce. Specific responsibilities
include technology and innovation, overseas
trade and export promotion, competition
policy and consumer affairs, regional
industrial development, small firms, company
legislation and patents. Through the Invest in
Britain Bureau, it gives advice and assistance
to overseas companies on locating in Britain
(see p. 150). The Scottish, Welsh and
Northern Ireland Offices are responsible for
industrial policies in their areas.
The Government has reorganised the DTI
so that it relates more closely to individual
142
INDUSTRY AND COMMERCE
sectors of business. In October 1992 the DTI
specified its objectives as:
• identifying the needs of business through
close contact with individual sectors of
industry;
• ensuring these needs are taken into
account by Government and within the
European Community;
• identifying influences on competitiveness
at home and abroad;
• working for trade liberalisation
worldwide;
• widening choice and stimulating
enterprise by promoting competition and
privatisation;
• maintaining confidence in markets and
protecting consumers by fair regulation;
• reducing burdens on business;
• stimulating innovation and encouraging
best practice in quality, design and
management;
• helping to create small and medium-sized
businesses;
• responding to regional needs; and
• stimulating an effective business response
to environmental developments.
Education and Training
A well-educated and well-trained workforce is
considered essential for economic growth,
particularly at a time of intense international
competition and rapid technological advance.
The Government takes measures to see that
education and training are broadly based and
that people of all ages can acquire relevant
knowledge and skills. Education—business
links are being improved (see Chapter 27).
Training and Enterprise Councils and Local
Enterprise Companies
The Government has set up a network of 82
business-led Training and Enterprise
Councils in England and Wales and 22 Local
Enterprise Companies in Scotland. TECs and
LECs are independent companies run by
boards of directors, the majority of whom are
drawn from private sector business. From
April 1993, grants are being provided to
TECs to enable them to provide a range of
training, education and enterprise
programmes on behalf of the Government.
The LECs encourage investment in the
development of skills throughout the
workforce and invest directly in training,
particularly for school-leavers and the long¬
term unemployed. In addition, they offer a
range of advisory and training services to
businesses, including schemes to enhance the
expertise of managers. TECs are expected to
play a strategic role and are not engaged in
the direct delivery of services, particularly
where this may compete with existing
provision.
Single European Market
The Government believes that the
completion of the single European market,
which was achieved by the end of 1992 (see
p. 296), will benefit the economy of each
member state, and that the removal of trade
barriers should lead to a reduction in
business costs as well as increasing
competition, stimulating efficiency, benefiting
consumers and encouraging the creation of
jobs and wealth. In the years leading up to
the completion of the single market legislative
framework, the DTFs Single Market
Campaign informed business organisations on
specific issues and opportunities that would
arise. In 1993 the Government launched
Business in Europe, an initiative to
strengthen export advisory services to help
British companies compete effectively.
Privatisation
The Government believes that the best way
to improve the performance of public sector
companies and nationalised industries is to
expose them to market forces, through
privatisation and the promotion of
competition. Privatisation has also provided
an opportunity for the Government to widen
and deepen share ownership by encouraging
both employees and the general public to take
a direct stake in industry. In major flotations,
employees in privatised companies are
normally given a preferential right to buy
shares in the new privatised companies.

‘’Includes value of future instalment payments.
Since 1979 the Government has privatised
46 major businesses, with forecast net
proceeds to the end of 1993-94 of some
£55,500 million. Recent privatisations include
the electricity industry in Northern Ireland
and the Government’s residual shareholding
in BT (British Telecom). British Coal is to be
privatised and legislation is being introduced
to enable the private sector to operate rail
services. The future of the Post Office is
under review and the ten companies operating
London’s buses are to be sold from late 1993.
Privatisation is also being extended to non¬
core government activities and other public
sector areas.
Benefits
The economy has benefited through higher
returns on capital in the privatised industries,
which can no longer pre-empt or command
resources from elsewhere in the economy but
must compete for funds in the open capital
markets. Privatised companies have welcomed
the freedom to raise finance in private sector
capital markets.
The consumer has benefited from
downward pressure on prices and from rising
standards of service. The Government
established a system of independent
regulation for the privatised utilities (see
p. 153). For each of the privatised utility
sectors, such as gas or telecommunications,
there is a regulatory body which has a wide
range of powers and duties to promote
competition and the interests of consumers.
These include considering all complaints and
representations about the company’s services.
Each privatised utility has a pricing policy
which usually limits annual price increases to
no more than the rate of inflation.
Nationalised Industries
The remaining major nationalised industries
are British Coal, British Rail, the Post Office,
London Transport and Nuclear Electric.
Their managing boards are appointed by
ministers who have the power to give general
directions but are not involved in day-to-day
management. The managing boards and staffs
of the nationalised industries are not civil
servants.
The Government considers that
nationalised industries should act as
commercial enterprises and has set policies
with which they are expected to conform.
These involve:
• clear government objectives for the
industries;
144
INDUSTRY AND COMMERCE
• regular corporate plans and performance
reviews;
• agreed principles relating to investment
appraisal and pricing;
• financial targets and performance aims;
• external financing limits; and
• systematic monitoring.
Deregulation
The Government’s objective is to reduce or
simplify administrative and legislative
burdens imposed on business, particularly
small businesses, where the burden of
compliance is most demanding.
Under a Deregulation Initiative, the
Government is working to reduce burdens on
business by:
• achieving better regulation, cutting
unnecessary regulation and minimising
the cost of compliance with essential
regulation;
• ensuring that the views of business, and
potential costs of compliance, are taken
into account in framing new regulations
and in negotiating EC proposals;
• improving official awareness of the needs
of business through training and better
consultation and communication; and
• improving the quality of service to
business generally, whether provided by
central or local government.
Proposed regulations, including EC
directives, are to be accompanied by an
assessment of the costs they would impose on
business. The existing 3,500 regulations
affecting companies are being reviewed by
task forces of business people working with
government departments.
It is intended that deregulation should
complement the Citizen’s Charter, which
aims to ensure public services are efficient
and responsive to their users. Measures are
being taken to ensure business forms are
simplified and that contracting out does not
impose additional burdens on business.
Small Firms
Small businesses make a major contribution
to the economy. Firms with fewer than 100
employees account for 50 per cent of the
private sector workforce and produce 27 per
cent of British turnover. Some 400,000 new
businesses were started in 1992, slightly fewer
than the 460,000 in 1991, but higher than the
average for the 1980s. Industries with the
fastest growth rates between 1980 and 1991
were in the services sector, particularly
finance, property and professional services.
The Government runs schemes giving
either direct assistance or advice and guidance
on a range of business problems affecting
small firms. In addition to DTI schemes such
as those available under the Enterprise
Initiative, TECs offer small and medium-sized
enterprises a comprehensive package of
business and training support. The range of
support is varied. A TEC portfolio of
business support would typically include
business information and advice services,
business counselling for new and existing
companies, and business skills training
programmes.
One-stop Shops
The DTI has set up a pilot network of 23
business advice centres—‘One-stop Shops’—to
bring together organisations supporting
enterprise, such as local companies, TECs and
chambers of commerce, to offer a full range of
business advisory services to established
medium-sized and small firms. It is envisaged
not as a government scheme but as a network
of local partnerships, in which larger firms can
make contacts and expertise available to small
firms. The Government intends contracting
out all consultancy services at present run by
DTI to the One-stop Shops.
The first One-stop Shops are being set up
in six areas at a cost of £5.6 million.
Additional government funds will be provided
to set up a London-wide network of One-stop
Shops. If successful, it is intended to establish
a national network of such centres.
In Scotland the arrangements for the
provision of integrated business advice are
slightly different. The LECs play a significant
role, both individually and in their
partnerships with other agencies, and a
number of local Business Information Centres
have been opened.
145
BRITAIN 1994: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Enterprise Initiative
The Enterprise Initiative brings together a
wide range of the services that the DTI
provides for industry and commerce. The
consultancy scheme encourages small and
medium-sized businesses to use outside
consultancy services as a regular part of
their management strategy and offers
short-term consultancy support in design,
marketing, manufacturing and services
systems, quality, business planning, and
financial and management information
systems. Some 12,000 consultancy projects
were completed in 1992-93.
In Scotland and Wales the consultancy
scheme is delivered by Enterprise Services
Scotland (a subsidiary of Scottish
Enterprise—(see p. 147) and the Welsh
Development Agency (see p. 147).
Assistance is available to most
manufacturing and service businesses with
fewer than 500 employees. In the Assisted
Areas (see below) and Urban Programme
Areas, half of the costs of a project are
met; elsewhere the rate is one-third. Some
£50 million is being provided in 1993-94
to support the consultancy scheme. The
target in 1993-94, the last year for
applications, is to assist 10,000 firms.
Thereafter consultancy support will be
channelled through One-stop Shops and
TECs.
Small Firms Schemes
The Support for Products Under Research
scheme (SPUR) offers grants to businesses
with up to 500 employees for new product
and process development requiring a
significant technological advance. The
Small Firms Merit Award for Research
and Technology (SMART) is an annual
competition which provides grants to
individuals and businesses with fewer than
50 employees in support of highly
innovative technological projects with
commercial potential. The DTI has
allocated over £70 million to the SPUR
and SMART programmes.
Other government help to small firms
includes:
• the Small Firms Loan Guarantee
Scheme, which helps businesses with
viable proposals to obtain finance where
conventional loans are unavailable as a
result of a lack of financial security or
previous performance—the scheme
provides banks and other financial
institutions with a government guarantee
on a certain percentage of the loan in
return for a premium payment;
• an initiative to encourage the growth of
informal investment for small firms from
a wider range of sources. The
Government is providing support to a
number of TECs and other organisations
to bring together investors and small
firms; and
• the Business Start-Up scheme, enabling
unemployed people to claim an allowance
while establishing a new business.
REGIONAL INDUSTRIAL
DEVELOPMENT
Industrial policy is designed to encourage
enterprise and economic growth in all areas
of Britain. In some areas, however, where
additional help is needed, it is provided
under the Enterprise Initiative. Help is
focused on the Assisted Areas (Development
Areas and Intermediate Areas), which cover
around 34 per cent of Britain’s working
population.
Following a review of the Assisted Areas,
in July 1993 the Government announced a
number of changes. The new map (see
p. 148) represents the Government’s
assessment of those areas now facing
problems of structural unemployment. The
review took into account a wide range of
factors, including levels of unemployment
and the nature of the problems faced in each
area. Some regions, such as Wales, which
have experienced a relative improvement in
unemployment levels, now have less of their
area covered by Assisted Areas. Areas which
have become eligible for regional aid include
parts of the South East, such as inner areas
of London and some coastal towns affected
by high unemployment; and areas in the East
Midlands and Yorkshire affected by coal
mine closures.
146
INDUSTRY AND COMMERCE
The principal regional policy instruments
are:
• regional selective assistance, available
throughout the Assisted Areas, for
investment projects undertaken by firms
meeting certain criteria;
• Regional Enterprise Grants, which are
available to support investment and
innovation in small firms. Investment
grants are available to firms with fewer
than 25 employees in Development Areas
and certain Intermediate Areas;
• Regional Innovation Grants, which are
made to firms employing fewer than 50
employees in all Development,
Intermediate, Task Force and City
Challenge areas (see pp. 321-6), as well
as some other areas covered by EC
schemes; they are also available in certain
Scottish urban areas. The promotion of
inward investment is a key element in
the Government’s regional policy.
England
The English Industrial Estates Corporation
makes available industrial and commercial
premises in certain parts of the Assisted
Areas in England where private sector
provision is insufficient.
The Rural Development Commission is
responsible for advising the Government on
issues affecting rural England and for
promoting its economic and social
development. The Commission’s resources
are concentrated in areas of greatest need,
known as Priority Areas. It provides:
• small factories and workshops built and
managed by English Estates or in
partnership with local authorities or the
private sector;
• a grant scheme for the conversion of
redundant buildings to industrial or
commercial premises;
• technical, management and financial
advice, as well as training facilities and
loans to small businesses;
• support for local enterprise agencies,
which in turn offer help to small
firms;
• support for voluntary bodies in rural
areas to encourage community activity
and self-help; and
• support for the provision of small-scale
rural housing and local rural transport
schemes.
Scotland
Scottish Enterprise and Highlands and
Islands Enterprise provide support to
industry and commerce, in lowland and
highland Scotland respectively, operating
mainly through the network of LECs
(see p. 143).
Scottish Enterprise and Highlands and
Islands Enterprise seek to ensure that
economic development in Scotland is not
artificially constrained by inadequate
provision of sites and factories, and that there
is sufficient investment funding for businesses
in the private sector. Where necessary they
contribute financially to such provision. They
also remove obstacles to economic
development through the treatment of
derelict land and by contributing to tackling
deficiencies in the physical environment and
infrastructure of towns and cities. In addition,
The Scottish Office Industry Department
provides support to exporters and small firms
through the SPUR and SMART programmes
and Regional Enterprise Grants.
Wales
The Welsh Development Agency (WDA)
promotes industrial efficiency and
international competitiveness and aims to
improve the environment in Wales. Through
Welsh Development International, it seeks to
attract high-quality investment into Wales
and co-ordinates the approach for responding
to the needs of investors. The WDA provides
a range of support services, particularly for
small and medium-sized enterprises.
The Business Services programme
helps companies plan strategically for long¬
term competitiveness, growth and improved
profitability, and for meeting customer
requirements, and understanding and
implementing best practice. The programme
also includes technology exploitation, skills

development, financial advice and help, and a
comprehensive European programme.
The WDA aims to ensure that an adequate
supply of industrial and commercial property
is available in Wales. Its direct building
programme focuses on areas where private
sector provision is not adequate; increasingly
the Agency operates through land assembly
and servicing of sites, and by encouraging
participation from the private sector, for
example, through joint ventures.
Development projects, such as a major
programme of land reclamation and
environmental improvement and an urban
development programme, aim to
regenerate selected areas by opening up
development opportunities for private
enterprise.
The Rural Prosperity Programme includes
comprehensive action plans to develop
specific rural areas. There are also initiatives
and schemes designed to stimulate new rural
enterprise and business growth. The
Development Board for Rural Wales supplies
factories, key worker housing and advice for
small businesses.
Northern Ireland
Development policy in Northern Ireland is
the responsibility of the Department of
Economic Development and is delivered
through various agencies, including:
• the Industrial Development Board, which
deals with overseas companies considering
Northern Ireland as an investment
location, as well as the development of
local companies with more than 50
employees;
• the Local Enterprise Development Unit,
responsible for the promotion of
enterprise and the development of small
businesses;
• the Industrial Research and Technology
Unit, providing advice and assistance on
research and development, innovation and
technology transfer; and
• the Training and Employment Agency,
which helps with in-company training
and management development.
A variety of schemes are available to help
companies with marketing, exporting, product
development and design, improved
productivity and quality, training, and
research and development. The full range of
assistance is made available to those
companies which are able to demonstrate
development potential and prospect of long¬
term competitive growth. Where appropriate,
this assistance includes capital grants, loans
and share capital investment. The Industrial
Development Board also offers stocks of land
and industrial premises for purchase or lease.
There is exemption from local taxes for
manufacturing premises.
European Community Regional Policy
and Aid
The European Community seeks to reduce
disparities between regions. The principal
responsibility for helping less prosperous
areas remains with national authorities, but
the Community may complement schemes
through aid from a number of sources.
The European Regional Development
Fund is intended to stimulate
economic development in the EC’s
least prosperous regions and those
where economic development is at a
relatively low level. For 1993,
£571 million has been allocated to
Britain. The Fund is used to
co-finance a variety of measures,
including industrial facilities,
transport infrastructure,
environmental improvement schemes,
tourism developments, and support for
research and development (R & D)
and vocational training.
The European Investment Bank (see p. 297)
also helps to finance projects of common
interest to several member states. The
Channel Tunnel (see Chapter 18) is one such
project currently being assisted in Britain.
INWARD INVESTMENT
Britain is considered a favourable location for
inward direct investment, attracting more
than any other EC country. This reflects its
149
BRITAIN 1994: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
membership of the European Community
and proximity to other European markets,
stable labour relations, a flexible and
productive workforce, and comparatively low
corporate and personal taxation. In 1992-93
the DTI’s Invest in Britain Bureau reported
over 300 investment decisions taken by
overseas companies, with associated
employment estimated at more than 56,000.
Benefits
Inward investment brings many benefits to
Britain’s economy, such as new jobs,
management practices, products and
processes. Overseas companies are estimated
to provide 16 per cent of manufacturing jobs
in Britain, 22 per cent of net output and 27
per cent of net capital expenditure. Over the
past three years they have bought over a half
of their capital equipment from companies
within Britain and have built long-term
contacts with suppliers.
The regions benefiting most from inward
investment by multinational companies are
Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland, north-east
England, Yorkshire and Humberside, and the
Midlands. Many projects are expansions by
companies already established in Britain.
Promotion
Overseas-owned firms are offered the same
incentives by the Government as British-
owned ones. The Invest in Britain Bureau
gives overseas companies advice and
assistance on locating and relocating
businesses in Britain, and on expanding
existing facilities. It operates overseas
through British Embassies, High
Commissions and Consulates-General, and
within Britain through the DTPs network of
regional offices in England, which provide
local information about available sites, wages
and skills, markets and housing. They
operate with the aid of the six English
Regional Development Organisations
(RDOs), which also promote their own areas
to potential investors overseas and elsewhere
in Britain.
Similar advice and assistance to that
provided by the RDOs is available through:
• Locate in Scotland, operated jointly by
The Scottish Office Industry Department
and Scottish Enterprise;
• Welsh Development International, the
investment arm of the Welsh
Development Agency; and
• the Industrial Development Board in
Northern Ireland.
REGULATION OF MARKETS
While preferring to let markets operate as
freely as possible, the Government recognises
that intervention may sometimes be needed
to ensure that markets are open and fair. The
Government therefore seeks to control
restrictive or anti-competitive practices.
Within the public sector it has taken a
number of steps to increase competition,
notably through privatisation (see p. 143).
Deregulation measures seek to reduce
regulations which inhibit competition,
innovation or consumer choice (see p. 145).
Government policy provides for the
regulation of monopolies, mergers, anti¬
competitive practices and restrictive trade
practices. The Office of Fair Trading, headed
by its Director General, administers the
legislation on competition, consumer credit,
fair trading and resale price maintenance.
Among other things, it takes action against
cartels and anti-competitive practices;
examines company mergers for adverse
effects on competition; and scrutinises rules
and practices of regulatory bodies in sectors
such as financial services.
The Government has taken measures to
increase competition in professional services
by tackling restrictive practices. The
opticians’ monopoly on the dispensing of
spectacles and the solicitors’ monopoly on
conveyancing have been ended. Certain
professional groups (for example, accountants,
solicitors, veterinary surgeons, stockbrokers,
doctors, dentists and surveyors) have eased
the restrictions on advertising by their
members, and rules on fee scales have been
made more liberal in a number of areas.
Building societies are now allowed to offer a
greater range of services. Legislation has also
provided for greater competition in the
150
INDUSTRY AND COMMERCE
provision of legal services. Legislation exists
to offer greater protection to investors. The
Securities and Investments Board (see p. 179)
is empowered to set out general principles
governing the conduct of investment business.
European Community rules provide for
free and fair competition in trade between
member states. Enforcement of these rules is
primarily the responsibility of the European
Commission, which has powers to investigate
and terminate alleged infringements and to
impose fines, and the competition authorities
in Britain liaise closely with the Commission.
Following a Green Paper in 1992 on the
abuse of market power, the Government
announced in April 1993 that it proposed to
strengthen the law against anti-competitive
practices, including increasing the
investigative powers of the Director General
of Fair Trading.
Monopolies
The Director General of Fair Trading and
the President of the Board of Trade can refer
monopolies for investigation by the
Monopolies and Mergers Commission, an
independent body. Its members are drawn
from a variety of backgrounds and include
industrialists, lawyers, economists and trade
unionists. The governing legislation defines a
monopoly situation as one in which at least a
quarter of the market for a particular product
or service is supplied or consumed by a
single person or a group of connected
companies or by two or more people acting
in a way which prevents, restricts, or distorts
competition. The market definition of a
monopoly can relate to all of Britain or
part of it.
If the Commission finds that a monopoly
situation operates against the public interest,
the President of the Board of Trade has
powers to take action to remedy this.
Alternatively the Director General may be
asked to negotiate undertakings to remedy the
adverse effects identified by the Commission.
In 1992 the Commission reported on four
monopoly situations, three of which were
found to operate against the public interest.
Eight further monopoly references were
under investigation at the end of 1992.
The President of the Board of Trade has
powers to refer to the Commission any
questions concerning the efficiency and costs
of the service provided by, or the possible
abuse of a monopoly situation by, certain
bodies in the public sector.
Mergers
The Government believes that the market is,
in most cases, the best judge of the
advantages and disadvantages of mergers.
The great majority of mergers which do not
pose a threat to competition are, therefore,
allowed to take place. However, under the
Fair Trading Act 1973, the President of the
Board of Trade can refer mergers for
investigation by the Monopolies and Mergers
Commission if they could lead to a significant
reduction in competition or otherwise raise
matters of public concern.
A merger is defined as occurring when
two or more enterprises are brought under
common ownership or control. A merger
qualifies for investigation by the Commission
where:
• an existing market share of 25 per cent
or more is increased; or
• the total value of gross assets to be taken
over exceeds £30 million.
After considering advice from the Director
General of Fair Trading, the President of the
Board of Trade may refer a merger or
proposed merger to the Commission. The
primary criterion of the Government’s
referral policy is the possible effects on
competition. If the Commission finds that a
merger or proposed merger may be expected
to operate against the public interest, the
President of the Board of Trade can prohibit
it. Alternatively, the Director General may be
asked to obtain suitable undertakings from
the companies involved to remedy the
adverse effects identified. If the merger has
already taken place, the President of the
Board of Trade can take similar action to
reverse it. There are special provisions for
newspaper and water company mergers.
The Companies Act 1989 made changes to
improve merger control procedure. This
provided for:
151
BRITAIN 1994: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
• a voluntary procedure for pre-notification
of proposed mergers which, for the
majority of cases, permits prompt
clearance;
• the acceptance of statutory undertakings
by the parties concerned in order to
obviate the need for a full investigation
by the Commission in certain cases; and
• the temporary prohibition on reciprocal
share dealing by the parties to a merger
referred to the Commission.
During 1992, 16 acquisitions valued at
more than £500 million were
completed, eight of which exceeded
£1,000 million. The number of mergers
qualifying for investigation in 1992 was
125, compared with 185 in 1991.
Large mergers with an EC dimension,
which are assessed by reference to turnover,
normally come under the exclusive
jurisdiction of the European Commission.
The Commission can ban them if it considers
that they create or strengthen a dominant
position which would significantly impede
effective competition within the Community.
Anti-competitive Practices
The Director General of Fair Trading can,
with limited exceptions, investigate any
course of conduct by a business which
appears to be anti-competitive. If the Director
General concludes in the report following his
investigation that a practice is anti¬
competitive, undertakings may be offered by
the business responsible for the conduct. If a
suitable undertaking is not given, the matter
may be referred to the Monopolies and
Mergers Commission to establish whether the
course of conduct is an anti-competitive
practice and if so whether it operates against
the public interest. In the case of an adverse
finding by the Commission, the President of
the Board of Trade has powers to take
remedial action.
Restrictive Trade Practices
Certain kinds of commercial agreements
containing restrictions on, for example,
matters such as prices or conditions of sale
have to be notified to the Director General of
Fair Trading for registration. Failure to
register an agreement within the required
period means that the restrictions are void
and unenforceable and the parties may be
liable to legal proceedings.
Once an agreement has been registered,
the Director General is under a general duty
to refer it to the Restrictive Practices Court.
In practice, however, the great majority of
agreements never reach the Court because the
parties elect to give up the restrictions rather
than go to court. Alternatively, the President
of the Board of Trade accepts the Director
General’s advice that the restrictions are not
significant enough to warrant referral to the
Court.
If an agreement goes to the Court, the
Court must declare the restrictions contrary
to the public interest unless the parties can
satisfy it that the agreement is in the public
interest, using set criteria (‘gateways’).
Restrictions declared contrary to the public
interest by the Court are void, and the Court
has the power to order the parties not to
implement them.
Resale Price Maintenance
With two exceptions, it is unlawful for
suppliers to notify dealers of a minimum
resale price for their goods or to make it a
condition of supply that their goods must not
be sold below a specified price. Similarly, it
is also unlawful for suppliers to seek to
impose minimum resale prices by
withholding supplies of goods or
discriminating in other ways. The Director
General of Fair Trading, or anyone affected,
can take proceedings in the civil courts.
Consumer Protection
The Government believes that consumers’
interests are best served by open and
competitive markets offering the widest range
of choice in goods and services. There are,
however, laws to ensure that consumers are
adequately protected.
Legislation covers the sale of goods, the
supply of goods and services, and the way
152
INDUSTRY AND COMMERCE
that goods and services are described. The
marking and accuracy of quantities are
regulated by weights and measures legislation.
The Food Safety Act 1990 and, for Northern
Ireland, the Food Safety (NI) Order 1991
contain measures to improve food safety and
to protect consumers. Another law provides
for the control of medical products, and
certain other substances and articles, through
a system of licences and certificates. Under
EC legislation, it is a criminal offence to
supply unsafe consumer products. A range of
public safety information for consumers has
been made available by the DTI.
The Director General of Fair Trading
promotes good trading practices and acts
against malpractices. Under the Fair Trading
Act 1973, the Director General makes
recommendations for legislative or other
changes to stop practices adversely affecting
consumers’ economic welfare, encourages
trade associations to adopt codes of practice
promoting consumers’ interests, takes action
against those breaching the law to the
detriment of consumers, and disseminates
guidance to consumers on their rights. The
Director General is also responsible for
administering legislation regulating consumer
credit and estate agency work, and has
responsibilities for controlling misleading
advertisements.
The European Community’s consumer
programme covers a number of important
activities, such as health and safety,
protection of the consumer’s economic
interests, promotion of consumer education
and strengthening the representation of
consumers. The views of British consumer
organisations on Community matters are
represented by the Consumers in the European
Community Group (UK). British consumer
bodies are also represented on the European
consumer ‘watchdog’ body, the Bureau
Europeen des Unions de Consommateurs.
Consumer Advice and Information
Advice and information on consumer matters
are given by Citizens Advice Bureaux, trading
standards or consumer protection departments
of local authorities (in Northern Ireland the
Department of Economic Development), and,
in some areas, by specialist consumer advice
centres.
The independent, non-statutory National
Consumer Council (and the associated
councils for Scotland and Wales), which
receives government finance, presents the
consumer’s view to government, industry and
others. The General Consumer Council for
Northern Ireland has wide-ranging duties in
consumer protection and consumer affairs in
general.
Consumer bodies for the rail industry and
for some privatised utilities investigate
questions of concern to the consumer. Some
trade associations in industry and commerce
have established codes of practice. In
addition, several private organisations work to
further consumer interests. The largest is the
Consumers’ Association, funded by the
subscriptions of its 800,000 members.
Company Law
All British companies are registered with the
Registrar of Companies in Cardiff, Edinburgh
or Belfast, depending on whether a
company’s registered office is in England or
Wales, Scotland or Northern Ireland.
Legislation deals with capital structure, the
rights and duties of directors and members,
and the preparation and filing of accounts.
Most corporate businesses are ‘limited
liability’ companies. The liability of members
of a limited company is restricted to
contributing an amount related to their
shareholding. In the case of unincorporated
businesses, such as sole proprietorships or
partnerships, individuals are personally liable
for any business debts, except where a
member of a partnership is a limited liability
company.
Companies may be either public or
private. A company must satisfy three
conditions before it can become a public
limited company (pic). It must:
• be limited by shares and have a share
capital;
• state in its memorandum of association
that it is to be a public limited company;
and
• meet specified minimum capital
requirements.
153
BRITAIN 1994: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
All other British companies are private
companies and are generally prohibited from
offering their shares to the public. Companies
with a place of business in Britain, but which
are incorporated overseas, are also required to
register.
Laws relating to companies are designed to
meet the need for proper regulation of
business, secure open markets and create
greater safeguards for those wishing to invest
in companies or do business with them. They
implement EC directives dealing with
company law, and company and group
accounts and their auditing. The 1992
Cadbury Committee Report on the
management of companies has proposed a
Code of Best Practice for company boards. It
is based on the need for open management
and for checks and balances to prevent abuses
of power.
Insider dealing in shares is a criminal
offence. Inspectors may be appointed to
investigate possible insider dealing.
Throughout Britain there is a licensing
procedure to ensure the professional
competence, integrity and independence of
people acting as trustees of bankrupt
individuals, or as liquidators, receivers or
administrators of insolvent companies.
MANAGEMENT INITIATIVES
The DTI is working with other government
departments and with industry to improve
management education, and to spread
awareness about best management practices
through schemes such as the Enterprise
Initiative (see p. 146).
Another programme, ‘Managing in the
90s’, offers advice to managers in small and
medium-sized businesses on design, quality,
production and purchasing, and materials
management. Having been extended until
1995, the programme will focus on innovation
and management practices in the
manufacturing sector.
Management Development and
Industrial Training
Management education is on offer at many
universities and colleges of higher and further
education. Some regional management
centres have been established in England and
Wales by associations of these colleges, and
there are several similar organisations in
Scotland. Universities run full-time
postgraduate programmes at business schools
such as those of London, Manchester,
Durham, Warwick and Strathclyde
universities.
The British Institute of Management
encourages excellence in management. Other
professional bodies are concerned with
standards and training in specialised branches
of management. The employer-led
Management Charter Initiative (MCI) is the
operating arm of the National Forum for
Management Education and Development
and the leading industrial body for
management standards. Some 1,700
employers, representing a quarter of the total
workforce, are members of the MCI, which
has 86 local networks working with local
employers.
Teaching Company Scheme
The Teaching Company Scheme (TCS)
provides industrially relevant training for
young graduates over a two-year period while
they undertake key technology transfer
projects in companies under the joint
supervision of academic and company staff.
There are over 450 TCS partnerships in
progress at any one time. A similar
programme, the Senior Academics in
Industry Scheme, supports the placement of
senior academic staff into Firms for six
months, where they work directly on projects
which will benefit from their research
experience.
QUALITY AND STANDARDS
The Government is urging industry and
commerce to consider quality at all stages of
design, production, marketing and delivery to
customers.
Through its support for consultancy
projects, the Government helps small and
medium-sized firms to learn about and apply
quality management techniques based on a
national standard meeting international
154
INDUSTRY AND COMMERCE
requirements. In order to increase customer
confidence, companies are encouraged to
obtain assessment and registration to this
standard. The competence and performance
of organisations undertaking such certification
are officially accredited by the President of
the Board of Trade through the National
Accreditation Council for Certification
Bodies. Companies certified by accredited
bodies are permitted to use the national
‘crown and tick’ accreditation mark. The
DTPs Register of Quality Assessed
Companies lists accredited certification bodies
and companies assessed by them.
British Standards Institution
The British Standards Institution (BSI),
incorporated by Royal Charter, is the British
member of the European and international
standards organisations. It works with
industry and government to produce
standards of the required quality, relevant to
the needs of the market, internationally
respected, and suitable for public purchasing
and regulatory purposes.
Government support for the BSI is
directed particularly towards European and
international standards work. Common
standards are contributing to the aim of
removing technical barriers to trade in the
European Community. About 5,000 of the
12,500 British Standards are now identical
with European or international standards; of
all standards published in 1992-93, over
three-quarters are identical. The Kitemark is
the BSPs registered certification trade mark.
Measurement Standards
The DTI is responsible for policy relating to
the National Measurement System. Through
its contractors, it provides many of the
physical measurement standards and
associated calibration facilities necessary so
that measurements in Britain are made on a
common basis and to the required accuracy.
Contractors include three DTI executive
agencies: the National Physical Laboratory,
the Laboratory of the Government Chemist,
and the National Weights and Measures
Laboratory. Links with laboratories in other
countries are maintained to ensure
international compatibility in standards and
measurement, which is essential for overseas
trade and technological co-operation. The
National Measurement Accreditation Service
(NAMAS) is the national accreditation
service for calibration and testing laboratories.
For example, NAMAS-accredited calibration
laboratories offer calibration of scientific
instruments and supply official certificates in,
primarily, the physical, chemical and
engineering fields.
Design
The Design Council promotes effective
design in industry and commerce. It works
with manufacturing industry to promote the
importance of design, and to encourage
manufacturers to make better use of it, and
supports training and education in design at
all levels.
As the DTPs main agent for design
promotion, the Design Council has
responsibility for linking design to innovation
and technology so as to ensure that British
products compete effectively. It is also
responsible for the design elements of the
Enterprise Initiative consultancy scheme and
the ‘Managing in the 90s’ programme.
The Design Council, in operating the
DTPs consultancy initiative on design, offers
firms employing up to 500 people five to 15
days of subsidised consultancy. The Council
runs the British Design Awards in four
categories: consumer and contract goods,
transport industry products, computer
software, and industrial products.
In September 1993 the Government
announced that the Council would be
reorganised into a smaller body acting
primarily as a provider of analysis and advice
on all aspects of design policy.
Awards to Industry and Commerce
The Queen’s Awards for Export and
Technological Achievement recognise
outstanding performance in their respective
fields. Awarded annually, they are valid for
five years and are granted by the Queen on
the advice of the Prime Minister, who is
155
BRITAIN 1994: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
assisted by an Advisory Committee consisting
of senior representatives from industry,
commerce, the trade unions and government
departments. Any self-contained ‘industrial
unit’ in Britain is eligible to apply, regardless
of size, provided it meets the scheme’s criteria.
The Queen’s Award for Environmental
Achievement was launched in 1993.
Other awards include the Export Award
for Smaller Businesses (for firms employing
fewer than 200 people) and the MacRobert
Award, the major award for engineering in
Britain made by the Fellowship of
Engineering for successful technological
innovation.
INNOVATION
Innovation—the successful exploitation of
new ideas—is vital in maintaining an
economy based on competitive wealth
creation. Through its Innovation Unit, which
includes five seconded industrialists, the DTI
seeks to influence the thinking of business,
education, the media and Government, as
well as the general public, by:
• improving commercial exploitation of
Britain’s science and technology base;
• improving management of innovation in
business by spreading best practice;
• improving communications between
investors and business regarding
innovation;
• increasing appreciation of the importance
of innovation within education at all
levels;
• encouraging a more positive attitude to
innovation, as well as to science and
technology;
• informing the public of the importance of
innovation in wealth creation; and
• ensuring consistency and co-operation in
the delivery of innovation schemes and
services provided by the DTI and other
government departments.
There has been an increase in the DTPs
budget for industrial innovation (see p. 277).
In Northern Ireland the basic aim of the
Industrial Research and Technology Unit is
to improve the competitiveness of industry
by encouraging innovation, industrially
relevant R & D and technology transfer. It
does this through the provision of scientific
services and the delivery of R & D support
programmes, such as its Product and Process
Development Programme and its Science
and Technology Programme.
Industrial and Intellectual Property
The Government supports innovation by
protecting the rights of the originators of
inventions, industrial designs, trade marks
and copyright in literary, artistic and musical
works. These matters are the responsibility
of the Patent Office, which includes the
Design Registry and the Trade Marks
Registry. The Patent Office is an executive
agency of the DTI. Patent protection is also
available under the European Patent
Convention and the Patent Co-operation
Treaty. Benefits may be claimed in other
countries by virtue of separate conventions
on industrial property, literary and artistic
works, and music and broadcasting. Recent
measures include:
• the adoption of EC directives on
copyright which harmonise rental and
lending rights, the rights of performers,
record producers and broadcasters, and
legal protection of computer programs.
The directive on computer programs has
been implemented into British law.
• a regulation on patents to create a
supplementary protection certificate for
medicinal products.
Proposals have been made for a
Community Design Right and some
harmonisation of national design legislation.
Negotiations continue on the Community’s
regulation on trade marks, and the proposed
EC directive for the legal protection of
biotechnological inventions is also being
discussed.

13 Manufacturing and
Construction Industries
Introduction 157 Construction 173
Sectors of Manufacturing 158
Britain became the world’s first industrialised country in the mid 19th
century. Wealth was based on manufacturing iron and steel, heavy machinery
and cotton textiles, and on coal mining, shipbuilding and trade. As in other
industrialised nations, service industries have become much more important.
However, manufacturing still plays an important role and many high-
technology industries have been developed. Major export industries with a
high proportion of research and development (R & D) spending are chemicals,
aerospace, electronics and offshore equipment, where Britain is a world
leader in technological expertise.
Introduction
Manufacturing accounted for 22 per cent of
gross domestic product (GDP) in 1992 and
for about the same percentage of
employment. Over 80 per cent of visible
exports consisted of manufactured or semi¬
manufactured goods. Almost all manufacturing
is carried out by private sector businesses.
In 1992 manufacturing output was 11 per
cent higher than in 1985, but 6 per cent
lower than in 1990 (see Table 13.2). The
recent recession led to a decline in
manufacturing output of 1 per cent in 1992.

BRITAIN 1994: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Employment in manufacturing in Britain fell
from 5.9 million in 1982 to 4.5 million in
1992. Total capital investment in
manufacturing was £12,485 million in 1992,
comprising £10,384 million in plant and
machinery, £1,377 million in new building
work and £724 million in vehicles (invest¬
ment by sector is shown in Table 13.3).
The ten largest manufacturing concerns,
by £ million of turnover, are:
BAT Industries 13,817
Imperial Chemical Industries
(ICI)1 12,488
British Aerospace 10,562
Grand Metropolitan 8,748
Hanson 7,691
Unilever 7,596
Ford Motor Company 7,509
BTR 6,742
General Electric Company (GEC) 6,042
Allied-Lyons 5,360
The construction industry contributed
7 per cent of GDP and employed about
1.3 million people in 1992, over 4 per cent
of the total number of employees.
1 Now split into ICI and Zeneca (see p. 160).
Total domestic fixed capital spending was
£618 million in 1992.
Sectors of Manufacturing
Relative sizes of the main sectors are shown
in Tables 13.1 and 13.2. Table 13.3 indicates
output and investment. A more detailed
description of the main sectors is given
below.
Mineral and Metal Products
Steel Products
British producers delivered 14.9 million
tonnes of finished steel in 1992, of which 51
per cent was exported. Over the past ten
years annual exports of the steel industry
have more than doubled, from around 3.5
million tonnes to nearly 8 million tonnes,
creating a favourable balance of trade in steel
products. The major areas of steel production
are in Wales and northern England, with
substantial further processing in the
Midlands. Major restructuring in the steel
industry took place during the 1980s and

early 1990s. Productivity and efficiency have
improved and the industry is now one of the
lowest cost producers in Europe. The number
of people employed in 1992 was 50,000,
compared with 90,000 in 1985.
British Steel is the fourth largest steel
company in the world, producing about three-
quarters of Britain’s crude steel. The company’s
output is based on flat steel products, plate,
heavy sections and tubes. These are used
principally in the construction, automotive,
engineering, transport, metal goods,
packaging and energy industries.
Other important steel producers in Britain
include United Engineering Steels, Allied
Steels and Wires, Co-Steel Sheerness, the
Glynwed Group and the specialist stainless
steel producer Avesta Sheffield. Products
manufactured by these companies include
wire rod, hot rolled bars, reinforcing bars for
the construction industry, engineering steels
and other special steels.
Non-ferrous Metals
Output of non-ferrous metals and their alloys
in 1992 included primary aluminium, of which
nearly 244,000 tonnes were delivered, and
secondary aluminium, of which over 252,000
tonnes were delivered. Britain produced over
42,000 tonnes of refined copper and nearly
436,000 tonnes of copper and copper alloy
semi-manufactures. Primary metal production
relies mainly on imported ores, concentrates
and partially refined metal. Recycled metal
plays an important part in raw material
supply. Nearly half of the industry is situated
in the Midlands and Wales.
Specialised Alloys
Britain is a major producer of specialised
alloys for high-technology requirements in
the aerospace, electronic, petrochemical, and
nuclear and other fuel industries. Titanium
and titanium alloys are used in aircraft
production, power generation and North Sea
oil production, and nickel alloys for aero¬
engines operating in high-temperature
environments.
In recent years considerable progress has
been made in the development of
‘superplastic’ alloys, which are more ductile
and elastic than conventional alloys.
Aluminium lithium, developed by British
Alcan Aluminium, is ideal for use in aircraft,
being lighter, stronger and more rigid than
normal aluminium.

Non-metallic mineral products
of which: glass and glassware
ceramic and heat-resistant goods
Ceramics
The ceramics industry manufactures clay
products, such as domestic pottery,
sanitaryware and tiles, and clay pipes for the
building trade. Domestic pottery production
includes the manufacture of china,
earthenware and stoneware. Tableware is
produced in Stoke-on-Trent, and Britain is
the world’s leading manufacturer and major
exporter of fine bone china.
Research is being conducted into ceramics
for use in housebuilding and diesel and jet
engines. Important industrial ceramics
invented in Britain include silicon carbides
and sialons.
Glass Products
Glass-reinforced cement composites for the
construction industry were invented in Britain
in the early 1970s and are made under licence
in over 40 countries.
Flat glass is manufactured through the
float glass process, which was developed by
Pilkington Brothers and licensed to
glassmakers throughout the world. Pilkington
has also produced an energy-saving window
glass which reflects room heat without
impairing visibility. Export sales of flat glass
principal products amounted to £106 million
in 1992. United Glass is a leading
manufacturer of bottles and other glass
containers.
China Clay
Britain is the world’s biggest exporter of
china clay (kaolin), four-fifths of which is
used in paper-making. In 1992, 2.8 million
tonnes, valued at more than £195 million,
were sold overseas. The main company
involved is ECC International, part of the
English China Clays Group.
Chemicals and Related Products
Britain’s chemicals industry is at the forefront
of modern technology, spending the
equivalent of 6 per cent of total sales on R &
D. It is the third largest chemicals industry
in Western Europe, and the fifth largest in
the Western world. The nation’s fourth
biggest manufacturing industry, it provides
direct employment for more than 290,000
people. Around a half of its production of
principal products is exported, making it
Britain’s greatest single export earner.
Exports in 1992 were worth £14,974 million,
while imports were valued at £11,618 million.
Traditionally Britain has been a major
producer of basic industrial chemicals, such
as inorganic and basic organic chemicals,
plastics and fertilisers, which together
comprise around two-fifths of output. The
most rapid growth in recent years has been in
speciality chemicals, particularly
pharmaceuticals, pesticides and cosmetics.
Many major chemical companies in Britain
are multinationals; several are subsidiaries of
overseas companies and others are specialist
manufacturers of pharmaceuticals, such as
Glaxo and Wellcome. In 1992 Imperial
Chemical Industries (ICI) was the fourth
largest chemicals company in the world, with
a range of 15,000 products. In a major
restructuring programme, ICI was demerged
into two companies in June 1993 to form
‘new’ ICI, built around industrial chemicals,
paints, materials and explosives, and a
160
MANUFACTURING AND CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRIES
separate company, Zeneca, comprising Id’s
pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals and seeds,
and specialities businesses.
Organic Chemicals
Sales of the principal products of organic
chemicals amounted to £3,644 million in
1992 and those of miscellaneous chemicals for
industrial use to £3,114 million. The most
important products sold in the organic
chemicals range are ethylene (1.9 million
tonnes produced in 1992), propylene (832,000
tonnes) and benzene (778,000 tonnes).
Inorganic Chemicals
Much of inorganic chemicals production
consists of relatively simple bulk chemicals,
such as sulphuric acid and metallic and non-
metallic oxides, serving as basic materials for
industry. Other speciality chemicals include
industrial gases, essential oils and flavourings,
adhesives and sealants, and explosives,
including those used for car safety airbags.
Investment in environmentally safe products
and processes, such as substitutes for
chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), is increasing.
Plastics
Total annual turnover of the plastics industry
is estimated at £13,000 million. In 1991
Britain consumed over 3.3 million tonnes of
plastics materials, with British producers
exporting over 1.2 million tonnes.
Around 200,000 people are employed in
the plastics industry, three-quarters working
in the processing or conversion sector. Some
4,000 firms are engaged in plastics
processing—the conversion of plastics
materials into finished, semi-finished or sub-
assemblies of final products. Production
includes housewares and semi-finished
products for the automotive, domestic
appliance, mechanical goods and business
equipment industries.
Paints
Sales of paint, varnishes and painters’ fillings
were worth £1,718 million in 1992. ICI is the
world’s largest paint manufacturer. Among
specialised products are new ranges of
synthetic resins and pigments, powder
coatings, non-drip and quick-drying paints
and paints needing only one top coat. Its
best-known consumer product is the Dulux
paint range. Two recent innovations have
been solid emulsion paint and a temporary
water-based finish which can be removed
easily by chemical treatment, for vehicle
bodies and road markings.
Pharmaceuticals
Britain is the world’s fourth biggest exporter
of medicines. This sector has some of the
world’s largest multinational research¬
intensive manufacturers, as well as medium¬
sized and smaller specialist companies. Total
sales in 1992 were around £7,300 million.
Pharmaceuticals exports, which include some
of the world’s best-selling medicines, were
valued at £2,993 million. The main markets
are Western Europe and North America, with
Japan an expanding market. The
pharmaceuticals industry’s trade surplus of
over£ 1,300 million in 1992 was the second
largest of all manufacturing sectors, and
represented an increase of 12 per cent
on 1991.

BRITAIN 1994: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Employing over 85,000 people directly,
pharmaceuticals support employment for
250,000 people in related activities. The
industry invested more than ^^450 million
in R & D in 1992. This sum amounts to
more than 14 per cent of British
manufacturing industry’s R & D and
represents about 8 per cent of total world
expenditure on medicines research. Progress
in pharmaceuticals research has helped to
reduce dramatically the impact of diseases
such as polio, diphtheria and measles.
Britain has two of the world’s top seven
pharmaceuticals groups, Glaxo and
SmithKline Beecham. In 1992 British firms
made six of the world’s 20 best-selling
medicines, including Glaxo’s ulcer treatment
Zantac, the world’s best-selling medicine, and
ICI’s (now Zeneca’s) beta-blocker Tenormin,
for treating high blood pressure. Among
Zeneca’s newer products are Zestril (for
combating high blood pressure), Zoladex (a
prostate cancer therapy) and Deprivan (an
anaesthetic).
Other recent major developments pioneered
in Britain are semi-synthetic penicillins and
cephalosporins, both powerful antibiotics, and
new treatments for asthma, arthritis, migraine
and coronary heart disease. SmithKline
Beecham, which manufactures four of the
world’s top-selling antibiotics, has developed
Augmentin, which is used to treat a range of
infections that have become resistant to
antibiotics. Glaxo’s Zofran, an anti-nausea
drug used to counter the unpleasant side-
effects of cancer treatments, is one of the
company’s most successful new medicines.
A growing trend is the production of
cheaper, unbranded (generic) drugs. The
biggest British company making these,
Medeva, is also the world’s fifth largest
vaccine maker. It develops generic medicines
by improving existing drugs or buying the
companies which make them.
Agrochemicals
A large proportion of world R & D in
agrochemicals is conducted in Britain.
Notable British discoveries include pyrethroid
insecticides, ICI’s diquat and paraquat
herbicides, systemic fungicides and aphicides,
genetically engineered microbial pesticides
and methods of encouraging natural parasites
against common pests in horticulture.
Soap and Toilet Preparations
Exports of soap and toilet preparations in
1992 were valued at £1,015 million,
compared with imports of £629 million.
Total sales amounted to £4,173 million. This
sector includes soap and synthetic detergents,
dominated by Lever Brothers (part of
Unilever) and by the US-owned Proctor and
Gamble. Boots and SmithKline Beecham are
significant producers of perfumes, cosmetics
and toilet preparations.
Biotechnology
Biotechnology includes the manufacture of
products using genetic modification. Britain
has made major advances in the development
of drugs such as human insulin and
interferons, genetically-engineered vaccines,
and in the production of antibiotics by
fermentation; alternative bacteriocidal drugs
based on Nisin, a food preservative made in
Britain; agricultural products such as
infection-resistant crops; and medical
diagnostic materials like biosensors.
Major companies, such as ICI, Wellcome,
Glaxo and SmithKline Beecham, undertake
extensive research in biotechnology. A second
generation of vaccines based on recombinant
DNA technology includes SmithKline
Beecham’s Engerix-B vaccine against
hepatitis, which more than doubled its sales
in 1992. Drugs are being developed that act
on defective genes either in the human host
or in the infecting organism.
Specialist products of Britain’s 50 small
independent biotechnology firms comprise,
among other items, medical diagnostics and
microbial pesticides. The British company
Celltech was the first licensed by the United
States Government for the large-scale
production of monoclonal antibodies, proteins
which can seek out a particular substance in
the body. They are used to diagnose diseases,
identify different blood types and can be
employed in the treatment of a range of
conditions, including cancer.
162
MANUFACTURING AND CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRIES
Britain leads in the development of
molecular graphics, which contribute to the
rational design of new and improved medicines
through a computer-aided technique for
analysing the structures of complicated
organic molecules on a visual display unit.
Fibres
The main types of synthetic fibre are still
those first developed: regenerated cellulosic
fibres such as viscose, and the major synthetic
fibres like nylon polyamide, polyester and
acrylics. Extensive research continues to
produce a wide variety of innovative products
with characteristics designed to meet market
needs; antistatic and flame-retardant fibres are
examples. More specialist products include the
aramids (with very high thermal stability and
strength), elastanes (giving very high stretch
and recovery) and melded fabrics (produced
without the need for knitting or weaving).
Britain’s second biggest chemicals
company, Courtaulds, has developed a new,
solvent-spun, biodegradable fibre, Tencel,
which is twice as strong as cotton while being
soft enough to be used by designers of luxury
garments. Id’s Tactel, a fine nylon micro-
fibre originally used to make sportswear, is
now being used by the fashion industry and
accounts for around 35 per cent of the
company’s fibre output by value.
Mechanical Engineering and Metal
Goods
Exports of mechanical machinery represented
13 per cent of total visible exports in 1992.
Output includes pressure vessels, heat
exchangers and storage tanks for chemical
and oil-refining (process) plant, steam¬
raising boilers (including those for power
stations), nuclear reactors, water and
sewage treatment plant, and fabricated
steelwork for bridges, buildings and
industrial installations.
Agricultural Machinery
Britain is among the Western world’s major
producers of tractors, which make up over
three-quarters of the country’s total output
of agricultural equipment. Sales of the
principal products of the tractor industry
were ^1,041 million in 1992, of which
about two-thirds were accounted for by
overseas sales. Widely used technical
innovations include computer-controlled
tractors, a highly efficient pesticide sprayer
and combined mower/conditioners that
significantly reduce the drying time for
grass. Much of the new machinery is
designed for use in a variety of conditions
to meet the needs of overseas farmers. The
Royal International Agricultural Exhibition,
held annually near Coventry, has a
specialised tropical machinery centre, where
demonstrations of such machinery are
given.
Machine Tools
Britain is the world’s seventh largest
producer of machine tools. Almost all are

purchased by the engineering, vehicles and
metal goods industries. Total sales reached
£2,228 million in 1991, of which over a
third were exports. British manufacturers
have made technological advances in probes,
sensors, co-ordinate measuring devices, laser
melting and the installation of flexible
manufacturing systems. Computer
numerical-controlled machines account for
an increasing proportion of output.
Textile Machinery
Most sales of textile machinery are to export
markets. British innovations include
computerised colour matching and weave
simulation, friction spinning, high-speed
computer-controlled knitting machines and
electronic jacquard attachments for weaving
looms.
Mining and Tunnelling Equipment
Sales of mining machinery and tunnelling
equipment are substantial. Britain’s mining
equipment industry leads in the production
of coal-cutting and road-heading (shearing)
equipment, hydraulic roof supports,
conveying equipment, flameproof
transformers, switchgear, and subsurface
transport equipment and control systems.
J.C. Bamford is the world’s leading
manufacturer of backhoe loaders and
telescopic handlers.
Other Equipment
The mechanical handling equipment
industry produces cranes and transporters,
lifting devices, escalators, conveyors,
powered industrial trucks and air bridges, as
well as electronically controlled and
automatic handling systems. Britain is also a
major producer of industrial engines, pumps,
valves and compressors, and of pneumatic
and hydraulic equipment. Companies like
Babcock manufacture steam generators and
other heavy equipment for power plants.
Despite an overall decline in the castings
industry, some foundries have been investing
in new melting, moulding and quality
control equipment.
Electrical, Electronic and Instrument
Engineering
Britain has the fourth largest electronics
industry in the world, accounting for around
10 per cent of visible exports.
Electrical Engineering and Electrical and
Electronic Appliances
Making extensive use of the most advanced
technologies, the electrical engineering
industry manufactures products for the
electricity supply sector, including power
plant, cable transformers and switchgear, and
lighting, plugs and sockets. The domestic
electrical appliance sector is dominated by a
few large firms.
The major electronic consumer goods
produced are radio and television sets, and
high-fidelity audio and video equipment.
Several Japanese companies have established
manufacturing bases in Wales, making
television sets, video recorders and compact
disc players. In the audio field British
manufacturers have a reputation for high-
quality goods, but are less strong in the mass
market.
Computers
This sector produces an extensive range of
systems, central processors and peripheral
equipment, from large computers for large-
scale data-processing and scientific work to
mini- and microcomputers for control and
automation systems and for home,
educational and office use.
Britain makes 40 per cent of Europe’s
desktop computers. Nearly half of Britain’s
computers and peripheral equipment
intended for export are made in Scotland.
Several leading overseas manufacturers of
data-processing equipment—for example,
IBM, Unisys and Compaq—have established
manufacturing plants in Britain. Britain’s
biggest computer manufacturer is the largely
Japanese-owned ICL. Other companies, such
as Psion, have concentrated on developing
new products for specialised markets. These
include hand-held, pocket-sized computers,
increasingly used by company sales forces,
164
MANUFACTURING AND CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRIES
and notebook and pen computers.
British firms make communications
software for portable and mainframe
computers. The world’s first modem
(computer telephone link) for portable
computers was designed in Britain. Psion is a
pioneer of the ‘palmtop’ computer, which has
the equivalent power of a desktop machine. A
Scottish firm, Calluna, has designed an
extremely small disc drive for use in
notebook-sized computers.
British firms and research organisations,
with government support, have been involved
in the development and application of the
family of ‘three-five’ semiconductor materials,
such as gallium arsenide; these are used in a
number of microwave devices and in the
production of much faster-working
computers. The Trax, a novel design of
supercomputer processor with a wide range
of applications, including high-definition
television and defence systems, was originally
developed at Brunei University, near
London. Advances are being made by British
firms in ‘virtual reality’ (VR) technology, an
advanced simulation technique. It is being
used to design buildings and a range of
products, including cars, pharmaceuticals and
machine tools.
Communications Equipment
Britain’s main communications products are
switching and transmission equipment,
telephones and terminals. Mercury
Communications is licensed to compete with
BT in the provision of network services,
while the market for terminals and telephones
has been fully liberalised. This has led to
increased demand from BT and Mercury for
new equipment and services.
Innovative work is being stimulated by the
expansion of cable television and the growth
in value added network services. There has
been rapid expansion in the market for
cellular telephones since the second half of
the 1980s.
Transmission equipment and cables for
telecommunications and information networks
include submarine and high-specification
data-carrying cables. Supported by a
technically advanced cable industry, BT has
led in the development of optical fibre
communications systems and has paved the
way for simpler and cheaper optical cables by
laying the first non-repeatered cable over
100 km (62 miles) long, and by developing
the first all-optical repeater.
More than half of the world’s undersea
communications cables have been made and
laid by STC Submarine Systems, which, with
its United States and French partners,
completed the laying of the first transatlantic
optical fibre cable in 1988. Now part of
Canada’s Northern Telecom, STC is building
the first fibre-optic cable linking Canada and
Europe. The cable, which will be made in
Britain and the United States, will carry up
to 30,000 telephone calls simultaneously down
each of two pairs of optical fibres.
Britain also has a world lead in the
transmission of computerised data along
telephone lines for reproduction on television
screens.
Another sector of the industry
manufactures radio communications
equipment, radar, radio and sonar
navigational aids for ships and aircraft,
thermal imaging systems, alarms and
signalling equipment, public broadcasting
equipment and other capital goods. Radar was
invented in Britain and British firms are still

in the forefront of technical advances. Racal
Avionics’ X-band radar for aircraft ground
movement control is in use at airports in
several countries. Solid-state secondary
surveillance radar, manufactured by Cossor
Electronics, is being supplied to 50 overseas
civil aviation operators. Cable and Wireless’s
submarine cable-laying robot ‘CIRRUS’,
which can work at depths of up to 1 km
(3,280 ft), is controlled entirely by a
computer on its mother ship.
Medical and Other Electronic Equipment
A range of electronic measurement and test
equipment is made in Britain, as well as
analytical instruments, process control
equipment, and numerical control and
indication equipment for use in machine
tools. Companies such as GEC and Oxford
Instruments produce advanced electronic
medical equipment, like ultrasound scanners,
electromyography systems and patient
monitoring systems for intensive and
coronary care and other uses. Britain
pioneered the development of magnetic
resonance imaging.
The indigenous electronics components
industry is supplemented by subsidiaries of
several leading overseas companies. An area
of very rapid change in which Britain is
particularly strong is the manufacture of
advanced components, such as integrated
circuits.
Instrument Engineering
The instrument engineering industry makes
measuring, photographic, cinematographic
and reprographic equipment; watches, clocks
and other timing devices; and medical and
surgical instruments.
Motor Vehicles and Other Transport
Equipment (excluding Aerospace)
Some 1.8 million new cars and commercial
vehicles were sold in 1992. Production has
recently recovered following the recession,
although sales of new cars were 31 per cent
below the 1989 peak of 2.3 million. Car
output is dominated by seven groups,
accounting for 99 per cent of the total:
Rover, Ford (including Jaguar), Vauxhall,
Peugeot-Talbot, Honda, Nissan and Toyota.
The remainder is in the hands of smaller,
specialist producers such as Rolls-Royce,
whose cars are renowned for their quality and
durability. Rover’s production includes the
successful Land Rover four-wheel drive
vehicle and the new 600 range of family cars,
launched in April 1993. Some 584,000
passenger cars valued at 3£4>060 million were
exported in 1992.
A period of major change has accompanied
the arrival of the three major Japanese
manufacturers—Nissan, Toyota and Honda—
which have invested in projects worth some
£2,100 million. The established motor vehicle
manufacturers are restructuring as a result.
Japanese inward investment has introduced
new management and production methods
into the sector.
The motor components industry consists
of over 2,000 companies, such as GKN,
Lucas and Bosch, and is ranked as one of the
most important industries in Britain.
Demand for pedal cycles at home and
abroad continues to rise significantly. Raleigh
is the leading bicycle manufacturer.
Shipbuilding and Marine Engineering
Britain has a long tradition of shipbuilding
and remains active in the construction,

conversion and repair of merchant vessels,
warships and offshore structures. The largest
sector is the building of warships. In addition
to meeting all the needs of the Royal Navy,
the warship yards build and convert ships for
overseas governments.
The Shipbuilders and Ship Repairers’
Association estimates that orders taken by
British merchant shipbuilders for the
construction of vessels were worth around
3^250 million in 1992. The marine equipment
industry is a major contributor to the
shipbuilding sector, as equipment installed in
a ship’s hull accounts for some 70 per cent of
its cost. It offers a complete range of
products, from engines to sophisticated
navigational systems, around 70 per cent of
which is exported to shipbuilders and ship-
repairers overseas.
More than two decades of oil and gas
exploitation in the North Sea have generated
a major offshore industry (see p. 209).
Shipbuilders and fabricators build fixed
platforms and semi-submersible units for
drilling, production and emergency/
maintenance support, drill ships, jack-up rigs,
modules and offshore loading systems.
Several thousand manufacturing and service
industry firms supply goods and services,
including consultancy, design, project
management, and R & D to the offshore
industry. Their experience of North Sea
projects has enabled them to establish
themselves in oil and gas markets throughout
the world.
Aerospace
Britain’s aerospace industry is the third
largest in the world, after the United States
and France. With some 200 member
companies of the Society of British Aerospace
Companies (SBAC) employing around
148,000 people, it had a turnover in 1992 of
about £11,000 million. Exports totalled
£7,700 million and contributed £2,500
million in net terms to the balance of
payments. Aircraft and parts account for
around three-fifths of overseas sales, with
engines and parts, and aerospace equipment
making up the rest. The impact of recession
on the civil aerospace market and reductions
in defence orders have led to further
rationalisation and consolidation of the
aerospace industry.
The industry’s activities cover designing
and constructing airframes, aero-engines,
guided weapons, simulators and space
satellites, together with a full range of flight
systems, particularly avionics and complex
components, and associated services. To
improve fuel economy, engine and airframe
manufacturers use lighter materials such as
titanium and carbon-fibre composites,
combined with improved aerodynamic
techniques.
Civil Aircraft
As the leading British exporter of
manufactured goods, British Aerospace (BAe)
produces both civil and military aircraft, as
well as satellites, space systems, guided
weapons and components. Civil aircraft
include the 146 family of regional quiet-jet
airliners; the 64-seat Jetstream ATP
(advanced turboprop) airliner, being
developed as the 70-seat Jetstream 61; the 19-
seat Jetstream 31 and 29-seat Jetstream 41
regional airliners; and the 125—the world’s
best-selling medium-sized business jet.
Collaborative development of civil and
military aircraft is increasing to save on costs
of new production programmes. BAe has a 20
per cent share of the European consortium
Airbus Industrie, which had sold over 1,800
aircraft by the end of 1992. BAe designs and
supplies the wings for all Airbus airliners.
Four types are in production: the A310 and
A300 medium to long-range airliners, the
long-range, four-engine A340 and the short-
to medium-haul A320, the first civil airliner
to be fitted with ‘fly-by-wire’ controls. Two
further aircraft—the A321 and A330—are
under development; both are undergoing
flight test programmes. Together with other
international aerospace organisations, BAe is
studying the feasibility of developing a
successor to the Concorde supersonic airliner,
and an ultra high-capacity aircraft.
Short Brothers of Belfast is engaged in the
production of civil aircraft, advanced nacelle
(engine casings) systems and components for
aerospace manufacturers. It designs and
167
BRITAIN 1994: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
builds the wings for the Fokker 100 jetliner
and is a partner in manufacturing the 50-seat
Canadair Regional Jet airliner, and the
recently launched Lear Jet 45, a medium¬
sized business jet aircraft.
Military Aircraft and Missiles
British Aerospace is among the world’s top
three defence companies. More than three-
quarters of its military production was
exported in 1992. It includes the Harrier, a
unique vertical/short take-off and landing
(V/STOL) military combat aircraft. Sea
Harriers are supplied to the Royal Navy and,
in association with McDonnell Douglas in the
United States, BAe has developed the
improved Harrier II. BAe also produces the
Hawk fast-jet trainer and, with McDonnell
Douglas, the Goshawk T45 carrier jet trainer.
It has a 33 per cent share in the development
of the next-generation European Fighter
Aircraft (EFA), now known as Eurofighter
2000, with adapted design—a co-operative
venture between Britain, Germany, Italy and
Spain.
The Tornado combat aircraft is built by a
company set up jointly by BAe, Alenia of
Italy and Deutsche Aerospace. A £5,000
million order for 48 Tornado bombers was
placed in 1992 by Saudi Arabia, making it
one of Britain’s biggest ever export deals. A
small Yorkshire company, Slingsby Aviation,
makes the T67 Firefly trainer aircraft. It has
been chosen by the United States Air Force
as its new basic trainer for pilots and is in
service in ten other countries. Slingsby also
designs and makes aerospace components and
parts for airships.
BAe and Shorts are major suppliers of
tactical guided weapon systems for use on
land, at sea and in the air.
Helicopters
In addition to producing aerospace
equipment, Westland manufactures the Sea
King and Lynx military helicopters. In
collaboration with Agusta of Italy, it is
developing the multi-role EH101 three-
engine helicopter, which will be delivered to
the Royal Navy and the Italian Navy by the
mid-1990s. The company is a leading
manufacturer of composite helicopter blades.
Aero-engines
Rolls-Royce is one of the world’s three major
manufacturers of aero-engines, with a
turnover in 1992 of £3,562 million and an
order book worth £6,700 million. The
company’s civil engine group produces
engines for airliners and executive and
corporate jets. Rolls-Royce RB211-535
engines have been selected by 80 per cent of
airlines using Boeing 757 airliners. The
RB211-524G and RB211-524H engines,
which power Boeing 747-400 airliners, give
improved thrust and fuel efficiency. The
company’s Tay engines are in service on the
Gulfstream IV and Fokker 100 airliners, and
are available as replacement engines for older
aircraft.
The Trent engine, currently under
development, will be Rolls-Royce’s
largest to date, providing improved
fuel efficiency and lower maintenance
costs. It will power the new generation
of large airliners, such as the Airbus
A330 and Boeing 777, entering service
in 1995.
Rolls-Royce is a partner in the five-nation
International Aero Engine consortium, which
produces the low-pollution V2500 aero¬
engine, now in service on some versions of
the Airbus A320.
The military engine group of Rolls-Royce
produces engines for both aircraft and
helicopters, and is a partner in the EJ200
engine project for the Eurofighter 2000. The
company also produces gas turbines for
power generation and for oil and gas
pumping, gas turbines for 25 of the world’s
navies, and propulsion systems for the Royal
Navy’s nuclear-powered submarines.
Aviation Equipment
Around one-third of the aerospace industry is
devoted to designing and manufacturing
aviation equipment. British firms have made
significant technological advances.
168
MANUFACTURING AND CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRIES
Manufacturers provide essential systems for
engines and aircraft, including navigation and
landing systems, engine and flight controls,
electrical generation, mechanical and
hydraulic power systems, cabin furnishings,
flight-deck control and information displays,
including head-up display (HUD), of which
GEC Avionics is the world’s largest
manufacturer. Numerous other companies
supply components, sub-assemblies and spare
parts. Consortia are being formed with other
European companies to reduce costs on long¬
term projects.
British firms have made important
advances in developing ejection seats,
firefighting equipment and flight simulators,
as well as fly-by-wire and fly-by-light
technology, where control surfaces are moved
by means of automatic electronic signalling
and fibre optics respectively, rather than by
mechanical means. Fly-by-wire is being used
on the Airbus A320 and A330/A340.
Britain’s aerospace companies provide radar
and air traffic control equipment and ground
power supplies to airports and airlines
worldwide. A consortium including Siemens
Plessey Radar and Logica has won a £130
million contract to equip a new air traffic
control centre at Farnham, Hampshire.
Hovercraft
Britain pioneered the development of
hovercraft and is a world leader in their
technology and production. Westland
Aerospace hovercraft range from large
commercial craft to smaller, 10-passenger
craft. Slingsby Aviation builds amphibious
hovercraft for passenger transport, cargo,
ambulance and rescue, and surveying.
Satellite Equipment
Over 400 companies in Britain are involved
in space activities. The industry is strong in
the manufacture of satellites, in
manufacturing ground infrastructure for
satellite systems and in the analysis and
exploitation of data from satellites. British
Aerospace Space Systems is one of Europe’s
leading producers of communications
satellites. It was the prime contractor for all
such satellites built for the European Space
Agency (ESA), and for the Marecs and
Inmarsat-2 series of maritime
communications satellites. It built payload
pallets for the United States Space Shuttle
and supplies SPELDA, a structure that
enables the ESA’s Ariane 4 launcher to carry
two spacecraft on the same mission. It was
also involved in developing and producing
the Intelsat III, IV and V series of satellites,
and is a subcontractor for the Intelsat VI
satellites launched from the Space Shuttle. It
supplied equipment for the ESA Ulysses
satellite mission to Jupiter and the Sun, and
for the Hubble Space Telescope. Work is
now in progress on ESA’s latest Cluster and
SOHO scientific spacecraft and BAe is acting
as prime contractor for the European Polar
Platform, the first of ESA’s new generation
of environmental monitoring missions due for
launching in 1998.
Matra-Marconi Space (UK) has
acted as principal contractor on many
telecommunications payloads, for example,
for ESA. In addition, it was prime contractor
for the principal radar instrument on the
ESA’s European Remote Sensing Satellites
ERS-1 and ERS-2, and is prime contractor
for an advanced synthetic aperture radar for
ESA’s ENVISAT-1 mission.
A new Earth Observation Data Centre was
built by a consortium led by BAe to process
data from ERS-1 and other satellites, and to
develop the market for earth observation data.
GEC Ferranti Defence Systems produces the
inertial guidance system for the European
Ariane launcher and Pilkington Space
Technology is the world’s leading producer
of solar cell coverglasses for satellites. Several
companies, such as Logica, Data Sciences,
EOS and Cray Electronics, are involved in
processing earth observation data, and a wide
range of smaller companies specialise in its
interpretation.
Food, Drink and Tobacco
Britain has a large food and drink
manufacturing industry, which has accounted
for a growing proportion of total domestic
food supply in recent decades. The industry’s
interests are represented by the Food and
169
BRITAIN 1994: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Drink Federation (FDF) and several sector
associations. In recent years, major British
food manufacturers have increased their
productivity and are planning further
restructuring, in particular to take advantage
of the single European market.
Convenience foods (particularly frozen
foods and ready-cooked meals, annual sales of
which now stand at approximately £4,400
million and £600 million respectively),
yoghurts, other dairy desserts and instant
snacks have formed the fastest-growing sector
of the food market in recent years. The
market in health and slimming foods also
continues to expand. Companies have
introduced new low-fat and fat-free spreads
and ice creams to meet consumer demand.
Dairy Products
Nearly 60 per cent of households in Britain
receive milk through a doorstep delivery
system employing about 32,000 people.
Domestic milk consumption per head—
2.23 litres (3.93 pints) per week in 1992—is
among the highest in the world. Consumption
of skimmed and semi-skimmed milk
continues to rise as people seek to reduce the
fat content in their diet.
The main milk products are butter, cheese,
condensed milk and dried whole and
skimmed milk. The British dairy industry
accounted for 67 per cent of butter supplies
to the domestic market in 1991 and 73 per
cent of cheese supplies. Butter exports in 1992
were worth £96 million. The other main
exports are skimmed milk powder and whole
milk powder, worth £187 million in total.
Bread
About 75 per cent of bread is manufactured
in large bakeries; the total bread market is
worth some £3,000 million a year. A
dramatic increase in the number of varieties
available and greater demand for ‘wholemeal’
bread have stabilised consumption. Biscuit
exports were valued at £216 million in 1992.
Drink
Of major significance among the alcoholic
drinks produced in Britain is Scotch whisky,
which is one of Britain’s top five export
earners. There are 110 distilleries in
Scotland, where the best known brands of
blended Scotch whisky, such as J & B,
Johnnie Walker, Famous Grouse and
Teachers, are made from the products of
single malt and single grain whisky
distilleries. Some 85 per cent of Scotch
whisky is exported, to 190 countries. The
value of whisky exports was over £1,958
million in 1992, Europe taking 40 per cent
and the United States about 17 per cent by
volume.
In 1992 purchases of beer in Britain were
valued at £13,539 million, about 3.5 per cent
of consumers’ expenditure and a rise of 5 per
cent compared with 1991.
The brewing industry has six major
national brewery groups, and 160 regional
and local brewers. British malt, which is
made almost entirely from home-grown
barley, is used by brewers throughout the
world. Demand for traditional cask-
conditioned ales (‘real ale’), which fell in the

1970s, is rising, while lager now accounts for
just over half of all beer sales. Cider is made
primarily in south-west England. Wine is
mainly produced in parts of southern England.
The soft drinks industry—comprising still
and carbonated drinks, concentrates, squashes,
cordials, frozen drinks, fruit juices, natural
mineral and bottled waters—is the fastest
growing sector of the grocery business, with
an annual turnover of about £5,500 million.
Tobacco
The British tobacco industry manufactures 99
per cent of cigarettes and tobacco goods sold
in Britain. Almost all domestic output is
provided by three major manufacturers
(Imperial Tobacco, Gallaher and Carreras
Rothmans). The industry specialises in the
production of high-quality cigarettes made
from flue-cured tobacco and achieves
significant exports. Europe, the Middle East
and Africa are important markets.
Textiles and Clothing
These products make a substantial
contribution to the British economy in
terms of employment, exports and turnover.
Together with the footwear and leather
industries, they employ around 400,000
people, equal to nearly 9 per cent of
manufacturing employment. For textiles,
there is a high degree of regional
concentration. Particularly important areas are
the North West, West Yorkshire (mainly
wool), the East Midlands (knitwear), Scotland
and Northern Ireland.
Most of the clothing industry is widely
scattered throughout the country, although
there are significant concentrations in cities
such as Manchester, Leicester and London.
The industries’ main products are yarn,
woven and knitted fabrics, apparel, industrial
and household textiles, and carpets based
mainly on wool, cotton and synthetic fibres.
The textile and clothing industry has
around 15,000 firms, comprising a few large
multi-process companies and two of the
world’s largest firms—Coats Viyella and
Courtaulds Textiles—as well as a large
number of small and medium-sized firms.
Increased investment in new machinery
and greater attention to design, training and
marketing have helped the industry to raise
competitiveness. New technologies, largely
designed to improve response times and give
greater flexibility in production, are being
used throughout the industry.
The Multi-Fibre Arrangement (MFA) of
the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade
(GATT—see p. 201) allows a measure of
restraint on imports into the European
Community of textiles and clothing from
low-cost countries.
Wool
Britain’s wool textile industry is one of the
largest in the world, with two main branches
making woollen and worsted. In the past few
years the industry’s export earnings have
been significant, wool worsted export values
totalling more than £500 million in 1992.
Synthetic fibre is sometimes blended with
wool. West Yorkshire is the main producing

area, but Scotland is also famous as a
specialised producer of high-quality yarns,
tweeds and cloth. Substantial quantities of
raw wool are scoured and cleaned in Britain
in preparation for spinning. British mills also
process the bulk of rare fibres such as
cashmere. Sales of the woollen and worsted
industry amounted to almost £1,300 million
in 1992.
Cotton
Low-cost competition has cut progressively
into British markets for cotton and allied
products. Production includes yarn and
fabrics of cotton, synthetic fibres and cotton-
synthetic mixes, with large-scale dyeing and
printing of cotton and synthetic fibre fabric.
The linen industry is centred in Northern
Ireland.
Carpets
Over half the value of carpet and rug output
is made up of tufted carpets. Woven carpets,
mainly Axminster, account for most of the
remaining sales. There is a higher wool
content in woven types, although in these,
too, considerable use is being made of
synthetic fibres. The high quality and variety
of design make Britain one of the world’s
leading producers of woven carpets.
Industrial textiles account for an
increasing proportion of the industry’s
output, covering products such as conveyor
belting and geotextiles used in civil
engineering projects. Many of these are non-
woven, made of fibres assembled using
advanced techniques. Synthetic
polypropylene yarn is used in the
manufacture of carpet backing and ropes, and
woven into fabrics for a wide range of
applications in the packaging, upholstery,
building and motor vehicle industries.
Clothing and Footwear
The clothing industry is labour intensive,
involving about 5,000 companies. While a
broad range of clothing is imported from the
rest of Europe and Asia, British industry
supplies over half of domestic demand.
Exports have risen since the British fashion
designer industry regained prominence during
the 1980s and traditional British tailoring
enables clothing companies such as Burberry’s
to compete overseas. The hosiery and knitwear
industry comprises about 1,500 companies,
mainly in the East Midlands and Scotland.
The footwear manufacturing industry is
made up predominantly of small companies,
increasingly under pressure from cheap
imports.
Other Manufacturing
Wood and Paper
Over 14,000 companies in the wooden and
upholstered furniture industry supply
domestic, contract and institutional markets.
Domestic production of wood for industrial
use has been steadily increasing.
There were 106 paper and board mills
employing 28,000 people in 1992. Among the
largest British groups are Arjo Wiggins
Appleton, St Regis and BPB Paper and
Packaging. Over the past decade, inward
investment has transformed the paper and
board industry. Production has been
concentrated in large-scale units to compete
more effectively within the single European
market. Between 1984 and 1992 output
increased by 43 per cent. Over half the
industry is made up of forestry product
companies from Scandinavia, North America,
Australia and elsewhere. There has been a
significant trend towards waste-based
packaging grades in order to reduce the
industry’s reliance on imported woodpulp
supplies. Usage of recycled waste paper is
increasing and research is helping to extend
it. In 1992 the total amount of waste paper
used in British newspapers accounted for
nearly 27 per cent of the total newsprint
consumed. Waste paper provides over half of
the industry’s fibre needs. In 1992
domestically produced wood pulp represented
11 per cent of fibrous raw material input.
Publishing
Total employment in the paper, printing and
publishing industries in June 1993 was
172
MANUFACTURING AND CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRIES
440,000. Most of the printing and publishing
industry’s employment and output is
concentrated in firms based in south-east
England. Mergers have led to the formation
of large groups in newspaper, magazine and
book publishing. Reed Elsevier, one of the
world’s biggest publishing businesses,
resulted from a merger between Reed
International and the Dutch company
Elsevier in 1993.
Printing, engraving, bookbinding and
specialist publishing activities still involve
many small firms, now often using new
technology such as desktop publishing. The
book-publishing industry is a major exporter,
selling one-third of production in overseas
markets. Security printers (of, for example,
banknotes and postage stamps) are
important exporters, the major company
being De La Rue.
Rubber
Rubber tyres and inner tubes sold by British
manufacturers in 1991 were valued at
£1,315 million, about half of which went
overseas. Other important rubber goods are
vehicle components and accessories,
conveyor belting, cables, hoses, latex foam
products, and footwear, gloves and clothing.
Tyre manufacturers include subsidiaries of
United States and other overseas companies.
The industry’s consumption of rubber
comprises natural, synthetic and recycled
rubber.
Toys, games and sports equipment are
established in export markets, while jewellery,
gold and silverware and the refining of
precious metals are industries maintaining a
strong craft tradition.
Construction
Construction work is carried out mainly by
private contractors but also by public
authorities employing their own labour.
From 1990 the industry was in recession,
with employment falling from 1.7 million to
1.3 million in 1992. However, in 1993 there
were signs of recovery in the construction
industry.
Most work is done by private firms, 98
per cent of which employ fewer than 25
people. While only 95 out of a total of
206,000 firms employ more than 600 people
directly, these companies undertake about
one-fifth of all construction in Britain. Some
of the larger firms own quarries and factories
for materials manufacture, and sophisticated
plant. Some firms undertake responsibility for
all stages of projects from initial design to
finished building. Efficiency and
productivity in construction have benefited
from greater off-site fabrication of
standardised components and from
computerised techniques such as electronic
load safety measures for cranes, distance
measuring equipment, computerised stock
ordering and job costing, and computer-aided
design.
Building Materials and Products
A vast range of products is used in the
construction process, from glass and bricks to
tiles and bathroom fittings. These materials
are estimated to make up around 40 per cent
of the value of construction output. In 1992
sales of construction materials were around
£18,000 million, with exports amounting to
£2,300 million.

Aggregates, Bricks and Cement
The aggregates industry quarried around 255
million tonnes of crushed rock, sand and
gravel in 1991, of which 235 million tonnes
were used in construction. The brick
industry, one of Britain’s oldest, is regarded
as the world’s most technically advanced. In
the late 1980s over £300 million was invested
in improving production of bricks, which
now stands at a capacity of 4,000 million a
year. Portland cement, a 19th-century British
innovation, is the most widely used chemical
compound in the world.
Glass and Windows
Britain is a world leader in the manufacture
of glass used in windows, doors and cladding.
Pilkington developed the float process for
manufacturing distortion-free flat glass
(see p. 160), which is licensed throughout the
world. Substantially more energy efficient,
flat glass is increasingly used to allow more
light into buildings and to provide insulation
against heat loss in winter. The manufacture
and supply of windows and doors is carried
out by a large number of companies operating
in one of three distinct product sectors—
timber, metal (aluminium and steel) and
UPVC.
Project Procurement, Management and
Financing
The common basis of procurement is a lump¬
sum contract with provision for variation.
The largest projects are often carried out
under the direction of construction managers
or management contractors. Clients generally
employ architects, project managers or civil
engineers to advise on the feasibility of
projects, draw up plans and inspect and
supervise the construction work.
Private and public sector projects are
managed in a variety of ways. Most clients
invite construction firms to bid for work by
competitive tender, having used the design
services of a consultant. The successful
contractor will then undertake on-site work
with a number of specialist sub-contractors.
However, alternative methods of contracting
are becoming more common. For example,
contracts might include subsequent provision
of building maintenance or a comprehensive
‘design-and-build’ service, where a single
company accepts responsibility for every stage
of a project.
The Government provides substantial
work for the construction industry. Recently,
a number of schemes have been built and
paid for by private consortia, which then
charge the public for their use for a fixed
period of time before transferring ownership
back to the public sector; these are known as
‘BOOT’ (‘Build, Own, Operate and
Transfer’) schemes. One example is the toll
bridge over the River Thames at Dartford,
Kent (see p. 248).
Major Construction Projects in Britain
The most important recent construction
project is the Channel Tunnel, the largest
single civil engineering project ever
undertaken in Europe (see p. 255). Nearing
completion, its estimated cost is over £8,000
million. Building work was carried out by a
consortium of ten French and British
contractors working together as Transmanche
Link (TML). The Tunnel is nearly 50 km
(31 miles) long and is 70 m (230ft) below sea
level at its deepest. Associated projects
include a new international station at
Waterloo in London and an international
terminal at Folkestone.
Other major building projects in hand or
recently completed are the M25 motorway
widening scheme; the A55 Conwy Tunnel in
Wales; the extensive development in
London’s Docklands (including the
Limehouse link road); and the Sizewell B
nuclear power station in Suffolk. Expansion
of Britain’s road network covers over 270 km
(170 miles) of new motorway. Both Stansted
and Manchester airports have been
substantially redeveloped. There has also
been large-scale redevelopment of sports
stadiums, including Twickenham and
Murrayfield (in Edinburgh) rugby grounds,
and Manchester United and Arsenal football
grounds. A £15 million stadium for the
ground at Millwall in south-east London,
completed in 1993, was the first major new
174
MANUFACTURING AND CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRIES
stadium to be built in Britain since the end
of the Second World War.
Housing
During 1992 a total of around 155,900
dwellings were started in Great Britain,
slightly fewer than in 1991. Starts by private
enterprise were 120,200, by housing
associations 33,200 and in the public sector
2,600. Some 169,500 dwellings were
completed: 140,000 by the private sector,
25,000 by housing associations and 4,600 by
the public sector. The total value of new
housing orders was £5,262 million.
Building Regulations
The Department of the Environment’s
building regulations prescribe minimum
standards of construction in England and
Wales. Administered and enforced by local
government, the regulations apply to new
building, the installation or replacement of
fittings, and alterations and extensions to
existing buildings. New regulations came into
force in 1992. There are similar controls in
Scotland and Northern Ireland. An
alternative to local authority building control
was introduced in 1984; under this there is a
system of private certification of compliance
with building regulations. The British
Standards Institution is making Britain’s
contribution to the drafting of European
standards, which are increasingly replacing
national construction standards.
Research and Advisory Services
The Government’s research and advisory
body on construction is the Building
Research Establishment. It has four
laboratories, including a fire research station,
and is the site of a building energy
management systems centre. It has links with
most major overseas research and technical
organisations in the field and has a key role
in developing European codes and standards.
Major construction and materials firms,
universities, colleges and research
associations, as well as the British Board of
Agrement, carry out research and provide
advisory services. The Building Centre
provides exhibition and information services
on materials, products, techniques and
building services.
Overseas Contracting and Consultancy
British companies are involved in many
major projects throughout the world and have
been in the forefront of innovative methods
of management contracting and construction
management. Contractors undertake the
supervision and all or part of the
construction of a project. Consultants are
involved in the planning and design of
construction projects. British contractors and
consultants have long enjoyed a worldwide
reputation for their integrity and
independence.
Contracting
British contractors are currently undertaking,
or have recently completed, work in 112
overseas countries and have a permanent
presence in 74. Important international
contracts won in 1992-93 included:
• management contracts for the
EuroDisney Theme Park, near Paris
(£1,000 million) and the 1996 Olympics
in Atlanta, United States (£250 million);
• Tsing Ma Bridge in Hong Kong
(£583 million);
• a hydro-electric project in Malaysia
(£400 million);
• a light railway transit system in Kuala
Lumpur (£300 million); and
• site preparation for the new Hong Kong
airport (£100 million).
Consultancy
In 1992 members of the Association of
Consulting Engineers were involved in new
work overseas valued at almost £28,000
million. The capital value of projects under
way at the end of 1992 or completed during
the year was almost £60,000 million. British
consulting engineers had estimated gross
earnings in 1992 of £625 million from
175
BRITAIN 1994: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
overseas commissions. The three largest
categories of work covered roads, bridges and
tunnels; airports; and water supply. The
largest markets were the Far East, Africa,
India and the Middle East. Major
international projects include:
• Bangkok Elevated Transport System
(£10,000 million);
• Hong Kong International Airport
(£4,000 million); and
• thermal power stations in China
(£2,500 million).

14 Finance and Other
Service Industries
Introduction 177 Other Services 190
Financial Services 178
The service industries, which include finance, retailing, tourism and business
services, contribute about 65 per cent of gross domestic product and over
70 per cent of employment. Britain is responsible for some 10 per cent of the
world’s exports of services: overseas earnings from services amounted to
30 per cent of the value of exports of manufactures in 1992. The number of
employees in services rose from over 13 million in 1982 to 15.5 million by the
end of 1992, much of the rise being accounted for by growth in part-time
(principally female) employment.
INTRODUCTION
Average real disposable income per head
increased by nearly three-quarters between
1971 and 1990 and this was reflected in a rise
in consumer spending on financial, personal
and leisure services and on the maintenance
and repair of consumer durables. Demand for
British travel, hotel and catering services rose
as real incomes in Britain and other countries
increased. The spread of home ownership,
particularly during the 1980s, increased
demand for legal and estate agency services.
Britain is a major financial centre, housing
some of the world’s leading banking,
insurance, securities, shipping, commodities,
futures, and other financial services and
markets. Financial services are an important
source of employment and overseas earnings.
Business services include advertising, market
research, management consultancy, exhibition
and conference facilities, computing services
and auction houses.
By the year 2000, tourism is expected to
be the world’s biggest industry, and Britain is
one of the world’s leading tourist
destinations. The industry is Britain’s second
largest, employing nearly 7 per cent of the
workforce. Retailing is also a major employer
and Britain has an advanced distribution
network. An important trend in retailing is
the growth of out-of-town shopping centres.
The computing services industry continues
to be one of the fastest-growing sectors of the
economy, and information technology is
widely used in retailing and financial services.
A notable trend in the services sector is
the growth of franchising, an operation in
which a company owning the rights to a
particular form of trading licenses them to
franchisees, usually by means of an initial
payment with continuing royalties. The main
areas include cleaning services, film
processing, print shops, hairdressing and
cosmetics, fitness centres, courier delivery,
car rental, engine tuning and servicing, and
fast food retailing. It is estimated that
franchising’s share of total retail sales is over
3 per cent, a figure which is likely to
increase.
FINANCIAL SERVICES
Historically the financial services industry in
Britain has been located in the famous
‘Square Mile’ in the City of London. This
177
BRITAIN 1994: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
remains broadly the case, even though the
markets for financial and related services have
grown and diversified greatly. Manchester,
Cardiff and Liverpool are also financial
centres and Edinburgh is a world-leader in
fund management. ‘The City’—the collection
of markets and institutions in and around the
Square Mile—is noted for having:
• the greatest concentration of foreign
banks in the world;
• a banking sector that accounts for about a
fifth of total international bank lending;
• one of the world’s largest international
insurance markets;
• the largest centre in the world for trading
overseas equities;
• the world’s largest foreign exchange
market;
• one of the world’s largest financial
derivatives markets;
• the greatest concentration of international
bond dealers; and
• a full range of ancillary and support
services—legal, accountancy and
management consultancy—which
contribute to London’s strength as a
financial centre.
Banking, finance, insurance, business
services and leasing accounted for
around one-fifth of Britain’s total
output in 1992, a share which has risen
sharply over the past decade.
Banking, finance and insurance accounted
for 12 per cent of all employment in Great
Britain at the end of 1992. British financial
institutions’ overseas earnings amounted to
£18,800 million in 1992.
Development of Financial Services
The growth in international movements of
capital in the 1960s and 1970s mainly took
the form of increased bank lending and
foreign exchange trading. London became the
international centre of this activity,
particularly in the eurocurrency markets (see
p. 189), and the number of overseas banks
represented in London is larger than in any
other financial centre. During the 1980s, with
increasing international competition in
financial services and developments in
technology, London’s securities markets grew
rapidly. Edinburgh also developed as a centre
for fund management.
Some traditional distinctions between
financial institutions have been eroded, so
that single firms supply a broader range of
services, both in domestic and international
markets. Landmarks in the deregulation of
Britain’s financial services in recent years
include:
• the abolition of exchange controls in
1979;
• the ending in 1980 of the supplementary
special deposits scheme, which was
designed to curb bank lending;
• the abolition in 1981 of the Reserve Asset
Ratio requirement, under which banks
had to hold 12.5 per cent of their
deposits as liquid assets with the Bank of
England;
• the abolition of hire purchase restrictions
in 1982;
• the Building Societies Act 1986 (see
p. 183); and
• ‘Big Bang’, also in 1986 (see p. 187).
Supervision
HM Treasury is the government department
with responsibility for financial services. In
particular, it is responsible for legislation
covering the supervision of banks, building
societies, friendly societies and investment
businesses which are subject to the new
regulatory system established under the
Banking Act 1987 (see p. 181), the Building
Societies Act 1986 (see p. 183) and the
Financial Services Act 1986 (see p. 180). The
Treasury also oversees the Securities and
Investments Board (SIB—see p. 179).
The Department of Trade and Industry
(DTI) is responsible for company law and
insolvency matters, and for investigations and
prosecutions under the Financial Services,
Insolvency and Companies Acts.
Investigations are carried out with the
Serious Fraud Office. DTI’s responsibilities
178
FINANCE AND OTHER SERVICE INDUSTRIES
also include prudential supervision of
insurance undertakings, European
Community (EC) insurance directives,
insurance interests in the Organisation for
Economic Co-operation and Development
(OECD) and the General Agreement on
Tariffs and Trade (GATT), and general
questions affecting the insurance industry. It
also has powers to investigate ‘insider
dealing’—securities trading carried out on the
basis of privileged access to relevant
information.
The Treasury negotiates and implements
EC directives relating to financial services and
is responsible for arrangements with overseas
regulators for exchanging information. It is
also charged with encouraging international
liberalisation in financial services both
bilaterally and through GATT and the
OECD. International supervisory forums
include the Basle Committee on Banking
Supervision and the International
Organisation of Securities Commissions
(IOSCO). IOSCO is the primary international
meeting place for regulatory authorities. Its
1992 conference, held in London, approved a
set of principles for the supervision of
financial conglomerates and released
guidelines for clearing and settlement systems
in energy markets.
The main provisions of the Financial
Services Act came into force in 1988; and
most of the Act’s powers are delegated to the
SIB. Under the Act, investment businesses
(those dealing in, arranging, managing or
giving advice on investments or operating
collective investment schemes) require
authorisation and are subject to rules on the
conduct of business and other rules made
under the legislation. The SIB has recognised
a number of self-regulating organisations
(SROs) and recognised professional bodies
(RPBs). It has a duty to assist SROs and
RPBs to fulfil their regulatory functions.
Most investment businesses are authorised
under the Act by virtue of membership of
one of these. The SROs are:
• the Financial Intermediaries, Managers
and Brokers Regulatory Association
(FIMBRA), which covers firms such as
independent financial advisers and
insurance brokers;
• the Investment Management Regulatory
Organisation (IMRO), whose members
include merchant banks and pension fund
managers with mainly corporate clients;
• the Life Assurance and Unit Trust
Regulatory Organisation (LAUTRO),
which has responsibility for the way in
which its members, mainly the large life
assurance companies, market life
insurance and unit trusts; and
• the Securities and Futures Authority
(SFA), whose members include member
firms of the London Stock Exchange, as
well as futures brokers and dealers, and
eurobond dealers.
The SIB proposes to merge FIMBRA and
LAUTRO in April 1994.
Other information relating to supervision
and regulation is contained in the following
section and in the sections dealing with the
various types of financial institutions and
markets.
Bank of England
The Bank of England was established in 1694
by Act of Parliament and Royal Charter as a
corporate body. Its entire capital stock was
acquired by the Government in 1946. The
Bank acts as banker to the Government,
holding its main accounts, managing Britain’s
reserves of gold and foreign exchange,
arranging new government borrowing and
managing the stock of its existing debt. The
Bank’s main objectives are to:
• ensure the soundness of the financial
system through the direct supervision of
banks and specialised City institutions;
• promote the efficiency and
competitiveness of the financial system,
especially in domestic and international
payment and settlement systems; and
• maintain the value of the nation’s money,
mainly through policies and market
operations agreed with government.
The Banking Act 1987 assigns the Bank of
England the overriding objective of
protecting depositors. To this end institutions
intending to take deposits from the public
must gain authorisation from the Bank and
submit to its continued supervision. Under
179
BRITAIN 1994: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
the Financial Services Act 1986, the Bank is
also responsible for overseeing money-market
institutions (see p. 188). The Bank’s
supervision is ‘prudential’—it sets minimum
standards for authorised institutions but
offers no guarantee that those institutions will
not fail or that investors or depositors will be
compensated in full. The Banking Act
established the Deposit Protection Fund,
financed by contributions levied on the
banking system; this entitles depositors to
limited compensation if an authorised bank
fails. In order to be and remain authorised, an
institution has to satisfy the Bank that it has:
• adequate capital and liquidity;
• a realistic business plan;
• adequate systems and controls;
• adequate provision for bad and doubtful
debts; and
• that its business is carried out with
integrity and skill, and in a prudent
manner.
As agent for the Government, the Bank is
responsible for managing the National Debt,
which involves arranging government
borrowing and repayment of debt. It also
maintains the register of holdings of
government securities on behalf of the
Treasury, and manages the Exchange
Equalisation Account (EEA) holding Britain’s
official reserves of gold, foreign exchange,
Special Drawing Rights (SDRs—claims on
the International Monetary Fund) and
European Currency Units (ECUs). The Bank
may intervene in the foreign exchange
markets on the Government’s behalf, using
the resources of the EEA, to check undue
fluctuations in the exchange value of sterling.
The Bank is able to influence money-
market conditions through its dealings with
the discount houses (see p. 183), which
developed in the 19th century as bill brokers
for industrialists. Discount houses hold
mainly Treasury, local authority and
commercial bills, and negotiable certificates of
deposit financed by short-term loans from the
banks. If on a particular day there is a
shortage of cash in the banking system as a
result, for example, of large tax payments, the
Bank relieves the shortage either by buying
bills from the discount houses or by lending
directly to them. This permits banks to
replenish their cash balances at the Bank by
recalling some of their short-term loans to
the discount houses. The Bank’s dealings
with the discount houses give it powerful
influence over short-term interest rates.
The Bank of England has the sole right in
England and Wales to issue banknotes. The
note issue is no longer backed by gold but by
government and other securities. Three
Scottish and four Northern Ireland banks also
issue notes. These issues, apart from a small
amount specified by legislation for each bank,
must be fully covered by holdings of Bank of
England notes and coinage. Responsibility for
the provision of coin lies with the Royal
Mint, a government trading fund which
became an executive agency in 1990.
The Bank of England seeks to ensure that
Britain’s financial markets are efficient and
competitive. To this end it runs two
securities settlement systems with in-built
payment arrangements—the Central Gilts
Office and the Central Moneymarket Office.
A permanent body of market and legal
practitioners—the Financial Law Panel—has
been established by the Bank to help find
practical solutions to problems of legal
uncertainty in the wholesale financial
markets.
Banks and Building Societies
In addition to banks, the chief institutions
offering banking services are the building
societies and the National Savings Bank. The
‘single passport’ system created by the
European Community Second Banking
Directive allows ‘credit institutions’ (banks
and building societies) to operate throughout
the EC on the basis of their home-state
authorisation.
A useful distinction can be made between
‘retail’ and ‘wholesale’ banking. Retail
banking is primarily for personal customers
and small businesses. Its main services are
cash deposit and withdrawal facilities, and
money transmission systems. Competition
between the banks and the building societies
in providing money transmission services to
individuals has increased during the last two
180
FINANCE AND OTHER SERVICE INDUSTRIES
decades and is expected to intensify further
(see p. 182). Building societies can also offer
money transmission services to companies.
Wholesale business involves taking large
deposits at higher rates of interest, deploying
funds in money-market instruments (see
p. 188) and making large loans and
investments. Nearly all banks in Britain
engage in some wholesale activities and some,
such as the merchant and overseas banks,
centre their business on them. Many such
wholesale dealings are conducted on the
inter-bank market, that is, between banks
themselves.
In 1993 there were 508 institutions
authorised under the Banking Act 1987, or
EC legislation, including retail banks,
merchant banks, branches of overseas banks,
discount houses and banking subsidiaries of
both banking and non-banking institutions
from Britain and overseas. Of these, around
320 were members of the British Bankers’
Association, the main representative body for
British banks.
Retail Banks
The major retail banks have a significant
branch network, offering a full range of
financial services to both individuals and
companies. Among services generally available
are interest-bearing current accounts; deposit
accounts; and various kinds of loan
arrangements. In addition, there is a full
range of money transmission facilities that
increasingly feature plastic card technology.
The major banks in England and Wales
are Barclays, Lloyds, Midland, National
Westminster, the TSB Group and Abbey
National; and in Scotland the Bank of
Scotland and the Royal Bank of Scotland.
Other important retail banks are the
Clydesdale Bank, the Co-operative Bank, the
Yorkshire Bank and Girobank. Girobank,
previously a subsidiary of the Post Office, was
privatised in 1990 and became a subsidiary of
the Alliance and Leicester Building Society.
Northern Ireland is served by branch
networks of four major banking groups.
With the growth of financial services and a
relaxation of restrictions on competition
among financial institutions, the major banks
have diversified their services. They are
lending more money for house purchases, and
most now own finance houses, leasing and
factoring companies, merchant banks,
securities dealers, insurance companies and
unit trust companies.
The banks offer loan facilities to
companies; since the 1970s they have
provided more medium- and long-term loans
than they did formerly. They have become
important suppliers of finance for small
firms. A loan guarantee scheme is supported
by the banks, under which 70 per cent of the
value of loans to small companies is
guaranteed by the Government. Some banks
have set up special subsidiaries to provide
venture capital for companies (see p. 187).
Most retail banks maintain overseas
subsidiaries which may account for a
substantial proportion of their business, and
are active in eurocurrency markets
(see p. 189).
The total liabilities/assets of the retail
banks amounted to over £500,000 million in
1993. Of the liabilities, 63 per cent were
sterling deposits, 22 per cent foreign currency
deposits, and the remainder items in suspense
or transmission, and capital and other funds.
Of the £324,000 million of sterling deposits,
sight deposits withdrawable on demand
constituted 50 per cent; time deposits
requiring notice of withdrawal and certificates
of deposit and other short-term instruments
accounted for the remainder. The banks’
main liquid assets consist of money at call
(mainly short-term loans to discount houses),
their holdings of Treasury and other bills,
short-dated British government securities and
balances at the Bank of England. They also
hold a proportion of their assets as portfolio
investments (mainly longer-dated British
government securities) or trade investments.
The main retail banks operate through
some 12,450 branches and sub-branches in
Britain. National Westminster has the largest
number, with some 2,700 branches, followed
by Barclays (2,200), Lloyds (1,850), Midland
(1,740), TSB (1,400), the Royal Bank of
Scotland (750), Abbey National (680),
Clydesdale Bank (600), Bank of Scotland
(350), Yorkshire Bank (270) and the Co¬
operative Bank (88). Around three-quarters of
181
BRITAIN 1994: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
adults in Britain have a current account and
over one-third a deposit account.
Payment Systems
Apart from credit and debit card
arrangements, the main payment systems are
run by three separate companies operating
under an umbrella organisation, the
Association for Payment Clearing Services
(APACS), of which 21 banks and building
societies are members. One covers bulk paper
clearings—cheques and credit transfers. A
second deals with high-value clearings for
same-day settlement, namely the nationwide
electronic transfer service Clearing House
Automated Payment System (CHAPS) and
the cheque-based Town Clearing (which
operates only in the City of London). A third
covers bulk electronic clearing for standing
orders and direct debits. Membership of each
of these clearing companies is open to any
bank, building society or other financial
institution meeting the criteria for appropriate
supervision and volume of transactions.
Plastic Card Technology
All the major retail banks and building
societies have substantial networks of
automated teller machines, which give
customers access to cash and other services
for up to 24 hours a day. Almost 18,500
machines were in operation at the end of
1992.
The banks and major building societies
also offer their customers cheque guarantee
cards-—typically for amounts up to £50 or
sometimes £100. The cards entitle holders to
cheque-cashing facilities in participating
institutions and guarantee retailers that
transactions up to the specified guarantee
limit will be honoured. Uniform eurocheques
supported by a eurocheque card are available
from all major banks. These standard-format
cheques may be used to obtain cash or make
payments in Britain, elsewhere in Europe and
in a few other overseas countries. The
cheques are made out in the currency of the
country in which they are being used, with
a guarantee limit of the equivalent of £100
per cheque.
Credit cards issued by major retail banks
and building societies are a popular means of
payment and are widely accepted throughout
Britain and overseas. Most cards are
affiliated to one of the two major
international credit card organisations, Visa
and MasterCard. Some of the major retail
stores issue their own cards, which operate
like credit cards. A charge card, like a credit
card, enables the holder to make retail
payments, but there is either no credit limit
or a very high limit, and the balance must
be settled in full on receipt of a monthly
statement.
As well as the traditional paper-based
systems for making retail payments by credit
or charge cards, an increasing number of
stores and garages now provide EFTPOS
(see p. 193) facilities. Using debit cards,
payments can be deducted directly from the
purchaser’s bank account. Most cards are
affiliated either to Visa or to the Switch
organisation, which is based in Britain.
Home Banking
Manj banks and building societies offer
home banking services whereby customers
use a telephone or personal computer to
obtain account information, make transfers
and pay bills. Midland’s First Direct is one
such service.
Building Societies
Building societies are mutual institutions,
owned by their savers and borrowers. They
raise short-term deposits from savers, who
are generally able to withdraw their money
on demand or at short notice. The societies
make long-term loans, mostly at variable
rates of interest, against the security of
property—usually private dwellings
purchased for owner-occupation.
Competition between the building
societies and other financial institutions has
increased in the last decade. A variety of
savings schemes have been established, and a
growing number of societies provide current
account facilities such as cheque books and
automated teller machines. In 1992 there
were some 3,500 building society automated
182
FINANCE AND OTHER SERVICE INDUSTRIES
teller machines, about one-sixth of the total.
Three building societies issue credit cards.
Building societies are the major
lenders for house purchase in Britain
and are the principal repository for the
personal sector’s liquid assets,
although banks’ shares have increased
in both areas since 1985. Some 60 per
cent of adults have building society
savings accounts.
In 1993 there were 90 registered societies,
of which 87 were members of the Building
Societies’ Association. Building societies’
assets totalled £263,000 million at the end of
1992; about £33,000 million was advanced in
new mortgages in the course of 1992. The
three largest—the Halifax, Nationwide and
Woolwich—account for about one-half of the
total assets of all societies. Societies may
operate throughout the EC.
The Building Societies Act 1986 enabled
societies to diversify into banking and other
services. Up to 25 per cent of a society’s
commercial assets may be used for purposes
other than loans on first mortgage of owner-
occupied houses, including as much as 15 per
cent in other types of asset such as unsecured
loans. Directly or through subsidiaries,
societies may offer services within the general
areas of banking, investment, insurance,
trusteeship, executorship and estate agency.
However, their main business will continue
to be financial and housing-related services.
The 1986 Act established the Building
Societies Commission to carry out the
prudential supervision of building societies. It
also made provision for a society to seek the
approval of its members to convert into a
public limited company. In this event the
society becomes an authorised institution
under the Banking Act 1987 (see p. 181) and
is then supervised by the Bank of England.
Abbey National pursued this course and no
longer contributes to building society
statistics.
The Council of Mortgage Lenders is a
trade body established in 1989 for all
mortgage lending institutions, including
building societies, insurance companies,
finance houses and banks.
Merchant Banks
Merchant banks have traditionally been
concerned primarily with accepting, or
guaranteeing, commercial bills and with
sponsoring capital issues on behalf of their
customers. Today they undertake a
diversified and complex range of activities.
They have important roles in equity and debt
markets and the provision of advice and
financial services to industrial companies,
especially where mergers, takeovers and other
forms of corporate reorganisation are
involved. Management of investment
holdings, including trusts, pensions and other
funds, is also an important function of
merchant banks. The sector is split between
independent houses and those which are part
of larger banking groups.
Overseas Banks
A total of 255 banks incorporated overseas
were represented in Britain in 1993. Of these,
26 were from the United States and 27 from
Japan. Some 78 institutions incorporated in
Britain were subsidiaries of overseas
companies. They offer a comprehensive
banking service in many parts of the world
and engage in the financing of trade not only
between Britain and other countries but also
between third-party countries.
Bntish-based Overseas Banks
A small number of banks have their head
offices in Britain, but operate mainly abroad,
often specialising in particular regions.
Standard Chartered, which is represented in
Asia, Africa and the Middle East, is the
major example of this type of bank.
Discount Houses
There are seven discount houses authorised
under the Banking Act 1987. These are
specialised institutions unique in their
function and central position in the British
monetary system. They act as financial
intermediaries between the Bank of England
and the rest of the banking sector, promoting
an orderly flow of short-term funds. They
183
BRITAIN 1994: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
guarantee to tender for the whole of the
weekly offer of the Government’s Treasury
bills, which are instruments to raise funds
over a period of up to six months. In return
for acting as intermediaries, the discount
houses have secured borrowing facilities at
the Bank of England, acting as ‘lender of last
resort’. Assets of the discount houses consist
mainly of Treasury and commercial bills,
negotiable certificates of deposit and short¬
term loans. Their liabilities are for the most
part short-term deposits.
National Savings Bank
The National Savings Bank is run by the
Department for National Savings, a
government department. It contributes to
government borrowing and aims to encourage
saving by offering personal savers a range of
investments, designed to meet various
requirements. Important products include:
• Savings Certificates, which either pay a
fixed rate of interest alone or a lower
fixed rate of interest combined with
index-linking;
• Premium Bonds, where interest is paid in
the form of prizes chosen by lottery;
• Income and Capital Bonds;
• Children’s Bonus Bonds, which are
designed to accumulate capital sums for
those under 21;
• Ordinary and Investment Accounts,
where deposits and withdrawals can be
made at over 19,000 post offices
throughout Britain; and
• FIRST Option Bonds, launched in 1992,
which are ‘tax-paid’ and offer a
guaranteed rate of interest that is fixed
for one year.
With the exception of FIRST Option
Bonds, interest on National Savings products
is paid without deduction of tax at source.
Certain National Savings products offer tax
exempt returns. In some cases the best
returns are paid to those who leave their
savings untouched for several years. In
August 1993 the total amount of money
invested in National Savings was over
£45,000 million.
Insurance
London is the world’s leading centre for
insurance and for placing international
reinsurance; it handles an estimated 20 per
cent of the general insurance business placed
on the international market. There are two
broad categories of insurance: long-term life
insurance, where contracts may be for periods
of many years; and general insurance,
including accident and short-term life
insurance, where contracts are for a year or
less. Authorised insurance companies are
supervised by the Department of Trade and
Industry under the Insurance Companies
Act 1982.
In addition to the British companies and
Lloyd’s (see p. 185), a large number of
overseas companies are represented, with
which many British companies have formed
close relationships. Some British companies
confine their activities to domestic business
but most large companies undertaking general
business transact a substantial amount
overseas through branches and agencies or
affiliated local companies.
Over 820 companies are authorised to
carry on one or more classes of insurance
business in Britain. About 450 companies
belong to the Association of British Insurers
(ABI). Some companies are mutual
institutions, owned by their policy holders.
Insurance is also available from certain
friendly societies (see p. 186).
EC directives introducing the ‘single¬
licence’ system in insurance are due to be in
force by July 1994. Life and non-life insurers
will be able to operate throughout the EC on
the basis of authorisation in their home state.
Restrictions on carrying both life and non-life
insurance business within the same firm (a
‘composite’ insurer) will be lifted. Separate
directives cover reinsurance, motor insurance
and co-insurance.
Long-term Insurance
As well as providing life cover, life insurance
is a vehicle for saving and investment because
premiums are invested in securities and other
assets. Some 31 per cent of adults have life
assurance policies. The net long-term
184
FINANCE AND OTHER SERVICE INDUSTRIES
insurance premium income of companies
representing about 99 per cent of the British
market in 1992 was almost £52,000 million
from their worldwide operations, £43,000
million of which was earned in Britain. Long¬
term insurance is handled by 196 companies.
General Insurance
General insurance business is undertaken by
insurance companies and by Lloyd’s. It covers
fire, accident, general liability, short-term life,
motor, marine, aviation and transport. Total
ABI member company premiums worldwide
in 1992 were £31,000 million, of which
£19,000 million was earned in Britain. Over
£5,700 million was for motor insurance in
Britain and £1,700 million for marine,
aviation and transport insurance. Fire and
accident insurance was worth around £10,600
million. The bulk of business by ABI
companies in the latter categories was written
through the Institute of London Underwriters
(see below).
Lloyd's
Lloyd’s, the origins of which go back to the
17th century, is an incorporated society of
private insurers in London. Although its
activities were originally confined to the
conduct of marine insurance, a considerable
worldwide market for the transaction of other
classes of insurance business, such as aviation
and motor insurance, has been built up.
Lloyd’s is not a company but a market for
insurance administered by the Council of
Lloyd’s, the Lloyd’s Market Board and
Lloyd’s Regulatory Board. Business is carried
out for individual elected underwriting
members, or ‘names’, who must show
sufficient available wealth and lodge a deposit.
Insurance is transacted for them with
unlimited liability, in competition with each
other and with insurance companies. In 1993
there were 19,500 members, grouped into 228
syndicates. Each syndicate is managed by an
underwriting agent responsible for appointing
a professional underwriter to accept insurance
risks and settle claims on the syndicate
members’ behalf. Insurance may only be
placed through accredited Lloyd’s brokers,
who negotiate with Lloyd’s syndicates on
behalf of the insured.
Lloyd’s net premium income in 1990, the
most recent year for which figures are
available, was £5,280 million, which can be
broken down as follows:
• £634 million for motor insurance;
• £1?703 million for marine insurance;
• £324 million for aviation insurance; and
• £2,619 million for non-marine insurance.
Lloyd’s has suffered severe losses in recent
years, partly as a result of a series of natural
disasters, including the storms in Britain in
October 1987, the Exxon Valdez oil tanker
disaster off the coast of Alaska in 1989, and
Hurricane Andrew, which struck Florida and
Louisiana in 1992.
A business plan published in April 1993
set out a series of reforms for Lloyd’s, the
most radical of which is the introduction of
incorporated capital. From 1 January 1994
corporate members with limited liability will
operate alongside individual unlimited
liability members, to give the market the
additional capacity needed to take advantage
of improved trading conditions.
Institute of London Underwriters
The Institute of London Underwriters was
formed in 1884, originally as a trade
association for marine underwriters. It now
provides a market where insurance companies
transact marine, commercial transport and
aviation business. The Institute issues
combined policies in its own name which are
underwritten by member companies. The
premium income processed by the Institute’s
member companies in 1992 was some
£2,600 million. About half of the 80 member
companies are branches or subsidiaries of
overseas companies.
Insurance Brokers
Insurance brokers, acting on behalf of the
insured, are a valuable part of the company
market and play an essential role in the
Lloyd’s market. Many brokers specialise
in reinsurance business, serving as
intermediaries in the exchange of contracts
185
BRITAIN 1994: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
between companies, both British and
overseas, and often acting as London
representatives of the latter. The Insurance
Brokers (Registration) Act 1977 makes
provision for the voluntary registration and
regulation of insurance brokers by the
Insurance Brokers Registration Council. Only
those registered with the Council can use the
title ‘insurance broker’. In 1993 some 13,400
individuals were registered with the Council,
through 2,115 partnerships or sole traderships
and 2,650 limited companies.
Friendly Societies
Friendly societies have traditionally been
unincorporated societies of individuals,
offering their members a limited range of
financial services, particularly provision for
retirement and against loss of income through
sickness or unemployment. The Friendly
Societies Act 1992 enabled friendly societies
to incorporate, take on new powers and offer
a broad range of financial services through
subsidiaries.
Investment Funds
Britain has a great deal of expertise in fund
management, which involves managing funds
on the investor’s behalf, or advising investors
on how to invest their funds. The main types
of investment fund include pension schemes,
life assurance, investment trusts and unit
trusts.
Pension Funds
Virtually all occupational pension schemes are
established under trust law to protect the
interests of members and most pay benefits
related to final salary. Benefits are funded in
advance by employer (and wholly employee)
contributions, which are held and invested by
trustees on behalf of beneficiaries. Pension
funds are major investors in securities
markets. Total British pension fund assets
were worth in the region of £400,000 million
in 1993 and pension funds hold around 40
per cent of securities listed on the London
Stock Exchange. Since 1986, members of
occupational pension schemes have been able
to opt out and set up a personal pension
scheme. Over 11 million people belong to
occupational pension schemes and more than
4 million to personal pension schemes.
The Pensions Law Review Committee
submitted a report to the Government in
autumn 1993 outlining a legal and regulatory
framework for occupational pension schemes.
The report has reviewed the framework
within which these pension schemes operate,
and has recommended a range of measures
for improving the security of pension
entitlements under the schemes.
Investment and Unit Trusts
Investment trust companies, which offer the
opportunity to diversify risk even on a
relatively small investment, are listed on the
London Stock Exchange and their shares are
traded in the usual way. They must invest
mostly in securities, and the trusts themselves
are exempt from capital gains tax. Assets are
purchased mainly out of shareholders’ funds,
although investment trusts are also allowed to
borrow money for investment. There were
235 members of the Association of
Investment Trust Companies in April 1993,
with some £31,250 million worth of assets
under management.
Authorised unit trusts are open-ended
mutual or pooled investment vehicles which
place funds in a wide range of securities
markets all over the world. As with
investment trusts, investors with relatively
small amounts to invest are able to benefit
from diversified and expertly managed
portfolios. The industry has grown rapidly
during the last decade, and in 1993 there were
over 1,500 authorised unit trusts with total
assets exceeding £70,000 million. Unit trust
management groups are represented by the
Association of Unit Trusts and Investment
Funds and regulated by IMRO. The trusts
themselves are authorised by the SIB.
Special Financing Institutions
There are many specialised institutions
offering finance to personal and corporate
sector borrowers. These borrowers are found
in both the public and the private sectors.
186
FINANCE AND OTHER SERVICE INDUSTRIES
Among public sector agencies are Scottish
Enterprise, Highlands and Islands Enterprise,
the Welsh Development Agency, the
Industrial Development Board for Northern
Ireland and ECGD (Export Credits Guarantee
Department—Britain’s official export credit
insurer). The part of ECGD that handled the
export of capital goods sold on short-term
credit was privatised in 1991 and is now dealt
with by NCM Credit Insurance.
Some private sector institutions were set
up with government support and with
financing from banks and other financial
institutions. I hey may offer loan finance or
equity capital. The main private sector
institutions are described below.
Finance and Leasing Companies
At the beginning of 1992 the Finance Houses
Association and the Equipment Leasing
Association together formed a single new
representative body, the Finance and Leasing
Association (FLA). This represents the
interests of companies offering motor finance,
consumer credit, and business finance and
leasing. The FLA’s 108 members undertook
new business worth £22,172 million in 1992.
Factoring Companies
Factoring comprises a range of financial
services which provide growing companies
with a flexible source of finance in exchange
for the outstanding invoices due to them.
Factoring has developed as a major financial
service since the early 1960s, covering
international activities as well as domestic
trade. Member companies of the Association
of British Factors and Discounters handled
business worth £16,000 million in 1992, 47
per cent of which was undertaken for clients
in manufacturing industry, 29 per cent for
clients in distribution and 17 per cent for
clients in the services sector.
Venture Capital Companies
Venture capital companies offer medium- and
long-term equity financing for new and
developing businesses when such funds are
not easily or directly available from traditional
sources, such as the stock market or banks.
The British Venture Capital Association has
115 full members and makes up virtually all
the industry. Many venture capital companies
are subsidiaries of other financial institutions,
including banks, insurance companies and
pension funds.
Britain’s venture capital industry
invested £1,400 million worldwide in
1992; management buy-outs and buy-
ins accounted for 64 per cent of the
capital invested. The South East of
England remains the dominant region
for investment, accounting for 44 per
cent of the total.
The largest of Britain’s venture capital
companies is Ji, shares in which are owned
by the Bank of England (15 per cent) and six
of the major retail banks.
Financial Markets
The City of London has a variety of financial
markets. They include the London Stock
Exchange, the foreign exchange market, the
financial futures and options market,
eurobond and eurocurrency markets, Lloyd’s
insurance market (see p. 185), and bullion
and commodity markets. The securities
markets are supervised jointly by the
Treasury, the Bank of England, SIB and the
London Stock Exchange among others.
London Stock Exchange
The London Stock Exchange has its main
administrative centre in London, as well as
centres in Belfast, Birmingham, Leeds,
Glasgow and Manchester. As a result of a set
of reforms implemented in 1986 and known
popularly as ‘Big Bang’, the Exchange has
changed radically in recent years. The main
reforms were as follows:
• the Exchange’s rules on membership
were altered to allow corporate ownership
of member firms;
• the system under which dealers charged
fixed minimum scales of commission to
investors was abolished in favour of
negotiated commissions;
187
BRITAIN 1994: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
• dealers were permitted to trade in
securities both on their own behalf, as
principals, and on behalf of clients, as
agents, these two roles formerly having
been kept distinct; and
• a screen-based price quotation system was
introduced and led to the closing of the
trading floor.
The London Stock Exchange is one of the
largest in the world in terms of the number
and variety of securities listed. It accounts for
some 10 per cent of equity trading
worldwide. Some 7,500 securities are listed;
in 1993 these had a market value of almost
£3,000,000 million. About 4,400 company
securities are listed, including those of a
growing number of leading overseas
companies, with a value of around £2,500,000
million. The remainder is made up of British
and overseas government and corporate stocks
as well as eurobonds (see p. 189).
Throughout the 1980s a trend towards the
‘securitisation of debt’ developed, with major
borrowers increasingly raising funds by
issuing securities rather than by seeking out
bank loans. In recent years the largest market
for new issues has been that for companies’
securities, including issues of shares resulting
from the Government’s privatisation
programme.
More than 9 million people, over
22 per cent of the adult population,
own shares, according to a survey
carried out by Mori and ProShare
(which promotes share ownership) in
December 1992.
The gilt-edged market allows the
Government to borrow money by issuing loan
stock through the Bank of England. The
Stock Exchange offers a secondary market
where investors can buy and sell gilts.
Average daily turnover in the market reached
£6,000 million in 1993.
European Community Directives
The London Stock Exchange altered its rules
in 1990 to conform to EC directives on listing
particulars, prospectuses and mutual
recognition. The major effect of the EC
directive on Mutual Recognition of Listing
Particulars is that, subject to certain
limitations, each member state is required to
recognise listing particulars accepted in
another member state. In order to put
British companies on an equal footing with
those in other EC countries, the Exchange
reduced the minimum trading record
requirement for full listing from five years
to three.
Money Markets
The London money markets comprise the
interbank deposit markets plus a range of
other instruments, usually short-term in
maturity. They are wholesale in the sense
that the participants are professional
operators dealing in substantial amounts of
money.
Banks are the major participants in these
markets, and are supervised by the Bank of
England. The Bank also supervises other
institutions which operate in the foreign
exchange and other wholesale money
markets. In close consultation with market
participants, the Bank has issued the London
Code of Conduct, which defines the
instruments that comprise the wholesale
money markets and the standards and
dealing procedures which participants should
follow.
Since 1986, large companies have been
permitted to issue sterling commercial paper
(SCP): this consists of debt denominated in
sterling with a maturity of up to one year.
The range of qualifying issuers of SCP has
broadened since 1986 to include, for
example, banks, building societies and
overseas public authorities.
Euromarkets
These are markets in currencies lent or
invested outside their domestic marketplace,
particularly as a means of financing
international trade and investment.
Transactions can thus be carried out in
eurodollars, eurodeutschmarks, euroyen and
so on. London is at the heart of the
euromarkets and houses most of the major
international banks and securities firms.
188
FINANCE AND OTHER SERVICE INDUSTRIES
The euromarkets developed in the late
1950s following the restoration of
convertibility between the major currencies,
partly to avoid incurring the costs of exchange
control and other regulations. In recent years
distinctions between markets have been
breaking down and the euromarkets form a
major part of the wider international money
and capital markets. Participants in the
markets include multinational trading
corporations, financial companies and
governments.
The euro-securities markets have grown
considerably in recent years because the
instruments traded on them, including euro¬
commercial paper, euro-medium-term notes
and eurobonds, are seen as flexible
alternatives to bank loans. Euro-medium-term
note (EMTN) programmes were introduced
in 1986, and EMTN issues rose threefold
between 1990 and 1992. British building
societies are prominent among EMTN
issuers. There is a growing private sector
market in ECU-denominated deposits,
securities and eurobonds.
Foreign Exchange Market
London is the world’s biggest centre for
foreign exchange trading, with an average
daily turnover of about US $300,000 million.
Along with Singapore, it has the most
diversified exchange market in the world.
The foreign exchange market consists of
telephone and electronic links between the
participants, which include banks, other
financial institutions and several foreign
exchange broking firms acting as
intermediaries between the banks. It provides
those engaged in international trade and
investment with foreign currencies for their
transactions. The banks are in close contact
with financial centres abroad and are able to
quote buying and selling rates for both
immediate (‘spot’) and forward transactions in
a range of currencies and maturities. The
forward market enables traders and dealers
who, at a given date in the future, wish to
receive or make a specific foreign currency
payment, to contract in advance to sell or buy
the foreign currency involved for sterling at a
fixed exchange rate.
Derivatives
Financial derivatives are contracts to buy or
sell, at a future date, financial instruments
such as equities, bonds or money-market
instruments. They offer a means of hedging
against changes in prices, exchange rates and
interest rates. Derivatives include futures
(agreements to buy or sell financial
instruments or physical commodities at a
future date), options (the right to buy or sell
financial instruments or physical commodities
for a stated period at a predetermined price)
and ‘over-the-counter’ products, including
swaps. A foreign exchange swap can convert
a money-market instrument in one currency
into a money-market instrument in another—
a dollar deposit into a sterling deposit, for
example.
I he use of derivatives has grown rapidly
and instruments have become more complex,
especially as advances have been made in
information technology and links between
markets and institutions strengthened.
Between 1991 and 1992 the turnover on
London’s futures and options exchanges grew
by almost 50 per cent to reach 112 million
contracts. LIFFE (see below) accounted for
almost two-thirds of the contracts traded in
1992 and the London Metal Exchange
(see p. 190) accounted for about a fifth.
Financial Futures and Options
Over 200 banks, other financial institutions,
brokers and individual traders are members
of the London International Financial
Futures and Options Exchange (LIFFE),
which trades at the Cannon Bridge
development. Futures contracts cover the
purchase or sale of a fixed amount of a
commodity at a given date in the future at a
price agreed at the time of trade. There is
also dealing in options on the equity of
prominent British companies and in stock
index options. LIFFE has the most
internationally diverse range of financial
futures and options products of any exchange
in the world. In September 1992, trading on
LIFFE for the first time exceeded that on
the Chicago exchanges, which pioneered the
development of financial futures and options.
189
BRITAIN 1994: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
London Bullion Market
Some 60 banks and other financial trading
companies comprise the London gold and
silver markets, which, like the foreign
exchange market, trade by telephone or other
electronic means. Five of the members of the
London Bullion Market Association meet
twice daily to establish a London fixing price
for gold—a reference point for worldwide
dealings. The silver fixing is held once a day.
Although much interest centres upon the
fixings, active dealing takes place throughout
the day. London and Zurich are the main
world centres for gold dealings.
Commodity, Shipping and Freight Markets
Britain is a major international centre for
commodities trading and the home of many
of the related international trade
organisations. At London FOX (the London
Futures and Options Exchange), futures in
grains, meat, potatoes, and soya bean meal are
traded, as are futures and options on ‘soft’
commodities (cocoa and coffee). White sugar
and dry freight index futures contracts are
also traded. The London Metal Exchange is
the primary base metals market in the world,
trading both spot and forward contracts in
aluminium, aluminium alloy, copper, lead,
nickel, tin and zinc. The International
Petroleum Exchange is Europe’s only energy
futures exchange. The Baltic Exchange, which
finds ships for cargoes and cargoes for ships
throughout the world, is the world’s leading
shipping market.
OTHER SERVICES
Distribution
Distributing goods to their point of sale by
road, rail, air and sea is a significant
economic activity, accounting for about a
sixth of national income. In 1992 there were
some 3.4 million employees in the
distributive and allied trades in Great Britain.
The large retailers and wholesalers of food,
drink and clothing operate, either directly or
through contractors, extensive distribution
networks using fleets of trailers, vans and
lorries. There is also a highly competitive
specialist express delivery sector.
Wholesaling
There were 120,600 businesses, with a
turnover valued at almost £225,500 million
(see Table 14.1), engaged in wholesaling and
dealing in Great Britain in 1990. Total
turnover increased by 9 per cent between
1988 and 1990.
In the food and drink trade almost all
large retailers have their own buying and
central distribution operations. Elsewhere in
the trade, voluntary groups have been formed
by wholesalers and small independent
retailers; the retailers are encouraged by
discounts and other incentives to buy as
much as possible from the wholesaler. This
has helped to preserve many smaller retail
outlets, including the traditional ‘corner
shops’ and village stores. It has also given
small retailers the advantages of bulk buying
and co-ordinated distribution.
London’s wholesale markets play a
significant part in the distribution of
foodstuffs. New Covent Garden is the main
market for fruit and vegetables, Smithfield
for meat and Billingsgate for fish.
The co-operative movement has its own
distribution organisation, the Co-operative
Wholesale Society (CWS). Retail co-operative
societies are encouraged to buy from the
CWS, which is their main supplier. The
CWS is also a major retailer in Scotland,
Northern Ireland, the Midlands and south¬
east and northern England.
Retailing
Of the 25 largest retailers in Western Europe
(by sales in the period 1988-90), ten were
British firms. In 1990 there were 242,000
retail businesses, with 349,000 outlets, in
Great Britain (see Table 14.2). In recent
years the large multiple retailers have grown
in size, reducing numbers of stores but
increasing outlet size and diversifying their
product ranges. Decline has been particularly
evident among small independent businesses
and retail co-operative societies. The largest
multiple retailers in the grocery market are

year. Other important groups are Waitrose
and Morrisons.
About 20 million people regularly
purchase all kinds of goods and
services through mail order
catalogues. In 1992 sales by general
mail order totalled some £3,900
million, representing about 3 per cent
of all retail sales. The largest selling
items sold by the mail order
companies are clothing, footwear,
furniture, household textiles,
televisions, radios and electrical goods.
Retail co-operative societies are voluntary
organisations controlled by their members,
membership being open to anyone paying a
small deposit on a minimum share. There are
4,750 retail co-operative outlets, 48 per cent
of which sell food and groceries.
The leading mixed retail businesses
include Marks and Spencer, Boots,
Kingfisher, Storehouse, W. H. Smith, Argos,
Littlewoods, Savacentre, John Menzies, Sears,
Burton Group and House of Fraser.
Large Shopping Centres
Britain has a wide range of complementary
shopping facilities inside and outside town
and city centres. One of the most significant
trends in retailing is towards the
development of large and medium-sized
supermarkets and superstores in order to
increase efficiency and the range of goods
available. However, the five largest multiple
retailers have only 19 per cent of retail
turnover, partly because there continues to
be a demand for the services provided by
small, specialised shops.
The main multiple grocery companies
have been steadily increasing the size of
their stores both in towns and cities and on
suburban and out-of-town sites. Also,
retailers of goods such as do-it-yourself
(DIY) products, furniture and electrical
appliances have built retail warehouses
outside town and city centres, particularly to
attract shoppers with cars. More recently,
there has been a trend towards the grouping
of retail warehouses into retail warehouse
parks. Many towns and cities have purpose-
built shopping centres.
A number of regional out-of-town
shopping centres have been established on
sites offering good access to large numbers
of customers with cars. One of the first
centres was the Metro Centre at Gateshead,
Tyne and Wear, which has 209,000 sq m
(2.25 million sq ft) of floorspace and is the
largest of its kind in Europe. Other centres
include the Meadowhall shopping centre in
191
BRITAIN 1994: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Sheffield and the Lakeside centre at
Thurrock in Essex, both opened in 1990.
All new retail development requires
planning permission from the local
government planning authority. These
authorities must consult the appropriate
central government department before
granting permission for developments of
23,325 sq m (250,000 sq ft) or more. The
Government’s policy is to encourage the
provision of a broad range of shopping
facilities to the public, while ensuring that the
effects of major new retail development do
not undermine the viability and vitality of
existing town centres.
Diversification
Many of the large multiple groups sell a much
greater number of goods and services than
previously. However, in some cases extensive
diversification has proved unprofitable and
large food retailers are increasing their range
of foods instead. More emphasis is also being
placed on selling own-label goods and
environmentally friendly products, including
organic produce. Many superstores and large
supermarkets offer fresh food, such as meat,
fish, vegetables and bread baked on the
premises, as well as selling packaged foods.
Some large retailers have in recent years
begun to provide financial services.
Promotions
Retailers are placing greater emphasis on
price competition and quality as a means of
promoting sales. Some large retailers have
issued their own credit cards for regular
customers in an attempt to encourage sales,
particularly of high-value goods.
Information Technology
Information technology has become
increasingly central to distribution and
retailing. Computers are used to monitor
stock levels and record sales figures through
developments such as electronic point-of-sale
(EPOS) systems. EPOS systems read a bar¬
code, printed on the retail product, that holds
price and product information and can be
used to generate orders for stock
replenishment.
Techniques such as ‘just-in-time’
ordering, in which produce arrives at the
store at the last possible moment before sale,
have become widespread as a result. Most

FINANCE AND OTHER SERVICE INDUSTRIES
large retailers have set up electronic data
interchange (EDI) systems; these enable their
computers to communicate with those of
their suppliers, and transmit orders and
invoices electronically, so reducing errors and
saving time. A legal change permitting tax
invoices in forms other than paper has made
it easier for retailers to use EDI when
dealing with their suppliers.
EFTPOS (electronic funds transfer at
point of sale) systems enable customers to
pay for purchases using debit cards which
automatically transfer funds from their bank
account. Several major EFTPOS schemes are
well established and the number of terminals,
which currently stands at about 200,000, is
growing rapidly.
Vehicle and Petrol Retailing
In 1992 there were 260,000 people employed
in the retail distribution of motor vehicles
and parts, in petrol stations and in the repair
and recovery of vehicles. Many businesses
selling new vehicles are franchised by the
motor manufacturers. Over one-third of the
19,000 petrol stations are owned by oil
companies. The three companies with the
largest number of outlets are Shell, Esso and
BP. Unleaded petrol accounts for over half
of petrol sold. The majority of petrol stations
are self-service. About 16,000 outlets sell
diesel fuel.
Hotels and Catering
The hotel and catering trades employed
some 1.1 million people in Great Britain at
the end of 1992:
• 329,100 in public houses and bars;
• 294,800 in restaurants, cafes and snack
bars;
• 251,000 in hotels and other residential
establishments;
• 117,700 in canteens; and
• 137,300 in clubs.
A large number of self-employed people
also work in hotels and catering.
There were about 60,200 hotels in Great
Britain in 1992, with a turnover of £12,900
million. The largest hotel business is Forte,
with 338 hotels in Britain, as well as catering
and leisure interests. At the other end of the
scale, numerous guest houses and hotels each
have fewer than 20 rooms. Holiday centres—
including holiday camps with full board, self¬
catering centres and caravan parks—are run
by Butlins, Holiday Club, Center Parcs,
Warner Holidays and Pontin’s.
Britain has a very wide range of
restaurants, offering cuisine from virtually
every country in the world. The Food Safety
Act 1990 has contributed to a raising of food
safety standards, as has the application of the
relevant British standard on quality. In 1992
there were about 58,000 public houses (pubs),
which mainly sell beer, wines, soft drinks and
spirits for consumption on the premises.
Many pubs are owned by the large brewing
companies, which either provide managers to
run them or offer tenancy agreements; others,
called free houses, are independently owned
and managed. The Government has acted to
strengthen competition in the sale of beer and
other drinks in pubs.
Permitted opening hours for some 100,000
licensed premises in England and Wales were
extended in 1986. The introduction of liquor
licences for ‘cafe-style’ premises has been
proposed, which would allow children under
14 to accompany their parents to places
where alcoholic drinks are available. In
Scotland a similar type of licence called a
‘refreshment licence’ has been available since
1976, and licensed premises can apply for a
‘children’s certificate’ permitting children to
accompany an adult on the premises within
certain hours.
Advertising
Spending on advertising in 1992 amounted to
£8,769 million. The press accounted for 55
per cent of the total, television for 28 per
cent, direct mail for 11 per cent, posters for
3 per cent, and commercial radio and cinema
for the rest. The largest advertising
expenditure is on food, retail and mail order
services, cars, financial services, household
goods, toiletries and cosmetics, drink, and
holidays and travel. Campaigns are planned
by several hundred advertising agencies

which, in some cases, offer marketing,
consumer research and other services.
Computing Services
The computing services industry comprises
software houses; production of packaged
software; consultancy; facilities management;
processing services; and the provision of
complete computer systems. It also includes
companies providing information technology
education and training, independent
maintenance, contingency planning and
recruitment, and contract staff.
The turnover of companies in the
Computing Services Association, which
represents some 75 per cent of the industry
in Britain, totalled almost £5,000 million in
1992. Important areas for software
development include data and word
processing, telecommunications, computer-
aided design and manufacturing, defence and
consumer electronics. The financial services
sector is a major user of computer services.
Management Consultancy
Management consultants provide business
solutions by giving advice and technical
assistance to business and government clients.
Typically, consultants identify and investigate
problems and opportunities, recommend
appropriate action and help to implement
recommendations. Many British-based
consultancies operate internationally—the
most recent trend has been for the largest
firms to set up offices in Eastern Europe.
The 34 member firms of the Management
Consultancies Association are among the
largest in the industry. In 1992 they earned
£696 million in Britain and £114 million
overseas.
Market Research
A wide range of clients and industries use
market research, and Britain accounts for
about 10 per cent of worldwide research
spending. The Association of Market Survey
Organisations is the main trade organisation
and in 1992 its member companies earned
total research revenues of £293 million.
Exhibition and Conference Centres
Britain is one of the world’s three leading
countries for international conferences—the
others being the United States and France.
London and Paris are the two most popular
conference cities. Some 95 towns and cities in
Britain now have facilities for conferences
and exhibitions.
Among the most modern purpose-built
conference and exhibition centres are the
International Conference Centre in
Birmingham and the Queen Elizabeth II and
Olympia Conference Centres, both in
London. Others are situated in Brighton
(East Sussex), Harrogate (North Yorkshire),
Bournemouth (Dorset), Cardiff, Birmingham,
Manchester, Nottingham and Torquay. In
Scotland both Glasgow and Aberdeen have
exhibition and conference centres, and an
International Conference Centre is being built
in Edinburgh. Other large exhibition facilities
are situated in London at the Barbican, Earls
Court/Olympia, Alexandra Palace and
Wembley Arena.
Many of the larger sites belong to a
marketing group, the British Conference and
Exhibition Centres Export Council. A new
4,000-seat Arena and World Trade Centre is
being developed in Cardiff.
Auction Houses
Britain’s chief auction houses are active in the
international auction markets for works of art,
trading on their acknowledged expertise. The
two largest houses, Sotheby’s and Christie’s,
are established worldwide. In 1994 Sotheby’s
celebrates its 250th anniversary. Sotheby’s
handled sales valued at £674 million in
1992, while Christie’s sales were valued at
£636 million.
Tourism and Travel
More than 1.4 million people are employed
in tourism, and the industry contributes some
£25,000 million annually to the economy—
about 4 per cent of gross domestic product.
There were a record 18.1 million visitors to
Britain in 1992, 9 per cent more than in
1991, when the number was unusually low as
194
FINANCE AND OTHER SERVICE INDUSTRIES
a result of recession in key markets and the
Gulf War. Overseas visitors’ total spending in
Britain exceeded £7,600 million in 1992. An
estimated 64 per cent of visitors came from
Europe and 18 per cent from North America.
Business travel accounts for about one-fifth of
all tourism overseas revenue. Britain’s tourist
attractions include theatres, museums, art
galleries, historic houses, as well as shopping,
sports and business facilities.
Some 98 per cent of travel agencies belong
to the Association of British Travel Agents
(ABTA). Although most travel agents are
small businesses, there are a few large firms—
such as Lunn Poly and Thomas Cook—which
have hundreds of branches. Computerised
information and booking systems are used
extensively in travel agencies. There are also
656 tour operator members of ABTA; about
half are both retail agents and tour operators.
ABTA operates financial protection schemes
to safeguard its members’ customers and
maintains codes of conduct drawn up with
the Government’s Office of Fair Trading. It
also offers a free consumer affairs service to
help resolve complaints against members and
an independent arbitration scheme for tour
operators’ customers.
Tourist Authorities
The Department of National Heritage is
responsible for tourism in England, and the
Scottish, Welsh, and Northern Ireland Offices
have responsibility for tourism in their
respective countries. The government-
supported British Tourist Authority (BTA)
promotes Britain overseas as a tourist
destination and encourages the development
of tourist facilities in Britain to meet the
needs of overseas visitors. The tourist boards
for England, Scotland, Wales and Northern
Ireland encourage the development and
promotion of domestic tourism and work
with the BTA to promote Britain overseas.
The BTA and the national tourist boards
inform and advise the Government on issues
of concern to the industry. They also help
businesses and public sector bodies to plan by
researching and publicising trends affecting
the industry. The national tourist boards
work closely with regional tourist boards, on
which local government and business
interests are represented. The national tourist
boards offer financial assistance to the
industry. There are 800 or so Tourist
Information Centres in Britain, operating an
information service for visitors.
Three accommodation classification and
grading schemes are operated by the national
tourist boards:
• the Crown scheme for hotels, guest
houses, inns, bed and breakfast and
farmhouse holiday accommodation. A
new Lodge category has been introduced
for purpose-built accommodation
alongside motorways and major roads;
• the Key (Dragons used in Wales) scheme
for self-catering holiday homes; and
• the Quality ‘Q^ scheme for holiday
caravan, chalet and camping parks.
Common standards are applied throughout
Britain. All participating establishments are
inspected every year, involving more than
25,000 inspections in 1991-92.

Overseas trade has been of vital importance to the British economy for
hundreds of years, and especially since the mid-19th century, when the rapid
growth of industry, commerce and shipping was accompanied by Britain’s
development as an international trading centre. Although small in area and
accounting for only about 1 per cent of the world’s population, Britain is the
fifth largest trading nation in the world, and, as a member of the European
Community, part of the world’s largest established trading bloc, accounting
for about a third of all trade.
Exports of goods and services in 1992 were
equivalent to about a quarter of gross
domestic product (GDP). Britain exports a
higher proportion of its output than many
other industrial nations. It is a leading
supplier of machinery, aerospace products,
pharmaceuticals and other chemicals, and
electrical and electronic equipment, and a
significant oil exporter. It relies upon imports
for about a third of total consumption of

foodstuffs, and for many of the basic
materials and semi-manufactures needed for
its industries.
VISIBLE TRADE
In 1992 Britain’s exports of goods were
valued at about £107,000 million and its
imports of goods at £121,000 million on a
balance-of-payments basis (see Table 15.1).
Between 1991 and 1992 the volume of exports
rose by almost 3 per cent and the value of
exports by more than 3 per cent. Over the
same period imports grew by 6 per cent in
terms of volume and total value.
Commodity Composition
Britain has traditionally been an exporter of
manufactured goods and an importer of food
and basic materials. In 1970 manufactures
accounted for 85 per cent of Britain’s exports.
The proportion fell in the early 1980s—to
around 67 per cent by the middle of the
decade—as North Sea oil exports increased
their share. The proportion of manufactures
in exports has since risen, to 82 per cent in
1992. The share of finished manufactures in
total imports rose from 25 per cent in 1970 to
53 per cent in 1992. Britain has not had a
surplus on manufactures since 1982.
Machinery and transport equipment account
for two-fifths of exports and a similar
proportion of imports. Aerospace, chemicals
and electronics have become more significant
export sectors, while textiles and vehicles have
declined in relative importance.
Since the mid-1970s North Sea oil has
made a significant contribution to Britain’s
overseas trade both in terms of exports and

BRITAIN 1994: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
import substitution. In 1992 exports of fuels
in volume terms were about four times their
1975 level; imports were around three-
quarters of their 1975 level. During this
period the share of fuels in exports changed
from 4 to 6 per cent and in imports from 18
to 5.5 per cent. North Sea oil production has
now passed its peak of the mid-1980s, when
exports of fuels accounted for over 20 per
cent of total exports. In 1992 the surplus on
trade in oil amounted to about £1,500 million.
Since the early 1960s Britain’s imports of
semi-manufactures have exceeded those of
basic materials; they are now more than six
times as high. This reflects the increasing
tendency for producing countries to carry out
the processing of primary products up to the
semi-finished or finished stage. Imported
manufactures have also taken a greater share
of the domestic market. The share of basic
materials in total imports has fallen from 15
per cent in 1970 to 4 per cent in 1992. The
share of food, beverages and tobacco in total
imports has been falling since the 1950s,
reaching almost 11 per cent in 1992, as a
result both of the increasing extent to which
food demand has been met from domestic
agriculture and the decline in the proportion
of total expenditure on food.
Geographical Distribution
Britain’s overseas trade is mainly—and
increasingly—with other developed countries.
In 1970 these accounted for 73 per cent of
exports and a similar proportion of imports;
by 1992 the shares were 81 and 83 per cent
respectively. In 1970 non-oil developing
countries accounted for 17 per cent of
Britain’s exports and 15 per cent of its
imports; by 1992 they accounted for 13 per
cent of Britain’s exports and 14 per cent of
its imports.
In 1972, the year before Britain joined the
European Community, around a third of
Britain’s trade was with the other 11

countries which today make up the
Community. The proportion rose to more
than one-half in 1992 and is expected to rise
further as a result of the completion of the
single European market (see p. 296). Western
Europe as a whole took nearly two-thirds of
Britain’s exports in 1992. Trade with other
Commonwealth countries has declined in
importance.
EC countries accounted for seven of
Britain’s top ten export markets and
for six of the ten leading suppliers of
goods to Britain in 1992 (see Table
15.3). From 1981 to 1989 the United
States was Britain’s largest single
market but it was overtaken in 1990 by
Germany. Germany is also Britain’s
largest single supplier. In 1992
Germany took almost 14 per cent of
Britain’s exports and supplied 15 per
cent of Britain’s imports.
of the oil-exporting countries during the
1970s led to a sharp increase in their imports
from all sources, and by the early 1980s they
were taking some 12 per cent of Britain’s
exports. However, by 1992, their share of
Britain’s exports had fallen to 6 per cent,
partly because of a reduction in the price of
oil. In 1973 the oil-exporting countries
supplied 10 per cent of Britain’s imports
but, with Britain achieving self-sufficiency
in oil, the proportion had fallen to 2 per cent
by 1992.
There were large increases in Britain’s
exports to Hong Kong, Indonesia, Malaysia
and Singapore in 1992. Japan has steadily
increased its share of Britain’s imports and
now accounts for around 6 per cent. Since
1980 the percentage of Britain’s total exports
to Japan has doubled, and Japan is Britain’s
tenth largest market.
INVISIBLE TRANSACTIONS
Transactions on invisible trade fall into three
main groups:
• internationally tradeable services;
There have been a number of other
changes in the pattern of Britain’s overseas
trade in recent years. The growth in wealth

• interest, profits and dividends on external
assets; and
• transfers between governments.
Britain’s earnings from invisible trade in
1992 were £108,000 million, exceeded only by
those of the United States and Japan.
Earnings from services alone in 1992 were
£33,000 million. Britain accounts for 6 per
cent of the world’s exports of services and 16
per cent of its credits on interest, profits and
dividends.
Services range from banking, insurance
and stockbroking, tourism, and shipping and
aviation to specialist services such as
consultancy, computer programming and
training. Britain’s trade in services has been
in surplus for about 200 years, excluding war
periods.
Interest, profits and dividends on external
assets have rarely been in deficit; transfers,
however, have almost always been in deficit.
For invisible trade as a whole, the deficit of
general government is more than offset by the
substantial surplus of the private sector
(including public corporations), resulting in
an overall surplus. General government
transactions are relatively unimportant in
either the services or the interest, profits and
dividends accounts but they form the greater
part of the transfers account. In 1992 the
private sector had a surplus of £12,300
million on invisible trade while government
had a deficit of £7,500 million.
Earnings from private sector services rose
in value by 7 per cent in 1992 to £32,400
million; debits, at £26,200 million, were 8 per
cent higher than a year previously. The
surplus on private sector interest, profits and
dividends was a record £6,300 million in
1992.
The deficit on private sector transfers in
1992 was £275 million, while that on
government transfers was £4,800 million.
COMMERCIAL POLICY
Britain remains committed to the open
multilateral trading system and to the further
liberalisation of world trade. To this end it
has taken a leading part in the activities of
such organisations as the General Agreement
on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), the
International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the
Organisation for Economic Co-operation and
Development (OECD). It has given full
support to the current round of multilateral
trade negotiations. Since 1973, when Britain
joined, the European Community has acted
for Britain in international trade negotiations.
The Community’s common customs tariff is,
at a trade-weighted average of 2.5 per cent,
similar to the tariffs of most major
industrialised countries.

OVERSEAS TRADE
Single European Market
The single European market programme,
launched in 1985, was completed on
1 January 1993, ensuring the free movement
of goods, services, people and capital within
the Community. It is providing substantial
opportunities for exporters. Member states
are trying to ensure that the market
operates efficiently, with even application
and enforcement of Community measures
throughout member countries.
General Agreement on Tariffs and
Trade
Tariffs and non-tariff barriers to trade have
been considerably reduced in the seven
rounds of multilateral trade negotiations
completed since 1947 under the auspices of
GATT, the most recent one completed
being the Tokyo Round (1973-79). Britain
participates in these negotiations as a
member of the European Community.
The eighth round of GATT multilateral
trade negotiations (the Uruguay Round) was
launched in 1986. It is the most ambitious
and wide-ranging round of trade
negotiations ever. The most recent stage of
negotiations started in February 1991. The
Uruguay Round’s main concerns are to:
• bring trade in agriculture and textiles
fully within the GATT system;
• achieve further reductions in tariff and
non-tariff barriers;
• extend GATT disciplines to the new
areas of intellectual property,
investment and services; and
• strengthen the GATT system, so that it
can deal more effectively with trade
distortions and disputes.
The extension of the deadline for the
completion of the talks under the ‘fast
track’ procedure proposed by the United
States allows more time to reach agreement
while maintaining the discipline of a
deadline. The British Government
continues to urge on all parties the
importance of a successful conclusion to the
Uruguay Round.
European Community Agreements
In October 1992 EC finance ministers agreed
on a package of measures that enabled fiscal
frontiers within the EC to be abolished from
January 1993. The agreement was a vital step
towards the completion of the single market
because it enabled businesses to transport
goods throughout the EC without stopping at
borders to deal with time-consuming
paperwork.
The EC signed an agreement in May 1992
with the members of the European Free
Trade Association (EFTA—Austria, Finland,
Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway, Sweden and
Switzerland) on the creation of the European
Economic Area (EE A). The EE A would have
been created on 1 January 1993 if all the
signatories had ratified the agreement by
then. However, following a referendum in
December 1992, Switzerland decided not to
participate, and will not be covered by the
agreement. The Community and the rest of
EFT A remain committed to the EE A and are
aiming for it to come into force as soon as
possible.
The European Economic Area would
form the world’s largest single market
area, with some 370 million
consumers and the free movement of
goods, services, capital and people
based on Community legislation.
At the European Council meeting in
December 1992, agreements were reached on
the promotion of economic recovery,
subsidiarity, openness, the future financing of
the Community and on arrangements for
enlarging its membership. Austria, Finland,
Norway and Sweden are currently negotiating
to join the EC and a target date of 1 January
1995 has been set for their accession.
Switzerland, Turkey, Malta and Cyprus have
also applied for membership.
The EC has reciprocal preferential trading
agreements with Cyprus, Israel, Malta and
Turkey and non-reciprocal agreements with
Algeria, Morocco, Tunisia, Egypt, Jordan, the
occupied territories, Lebanon, Syria and
former Yugoslavia and, under the Lome
Convention, with a group of 69 African,
201
BRITAIN 1994: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Caribbean and Pacific developing countries.
The Lome Convention gives these countries
tariff-free access, subject to certain
safeguards, to the EC for industrial goods
and most agricultural products. Tariff
preference is given to developing countries
under the Generalised System of Preferences,
and also to the Faroe Islands and the
overseas dependencies and territories of
member states.
Economic co-operation agreements exist
between the EC and several Latin American
countries, the People’s Republic of China,
the Association of South East Asian Nations
and the six members of the Gulf Co¬
operation Council. Negotiations are in
progress which may lead to the establishment
of a free trade area embracing the
Community and the Council.
Association agreements are in place
between the EC and Poland, Hungary, the
Czech Republic, Slovakia, Bulgaria and
Romania. They are designed to facilitate
closer political and economic ties and the
eventual creation of a free trade zone with a
view to those countries becoming full
members of the EC. Trade and economic co¬
operation agreements are also in place with
Albania, Slovenia and the Baltic states.
Negotiations for partnership and co-operation
agreements with the former Soviet Union
republics are also in progress.
CONTROLS ON TRADE
Britain maintains few restrictions on its
international trade. Most goods may be
imported freely and only a narrow range of
goods is subject to any sort of export control.
Import Controls
In accordance with its international
obligations under GATT and to the
European Community, Britain has
progressively removed almost all quantitative
import restrictions imposed on economic
grounds. The few remaining quantitative
restrictions mainly affect textile goods (in
view of the rapid contraction of the domestic
textile industry). They stem primarily from
the Multi-Fibre Arrangement (MFA), under
which a series of bilateral agreements cover
international trade in textiles, designed to
balance the interests of both exporting and
importing countries. The present MFA
expired in 1991 but has been extended
pending its phasing out as part of the
Uruguay Round of GATT. A small number
of quantitative restrictions are also maintained
against non-GATT countries. Quantitative
restrictions have been removed from imports
of goods of EC origin.
Britain continues to apply internationally
recognised restrictions on non-economic
grounds to imports from all countries of
products such as firearms, ammunition and
nuclear materials. Non-economic restrictions
are also applied to goods such as meat and
poultry; animals, birds, bees, fish and plants
and some of their derivatives; unlicensed
controlled drugs; explosives; fireworks;
certain offensive weapons; certain citizens’
band radios; indecent or obscene articles;
and products derived from endangered
species.
Export Controls
The great majority of British exports are not
subject to any government control or
direction except for presentation and
declaration to HM Customs and Excise to
enable them to exercise any necessary
controls and collect overseas trade statistics.
Controls govern the export of goods
associated with biological, chemical and
nuclear weapons and missiles. There are also
controls on the export of firearms, military
equipment and of dual-use industrial goods—
those that can be used for both civil and
military purposes.
Other controls include those for health
certification purposes on certain animals,
meat and fish exported to another member of
the EC; on endangered animal and plant
species; and on antiques and works of art,
including photographic material, documents,
manuscripts and archaeological items.
The Co-ordinating Committee for
Multilateral Export Controls (COCOM), of
which Britain is a member, has already
agreed on extensive relaxation in East/West
controls because of the political changes in
202
OVERSEAS TRADE
Eastern Europe. The break-up of the former
Soviet Union is expected to reduce these
controls still further.
Britain is a member of the Australia
Group and of the Missile Technology
Control Regime, international bodies which
aim to prevent the spread of weapons of mass
destruction. Britain has issued a list of
countries of concern, along with lists of
controlled goods and technologies used in the
production, handling or storage of nuclear,
chemical and biological weapons and missile
technology. Also listed are controlled dual-
use items. When new controls are introduced,
an attempt is made to minimise the
regulatory burden on business.
GOVERNMENT SERVICES
The Government assists exporters by creating
conditions favourable to the export trade and
by providing practical help, advice and
financial support. This includes a wide range
of services and assistance to meet the
requirements of exporters.
Export Promotion Services
Overseas Trade Services comprises the
leading government departments involved in
export promotion, including the Department
of Trade and Industry (DTI), the Foreign &
Commonwealth Office, the Industry
Department of the Welsh Office, Scottish
Trade International and the Industrial
Development Board of Northern Ireland.
There are around 2,000 staff worldwide,
based at the DTI in London, in 11 regional
offices around Britain and at 196 diplomatic
posts overseas.
The range of services available includes
the dissemination of export intelligence,
assistance in researching potential markets,
help at trade fairs and support for firms
participating in trade missions. In 1992-93
some £177 million was spent on support for
exporters. The proposed network of One-stop
Shops (see p. 145) will make the export
services operation more accessible.
Overseas Trade Services is advised by the
British Overseas Trade Board (BOTB),
which aims to:
• help improve the export performance of
British industry and commerce;
• guide the Government’s export
promotion efforts, including the
provision of export services; and
• provide advice on policy issues affecting
international trade and exports.
The BOTB’s Area Advisory Groups,
which are made up of business people with
expert knowledge of trade with particular
world markets, provide advice on the world’s
main trading areas. The Overseas Projects
Board advises on major project business
overseas and the Small Firms Committee on
matters relating to small businesses. Nearly
200 businessmen and women are involved in
the Board’s work.
Overseas Trade Services pays special
attention to the promotion of exports to its
top priority areas in Western Europe, North
America, and Japan and the Asia Pacific Rim.
These three areas contain the world’s largest
and richest markets, and account for more
than three-quarters of Britain’s exports.
Other targets include the many emergent
markets in South America, Africa, South Asia
and Australasia, where there is great potential
for growth and the markets are becoming
more open.
British Invisibles promotes Britain’s
financial and other services overseas. It seeks
to increase awareness of London as an
international financial centre and of the role
of the service sector in the British economy.
ECGD
ECGD (Export Credits Guarantee
Department) is a government department,
responsible to the President of the Board of
Trade. It provides medium- and long-term
support for projects and capital goods exports
sold on credit terms of two years or more. By
guaranteeing credit, ECGD helps British
exporters overcome many of the risks in
selling overseas. In order to encourage
investment in less developed countries,
ECGD also insures against the main political
risks of such investment.
The cover available to exporters was
extended in the 1992 Autumn Statement and
203
BRITAIN 1994: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
spring 1993 Budget. Particular attention is
being paid to increasing cover for exports to
countries like Hong Kong, China, Indonesia,
South Africa and Malaysia. ECGD’s
Insurance Services Group, dealing with
exports sold on credit terms of less than two
years, was sold to the private sector in 1991.
BALANCE OF PAYMENTS
The balance-of-payments statistics record
transactions between residents of Britain and
non-residents. The transactions are classified
into two groups: current account (visibles and
invisibles) and transactions in assets and
liabilities. The balance on current account
shows whether Britain has had a surplus of
income over expenditure.
Since 1983 Britain has had a deficit on
visible trade. It has traditionally run a surplus
on trade in invisibles. Between 1991 and 1992
the deficit on visible trade grew from £ 10,300
million to £13,400 million. The surplus on
invisibles rose from £2,600 million to £4,800
million. The surplus on services increased by
£412 million; that on interest, profits and
dividends by £5,500 million; and the deficit
on transfers grew by £3,700 million.
Capital Flows
Britain has no exchange controls; residents
are free to acquire foreign currency for any
purpose, including direct and portfolio
investment overseas. There are also no
controls on the lending of sterling abroad and
non-residents may freely acquire sterling for
any purpose. Gold may be freely bought and
sold. Exchange controls were abolished in
1979, and Britain meets in full its obligations
on capital movements under the OECD code
on capital movements and under EC
directives.
The Government welcomes both outward
and inward investment. Outward investment
helps to develop markets for British exports
while providing earnings in the form of
interest, profits and dividends. Inward
investment is promoted by DTPs Invest in
Britain Bureau as a means of introducing new
technology, products, management styles and
attitudes; creating employment; and
increasing exports or substituting imports.
Inward direct investment in 1992 was
£10,300 million, compared with £9,000
million in 1991. In 1992 direct investment
overseas by British residents was £9,400
million, £600 million more than a year
previously. Outward portfolio investment was
£32,800 million. The inflow of portfolio
investment into Britain amounted to £21,400
million. An analysis of transactions in
Britain’s external assets and liabilities is given
in Table 15.6.
External Assets and Liabilities
At the end of 1992 Britain’s identified
external assets exceeded identified external
liabilities by £27,000 million, compared with

£6,300 million a year earlier. Net assets of
the private sector and public corporations
amounted to £24,000 million and those of
general government to £3,300 million.
The significance of any inventory of
Britain’s aggregate external assets and
liabilities is limited because a variety of
claims and obligations are included that are
very dissimilar in kind, in degree of liquidity
and in method of valuation. For example,
while portfolio investment is valued at market
prices, direct investment is given at book
value, which is likely to understate its current
market value.
Direct investment assets overseas of
British residents (investment in branches,
subsidiaries and associated companies)
totalled £163,000 million at the end of 1992
and portfolio investment £304,000 million. At
the end of 1991 (the latest year for which
data are available) over 83 per cent of direct
investment was in developed countries, with
over 38 per cent in the United States and
nearly 27 per cent in the EC. In terms of
industries, manufacturing accounted for
36 per cent of direct investment holdings.
By type of company, oil companies were
responsible for 18 per cent, insurance
companies for 8 per cent and banks for
2 per cent.
Direct investment in Britain by overseas
residents amounted to £131,500 million at
the end of 1992 and portfolio investment to
£181,000 million. At the end of 1991,
investment from developed countries
accounted for 97 per cent of overseas direct
investment in Britain: 40 per cent originated
in the United States and 31 per cent in
the EC. A total of 34 per cent was in
manufacturing. Oil companies were
responsible for 23 per cent, banks for 8 per
cent and insurance companies for 4 per cent.

Britain is a major producer of fuels. Energy efficiency measures are a key
part of its national programme to reduce carbon dioxide emissions and to
conserve energy. More competition in the gas and electricity supply industries
is being encouraged. For the 12th year running the increase in known oil and
gas reserves has exceeded production.
The value of minerals produced in Britain in
1991 was £16,967 million (just over 4 per
cent of gross domestic product—GDP).
Crude oil accounted for 44 per cent, coal
24 per cent and natural gas 21 per cent.
With the exception of gold, silver, oil and
natural gas (owned by the Crown), and coal
and some minerals associated with coal,
minerals in Great Britain are mainly privately
owned. In Northern Ireland gold and silver
are owned by the Crown, while rights to
exploit petroleum and other minerals are
vested in the Department of Economic
Development.
On the United Kingdom Continental
Shelf (UKCS) the right to exploit all
minerals except coal is vested in the Crown.
The exclusive right to extract coal, or
license others to do so, both on land in Great
Britain and under the sea, is vested in the
British Coal Corporation. Normally,
ownership of minerals belongs to the owner
of the land surface, but in some areas,
particularly those with a long history of
mining, these rights have become separated.
Mining and quarrying, apart from deep coal
mining, are usually carried out by privately
owned companies.
Energy Resources
Britain has the largest energy resources of
any country in the European Community and
is a major world producer of oil, natural gas
and coal—called primary sources. The other
main primary sources are nuclear power and
some water power; secondary sources
(derived from primary sources) are electricity,
coke and smokeless fuels, and petroleum
products. In 1992 Britain was a small net
importer of energy, amounting to 11.3 million
tonnes of oil equivalent. In financial terms,
however, the higher value of its exports
meant that it was a net exporter of fuels, to
the value of £104 million. Coal is expected to
continue to supply a significant proportion of
the country’s energy needs. Nuclear power
provided about 24 per cent of electricity
supplied by the British electricity companies
in 1992.
206
ENERGY AND NATURAL RESOURCES
ENERGY POLICY
The President of the Board of Trade and the
Secretary of State for the Environment are
responsible for energy matters in Great
Britain, except for electricity in Scotland,
which is under the Secretary of State for
Scotland. The Secretary of State for Northern
Ireland is responsible for all energy matters
there.
Energy policy stresses the importance of
energy to a prosperous and successful
economy. Its aim is to ensure secure,
diverse and sustainable supplies of energy in
the forms that people and businesses want,
and at competitive prices. When pursuing this
aim, the Government has to consider Britain’s
health, safety and environmental policies, as
well as its EC and other international
commitments.
Key elements are to:
• encourage competition among producers
and choice for consumers, and to establish
a legal and regulatory framework to enable
markets to work well;
• ensure service in a commercial
environment, with consumers paying the
full cost of the energy resources they
consume;
• privatise state-owned industries where
possible, thus exposing them to the
discipline of the capital markets;
• promote energy efficiency; and
• promote wider share ownership.
Independent regulators have been
established by legislation. Their main role is to
encourage the development of competition and
to protect the interests of consumers by
administering price controls and enforcing
standards of service.
Privatisation
British Gas, Britoil, Enterprise Oil, and the
non-nuclear electricity supply industry in
Britain are in the private sector. The
Government intends to privatise the coal
industry as soon as possible, to give it the
freedom and flexibility it will need to compete
in the future. The Citizen’s Charter
commitment has been fulfilled by the
Competition and Service (Utilities) Act 1992.
This aims to give customers of privatised
utilities fair treatment and strengthens the
powers of regulators. Customers are to be
compensated when standards are not met and
greater competition introduced into the gas
industry.
International Commitments
Britain is actively engaged in international
collaboration on energy questions, notably
through its membership of the Community
and of the International Energy Agency
(IEA; an autonomous sub-body of the
Organisation for Economic Co-operation
and Development, with 23 member
countries).
Britain supports the continuing
development of the single market in energy,
in particular through the removal of obstacles
to trade in the Community’s gas and
electricity markets.
European Energy Charter
In 1991 Britain (along with other member
states of the Community and European Free
Trade Association, Eastern European
countries, the republics of the former Soviet
Union, the Baltic states, the United States,
Japan, Australia and Canada) signed the
European Energy Charter. Associated legally
binding agreements are currently under
negotiation. The main objectives are an open
competitive market for trade in energy,
including a framework for investment
promotion and protection; improving the
energy economies of Eastern Europe, the
former Soviet Union and the Baltic states;
and the security of supply of all participating

Energy Report
The Government intends to publish an
annual energy report to provide information
for business and investment. This will deal
with trends in energy supply and demand,
licensing activity, and regulatory
developments in the energy field.

An independent energy advisory panel will
advise on the preparation of the report.
Energy suppliers and energy users will serve
on the panel.
ENERGY CONSUMPTION
During 1981-93, when Britain’s GDP rose
by 26.7 per cent, final energy consumption
on a ‘heat supplied’ basis increased by only
9.5 per cent. Energy consumption by final
users in 1992 amounted to 60,153 million
therms1 on a ‘heat supplied’ basis, of which
transport consumed 32 per cent, industrial
users 25 per cent, domestic users 29 per cent,
and commerce, agriculture and public
services 14 per cent.
ENERGY EFFICIENCY
Britain’s consumers spend about £50,000
million a year on energy. The Energy
Efficiency Office (EEO), part of the
Department of the Environment, estimates
that 20 per cent—or £10,000 million—could
be saved. Energy efficiency improvements are
recognised as offering one of the fastest and
most cost-effective means of reducing carbon
dioxide (CO2) emissions. The EEO aims to
tackle barriers to investment in energy
efficiency improvements through special
programmes. It provides consumers with the
necessary information to make energy
efficiency improvements, supplemented by
1 1 therm = 105,506 kilojoules.
grant schemes where the need is greatest.
The EEO budget for 1993-94 has been
increased to nearly £70 million.
Technical information and advice on
the best energy efficient practice in
industry and buildings are researched
and disseminated under the EEO’s
Best Practice programme. Its target
is to achieve savings of £800 million a
year, along with increasing the
capacity of Combined Heat and Power
(CHP) to 5,000 megawatts (MW), by
2000. CHP produces usable heat as
well as electricity, is significantly
more efficient than conventional
energy, generates substantial energy
cost savings and is an environmentally
friendly technology.
The EEO operates two grant schemes.
The Home Energy Efficiency Scheme gives
advice and grants for low-income households
to carry out basic energy efficiency measures,
such as insulation of lofts, tanks and pipes,
and draughtproofing. The Energy
Management Assistance Scheme provides
companies employing fewer than 500 people
with financial help towards the cost of
consultancy advice on energy efficiency
investments, covering energy surveys,
feasibility studies and project management
costs.
Among the EEO’s publicity initiatives, the
‘Making a Corporate Commitment’ campaign
aims to encourage heads of companies and
208
ENERGY AND NATURAL RESOURCES
public sector organisations to make a
corporate commitment to responsible energy
management. Over 1,500 companies have
made the commitment. ‘Helping the Earth
Begins at Home’ includes television and
press advertising, and other publicity
initiatives. It stresses to householders the
fact that they can help combat global
warming by improving the energy efficiency
of their homes.
Other work includes the promotion of
home energy labelling and energy labelling
of domestic appliances. In addition, the
Department of the Environment’s Green
House Demonstration Programme has
established a network of demonstration
projects throughout England. Revisions to
the Building Regulations, including double
glazing, improved insulation, heating
controls, and home energy labelling, are also
under consideration.
The Government has established an
independent Energy Saving Trust, in
partnership with British Gas and the
electricity companies, to develop and
propose new programmes to promote the
efficient use of energy.
OIL AND GAS
Britain has substantial oil and gas reserves
offshore on the United Kingdom
Continental Shelf. The trend in offshore oil
and gas developments is towards the
exploitation of smaller reservoirs, and
advances in science and technology have
made this a more economic proposition.
A 20-year project to map the geology
of the UKCS offshore was completed
in 1992.
The Government must approve all plans
for the development of oil and gas fields. It
has granted exploration and production
licences as a result of 14 offshore licensing
rounds since 1964. The 13th (frontier)
round was aimed at promoting exploration
of deep water areas north and west of
Scotland. By the end of 1992, 5,144
wells had been or were being drilled in
the UKCS: 2,365 development wells,
1,734 exploration wells and 1,045 appraisal
wells.
Oil and Gas Licensing
In the 14th round, announced in June 1993
and the biggest in terms of blocks available
and applications received since 1971-72, 484
blocks were offered. Applications were
received for 128 blocks and 110 were
awarded. Thirty-three of the latter had not
previously been licensed or were relatively
lightly explored. These include blocks in the
English Channel, Cardigan Bay, Solway Firth
and the North Channel. There is interest in
the more mature areas of the UKCS. Blocks
were also licensed in frontier acreage in the
south-west approaches.
Licensing rounds have been held
approximately every two years, but companies
may now compete for licences outside the
formal round system where significant
prospects have been identified. Licences for
five blocks in the West of Shetland Basin and
seven blocks in the Cardigan Bay area were
granted ahead of the other 14th round
awards.
Offshore Supplies
The Offshore Supplies Office (OSO) of the
Department of Trade and Industry aims to
promote fair commercial opportunity in all oil
and gas markets, to support development of
the latest technologies and to foster British
exports.
UKCS activity in the engineering,
design and project management sectors was
down on the peak of 1991. British-based
companies maintained a good proportion of
the work available both at home and in
export markets.
Research
The Offshore Energy Technology Board
advises the OSO on its offshore technology
programme. The Petroleum Science and
Technology Institute, set up in Edinburgh in
1989, is funded by oil companies and the
OSO. It supports oil-related research in
British universities. The Offshore
Technology Park in Aberdeen comprises
several projects and is part-funded by
Scottish Enterprise.
209
BRITAIN 1994: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Economic and Industrial Aspects
In 1992 UKCS oil and gas production
accounted for about 1.3 per cent of Britain’s
gross national product at factor cost. Total
revenue from the sale of oil and gas produced
from the UKCS in 1992 is estimated to have
been £7,700 million and £3,000 million
respectively. Taxes and royalty receipts
attributable to UKCS oil and gas are estimated
to have been £1,350 million in 1992-93.
Expenditure on offshore and onshore
development amounted to some £5,400
million in 1992. This was about 22 per cent
of British industrial investment and 7 per
cent of gross domestic fixed capital
formation. Total investment between 1965
and 1992 came to about £52,000 million
(£94,000 million at 1992 prices). Some
29,500 people were employed offshore in
September 1992.
Offshore Safety
The Offshore Safety Act 1992 assists in
enabling the major recommendations of the
Cullen report of 1990 to be implemented. It
raises the maximum penalties for offences
which show a failure to manage health and
safety adequately and to comply with an
improvement or prohibition notice. The Act
will also allow the recommendations to be
implemented by regulations rather than
primary legislation. It completes the statutory
transfer of offshore safety responsibilities to
the Health and Safety Executive (HSE).
Government funding for the HSE’s Offshore
Safety Division will reach £35 million in
1994-95.
OIL
Before the 1970s Britain was almost wholly
dependent for its oil supplies on imports, the
only indigenous supplies coming from a few
land-based oilfields. However, the first
notable offshore discovery of oil in the
UKCS was made in 1969 and the first oil
brought ashore in 1975. Output of crude oil
in Britain in 1992 averaged over 1.93 million
barrels (about 257,300 tonnes) a day, making
Britain the world’s ninth largest producer.
North Sea Fields
There were 53 offshore fields producing
crude oil at the end of February 1993, and
nine new offshore development projects were
approved during the year.
Output is likely to increase until the
mid-1990s, and Britain should remain
self-sufficient in oil well into the 1990s
and a significant producer into the
21st century.
The fields with the largest cumulative
production totals are Forties and Brent.
Ninian, Piper, Beryl, Fulmar, Thistle and
Claymore are other high-producing fields.
Production from most large fields is
controlled from production platforms of
either steel or concrete which have been built
to withstand severe weather, including gusts
of wind of up to 260 km/h (160 mph) and
waves of 30 m (100 ft). The Petroleum Act
1987 lays down measures to be taken in
connection with the abandonment of offshore
installations and pipelines.
The Government’s oil policy encourages
exploration, development and investment—to
maximise economic oil production for the
foreseeable future. Remaining recoverable
reserves of UKCS oil in the proven plus
probable categories amount to 1,365 million
tonnes, while the total remaining potential of
the UKCS could be as high as 5,946 million
tonnes.
Structure of the Oil Industry
About 250 private sector companies,
including many large oil firms, operate in
Britain or engage in work in the UKCS.
Exploration and development of the UKCS
are carried out by the private sector. The
Government receives royalties from UKCS
oil.
The two leading British oil companies are
British Petroleum (BP) and Shell Transport
and Trading, which has a 40 per cent interest
in the Royal Dutch/Shell Group of
Companies. BP and Shell are the two largest
industrial companies in Britain in terms of
turnover.

Land-based Fields
Onshore production of crude oil is much less
significant than offshore production. In 1992,
however, it increased by 7 per cent to 3.96
million tonnes, 86 per cent of which came
from Britain’s largest onshore field at Wytch
Farm (Dorset), which started production in
1979. In addition to minor production from
various mining licensees, other onshore fields
include Welton (Lincolnshire) and Wareham
(Dorset). Small, independent companies play
an increasingly prominent role in onshore
exploration. At the end of 1992, 183
landward petroleum licences were in force,
covering an area of 26,629 sq km (10,281 sq
miles).
Refineries
At the beginning of 1993 the distillation
capacity of Britain’s 11 major oil refineries
stood at 91.7 million tonnes a year. Excess
crude distillation capacity has largely been
eliminated, while existing refineries have been
adapted to the changing pattern of demand
by the construction of upgrading facilities (for
example, ‘catalytic crackers’), which are
leading to a higher output of lighter products,
mainly petrol, at the expense of fuel oil.
Consumption and Trade
Deliveries of petroleum products for inland
consumption (excluding refinery
consumption) in 1992 included 23.9 million
tonnes of motor spirit, 9.1 million tonnes of
kerosene, 18.9 million tonnes of gas and
diesel oil (including derv fuel used in road
vehicles), and 11.2 million tonnes of fuel oil.
Virtually all exports went to Britain’s
partners in the European Community
and the IEA, the largest markets being the
Netherlands, France, Germany, Canada
and the United States. Though self-
sufficient, Britain continues to import other
crude oils, to enable the full range of
petroleum products to be made efficiently
and economically.
Oil Pipelines
Oil pipelines brought ashore about 78 per
cent of offshore oil in 1992. Some 2,024 km
212
ENERGY AND NATURAL RESOURCES
(1,265 miles) of major submarine pipeline
brings oil ashore from the North Sea
oilfields. Major crude oil onshore pipelines
in operation from harbours, land terminals or
offshore moorings to refineries include those
connecting Grangemouth to Finnart,
Cruden Bay to Grangemouth, and Purbeck
to Southampton. Onshore pipelines also
carry refined products to major marketing
areas; for example, a 423-km (263-mile)
pipeline runs from Milford Haven to the
Midlands and Manchester, while similar
pipelines also run from Fawley to
Wolverhampton and from Lindsey to north
London. Chemical pipelines include one
from Mossmorran to Grangemouth and
another (405 km—252 miles) from
Grangemouth to Stanlow.
GAS
Public supply of manufactured gas in Britain
began in the early 19th century in central
London. For many years gas was produced
from coal, but during the 1960s growing
imports of oil brought about production of
town gas from oil-based feedstocks.
Following the first commercial natural gas
discovery in the UKCS in 1965 and the start
of offshore gas production in 1967, supplies
of offshore natural gas grew rapidly and by
1977 natural gas had replaced town gas in
the public supply system in Great Britain.
Some £13,530 million has been spent on
developing natural gas resources on the
UKCS and 896,284 million cubic metres
have been produced. Britain is the world’s
fifth largest gas producer.
Structure
The gas industry in Great Britain, in state
ownership since 1949, was privatised in
1986. British Gas pic supplies gas to
consumers in accordance with its
authorisation as a public gas supplier under
the Gas Act 1986. It is currently the only
public gas supplier. It has, however, an
obligation to act as a common carrier for
other companies. In early 1993 there were
about 30 independent companies supplying
gas in competition with British Gas, using
the company’s transport network. The
regulatory regime for the private gas sector
was established by the Gas Act 1986 and
places responsibility on the Office of Gas
Supply (Ofgas) for ensuring that British Gas
is operating within the terms of its
authorisation as a public gas supplier. The
Act also established the Gas Consumers’
Council, independent of both British Gas
and Ofgas, and responsible for investigating
consumer complaints.
British Gas has about 2 million private
and institutional shareholders. In 1992
the turnover of British Gas and its
subsidiary companies amounted to
£10,254 million, of which gas supply in
Britain accounted for £8,129 million.
Current cost operating profit was
£1,429 million. British Gas has about
76,000 employees in Britain.
Production
In 1992 indigenous production of natural gas
amounted to 55,179 million cubic metres.
This included 3,810 million cubic metres of
gas used for drilling, production and
pumping operations on North Sea
production platforms and at terminals. Total
availability of UKCS gas amounted to
51,369 million cubic metres—1 per cent
lower than in 1991. In addition, 6,000
million cubic metres of gas were imported
from Norway. British production of gas
accounts for some 20 per cent of total
primary fuel consumption in Britain.
Natural gas from the seven largest of the 37
gasfields—Leman, Indefatigable, Ravenspurn
North, Hewett and Della, Audrey, Amethyst
and Viking—accounted for over one-third of
the total gas produced in the UKCS. In
addition to supplies from gasfields,
associated gas delivered to land via the Far
North Liquids and Associated Gas System
(FLAGS) and from Alwyn North made
further significant contributions. Gas from
the South Morecambe field in the Irish Sea
and from the twin North Sean and South
Sean fields is used to augment supplies to
meet peak demand in winter.
213
ENERGY AND NATURAL RESOURCES
Reserves
Remaining recoverable gas reserves are
estimated at between 610,000 million and 1.02
million million cubic metres. If possible gas
from existing discoveries and potential future
discoveries are added, total reserves are
estimated to be in the range of 1.88 million
million to 4.32 million million cubic metres.
Indigenous offshore natural gas reserves are
likely to meet most of the British demand
well into the next century.
Transmission and Storage
The British Gas national and regional high-
pressure pipeline system of some 17,900 km
(11,125 miles) transports natural gas around
Great Britain. It is supplied from four North
Sea shore terminals, and from a terminal in
Barrow-in-Furness (Cumbria). The high-
pressure transmission system is inspected
regularly, using a British Gas invention, the
‘intelligent pig’.
Newly built natural gas pipelines, not
operated by British Gas, run from Horndean
to Barking and from Theddlethorpe to
Killingholme.
Various methods of storage of natural gas
to meet peak load conditions are used,
including salt cavities and storage facilities for
liquefied natural gas. British Gas has also
developed the partially depleted Rough field
as a major gas store. This, the first such use
of an offshore field, involves the injection into
the Rough reservoir in summer of gas drawn
from the national transmission system for
recovery at high rates during periods of peak
winter demand.
Consumption
Sales of natural gas in Britain totalled 593
terawatt hours (TWh) in 1992. About 44 per
cent of this is for industrial and commercial
purposes, the remainder being for domestic
use by 17.8 million consumers. Gas is used
extensively in industries requiring the control
of temperatures to a fine degree of accuracy,
such as the pottery and glass industries, and
in certain processes for making iron and
steel products.
Some 160 TWh of this gas were sold to
industry in Britain, and 100 TWh to
commercial (including other non-domestic)
users. Industrial gas prices have fallen by
about 36 per cent in real terms since
privatisation, and domestic prices by 16 per
cent. An increasingly large part of domestic
demand is for gas for central heating. In
1992, 330 TWh were sold to domestic users.
Research
British Gas has a worldwide reputation for
gas technology, with a research and
development programme costing £89 million
in 1992. It is involved in joint research with
overseas gas companies. The company is
assisting utilities in over 20 countries in
transmission, distribution and other
areas. British Gas is today exploring for
and producing gas and oil in some 20
countries.
Competition in Gas Marketing
An inquiry into the gas market by the
Monopolies and Mergers Commission was
completed in 1993. It followed two references
by the Government into the supply,
conveyance and storage of gas, and two
references by the Director General of Gas
Supply into conveyance and storage, and
fixing of tariffs for gas supply.
Two key issues for the Government arise
from the inquiry’s two reports: the future
structure of British Gas and the possible
relaxing of its statutory monopoly in
supplying gas to domestic customers.
COAL
Coal mining in Britain can be traced back
to Roman times. It played a crucial part
in the industrial revolution of the 18th and
19th centuries. In its peak year, 1913, the
industry produced 292 million tonnes of coal,
exported 74 million tonnes and employed
over 1 million workers. In 1947 (when 200
million tonnes were produced) the coal mines
passed into public ownership, and the
National Coal Board (now the British Coal
Corporation) was set up. The Government

has reduced the debt under which the
industry was operating and eliminated
accumulated liabilities incurred by British
Coal.
British Coal licenses private operators to
work mines with an employee limit of 150
and opencast sites.
Its deep and opencast mines are to be
offered for sale in five businesses—based on
Scotland, Wales, the North East and the
Central Coalfield (in two parts).
Market for Coal
Some 80 per cent of the 101 million tonnes
(British and imported) consumed in 1992
were used for electricity generation.
Increasing competition in this market has put
greater pressure on the coal industry to
reduce costs. In 1990 British Coal signed
three-year contracts with the electricity
generators in England and Wales, giving it a
guaranteed market for much of its output—
65 million tonnes in 1992-93. Five-year
contracts were signed with the Scottish
electricity supply industry.
In 1993 agreement was reached for British
Coal to supply 160 million tonnes of coal to
the generators in England and Wales over
five years.
However, long-term contracts for the
supply of gas for electricity generation,
improvement in nuclear output, and cheaper
coal from overseas, have helped to squeeze
British Coal markets.
Production
In 1992-93 total output of 80.8 million tonnes
comprised 61.8 million tonnes of British Coal
deep-mined coal, 15 million tonnes from its
opencast mines and 4 million tonnes from
licensed mines (deep and opencast). In March
1992 there were 50 British Coal collieries in
operation and 44,000 miners (compared with
850 and 695,000 in 1955).
In October 1992 British Coal announced
that it would close 31 deep mines: ten as
loss-making with no prospect of viability and
21 as without a market for their coal. The
Government accepted these proposals, but
subsequently established a review of the
prospects for the 21 pits (see above), as well
as a range of related issues. Its conclusions
were published in a White Paper in March
1993: the October assessment of the prospects
for coal had been realistic, but temporary
support should be given to the coal industry
to give it a better chance of a competitive
future. The Government would therefore
make a subsidy available to allow the
deep-mine industry a chance of additional
sales for electricity generation at world-
related prices.
Of the 21 pits covered by the review, 12
are to continue to produce while British Coal
seeks additional sales; six are to be put on a
care and maintenance basis; one (Maltby in
South Yorkshire) is to be developed as a low-
cost mine; and two are to be closed. British
Coal is to offer to the private sector any pit
which it does not intend to continue in
production.
British Coal Opencast also had 45 sites in
operation at the end of March 1993.
Since 1984, British Coal, through its job
creation activity, British Coal Enterprise, has
helped create job opportunities for 87,500
people in areas where mining was previously
the main source of employment.
Development
Britain has the largest hard-coal industry in
Western Europe, and one of the world’s most
technologically advanced. British Coal’s
investment programme amounted to
£186 million in 1992-93. A new colliery,
Asfordby (Leicestershire), is expected to
begin production by April 1994. It is being
designed as a single longwall operation,
employing approximately 450 people and
producing about 1.75 million tonnes a year.
Companies under government licence are
prospecting in Northern Ireland to determine
the extent of significant reserves, possibly
over 1,000 million tonnes, of lignite (brown
coal) in the clay basins around Lough Neagh
and at Ballymoney.
Consumption
In 1992-93 inland consumption of coal was
97.6 million tonnes, of which 78 per cent was
217
BRITAIN 1994: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
by power stations, 9 per cent by coke ovens
and 4 per cent by domestic users. British
Coal sales of coal to power stations totalled
66.5 million tonnes in 1992-93. Exports of
coal in 1992-93 were 0.6 million tonnes,
while imports amounted to 19.8 million
tonnes.
Research
Over £500 million has been spent by the
public sector in Britain on coal utilisation
research and development since the early
1980s. Some £1,000 million has been spent, if
all coal research and development work were
to be included. The Government has
increased its support for coal research and
development from £3 million to £7 million a
year during 1993-94. Most of this additional
funding will be used to secure the future of
the Coal Research Establishment before its
transition to the private sector is completed.
Among clean coal technologies being
exploited in Britain, about 100 fluidised bed
boilers are used in industry, and two
advanced systems, Integrated Gasification
Combined Cycle and Pressurised Fluidised
Bed Combustion, are being demonstrated on
a commercial scale in Europe. The British
Coal topping cycle programme, in which
some of the coal is converted to hot gas for
use in a gas turbine and the remaining char is
burnt in a fluidised bed to raise steam for a
conventional steam turbine, is to be taken
forward by an industry-led consortium. The
Government and the EC are to contribute to
the development phase.
The coal liquefaction plant at Point of Ayr
(Clwyd) opened in 1990 at a cost of £40
million. It converts 2.5 tonnes of coal a day
into petrol, diesel and other transport fuels.
ELECTRICITY
England and Wales
The privatised electricity supply industry in
England and Wales consists of three main
generating companies, the National Grid
Company (NGC) and 12 regional electricity
companies (RECs). The two main non¬
nuclear generators, National Power and
PowerGen, the publicly owned nuclear
generator, Nuclear Electric pic, and other
generators and importers sell electricity to
suppliers through a market known as the
pool. The NGC operates the transmission
system—the bulk transfer of electricity
across the national grid—and owns the
pumped storage stations at Dinorwig and
Ffestiniog. It is owned by the RECs through
a holding company.
Distribution and supply of electricity are
the business of the RECs. Distribution
involves transfer of electricity from the
national grid and its delivery, across local
systems, to consumers. Supply is the sale of
electricity to customers. Each REC is
authorised to supply any premises within its
area. Other companies may obtain a second-
tier licence to supply, although initially
competition is limited to premises with a
maximum consumption of 1 MW. This limit
will be reduced to 100 kW in April 1994.
The Government retains approximately
40 per cent of the issued ordinary share
capital of each of National Power and
PowerGen.
Scotland
Industry restructuring in Scotland created
three companies. Scottish Power pic and
Scottish Hydro-Electric pic generate,
transmit, distribute and supply electricity.
They are also contracted to buy all the
output from Scottish Nuclear Ltd, a
government-owned company which operates
the nuclear power stations at Hunterston
(Strathclyde) and Torness (Lothian), and
have contracts to share the output from each
other’s generation capacity. Opportunities
exist to export and import electricity to and
from the pool (see above).
Associated Functions
Certain service and co-ordinating functions
for the industry are undertaken by the
Electricity Association, jointly owned by the
electricity companies of Great Britain.
Regulation of the industry is the
responsibility of the Office of Electricity
Regulation, headed by the Director General

of Electricity Supply, whose duties include
the promotion of competition and the
protection of consumer interests.
Northern Ireland
After the restructuring of its electricity
supply industry Northern Ireland’s four
power stations were transferred to the private
sector by means of a trade sale in 1992. The
flotation of Northern Ireland Electricity
(NIE) pic in 1993 completed the privatisation
of the industry. Regulation is shared between
the Department of Economic Development
and the Director General of Electricity
Supply (NI).
Consumption
In 1991 sales of electricity through the
distribution system in Britain amounted to
280,143 gigawatt hours (GWh). Domestic
users took 36 per cent of the total, industry
33 per cent, and commercial and other users
the remainder. About 24 per cent of domestic
2 1 GW = 1,000 MW.
sales is for space heating, 13 per cent for
water heating and 8 per cent for cooking.
Electricity is used in industry mainly for
motive power, melting, heating and lighting.
Generation
National Power owns 35 operational fossil-
fuelled power stations which generate about
46 per cent of the electricity supplied to the
transmission and distribution networks in
England and Wales. PowerGen owns 19
fossil-fuelled power stations which generate
about 30 per cent of this electricity. The 11
nuclear stations of Nuclear Electric generate
almost 22 per cent.
In 1992-93, 47 per cent of electricity
supplied in Scotland was produced by
Scottish Nuclear’s two stations. In addition to
nuclear generation, Scotland’s electricity
needs are met from hydro generation, coal
generation and, from 1992, from gas
generation, using gas from the Miller field at
Peterhead power station. All of Scottish
Nuclear’s production is sold to Scottish
Power and Hydro-Electric in the proportions
74.9 per cent and 25.1 per cent respectively.
220
ENERGY AND NATURAL RESOURCES
Non-nuclear power stations owned by
Britain’s major generating companies
consumed 69.7 million tonnes of oil
equivalent in 1992, of which coal accounted
for 66 per cent and oil 7 per cent.
Independent generators are allowed to
compete on equal terms with the major
generators and have equal access to the grid
transmission and local distribution systems.
To control acid emissions the Government
expects National Power and PowerGen each
to fit flue gas desulphurisation (FGD)
equipment to 4 GW of their existing coal-
fired power stations. Work is in progress
towards fitting FGD equipment to National
Power’s Drax station (North Yorkshire).
PowerGen is retrofitting 2 GW of FGD to its
Ratcliffe on Soar power station
(Leicestershire). Scottish Power expects to fit
FGD as necessary at its main coal station,
Longannet. In addition, a ten-year
programme to control nitrogen oxide (NOx)
emissions through the installation of low-NOx
burners at the 12 major power stations in
England and Wales is in progress. Scottish
Power is fitting low-NOx burners at
Longannet.
The pumped storage station at
Dinorwig (Gwynedd), the largest of its
type in Europe, has an average
generated output of 1,728 MW. In
pumped storage schemes electricity
generated in off-peak periods is used to
pump water to high-level reservoirs,
from which it descends to drive
turbines, rapidly providing a large
supply of electricity at peak periods or
to meet sudden increases in demand.
For new stations the trend is towards the
construction of combined cycle gas turbines
(CCGTs). They are less costly to build than
other types of station, and have shorter
construction times and lower capital costs.
Their use of natural gas, low in sulphur, also
helps to reduce acid and CO2 emissions. In
England and Wales, 18 such stations over
50 MW are commissioned or under
construction. Britain’s first independent
CCGT station, in Cumbria, was opened in
1991. Some 1.3 per cent of electricity in
Britain was derived from gas in 1992.
The NGC, together with Electricite de
France, runs a 2,000-MW cross-Channel
cable link, providing the capacity for the
transmission of electricity between the two
countries. An eight-year export contract
agreed in 1993 represents potential sales of
over £100 million from Britain to France.
Transmission lines linking the Scottish
and English grid systems enable cross-border
trading. This interconnector is run jointly by
the NGC and Scottish Power. Work is in
progress to increase its capacity from 850
MW to 1,600 MW by 1994-95. NIE pic and
Scottish Power have plans to construct a 250-
MW interconnector between Scotland and
Northern Ireland, to come into use in 1997.
Nuclear Power
In 1956 the world’s first industrial-scale
nuclear power station, at Calder Hall
(Cumbria), began to supply electricity to the
national grid. There are in Britain 13
commercial nuclear power stations operated
by Nuclear Electric and Scottish Nuclear.
The former has six Magnox stations (with
capacities ranging from 245 to 840 MW) and
five Advanced Gas-cooled Reactor stations
(AGRs; ranging from 1,020 MW to
1,320 MW). Scottish Nuclear operates two
1,320 MW AGR stations. Completion of a
pressurised water reactor (PWR) of
1,175 MW at Sizewell (Suffolk) is expected
in 1994. There are also three Magnox stations
which have been shut down and are in the
process of being decommissioned.
Two main advantages are recognised in
continued nuclear power generation: first, it
increases diversity of energy supply and helps
maintain its security; and secondly, nuclear
stations produce no sulphur dioxide (SO2),
NOx or CO2. The Government wishes to
maintain the nuclear option, but only if
nuclear power can demonstrate that it is more
competitive with other sources. Work on the
Government’s full-scale review of nuclear
power is set to begin in late 1993.
In England and Wales a ‘fossil fuel
levy’ has been introduced, currently set at
10 per cent, on electricity sales. Most of the
revenue raised is to pay a premium to nuclear
221
BRITAIN 1994: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
generators, as the cost of producing energy
from nuclear sources is greater than that of
producing it from fossil fuel sources. The
levy is expected to raise £9,100 million to
help cover the unavoidable costs associated
with the closure of existing stations and the
reprocessing and disposal of spent fuel. It is,
however, set to be phased out by 1998, when
it is hoped that nuclear power generation will
be economically competitive.
British Nuclear Fuels
British Nuclear Fuels pic (BNFL) provides
services covering the whole nuclear fuel
cycle. All of its shares are held by the
Government.
BNFL’s major project is the thermal oxide
reprocessing plant (THORP), construction of
which has been completed at a cost of some
£2,800 million, including its share of
associated facilities. Further consultation
before opening is in progress. THORP has
been built to reprocess spent fuel from
British and overseas oxide reactors. At the
same time, BNFL plans to bring into
operation the latest of its waste management
and effluent treatment facilities. The
enhanced actinide removal plant (EARP) will
use a revolutionary ultrafiltration process to
provide further treatment facilities for low-
level liquid radioactive streams.
Nuclear Research
Almost all the nuclear research and
development funded by the Department of
Trade and Industry is carried out by the
United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority
(UKAEA). The UKAEA, which operates
commercially as AEA Technology, offers a
wide range of science and engineering
services and has four nuclear businesses
involved in research and development, the
provision of reactor fuel services, and
decommissioning and radioactive waste
management. Work is carried out at six sites:
Harwell and Culham (Oxfordshire), Risley
(Cheshire), Winfrith (Dorset), Windscale
(Cumbria) and Dounreay (Highland).
Co-operation on nuclear energy between
Britain and other countries takes place within
a framework of intergovernmental agreements
and through membership of bodies such as
the International Atomic Energy Agency
based in Vienna and the Nuclear Energy
Agency in Paris. There are also direct links
between AEA Technology and corresponding
establishments overseas.
Britain is also a partner in the co-operative
research programmes of the European Atomic
Energy Community (Euratom). A major
component of this programme is the Joint
European Torus (JET) nuclear project at
Culham, a world leader in this branch of
research.
Nuclear Safety
Britain has a rigorous system of nuclear
safety regulation, enforced by the HSE’s
Nuclear Installations Inspectorate, which
ensures that high standards of safety are
incorporated into the design, construction,
operation, maintenance and decommissioning
of all nuclear plant, and eventual disposal of
resulting wastes. While the safety of such
plant in Britain is the ultimate responsibility
of the nuclear operator, the Inspectorate has
the power to shut down a plant if it is
believed to be unsafe and may also require
improvements to an installation if it thinks
the appropriate standards of safety are not
being met.
Discharges have to be kept within the
limits and conditions set by authorisations
granted under the Radioactive Substances Act
1960. In England and Wales separate
authorisations are required from the
Secretaries of State for the Environment and
for Wales, and from the Minister of
Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, and in
Scotland from the Secretary of State for
Scotland. Within maximum dose limits,
operators of nuclear facilities are required to
keep discharges as low as is reasonably
achievable and failure to do so makes them
liable to prosecution.
Emergency Plans
The precautions taken in the design and
construction of nuclear installations in
Britain, and the high safety standards in their
222
ENERGY AND NATURAL RESOURCES
operation and maintenance, reduce the chance
of accidents which might affect the public to
an extremely low level. However, all operators
are required, as a condition of their site
licences, to prepare emergency plans,
including those for dealing with an accidental
release of radioactivity; these are regularly
tested in exercises under the supervision of
the Nuclear Installations Inspectorate.
International conventions have been
established on the early notification of a
nuclear accident which may have possible
transboundary effects, and on the mutual
provision of assistance in the event of a
nuclear accident or radiological emergency.
NEW AND RENEWABLE SOURCES OF
ENERGY
The Government encourages development of
new and renewable technologies which
promise to be economically attractive and
environmentally acceptable—to contribute to:
• diverse, secure and sustainable energy
supplies;
• a reduction in the emission of pollutants;
and
• encouragement of internationally
competitive renewables industries.
The Government aims to work towards a
figure of 1,500 MW of new electricity
generating capacity from renewable energy
sources, for Britain as a whole, by 2000.
Under the non-fossil fuel obligation (NFFO),
by mid-1993 two renewables orders had
resulted in contracts for 197 renewables
projects, with a total capacity of over
600 MW. In 1993 the third NFFO
renewables order for England and Wales, and
the first for Scotland and Northern Ireland,
were announced.
Research and development policy
concentrates resources on key technologies—
biofuels, wind, hydro, solar and fuel cells—
and aims to remove inappropriate market
barriers. Emphasis on technology transfer
continues. Expenditure on the Government’s
renewables programme for 1992-93 was about
£24 million.
International collaboration is undertaken
through multilateral and bilateral
arrangements within the IEA and the
European Community. These include Joule,
Thermie and Altener.
Wind
Wind energy is one of the most promising
renewable energy sources, with the potential
to contribute perhaps 10 per cent of Britain’s
electricity needs. The Government’s
research and development expenditure was
£8.7 million in 1992-93. Its programme has
provided a strong technical base and a
reliable assessment of the size and cost of
Britain’s resource. Through the NFFO wind
energy has the opportunity to prove itself
commercially.
Tidal
The programme, on which the Government
spent £1.7 million in 1992-93, aims to reduce
the technical, economic and environmental
uncertainties associated with tidal barrages
through a number of site and generic studies.
Wave
A review of wave power, published in 1992
after consultation with members of Britain’s
wave energy community, covers all the
leading British wave devices from shoreline to
offshore. Britain is collaborating in a
European programme which is assessing the
prospects for wave power. Government
research and development expenditure was
some £300,000 in 1992-93.
Biofuels
The programme, which received £3.2 million
for research and development in 1992-93,
includes work on further understanding of,
and increasing the energy available from,
landfill gas, and on the preparation and
combustion of refuse and dry wastes,
including straw and forestry residues. The
latter are closely connected to the exploitation
of short-rotation arable coppice, an energy
crop which could exploit land not required
for growing food.
223
BRITAIN 1994: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Solar
A major element of the programme is the
Energy Design Advice Scheme, which aims
to improve the energy and environmental
performance of building stock. The
Government provided £2.3 million on solar
energy research and development
expenditure in 1992-93.
The photovoltaic industry has
considerable potential, particularly in the
export market. The Government is assessing
the potential of buildings-integrated
photovoltaic systems, the most promising
application in Britain.
Geothermal Hot Dry Rocks
The aim of the current programme (costing
£1.1 million in 1992-93), in collaboration
with the European programme, is to exploit
the expertise developed in Britain and to
pursue opportunities for transferring the
technology to industry.
Technology Dissemination
Marketing and promoting renewables has
seen a shift of emphasis from technology
towards promotion to likely users and
developers. Established in 1991, the
commercialisation part of the programme
aims to remove a number of barriers to
investment in renewables. Resource studies
with potential developers, planning policy
studies with local authorities and contacts
with possible financiers are key activities.
Non-fuel Minerals
Although much of Britain’s requirements for
industrial raw materials is met by imports,
the non-fuel minerals it produces make an
important contribution to the economy.
Output of non-fuel minerals in 1991 totalled
over 335 million tonnes, valued at £1,814
million. Construction raw materials, in
particular aggregates, form the bulk of the
value of non-fuel minerals production. The
total number of employees in the extractive
industry was some 43,500 in 1991.
Exploration
The British Geological Survey is carrying out
a long-term programme for the Department
of Trade and Industry aimed at identifying

areas with mineral potential. Gold exploration
by the private sector has decreased, but
continues, especially in Scotland, Northern
Ireland and south-west England. In Wales
small-scale production of gold takes place at
the Gwynfynydd and Clogau mines.
Production
In terms of value, production of limestone
and dolomite was estimated at £529 million
in 1991, sand and gravel £459 million, clays
£266 million, igneous rock £224 million,
sandstone £67 million, potash £64 million,
salt £48 million, silica sands £46 million,
chalk £43 million, gypsum and anhydrite
£22 million, fuller’s earth £14 million,
fluorspar £10 million and tin £7 million. In
1992 the production of metals in non-
ferrous ores totalled 2,500 tonnes, mainly tin
from Cornwall. South Crofty, the one
remaining Cornish mine and one of the very
few sources of tin in the Community,
produced some 2,040 tonnes of tin-in-
concentrate in 1992, equivalent to about
20 per cent of Britain’s demand. Some lead
and a little zinc are produced as by-products
of fluorspar.
Water
Britain’s water supplies are obtained partly
from surface sources such as mountain lakes,
streams dammed in hills and lowland river
intakes, and partly from underground sources.
About 99 per cent of the population in Great
Britain and 97 per cent in Northern Ireland
are served by the public water supply system.
Water put into the public supply system in
England and Wales amounted to about 16,500
megalitres (Ml) a day in 1992 and average
daily consumption per head was 0.324 Ml. An
average of 2,239 Ml a day was supplied in
Scotland in 1991-92.
Some 33,463 Ml a day were abstracted
in England and Wales in 1991, of which
public water supplies accounted for 17,563
Ml a day. The electricity generating
companies and other industry took some
16,400 Ml a day. Agriculture took 500 Ml
a day.
England and Wales
The Secretaries of State for the Environment
and for Wales, the Director General of Water
Services and the National Rivers Authority
(NRA) are the principal regulators of the
privatised (since 1989) water industry. The
Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food
and the Secretary of State for Wales are
responsible for policy relating to land
drainage, flood protection, sea defence, and
the protection and development of fisheries.
The Drinking Water Inspectorate regulates
drinking water quality.
Water Companies
The ten water service companies are the
principal operating subsidiaries of the ten
water holding companies. They have
statutory responsibilities for water supply,
quality and adequacy, and for sewerage and
sewage treatment. The supply-only
companies, of which there were 29 in the
private sector in 1989, now number 22. They
supply water to about a quarter of the
population.
The Water Industry Act 1991 allows the
water companies to determine their own
methods of charging. An alternative to the
charging system based on rateable values,
however, must be found by the year 2000.
Water metering is one of the choices being
considered. Customers may choose to pay to
have a water meter installed. In general,
companies require new properties to have
metered supplies.
A system of economic regulation and
guaranteed standards of service is overseen by
the Director General of Water Services. The
Water Supply (Water Quality) Regulations
1989 define wholesomeness and incorporate
the requirements of the EC’s drinking water
directive. They impose physical, chemical
and microbiological standards for water
intended for domestic and food production
purposes. The task of the Drinking Water
Inspectorate is to ensure that drinking water
is wholesome and that companies comply
with the Regulations. Of 3.75 million tests
carried out in 1992, 98.7 per cent came
within the legal limits.
226
ENERGY AND NATURAL RESOURCES
National Rivers Authority
The NRA, the environmental regulator, is a
non-departmental public body with statutory
duties and powers in relation to water
resources, pollution control, flood defence,
fisheries, recreation, conservation and
navigation in England and Wales. The water
environment for which it has responsibility
includes all rivers, lakes, reservoirs,
estuaries, coastal waters and water stored
naturally underground. The NRA’s consent
is needed for the abstraction of water and
for discharges to water.
Development Projects
The water industry in England and Wales is
committed to a ten-year investment
programme costing over £30,000 million at
1989-90 prices. Thames Water’s 80-km
(50-mile) distribution system to meet the
growing demand for water in London is due
for completion in 1996. North West Water
has a major 25-year programme of
investment to clean up the polluted rivers of
the Mersey Basin.
Water is an increasingly scarce resource.
The industry, through contingency planning
and publicity campaigns, encourages the
wise use of water, especially when supplies
run low because of prolonged warm, dry
weather. A national review of water
consumption and conservation, partly
prompted by four years of drought in south¬
east and eastern England which ended in
1992, has been put in hand by the
Government. The NRA is investigating the
strategic development of water resources,
including major new transfer schemes, and is
reviewing the possibilities of a national grid
and desalination.
Scotland
In Scotland responsibility for public water
supply, sewerage and sewage disposal rests
with the nine regional and three islands
councils (‘the water authorities’). In addition,
the Central Scotland Water Development
Board is responsible for providing water in
bulk to five regional councils in central
Scotland. In 1991—92 the Board supplied
authorities with an average 294 Ml a day.
After public consultation the Government
has announced that three public water
authorities will take over provision of
these services from the local authorities.
An independent representative body for
consumers will also be established.
The Secretary of State for Scotland is
responsible for promoting conservation of
water resources and provision by water
authorities and water development boards
of adequate water supplies. He has a duty
to promote the cleanliness of rivers and
other inland waters, and the tidal waters
of Scotland. River purification authorities
have a statutory responsibility for water
pollution control. Water is charged for
according to type of consumer: domestic
consumers pay council water charges or
through metered charges; non-domestic
consumers pay by means of non-domestic
water rates, or through metered charges.
For sewerage services, domestic
consumers pay through the council tax,
and non-domestic consumers pay non¬
domestic sewerage rates and, where
appropriate, trade effluent charges.
Charges and rates are decided by each
authority.
Scotland has a relative abundance of
unpolluted water from upland sources.
Northern Ireland
The Department of the Environment for
Northern Ireland is responsible for public
water supply and sewerage throughout
Northern Ireland. It is also responsible
for the conservation and cleanliness of
water resources and, with the Department
of Agriculture for Northern Ireland, may
prepare a water management programme
with respect to water resources in any
area. There is a domestic water charge
which is contained in the regional rate,
while agriculture, commerce and industry
pay metered charges. There are abundant
potential supplies of water for both
domestic and industrial use. An average
of 667 Ml of water a day was supplied
in 1992-93.

The agricultural industry’s productivity rose by some 3 per cent in 1992. Total
income from farming rose by about 15 per cent and farming income
(covering only farmers and their spouses) by about 24 per cent. Among a
series of environmental initiatives announced by the Government have been
the development and extension of the Environmentally Sensitive Areas
scheme and an improved Farm Woodland Premium Scheme.
Agriculture
British agriculture is noted for its high level
of efficiency and productivity. In 1992 it
employed 2.1 per cent of the total workforce
and Britain was self-sufficient in 56 per cent
of all types of food and animal feed. It was
self-sufficient in 72 per cent of indigenous-
type food and feed. Food, feed and beverages
accounted for 10.7 per cent of Britain’s
imports by value in 1992, compared with
about a quarter in the 1960s. The agricultural
contribution to gross domestic product was
£6,790 million in 1992, 1.3 per cent of the
total. Britain is also a major exporter of
agricultural produce and food products,
agrochemicals and agricultural machinery.
The Government aims to foster an
efficient and competitive agriculture industry
through the provision and sponsorship of
research, development and advisory services;
the provision of financial support where
appropriate; measures to control disease,
pests and pollution; and improved marketing
arrangements for food and food products. It
also insists on high standards of animal
welfare. The needs of an efficient agricultural
industry must be balanced with other
interests in the countryside. These include
conservation of its natural beauty and
promotion of its enjoyment by the public.
In accordance with the Citizen’s Charter,
the agencies of the Ministry of Agriculture,
Fisheries and Food are set annual targets
which emphasise quality of service. Its
regional organisation has published details of
the levels of service that it will provide to
customers. A similar initiative operates in
Scotland.
Land Use
The area of agricultural land has been
declining, although there has been a
reduction in the net rate of loss in recent
years. In 1992 there were 11.8 million
hectares (29.2 million acres) under crops and
grass. A further 5.9 million hectares
(14.6 million acres) were used for rough
grazing, most of it in hilly areas. Soils vary
from the thin poor ones of highland Britain
to the rich fertile soils of low-lying areas such
229
BRITAIN 1994: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
as the fenlands of eastern England. The
temperate climate and the relatively even
distribution of rainfall over the year ensure a
long growing season; streams rarely dry up
and grassland normally remains green
throughout the year.
Land Use in Britain
Farming
In 1992 there were some 242,300 farm
holdings in Britain (excluding minor
holdings), with an average size of 70.8
hectares (175 acres)—again excluding minor
holdings. About two-thirds of all agricultural
land is owner-occupied. Some 43 per cent of
holdings are of 4 British Standard Units
(BSUs)1 or less.
The number of people (excluding spouses)
engaged in agriculture in 1992 was about
546,000, compared with an average of 630,000
in 1981-83. The total for whole-time farmers,
partners and directors in 1992—about
177,000—had declined from an average of
204,000 in 1981-83. The number of farmers,
partners and directors working part time
(104,000 in 1992) has continued to increase
(from an average of 88,000 in 1981-83).
Regular whole-time workers (family and
hired) have continued to decline, to 114,500
in 1992, compared with an average of 171,000
in 1981-83. The number of regular part-time
workers (family and hired) showed a

decline—to 57,000, compared with an average
of 62,000 in 1981-83.
Labour productivity has increased by 3.8
per cent over the past ten years. Total income
from farming (that of farmers, partners,
directors and their spouses and family
workers) was estimated at ^2,831 million in
1992, over 15 per cent more than in 1991.

PRODUCTION
Home production of the principal foods is
shown in Table 17.1 as a percentage by
weight of total supplies (that is, production
plus imports minus exports).
Livestock
Over half of full-time farms are devoted
mainly to dairying or beef cattle and sheep.
The majority of sheep and cattle are reared
in the hill and moorland areas of Scotland,
Wales, Northern Ireland and northern and
south-western England. Beef fattening occurs
partly in better grassland areas, as does
dairying, and partly on arable farms. British
livestock breeders have developed many of
the cattle, sheep and pig breeds with
worldwide reputations, for example, the
Hereford and Aberdeen Angus beef breeds,
the Jersey, Guernsey and Ayrshire dairy
breeds, Large White pigs and a number of
sheep breeds. Developments in artificial
insemination and embryo transfer have
enabled Britain to export semen and embryos
from high-quality donor animals. Livestock
totals are given in Table 17.2.
Cattle and Sheep
Most dairy cattle in Britain are bred by
artificial insemination. In 1992 the average
size of dairy herds in Britain was 63
(excluding minor holdings), while the average
yield of milk per dairy cow was 5,256 litres
(1,157 gallons). Average household
consumption of liquid (including low-fat)
milk per head in 1992 was 1.96 litres (3.45
pints) a week.
About two-thirds of home-fed beef
production originates from the national dairy
herd, in which the Friesian breed is
predominant. The remainder is derived from
suckler herds producing high-quality beef
calves in the hills and uplands, where the
traditional British beef breeds, such as
Hereford and Aberdeen Angus, continue to
be important. Imported breeds which have
been established include the Charolais,
Limousin, Simmental and Belgian Blue. In
1992 the size of the beef-breeding herd
continued to expand and reached its highest
level for 17 years. The increase to December
1992 more than offset the further decrease in
the dairy herd.
Britain has a long tradition of sheep
production, with more than 40 breeds and
many cross-bred varieties. Research has
provided vaccine and serum protection
against nearly all the epidemic diseases. Lamb
production is the main source of income for
sheep farmers, but wool is a significant
by-product.
Grass (including silage) supplies 60 to 80
per cent of the feed for cattle and sheep.
Grass production has been enhanced by the
increased use of fertilisers, methods of
grazing control, and improved herbage
conservation for winter feed. Rough grazings
are used for extensively grazed sheep and
cattle, producing young animals for fattening
elsewhere.
A harmonised identification system
throughout the European Community aims to
enable animals to be traced back to their farm

of origin, for disease control purposes and for
checking payments made under the Common
Agricultural Policy.
Pigs and Poultry
Pig production occurs in most areas but is
particularly important in eastern and northern
England. There is an increasing concentration
into specialist units and larger herds. Of the
pig herd 72 per cent are on 13 per cent of
the holdings with pigs.
Output of poultry meat benefits from
better husbandry and genetic improvements.
The number of broilers from the 7 per cent
of holdings of over 100,000 table birds
accounts for over a half of the total population.
Output of hen and duck eggs fell from 822
million dozen in 1991 to 812 million dozen in
1992. Some 73 per cent of laying birds are on
the 1 per cent of holdings with 20,000 or
more birds. Britain remains broadly self-
sufficient in poultry meat and eggs.
Animal Welfare
The welfare of farm animals is protected by
legislation and it is an offence to cause
unnecessary pain or distress to commercially
reared livestock. Detailed regulations require
owners of intensive units to arrange for the
daily inspection of their stock and the
equipment on which it depends. The law
bans close confinement crates for keeping
veal calves, and is phasing out close
confinement systems for keeping pigs. There
are further controls to safeguard the welfare
of animals in markets, during transport and
at slaughter. The Farm Animal Welfare
Council, an independent body set up by the
Government, advises on legislative or other
changes it considers necessary. Britain
continues to take the lead in pressing for
higher standards of animal welfare
throughout Europe.
Crops
The farms devoted primarily to arable crops
are found mainly in eastern and central-
southern England and eastern Scotland. The
main crops are shown in Table 17.3. In
Britain in 1992 cereals were grown on
3.5 million hectares (8.6 million acres),' an area
similar to that planted in 1991. Production of
cereals, at 22.1 million tonnes, was 0.6 million
down on 1991. A reduction of 7 per cent in
the planted area of barley was partially offset
by a 4 per cent increase in yield.
A little over 50 per cent of available
domestic wheat supplies (allowing for imports
and exports) are normally used for flour
milling, and just under half for animal feed.
About a third of barley supplies are used for
brewing, malting and distilling, and virtually
all the remainder for animal feed.

The area planted to oilseed rape fell from
440,000 hectares (1.1 million acres) in 1991
to an estimated 421,000 hectares (1.04 million
acres) in 1992. Production was about 1.15
million tonnes, compared with 1.29 million
tonnes in 1991.
Large-scale potato and vegetable
cultivation is undertaken in the fens
(in Cambridgeshire and south Lincolnshire),
the alluvial areas around the rivers Thames
and Humber, and the peaty lands in south
Lancashire. Early potatoes are an
important crop in Pembrokeshire (Dyfed),
Kent and Cornwall. High-grade seed
potatoes are grown in Scotland and Northern
Ireland.
Sugar from home-grown sugar beet
provides just under 60 per cent of home
needs, most of the remainder being refined
from raw cane sugar imported levy-free from
developing countries under the Lome
Convention (see p. 201).
Horticulture
In 1992 the land utilised for horticulture
(excluding potatoes, peas for harvesting dry
and mushrooms) was about 197,000 hectares
(486,806 acres). Vegetables grown in the open
accounted for 68 per cent of this, orchards
for 18 per cent, and soft fruit and
ornamentals (including hardy nursery stock,
bulbs and flowers grown in the open) each
for 7 per cent. More than one vegetable crop
is, in some cases, taken from the same area of
land in a year, so that the estimated area
actually cropped in 1992 was 263,500 hectares
(651,100 acres).
Mushrooms are the single most valuable
horticultural crop, with a farm gate value of
^171 million in 1991. Britain’s mushroom
production has increased from some 70,000
tonnes to just over 122,000 tonnes between
1982 and 1991. Apples are also a significant
crop. Output (of dessert and cooking apples)
233
BRITAIN 1994: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
increased from 292,000 tonnes in 1991 to
326,000 in 1992.
Field vegetables account for about one-
third of the value of horticultural output and
are widely grown throughout the country.
Most horticultural enterprises are increasing
productivity with the help of improved
planting material, new techniques and the
widespread use of machinery. Some field
vegetables, for example, are raised in blocks
of compressed peat or loose-filled cells, a
technique which reduces root damage and
allows plants to establish themselves more
reliably and evenly.
Glasshouses are used for growing
tomatoes, cucumbers, sweet peppers, lettuces,
flowers, pot plants and nursery stock.
Widespread use is made of automatic control
of heating and ventilation, and semi-automatic
control of watering. Energy-efficient
glasshouses use thermal screens, while low-
cost plastic tunnels extend the season for
certain crops previously grown in the open.
Under the EC’s Common Agricultural
Policy (see below), a wide range of
horticultural produce is subject to common
quality standards.
Under Community rules, Britain has a
production limit of 2.5 million litres of wine a
year. It is produced mainly in southern
England and south Wales. A pilot Quality
Wine Scheme was launched by the
Government for the 1991 vintage.
Organic Farming
The Government aims to establish a
framework in which organic farming in
Britain can respond to consumer demand.
The organic sector is eligible for the support
given to all farmers under a number of general
schemes. Other support includes a significant
commitment to research and development.
The United Kingdom Register of Organic
Food Standards (UKROFS) is an
independent body set up in 1987 with
government support. It has established
national voluntary standards for organic food
production tied to a certification and
inspection scheme. It also enforces the
Organic Products Regulations 1992, which
require producers or preparers of organic
food, or importers from outside the EC, to be
registered and to operate to Community
regulation standards.
FOOD SAFETY
Government spending on programmes to
promote food safety and against diseases
affecting food supply is some £116 million in
1993-94. Its expenditure on food safety
research was about £20 million in 1992-93.
Among significant findings in 1992 was that
any risk to health from dioxins was likely to
be remote.
The Food Safety Directorate within the
Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food
focuses ministry resources on ensuring
adequate supplies of the right kinds of food,
and its safety, wholesomeness and proper
labelling, through regulations and guidelines.
The Food Safety Act 1990 ensures food
safety and consumer protection throughout
the food chain. It combines basic provisions
with wide enabling powers, so that
detailed regulations made under the Act can
adapt to technological change and innovation.
It also combines enforcement powers and
increased penalties for offenders.
The Food Advisory Committee advises
ministers on the exercise of powers in the
Food Safety Act 1990 relating to the
labelling, composition and chemical safety of
food. The Advisory Committee on Novel
Foods and Processes advises on any matter
relating to the irradiation of food or to the
manufacture of novel foods or foods
produced by novel processes.
The Steering Group on Chemical Aspects
of Food Surveillance directs the extensive
programme of checks, tests and analyses which
monitor the chemical safety, nutritional
adequacy and authenticity of Britain’s food
supply. There is an Advisory Committee and
a Steering Group on the Microbiological
Safety of Food.
In accordance with the principles of the
Citizen’s Charter, a consumer panel—ten
consumer members nominated by the main
consumer organisations, but appointed to serve
as individuals—enables consumers directly to
convey their views on food safety and
consumer protection issues to the Government.

AGRICULTURE, THE FISHING INDUSTRY AND FORESTRY
EXPORTS
Today Britain imports about 42 per cent of
its food. The volume of exports related to
agriculture rose by 3 per cent in 1992, when
their value amounted to £7,522 million, the
main markets being Western Europe, North
America and the Middle East. Exports
include speciality products such as fresh
salmon, Scotch whisky (of which exports to
the EC alone were worth over £720 million
in 1992), biscuits, jams and conserves, as well
as beef and lamb carcasses and cheese.
Food From Britain is an organisation
funded by the Government and industry, to
assist the food and drink industry in Britain
to improve its marketing at home and
overseas. Through its export association, the
British Food Export Council, and its network
of seven overseas offices, Food From Britain
identifies market opportunities and arranges
promotions. It also co-ordinates the British
presence at major international food and
drink trade exhibitions.
The British Agricultural Export
Committee of the London Chamber of
Commerce represents exporters of
technology, expertise and equipment.
In 1992 Britain exported £764 million
of farm machinery and spares.
One of the world’s largest agricultural
events, the annual Royal International
Agricultural Exhibition, held at Stoneleigh in
Warwickshire, enables visitors to see the latest
techniques and improvements in British
agriculture. Some 177,500 visitors attended in
1993, of whom 25,000 were from overseas.
Other major agricultural displays include the
annual Royal Smithfield Show, held in
London, which exhibits agricultural
machinery, livestock and carcasses; the Royal
Highland Show; the Royal Welsh Show; and
the Royal Ulster Agricultural Show. There
are also important regional shows.
MARKETING
A government food marketing initiative began
in 1991 to encourage collaboration and
improved marketing throughout the
agriculture and food industries. A Group
Marketing Grant, introduced in 1992,
encourages the development of professionally
managed and market-oriented producer
groups.
Agricultural products are marketed by
private traders, producers’ co-operatives and
some marketing boards. The Agriculture Act
1993 ends the milk marketing schemes in
Great Britain and the wool and potato
guarantees. It provides enabling powers for
terminating the Potato Marketing Scheme, but
no decision has been taken to invoke this
provision. Marketing arrangements for wool
continue to be administered by the British
Wool Marketing Board. The legislation also
provides new powers for making marketing
grants. For home-grown cereals, meat and
livestock, and apples and pears there are
marketing organisations representing producer,
distributor and independent interests.
Co-operatives
Much agricultural and horticultural produce,
such as grain, fruit and vegetables, is handled
by marketing co-operatives; these had a
turnover of some £2,000 million in 1992.
Their aim is to meet the demand for a
continuous supply of fresh, quality produce.
ROLE OF THE GOVERNMENT
Four government departments have joint
responsibility for agriculture and fisheries
matters—the Ministry of Agriculture,
Fisheries and Food; The Scottish Office
Agriculture and Fisheries Department; the
Welsh Office; and the Department of
Agriculture for Northern Ireland.
Common Agricultural Policy
The EC’s Common Agricultural Policy
(CAP) accounts for over 50 per cent of the
Community’s budget. It aims to ensure stable
markets, a fair standard of living for
agricultural producers and regular supplies of
food at reasonable prices. For many
commodities support prices are set annually;
there are also levies on imports to maintain
internal market prices. Surpluses are bought
235
BRITAIN 1994: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
by intervention boards (the Intervention
Board executive agency in Britain) to be
stored and sold when appropriate.
Intervention stocks can be disposed of within
the Community where this can be done
without disrupting internal markets.
Exports, from the market and intervention
stocks, are facilitated by the provision of
export refunds to bridge any gap between
Community prices and world prices. In some
cases there are also direct payments to
producers—for example, the arable area
scheme (see below), the suckler cow
premium, the beef special premium and the
annual premium on ewes. The support
prices, as well as rates of levy, export refunds
and other aids, are set in European Currency
Units and are converted into the currencies
of the member states at fixed rates of
exchange—‘green rates’. These green rates
are to be kept broadly in line with market
rates in accordance with agreed criteria.
Nearly all the EC’s agricultural
expenditure (£28,000 million in 1993) is
channelled through the European Agricultural
Guidance and Guarantee Fund. The Fund’s
Public Expenditure under the CAP
by the Intervention Board and the
Agricultural Departments
FORECAST 1992/93
guarantee section finances market support
arrangements, while the guidance section
provides funds for structural reform—for
example, farm modernisation and investment
—and payments to assist certain farmers to
change to alternative enterprises.
Agricultural production under the CAP
has increased considerably in recent years,
reflecting rapid technical progress and
farming efficiency as well as the high level of
price support. As consumption has remained
relatively stable, this has resulted in the
emergence of surpluses.
Britain has consistently pressed for CAP
reform, to bring supply and demand into
better balance, to increase the role of market
forces in agriculture and to make
environmental considerations an integral part
of the CAP. Since 1988 there has been a
legally binding limit on CAP market support
expenditure (the agricultural guideline).
Reform
Agreement was reached in 1992 on measures
to reform the CAP in the arable, milk, beef
and sheepmeat sectors. The agreement cut
prices for major commodities and introduced
measures aiming to curb over-production and
to reduce the role of intervention.
Arable Crops. From the start of the 1993-94
marketing year a new price support structure
for cereals came into effect. Support prices
will be reduced from the present level by
about 30 per cent over three years. Under the
arable area scheme producers can claim a
direct subsidy on an area basis provided that
they agree to take 15 per cent of their arable
land out of production.
Beef. Intervention prices are being reduced
by 15 per cent over three years, starting in
July 1993. The ceiling on intervention
purchases introduced in 1993 will continue to
be reduced each year until 1997. To
compensate for this, in 1993 there were
significant increases in both the beef special
premium and the suckler cow premium.
There will be further increases in both
premiums in 1994 and 1995.
Milk. The butter support price is to be cut
by 5 per cent over two years.
Environment. All member states are to run
236
AGRICULTURE, THE FISHING INDUSTRY AND FORESTRY
programmes to encourage environmentally
sensitive farming, including extensification,2
organic farming, and environmentally friendly
management or upkeep of land.
An integrated administration and control
system has been introduced. By using a
computerised database, an identification system
for fields and animals, and an integrated system
for checking and inspection, it is designed to
ensure uniform enforcement of the reformed
CAP and to reduce the scope for fraud.
GATT Uruguay Round
Agriculture was identified as a major issue for
the GATT round of multinational trade
negotiations (see p. 201) launched in 1986.
These have aimed to achieve a liberalisation
of world trade in agricultural products and
to reduce the distorting effects which
agricultural support policies have on world
trade.
Participants have been trying to reach
binding agreements, including:
• reductions in internal support to
agriculture;
• improvements in market access for
agricultural products (by converting all
import market access restrictions to
tariffs, to be subsequently reduced);
• reductions in subsidising agricultural
exports; and
• greater harmonisation of rules relating to
animal and plant health as they affect
trade.
Price Guarantees, Grants and Subsidies
Expenditure in Britain in 1992-93 on price
guarantees, grants and subsidies and on CAP
market regulation was estimated to be £326
million and £1,740 million respectively.
Farmers are eligible for grants aimed at
environmental enhancement of their farms and
pollution control. Hill and upland farmers can
also benefit from headage payments on cattle
and sheep, known as compensatory
allowances. The Group Marketing Grant
2
Reduction of surpluses through the offer of financial payments
to farmers to lessen production.
(see p. 235) is helping farmers and growers to
develop effective marketing.
In Less Favoured Areas (LFAs), where
land quality is poor, farmers benefit from
enhanced rates of grant and special payments
on livestock—nearly £500 million a year.
Their purpose is to support the continuation
of livestock farming in the hill and upland
areas, thereby conserving the countryside and
maintaining a viable population in the LFAs.
Smallholdings and Crofts
In England and Wales county councils let
smallholdings to experienced people who
want to farm on their own account. Councils
may lend working capital to them. At 31
March 1992 there were about 5,370
smallholdings in England and 900 in Wales.
Land settlement in Scotland has been carried
out by the Government, which, while now
seeking to dispose of holdings to its sitting
tenants, still owns and maintains 118,957
hectares (293,823 acres) of land settlement
estates, comprising 1,446 crofts and holdings.
In the crofting areas of Scotland (the
former counties of Argyll, Inverness, Ross
and Cromarty, Sutherland, Caithness, Orkney
and Shetland) much of the land is tenanted
by crofters (smallholders). They enjoy the
statutory protection provided by crofting
legislation and can benefit from government
schemes which exist to support and help
crofting communities. Most crofters are part-
time or spare-time agriculturalists using croft
income to supplement income from activities
such as weaving, fishing, tourism and other
occupations. The Crofters Commission has a
statutory duty to promote the interests of
crofters and to keep all crofting matters
under review.
Agricultural Landlords and Tenants
Approximately 37 per cent of agricultural
land in England and Wales is rented. In
Scotland, where approximately 50 per cent of
farms are rented, the proportion of land is
somewhat higher because of the relatively
large areas of common grazings tenanted by
crofters. The relationship between
agricultural landlords and tenants is governed
237
BRITAIN 1994: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
by specific legislation and the terms of
individual tenancy agreements. The legislation
covers matters such as variations of rent;
liability for maintenance, repairs and
insurance; security of tenure; and
compensation on termination of tenancy.
The majority of farms in Northern Ireland
are owner-occupied, but, under a practice
known as ‘conacre’, occupiers not wishing to
farm all their land let it annually to others.
About one-fifth of agricultural land is let
under this practice and is used mainly for
grazing.
Agriculture and Protection of the
Countryside
Agriculture ministers have a general duty,
under the Agriculture Act 1986, to seek to
achieve a reasonable balance between the
needs of an efficient and stable agriculture
industry and other interests in the
countryside, including the conservation of its
natural beauty and amenity and the
promotion of its enjoyment by the public. In
addition, they are required, as far as it is
consistent with these schemes, to further
conservation of the countryside in the
administration of farm capital grant schemes,
both in National Parks and in Sites of Special
Scientific Interest designated by the nature
conservation agencies (see p. 343).
Environmentally Sensitive Areas
Under the Environmentally Sensitive Areas
(ESA) scheme, a British scheme which other
EC members are following, 30 areas in
Britain—16 in England, seven in Scotland,
four in Wales and three in Northern
Ireland—have been designated up to mid-
1993 (see Table 17.4). Six further areas in
England, three in Scotland, two in Wales and
two in Northern Ireland, have also been
proposed for designation. The scheme is
designed to help protect some of the most
beautiful parts of the country from the
damage and loss that can come from
agricultural practice. ESAs are notable for
their landscape, wildlife or historic
importance. Significant changes and
improvements have been made to the scheme
since it began in 1987, including
opportunities for farmers to restore key
environmental features of their land.
ESAs are unique and diverse in character,
and include, for example, the Lake District
and South Wessex Downs in England;
Radnor in Wales; part of the coastal areas of
the North and South Uists, Benbecula, Barra
and Vatersay in the Outer Hebrides off
north-west Scotland; and the steep-sided
glens and unique farming patterns of Antrim
in Northern Ireland.
Participation in the ESA scheme is
voluntary, and farmers enter into agreements
with the relevant agriculture department;
initially they lasted for five years. In the
reviewed areas ten-year agreements are
offered—with a five-year break clause. An
agreement specifies the agricultural
management practices to be carried out by
the farmer. Each ESA has varying tiers of
management practices, from basic care and
maintenance to more extensive forms of
management. Details vary from one ESA to
another, but all participants are prohibited
from converting grassland to arable and are
subject to restrictions on fertiliser and
chemical usage.

AGRICULTURE, THE FISHING INDUSTRY AND FORESTRY
Most ESAs also restrict the numbers of
stock that can be carried on the land as well
as other operations—including the timing of
cultivation. The annual payments are
designed to compensate the farmers for
reduced profitability, through the adoption of
these less intensive production methods, and
for the further work some management
practices require. Additional payments are
made for distinct items of conservation work
set out in conservation plans. Annual
government expenditure on payments to
farmers within ESAs throughout Britain is
expected to rise to £60 million in 199T-95.
Other Schemes
The Farm Woodland Premium Scheme offers
incentives to farmers to encourage planting of
woodlands on agricultural land. Trees planted
on arable or improved grassland qualify for
annual payments of up to £250 a hectare for
either ten or 15 years, depending on the type
of woodland created. For trees planted on
unimproved grassland in the LFAs, the
annual payment is £60 a hectare. Planting
must not, in total, exceed more than 50 per
cent of any individual agricultural unit.
The EC’s system of arable support offers
area payments to growers of cereals, oilseeds,
linseed and protein crops. To receive these
payments all but the smallest producers must
set land aside. The land set aside may either
be on a rotational basis (in which case
farmers must set aside 15 per cent of the
land they are claiming on) or on a non-
rotational basis (in which case farmers must
set aside 18 per cent of the land they are
claiming on). The Farm and Conservation
Grant Scheme, part-funded by the
Community, provides grants for farmers to
undertake environmental improvements and a
limited range of farm investments. In
addition to the expansion of the ESA
programme, the Government proposes to
introduce a wide ranging package of new
voluntary incentive schemes to encourage
environmentally beneficial farming practices.
In England these include:
• a Moorland Scheme to protect and
improve the condition of heather and
other shrubby moorland;
• 30 new nitrate sensitive areas (bringing
the total in England to 40) which will
help to protect groundwater sources used
to supply drinking water;
• a Habitat Scheme to create or improve a
range of wildlife habitats over a 20-year
period;
• an Organic Aid Scheme to help farmers
convert to organic production methods;
• new payments to increase opportunities
for public access in ESAs; and
• a Countryside Access Scheme to promote
public access to set aside land.
The proposals for Scotland, Wales and
Northern Ireland are along broadly similar
lines. By the time they are fully operational,
expenditure on these new measures
throughout Britain is expected to rise to
£31.5 million a year.
Farm Diversification
Farm-based enterprises other than food
production have become increasingly
important. A University of Exeter survey
published in 1991 calculated that diversified
enterprises generated an average trading
profit of over £5,000 a year, with 80 per cent
of farmers considering their ventures to be
successful. The survey showed that
diversification is estimated to provide over
30,000 full-time jobs. The most common
diversification enterprises provide leisure
amenities such as golf courses, tourist
accommodation, or riding. Often such
enterprises are small-scale, with low financial
returns. In contrast, many farmers run large-
scale farm shops which make a substantial
contribution to farm business income.
In the Highlands and Islands of Scotland
the Rural Enterprise Programme offers
special funding, with EC support, to
encourage farmers and crofters to develop
new businesses.
Agricultural Training
From 1994 an independent non-statutory
body, ATB-Landbase, is to act as the
industry training organisation for the
agricultural and horticultural industries. The
239
BRITAIN 1994: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Government is to finance it through a
contract and will also fund the resources
necessary to ensure support is provided for
local training initiatives. ATB-Landbase is to
be responsible for the co-ordination of
training provision, involving the agricultural
colleges and many independent instructors.
Professional, Scientific and Technical
Services
In England and Wales the Agricultural
Development and Advisory Service (ADAS),
an executive agency, provides professional,
scientific and technical services for agriculture
and its ancillary industries. Most types of
advice and servicing are on a fee-paying basis,
although initial advice to farmers on
conservation, rural diversification (including
use of land for woodlands) and animal welfare
is available free. Similar services are provided
in Scotland by The Scottish Office
Agriculture and Fisheries Department
through the Scottish Agricultural College. In
Northern Ireland these services are available
from the Department of Agriculture’s
agriculture and science services.
ADAS carries out research and
development work under commission from
the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and
Food, and works under contract directly for
others and for levy-funded bodies. These
undertakings are carried out at experimental
husbandry farms across England and Wales,
and through regional centres or on clients’
premises. The Central Science Laboratory
also carries out research and development
work commissioned by the Ministry.
CONTROL OF DISEASES AND PESTS
Farm Animals
Britain is free from many serious animal
illnesses. If they were to occur, diseases such
as foot-and-mouth disease and classical swine
fever would be combated by a slaughter
policy applied to all animals infected or
exposed to infection, and by control over
animal movements during the outbreaks.
The Government has taken comprehensive
measures to control bovine spongiform
encephalopathy and to ensure that consumers
are protected from any remote risk. It has
also established an expert committee to advise
on all matters relating to spongiform
encephalopathies.
Trade in animals, birds, meat and meat
products is covered by harmonised rules
within the EC. Under implementing
legislation control measures permit action to
be taken to prevent the introduction or
spread of diseases. Special measures apply to
prevent the introduction of rabies, and dogs,
cats and certain other mammals are subject to
import licence and six months’ quarantine.
Commercially traded dogs and cats, which
comply with strict conditions, will be
allowed entry without quarantine from other
Community member states after 1 July 1994.
There are severe penalties for breaking
the law. There have been no cases of rabies
outside quarantine in Britain since 1970.
Professional advice and action on the
control of animal disease and the welfare of
farm livestock are the responsibility of the
government State Veterinary Service,
whose veterinary investigation centres also
advise private practitioners responsible
for treating animals on the farm.
Government laboratories perform specialist
research work.
Fish
The fisheries departments operate statutory
controls to prevent the introduction and
spread of serious diseases of fish and shellfish.
These controls include the licensing of live
fish imports, the licensing of deposits of
shellfish on the seabed, and movement
restrictions on sites where outbreaks of
notifiable diseases have been confirmed.
Plants
The agriculture departments are responsible
for limiting the spread of plant pests and
diseases and for preventing the introduction
of new ones. They issue the health
certificates required by other countries to
accompany plant material exported from
Britain; and authorise growers who wish to
sell on the EC’s single internal market.
240
AGRICULTURE, THE FISHING INDUSTRY AND FORESTRY
Certification schemes encourage the
development of healthy and true-to-type
planting stocks.
Pesticides
All pesticides must be approved for their
safety and efficacy. There are strict controls
on the supply, storage and use of pesticides,
and their maximum residue levels in food.
Controls on pesticides are the joint
responsibility of six government departments
on the basis of advice from the independent
Advisory Committee on Pesticides.
Arrangements for the approval of pesticides
in Britain are being integrated into a
Community-wide system under the terms of a
directive on pesticides authorisations which
came into effect in 1992.
Veterinary Medicinal Products
The manufacture, sale and supply of
veterinary medicinal products are controlled
by legislation. Licences are issued by the
Veterinary Medicines Directorate on behalf of
the agriculture and health ministers. Advice
on the safety, quality and efficacy of
veterinary medicines and on suspected
adverse reactions is given by the Veterinary
Products Committee, which comprises
independent experts.
The Fishing Industry
Britain, one of the EC’s leading fishing
nations, plays an active role in the
implementation and development of the
Community’s Common Fisheries Policy
(CFP) agreed in 1983 (see p. 242).
The fishing industry provides 55 per cent
by quantity of British fish supplies, and is an
important source of employment and income
in a number of ports. Cod, haddock, whiting,
herring, plaice and sole are found in the
North Sea off the east coasts of Scotland and
England; mackerel, together with cod and
other demersal fish, off the west coast of
Scotland; sole, plaice, cod, herring
and whiting in the Irish Sea; and mackerel,
sole and plaice off the south-west coast of
England. Nephrops, crabs, lobsters and other
shellfish are found in the inshore waters all
around the coast.
The Government aims to conserve the fish
stocks and to encourage the development of a
viable, efficient and market-oriented fisheries
industry within the CFP framework.
Fish Caught
In 1992 demersal fish (caught on or near the
bottom of the sea) accounted for 40 per cent
by weight of total British landings, pelagic
fish (caught near the surface) for 42.5 per
cent and shellfish for 17.5 per cent. Landings
of all types of fish (excluding salmon and
trout) by British fishing vessels totalled
613,297 tonnes. Cod and haddock represented
24 and 13 per cent respectively of the total
value of demersal and pelagic fish landed,
while anglerfish (11 per cent), whiting
(8 per cent), plaice (8 per cent), mackerel
(6 per cent), and sole (4 per cent) were the
other most important sources of earnings to
the industry. The quayside value of the
British catch of wetfish and shellfish in 1992
was £401.1 million.
Imports of fresh, frozen, cured and
canned salt-water fish and shellfish in 1992
totalled 420,377 tonnes, those of freshwater
fish 52,973 tonnes, those of fish meal 237,350
tonnes and those of fish oils 6,729 tonnes.
Exports and re-exports of salt-water fish
and fish products amounted to 398,860
tonnes and those of freshwater fish to
22,665 tonnes.
The Fishing Fleet
At the end of 1992 the British fleet consisted
of 11,050 registered vessels, including 440
deep-sea vessels longer than 24.4 m (80 ft).
Among the main ports from which the
fishing fleet operates are Aberdeen,
Peterhead, Fraserburgh (Grampian), Lerwick
(Shetland), Kinlochbervie, Ullapool
(Highland), North Shields (Tyne and Wear),
Hull, Grimsby (Humberside), Lowestoft
(Suffolk), Brixham (Devon), Newlyn
(Cornwall), and Kilkeel, Ardglass and
Portavogie (Northern Ireland).
A package of measures, including
241
BRITAIN 1994: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
new licensing rules, a £25 million
decommissioning scheme and restrictions on
the time vessels may spend at sea, is being
introduced in January 1994.
Fish Farming
Fish farming production is centred on
Atlantic salmon and rainbow trout, which are
particularly suited to Britain’s climate and
waters. Production of salmon and trout has
grown from less than 1,000 tonnes in the
early 1970s to some 36,000 tonnes of salmon
and 15,000 tonnes of trout in 1992. Scotland
produces the largest amount of farmed salmon
(36,000 tonnes in 1992—with a first-sale value
of £120 million) in the Community. Shellfish
farming concentrates on molluscs such as
oysters, mussels, clams and scallops,
producing an estimated 5,000 tonnes a year.
The fish and shellfish farming industries
make an important contribution to rural
infrastructure, especially in remote areas such
as the Highlands and Islands of Scotland. In
1992 the industries were estimated to have a
combined wholesale turnover of some £150
million. Production is based on almost 1,400
businesses operating from some 2,100 sites
and employing more than 5,000 people.
Administration
The fisheries departments are responsible for
the administration of legislation concerning
the fishing industry and for fisheries research.
The safety and welfare of crews of fishing
vessels and other matters common to shipping
generally are provided for under legislation
administered by the Department of Transport.
The Sea Fish Industry Authority is
concerned with all aspects of the industry,
including consumer interests. It undertakes
research and development, provides training,
and encourages quality awareness. It also
administers a government grant scheme for
fishing vessels, to promote a safe, efficient
and modern fleet.
Fishery Limits
British fishery limits extend to 200 miles or
the median line (broadly halfway between the
British coast and the opposing coastline of
another coastal state), measured from
baselines on or near the coast of Britain. Only
British vessels may fish within 6 miles of the
coast. Certain other EC member states have
fishing rights between 6 and 12 miles in
certain areas and for named species, as
British vessels have in other member states’
coastal waters. Outside 12 miles Community
vessels may fish against agreed EC quotas in
named areas, while the only non-Community
countries whose vessels may fish in EC
waters are those with which the EC has
reciprocal fisheries agreements (Norway,
Sweden and the Faroes) which define areas
and quantities of species of permitted catch.
Common Fisheries Policy
The CFP’s system for the conservation and
management of the EC’s fishing resources
means that total allowable catches—with
these decisions based on independent
scientific advice—are set each year in order to
conserve stocks. These catch levels are then
allocated between member states on a fixed
percentage basis, taking account of traditional
fishing patterns. Activity is also regulated by
a number of technical conservation measures,
including minimum mesh sizes for towed
nets and net configuration restrictions,
minimum landing sizes and closed areas
designated mainly to protect young fish. Each
member state is responsible for ensuring that
its own fishermen and those of other member
states in its own waters abide by Community
fisheries regulations and are monitored by
EC inspectors.
The CFP also covers the common
organisation of the market in fishery and
aquaculture products and policies on the size
and structure of the Community fleet.
The provisions of the CFP are
supplemented by a number of fisheries
agreements between the EC and third
countries, the most important for Britain
being the agreements with Norway,
Greenland and the Faroe Islands.
Community catch quotas have also been
established in the international waters in
the north-west Atlantic and around
Spitzbergen (Svalbard).
242
AGRICULTURE, THE FISHING INDUSTRY AND FORESTRY
Fish and Shellfish Hygiene
Community legislation sets minimum hygiene
standards for the production and marketing
of fish and shellfish. Live bivalve molluscs
(oysters, mussels and scallops) can be
marketed only if they come from areas
classified by the Government according to
strict microbiological standards. Minimum
standards cover the handling, marketing and
processing of all forms of fish from the vessel
to wholesale vending.
Salmon and Freshwater Fisheries
Salmon and sea-trout are fished commercially
in inshore waters around the British coast.
Eels and elvers are also taken commercially in
both estuaries and freshwater. Angling for
salmon and sea-trout (game fishing) and for
other freshwater species (coarse fishing) is
popular throughout Britain. There is no
public right to fish in freshwater lakes and
rivers in England and Wales. Those wishing
to fish such waters must first obtain
permission from the owner of the fishing
rights and a licence from the National
Rivers Authority. In Scotland salmon
fishing is administered by district salmon
fishery boards. In Northern Ireland fishing
is licensed by the Fisheries Conservancy
Board for Northern Ireland and the Foyle
Fisheries Commission in their respective
areas, and 65 public angling waters, including
salmon, trout and coarse fisheries, are
accessible to Department of Agriculture
permit holders.
Research
The total government-funded programme of
research and development in agriculture,
fisheries and food in 1993-94 amounts to
some £319 million, including funding by the
Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food,
The Scottish Office Agriculture and Fisheries
Department, the Department of Agriculture
for Northern Ireland and the Office of
Science and Technology. The Government
funds research essential for the public good—
for example, into food safety, human health,
animal welfare and flood protection. It also
funds research which seeks to encourage an
efficient and competitive industry consistent
with high standards of consumer protection
and care for the environment. It looks to
industry, however, to fund those areas of
research where the benefits can be captured
by individual firms or ventures. Research is
carried out in a network of research
organisations, including research institutes,
specialist laboratories and higher education
institutions.
Agriculture and Food Research
The work of the Agricultural and Food
Research Council (AFRC) and the agriculture
departments is co-ordinated into national
programmes of research, based primarily on
the recommendations of the Priorities Board
for Research and Development in Agriculture
and Food. The Board advises on the research
needs and on the allocation of available
resources between and within areas of
research.
The AFRC (see p. 276) is to be absorbed
into the Biotechnology and Biological
Sciences Research Council from 1994. It
receives funds from the science budget
through the Office of Science and
Technology, and income from work
commissioned by the Ministry of Agriculture,
Fisheries and Food, by industry and by
other bodies. The Council is responsible
for research carried out in its eight institutes
and in British higher education institutions
through its research grants scheme.
In addition to commissioning research
with the AFRC and other organisations, the
Ministry commissions research and
development at its agencies—the Central
Veterinary Laboratory, the Central Science
Laboratory (which is to incorporate the Food
Science Laboratory from 1994), and ADAS.
The five Scottish Agricultural Research
Institutes, funded by The Scottish Office
Agriculture and Fisheries Department, cover
areas of research complementary to those of
the AFRC institutes, while including work
relevant to the soils, crops and livestock of
northern Britain. Development work in
Scotland is carried out by the Scottish
243
BRITAIN 1994: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Agricultural College, which operates from
three centres.
In Northern Ireland basic, strategic and
applied research is carried out by the
Department of Agriculture in its specialist
research divisions and at its three agricultural
colleges. It also has links with the Queen’s
University of Belfast and the Agricultural
Research Institute of Northern Ireland.
Fisheries and Aquatic Environment
Research
The Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and
Food laboratories deal with marine and
freshwater fisheries, shellfish, marine
pollution, fish farming and disease. Research
work is also commissioned by the Ministry
with the Natural Environment Research
Council, with the Sea Fish Industry
Authority and with a number of universities.
The Ministry has two seagoing research
vessels. In Scotland, The Scottish Office
Agriculture and Fisheries Department
undertakes a similar, and complementary,
range of research and also has two seagoing
vessels. The Department of Agriculture
laboratories in Northern Ireland undertake
research on marine and freshwater fisheries,
and also have a seagoing research vessel.
Forestry
Woodland covers an estimated 2.44 million
hectares (6 million acres) in Britain: about 7
per cent of England, 15 per cent of Scotland,
12 per cent of Wales and 6 per cent of
Northern Ireland—about 10 per cent of the
total land area and well below the 25 per cent
average for the whole of Europe. The
Government supports the continued
expansion of forestry, which makes an
increasing contribution to meeting the
national demand for timber; brings
employment in forestry and related industries;
creates opportunities for recreation and public
access to the countryside; is a component of
landscapes and a habitat for wildlife; and
provides an effective means by which carbon
dioxide can be absorbed from the atmosphere
and stored over long periods. Over 215,000
hectares (530,000 acres) of new forest have
been created during the last decade, mainly
on the initiative and enterprise of private
owners.
The area of productive forest in Great
Britain is 2.17 million hectares (5.4 million
acres), 39 per cent of which is managed by
the Forestry Commission. The rate of new
planting in 1992-93 was 2,356 hectares
(5,822 acres) by the Commission and
15,295 hectares (37,795 acres) by other
woodland owners, with the help of grants
from the Commission, mainly in Scotland. In
1992-93, 8,625 hectares (21,312 acres) of
broadleaved trees were planted, a practice
encouraged on suitable sites. An increasing
proportion of new planting is by private
owners.
Wood production has nearly doubled since
1970. British woodlands meet 15 per cent of
the nation’s consumption of wood and wood
products. The volume of timber harvested on
Commission lands in 1992-93 totalled 4.1
million cubic metres (145 million cubic feet).
The Commission’s expanded Woodland
Grant Scheme pays establishment grants to
help in the creation of new woodlands and
forests and for the regeneration of existing
ones. Management grants under the scheme
contribute to the cost of managing woodlands
to provide silvicultural, environmental and
social benefits. Supplements are available for
planting community woodlands and for
planting on better land.
Total employment in state and private
forests in Great Britain was estimated at
some 42,000 in 1991-92, including about
10,000 people engaged in the haulage and
processing of home-grown timber.
The Forestry Commission and Forestry
Policy
The Forestry Commission, established in
1919, is the national forestry authority in
Great Britain. The Commissioners give
advice on forestry matters and are responsible
to the Secretary of State for Scotland, the
Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food,
and the Secretary of State for Wales.
Within the Commission, reorganised in
1992, the Forestry Authority administers
244
AGRICULTURE, THE FISHING INDUSTRY AND FORESTRY
felling licence procedures, provides advice to
private woodland owners, administers
payment of grants for approved planting and
restocking schemes, and liaises with local
authorities and woodland and countryside
groups. Forest Enterprise develops and
manages the Commission’s forests and
forestry estate as a multiple-use resource,
provides timber for the wood-using industries
and opportunities for recreation, and is
responsible for nature conservation and the
forest environment. A Policy and Resources
Group is responsible for parliamentary
business, policy development, and European
and international liaison.
The Commission has sold 82,000 hectares
(200,000 acres) of plantation and plantable
land since 1981 and has been asked by the
Government to dispose of 100,000 hectares
(247,000 acres) during the 1990s. The
Commission is Financed partly by the
Government and partly by receipts from
sales of timber and other produce, and
from rents.
Forestry Initiatives
The Forestry Commission and the
Countryside Commission are creating 12
community forests (covering between 10,000
and 25,000 hectares each—40 to 100 sq miles)
on the outskirts of major cities in England.
They are in Tyneside, Cleveland, South
Yorkshire, Merseyside, Greater Manchester,
south Staffordshire, Nottingham, north
Bedfordshire, south Hertfordshire, east of
London, Swindon and Bristol. The
Countryside Commission plans a large new
forest, the National Forest, principally in
Leicestershire, but extending into Derbyshire
and Staffordshire. As part of its rural
initiative for Wales, the Government
encourages local communities to participate in
the continuing development of 35,000
hectares (135 sq miles) of existing forest in
the coalfield valleys of south Wales—about
20 per cent of the land area—which is owned
by the Forestry Commission. The Central
Scotland Woodlands Company, a Countryside
Trust, has planted over 6 million trees.
Forestry Research
The Forestry Authority maintains two
principal research stations, at Alice Holt
Lodge, near Farnham (Surrey), and at Bush
Estate, near Edinburgh, for basic and applied
research into all aspects of forestry. Aid is
also given for research work in universities
and other institutions. A database on forestry
and tree-related research in Great Britain has
been compiled by the Forestry Research
Co-ordination Committee and is updated
annually.
The Forestry Authority conducts an
annual forest health survey which monitors
the effects of air pollution and other stress
factors on a range of broadleaves and
conifers. Research continues into the genetic
improvement of broadleaves for farm forestry
as well as into the afforestation of land
reclaimed from industrial use.
Forestry in Northern Ireland
The Department of Agriculture may acquire
land for afforestation and give financial and
technical assistance for private planting. The
state forest area has grown steadily since
1945. By 1992, 61,800 hectares (153,000
acres) of plantable land had been acquired, of
which 60,800 hectares (150,000 acres) were
planted. There were 16,000 hectares
(39,500 acres) of privately owned forest.
Some 435 professional and industrial staff
work in state forests.

Britain’s transport and communications infrastructure is developing rapidly.
With the opening of the Channel Tunnel (see p. 255), the rail transport system
of Great Britain becomes linked to that of the European mainland. Britain’s
road network is developing, with the emphasis now on upgrading existing
routes rather than building new motorways. Investment at seaports and
airports and in air traffic control equipment continues to expand capacity
and facilitate the international movement of people and goods. In
telecommunications, more operators are seeking to enter the market
following a review of government policy (see p. 265) and existing operators
are maintaining a high level of investment to create a thoroughly modern
infrastructure.
Transport
There has been a considerable increase in
passenger travel in recent years. Travel in
Great Britain rose by 35 per cent between
1982 and 1992. Travel by car and van rose by
44 per cent and air travel expanded rapidly.
However, travel by motor cycle and by bus
and coach has been declining. In all, car and
van travel accounts for 86 per cent of
passenger mileage within Great Britain, buses
and coaches for about 6 per cent, rail for 6
per cent and air less than 1 per cent.
Car ownership has also risen substantially.
Some 67 per cent of households in Britain
have the regular use of one or more cars,
with 23 per cent having the use of two or
more cars in 1991. At the end of 1992 there
were 24.8 million vehicles licensed for use
on the roads of Great Britain, of which
20.7 million were cars (including 2.3 million
cars registered in the name of a company);
2.2 million light goods vehicles (that is,
vehicles other than cars in the passenger and
light goods category of vehicle); 437,000
other goods vehicles; 688,000 motor cycles,
scooters and mopeds; and 108,000 public
transport vehicles (including taxis).
ROADS
Total motor traffic for 1992 is estimated at
408,800 million vehicle-km. The total road
network in Great Britain in 1992 was 362,400
km (225,200 miles). Trunk motorways
accounted for 3,160 km (1,960 miles) of this
length, less than 1 per cent, and other trunk
roads for 12,330 km (7,660 miles), or about
3.5 per cent. However, motorways carry
nearly 15 per cent of all traffic and trunk
246
TRANSPORT AND COMMUNICATIONS
roads about 17 per cent. Combined, they carry
over half of all goods vehicle traffic in Great
Britain.
The Citizen’s Charter commits the
Government to improving service to
motorists. The Department of Transport has
speeded up repairs and deregulated the
provision of motorway service areas.
Legislation has also been passed to improve
the standard of street repairs and minimise
the frequency and duration of roadworks.
Administration
Responsibility for trunk roads in Great
Britain, including most motorways, rests in
England with the Secretary of State for
Transport, in Scotland with the Secretary of
State for Scotland and in Wales with the
Secretary of State for Wales. The costs of
construction and maintenance are paid for by
central government.
The highway authorities for non-trunk
roads are:
• in England, the county councils, the
metropolitan district councils and the
London borough councils;
• in Wales, the county councils; and
• in Scotland, the regional or islands
councils.
In Northern Ireland the Department of the
Environment for Northern Ireland is
responsible for the construction, improvement
and maintenance of all public roads.
Research on transport provides information
necessary for the Department of Transport to
set standards for highway and vehicle design;
to obtain better value for money in highway
construction and repair; and to formulate
transport, environmental and safety policies
and legislation. Research is carried out by the
Transport Research Laboratory (TRL). This
is presently an executive agency of the
Department of Transport, but the
Government announced in May 1993 that it
intends to transfer the TRL to the private
sector. Research is also carried out by
universities and other higher education
institutions, consultants and industry, while
some is done collaboratively within EC
programmes.
Road Programme
The Government is implementing a major
programme to improve the motorway and
trunk road network (see map on page facing
inside back cover). This programme is aimed
at increasing the traffic capacity of major
through routes and removing traffic from
unsuitable roads in towns and villages. Over
one-third of schemes in the programme are
bypasses or relief roads. In spring 1993 some
50 motorway and trunk road schemes were
under construction in England and over 400
further schemes were in preparation.
Expenditure of about £1,380 million on new
trunk road construction is planned for
1993-94, with 41 new schemes due to start.
These include the upgrading of 21 km (13
miles) of the A1 to motorway status. A major
package of improvements to ease congestion
on the M25 was announced in July 1993.
The trunk road maintenance programme is a
record £550 million. Some 316 major local

authority road schemes are being supported
by the Department of Transport, including
41 new schemes. Some £1,047 million is
available to support local authority road
schemes in England in 1993-94.
A new deregulated regime for the
provision of motorway service areas
was announced by the Government in
August 1992. It passes responsibility
for development to the private sector
while ensuring that all sites continue
to meet a specified range of minimum
standards.
Road communications in Wales will benefit
from the second Severn crossing, the
completion of the M4 motorway and
improvements in the ASS coast road in north
Wales. Improvements to the ASS include the
construction under the Conwy estuary of the
first immersed tube road tunnel to be built in
Britain, opened in 1991. Work on upgrading
the final section of the ASS to dual
carriageway began in February 1993. The
Welsh Office’s roads and transport
programme for 1993-94 totals £201 million.
Some £73 million is also being made available
to support major local authority road schemes
in Wales.
The Government has committed almost
£290 million over three years to new road
construction in Scotland. The main priorities
within the trunk road programme in Scotland
are the upgrading of the A74 to motorway
standard, which is now well advanced, and
completion of the central Scotland motorway
network. These routes provide important
links for commerce and industry to the south
and to mainland Europe. The Government’s
future strategy also includes a series of ‘route
action plans’ designed significantly to improve
safety and journey times on specific major
routes. The possibility of a privately funded
second road bridge across the Firth of Forth
is also being considered.
In Northern Ireland the emphasis is on
improving arterial routes, constructing more
bypasses, and improving roads in the
Belfast area, including the construction of a
new cross-harbour link planned for the
mid-1990s.
Private Finance
The Government encourages greater private
sector involvement in the design,
construction, operation and funding of roads.
A framework for encouraging privately
funded schemes is provided for in recent
legislation. Privately funded schemes
recently completed or being undertaken
include:
• a crossing of the River Thames at
Dartford, which opened to traffic in late
1991 and links into the M25 London
orbital motorway;
• a second crossing of the River Severn,
which should be completed by 1996;
• a relief road north of Birmingham,
which will be the first overland toll
route in Britain; and
• a bridge between the mainland of
Scotland and Skye, the construction of
which is now under way.
In 1993 the Government issued a
consultation paper on the wider application
of tolls on routes between cities and on ways
of involving private finance.
Licensing and Standards
Official records of drivers and vehicles are
maintained by the Driver and Vehicle
Licensing Agency (DVLA). At the end of
1992 it held records on 34.5 million drivers
and 24.8 million licensed vehicles in Great
Britain. New drivers of motor vehicles are
required to pass a driving test before being
granted a full licence to drive.
The Driving Standards Agency is the
national driver testing authority. It also
supervises professional driving instructors
and the compulsory basic training scheme
for new motor cyclists. Minimum ages are:
• 16 for riders of mopeds and disabled
drivers of specially adapted vehicles;
• 17 for drivers of cars and other
passenger vehicles with nine or fewer
seats (including that of the driver),
motor cycles and goods vehicles not
over 3.5 tonnes permissible maximum
weight;
248
TRANSPORT AND COMMUNICATIONS
• 18 for goods vehicles over 3.5 but not
over 7.5 tonnes; and
• 21 for passenger vehicles with over nine
seats and goods vehicles over 7.5 tonnes.
Before most new cars and goods vehicles
are allowed on the roads, they are required to
meet a number of safety and environmental
requirements, based primarily on standards
drawn up by the European Community. This
form of control, known as type approval, is
operated by the Vehicle Certification Agency.
The Secretary of State for Transport has a
statutory responsibility for ensuring the
roadworthiness of vehicles in use on the roads.
The Vehicle Inspectorate is the national
testing and enforcement authority. It meets
this responsibility mainly through:
• annual testing and certification of heavy
and light goods vehicles, buses and coaches;
• administration of the ‘MOT’ testing
scheme, under which cars and motor
cycles are tested at private garages
authorised as test stations and light goods
vehicles may be tested there rather than at
a government test centre;
• roadside enforcement checks of
roadworthiness, overloading and drivers’
hours;
• carrying out, on behalf of the Traffic
Commissioners, investigations and
assessments of operators’ vehicle
maintenance arrangements; and
• the investigation of serious accidents and
vehicle defects, and overseeing vehicle
recall campaigns.
In Northern Ireland the Driver and Vehicle
Testing Agency (DVTA) is responsible for
testing drivers and vehicles under statutory
schemes broadly similar to those in Great
Britain. Private cars five or more years old are
tested at DVTA centres.
Road Safety
Although Great Britain has one of the highest
densities of road traffic in the world, it has a
good record on road safety, with the lowest
road accident death rate in the European
Community. Figures for 1992 show that some
4,230 people were killed on the roads, 49,200
seriously injured and 257,200 slightly injured.
The figure for deaths was the lowest since
records began in 1926, and compares with
nearly 8,000 deaths a year in the mid-1960s.
A number of factors, such as developments in
vehicle safety standards, improvements in
roads, the introduction of legislation on seat-
belt wearing and drinking and driving, and
developments in road safety training,
education and publicity, have contributed to
the long-term decline in serious casualties.
A new edition of the Highway Code,
launched in January 1993, notched up
sales of 2 million copies in less than
three months.
The Government’s aim is to reduce road
casualties by one-third by the end of the
century, compared with the 1981-85 average.
To achieve this, resources are being
concentrated on measures which are
demonstrably cost-effective in reducing
casualties. Priority is given to reducing
casualties among vulnerable road-users
(children, pedestrians, cyclists, motor cyclists
and older road users), particularly in urban
areas, where some 75 per cent of road
accidents occur. For example, the child road
safety campaign is directed at encouraging
drivers to slow down when children are likely
to be about, particularly in urban areas.
Other areas for achieving lower casualties are
improvements in highway design, better
protection for vehicle occupants, encouraging
the use of cycle helmets and measures to
combat drinking and driving.
The Road Traffic Act 1991 introduced
several additional measures to improve road
safety, including the use of new technology,
such as remote-operated cameras, to improve
the detection of speeding and traffic-light
offences.
Traffic in Towns
Traffic management schemes are used in
many urban areas to reduce congestion, create
a better environment and improve road
safety. Such schemes include, for example,
one-way streets, bus lanes, facilities for
pedestrians Imd cyclists, and traffic-calming
249
BRITAIN 1994: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
measures such as road humps and chicanes to
constrain traffic speeds in residential areas.
Many towns have shopping precincts designed
for the convenience of pedestrians, from
which motor vehicles are excluded for all or
part of the day. Controls over on-street
parking are enforced through excess charges
and fixed penalties, supported where
appropriate by powers to remove vehicles. In
parts of London wheel clamping to immobilise
illegally parked vehicles is also used.
The fiftieth 20 mph (32 km/h) zone in
England was opened in March 1993 in
Poole, Dorset, little more than two
years after the 20 mph zone concept
was approved by the Government.
Early evidence from the TRL suggests
that the zones are reducing casualties
by well in excess of 50 per cent.
In June 1992 the Government announced
the designation of a network of priority ‘red
routes’ in London some 480 km (300 miles)
long. It is expected that the first of these
routes will be in operation during 1994. Red
routes, to be marked by red lining and special
signs, will be subject to special stopping
controls and other traffic management
measures, strictly enforced with higher
penalties. The Traffic Director for London
has been appointed to co-ordinate the
introduction and operation of the priority
routes throughout London. A pilot scheme in
north and east London, introduced in 1991,
has brought about significant falls in journey
times and greater reliability for buses, with a
consequent rise in passenger numbers.
Accident casualties along the route have
dropped significantly.
The Government has also set up a wide-
ranging study into urban traffic congestion,
including the lessons to be learnt from
improvements to traffic management in other
countries, and the question of ‘congestion
charging’ in London and other cities.
ROAD HAULAGE
Road haulage traffic by heavy goods vehicles
amounted to 121,250 million tonne-km in
1992, 3 per cent less than in 1991. There has
been a move towards larger and more
efficient vehicles carrying heavier loads—
about 78 per cent of the traffic, measured in
tonne-km, is carried by vehicles of over 25
tonnes laden weight. Much of the traffic is
moved over short distances, with 74 per cent
of the tonnage being carried on hauls of 100
km (62 miles) or less. Public haulage (private
road hauliers carrying other firms’ goods)
accounts for 71 per cent of freight carried in
Great Britain in terms of tonne-km. In 1992
the main commodities handled by heavy
goods vehicles were:
• crude minerals (327 million tonnes);
• food, drink and tobacco (290 million
tonnes); and
• building materials (136 million tonnes).
Road haulage is predominantly an industry
of small, privately owned businesses. There
were some 133,600 holders of an operator’s
licence in 1991. About half the heavy goods
vehicles are in fleets of ten or fewer vehicles.
The biggest operators in Great Britain are
NFC pic, Transport Development Group
pic, TNT Express (UK) Ltd and United
Carriers International Ltd.
Licensing and Other Controls
In general, those operating goods vehicles or
trailer combinations over 3.5 tonnes gross
weight require a goods vehicle operator’s
licence. Licences are divided into restricted
licences for own-account operators carrying
goods connected with their own business, and
standard licences for hauliers operating for
hire or reward. Proof of professional
competence, financial standing and good
repute is needed to obtain a standard licence.
Responsibility for granting licences rests with
seven independent Traffic Commissioners. In
Northern Ireland own-account operators do
not require a licence, although this matter is
under consideration.
Regulations lay down limits on the hours
worked by drivers of goods vehicles, and
minimum rest periods. Tachographs, which
automatically record speed, distance covered,
driving time and stopping periods,^ust be
fitted and used in most goods vehicles over
3.5 tonnes gross weight in Great Britain.
250
TRANSPORT AND COMMUNICATIONS
Speed limiters must also be fitted to
heavy lorries. Originally these had to be set
to limit speed to 60 mph (97 km/h), but
from January 1994 a programme is beginning
to reduce this gradually to 56 mph (90
km/h).
International Road Haulage
International road haulage has grown rapidly
and in 1992 about 1.4 million road goods
vehicles were ferried to mainland Europe or
the Irish Republic. Of these, 374,000 were
powered vehicles registered in Britain. In
1992 British vehicles carried almost 10
million tonnes internationally either inwards
or outwards, double the amount carried in
1984. About 95 per cent of this traffic was
with the European Community.
International road haulage within the EC
was fully liberalised from January 1993.
Pending the liberalisation of ‘cabotage’ (the
operation of domestic road haulage services
within a member state by a non-resident),
quotas of permits are available which allow
cabotage anywhere within the EC. Haulage
with other countries takes place under
bilateral agreements, most of which allow
unrestricted numbers of British lorries into
the country concerned, while some specify an
annual quota of permits. The European
Conference of Transport Ministers issues a
limited number of permits which allow free
access to, and transit across, a number of
countries in Central and Eastern Europe and
in Scandinavia.
PASSENGER SERVICES
Major changes in the structure of the
passenger transport industry have occurred in
recent years. Privatisation of the National
Bus Company (which was the largest single
bus and coach operator in Britain, operating
through 72 subsidiaries in England and
Wales) was completed in 1988. Each
subsidiary was sold separately, and
encouragement was given for a buy-out by
the local management or employees. London
Transport (LT) is a statutory corporation,
with its board members appointed by the
Secretary of State for Transport. Within LT
the main wholly-owned operating
subsidiaries are London Underground Ltd
(LUL) and London Buses Ltd; the
Government intends to offer the latter’s
operating companies for sale from late 1993
(see p. 252). The privatisation as ten separate
companies of the Scottish Bus Group,
formerly the largest operator of bus services
in Scotland, with some 3,000 vehicles, was
completed in 1991. The Government is
committed to the privatisation of the
remaining local authority-owned bus
companies, but these sales are on a voluntary
basis at present.
LT is testing a new bus passenger
information system. Called
Countdown, the system gives
information via dot-matrix displays
installed at 50 stops along the number
18 route in north London.
In Northern Ireland almost all road
passenger services are provided by
subsidiaries of the publicly owned Northern
Ireland Transport Holding Company.
Citybus Ltd operates services in Belfast, and
Ulsterbus Ltd operates most of the services
in the rest of Northern Ireland. These
companies have some 300 and 1,000 vehicles
respectively. As part of the Northern Ireland
Citizen’s Charter initiative, the bus
companies published a bus passengers’
charter in February 1993. This sets out the
companies’ commitment to customer care
and higher standards of service through
targets for punctuality, reliability and
cleanliness. Reports on the quality of service
are published twice a year in conjunction
with the General Consumer Council for
Northern Ireland.
As well as major bus operators, there are
also many small, privately owned
undertakings, often operating fewer than five
vehicles. Double-deck buses are the main
type of vehicle used for urban road
passenger transport in Britain, with some
21,000 in operation. However, there has been
a substantial increase in the number of
minibuses and midibuses in recent years, with
some 20,000 now in use. In addition, there
are some 30,000 other single-deck buses
251
BRITAIN 1994: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
and coaches. Some 3,500 million local bus
journeys were made in 1991-92.
Some £15.5 million has been allocated by
the Government in 1993-94 to local
authorities in England alone for measures
to promote bus use, such as bus lanes,
bus priority signalling and park-and-ride
schemes.
International Travel
British coaches regularly travel across the
continent of Europe, carrying passengers as
far afield as Greece and increasingly to
Eastern European countries. Regular coach
services still require authorisation or
permission from the authorities of the
countries to or through which they travel.
However, most tourist bus services within the
EC have now been liberalised. Operators no
longer need prior permission to run either
holiday shuttle services, where
accommodation is included as part of the
package, or occasional coach tours to, from or
within another member state.
Deregulation
Local bus services in Great Britain (except in
London) were deregulated in 1986, so that bus
operators are now able to run routes without
needing a special licence. Deregulation led to
an increase of 20 per cent in local bus mileage
outside London between 1985-86 and
1991-92, with some 84 per cent of services
operated without subsidy in 1991-92. Over
the same period the number of passengers has
fallen by 22 per cent outside London, in line
with long-term trends. Long-distance express
coach services have also been deregulated,
bringing about reductions in fares, the
provision of more services and an increase in
passengers. Local authorities can subsidise the
provision of socially necessary local bus
services after competitive tendering.
The Government is proposing the
deregulation of bus services in London and
the privatisation of London Buses Ltd. LT is
already required to involve the private sector
in the provision of services where this is more
efficient, and many London bus routes are
now run by private firms operating under
contract to LT. It is proposed to begin the
sale of the London Buses Ltd subsidiaries in
late 1993, once all the services have been put
on a contractual basis. Deregulation is
unlikely before 1995. On deregulation,
provision would be made for the operation
of socially necessary but uneconomic services
and for the continuation of a London-wide
concessionary travel scheme.
Taxis
There are about 56,000 licensed taxis in
Great Britain, mainly in urban areas;
London has about 17,000. In London and a
number of other cities taxis must be
purpose-built to conform to very strict
requirements and new ones have to provide
for people in wheelchairs. In most cases,
drivers must have passed a test of their
knowledge of the area. Private hire vehicles
with drivers may be booked only through
the operator and not hired on the street; in
most areas outside London private hire
vehicles are licensed.
A local authority can only limit the
number of licensed taxis if it is satisfied that
there is no unfulfilled demand for taxis in its
area. Taxi operators are able to run regular
local services and can tender in competition
with bus operators for services subsidised by
local authorities. To do this, they may apply
for a special ‘restricted’ bus operator’s
licence, allowing them to run local services
without having to obtain a full bus
operator’s licence. Taxis and licensed private
hire vehicles may also offer shared rides to
passengers paying separate fares.
There are some 4,000 licensed taxis in
Northern Ireland. Licences are issued by the
Department of the Environment for
Northern Ireland on a basis broadly similar
to that in Great Britain.
RAILWAYS
Railways were pioneered in Britain: the
Stockton and Darlington Railway, opened in
1825, was the first public passenger railway
in the world to be worked by steam power.
The main railway companies in Great
Britain were nationalised in 1948.
252
TRANSPORT AND COMMUNICATIONS
Organisation
The British Railways Board, set up in 1962,
controls most of the railway network in
Great Britain. Of its six business sectors,
InterCity, Network SouthEast and Regional
Railways services are responsible for the
passenger services. The other three sectors
are Railfreight Distribution, Trainload
Freight and Parcels. A subsidiary company,
European Passenger Services Ltd, has been
set up to operate international passenger rail
services through the Channel Tunnel. Other
subsidiary businesses include Union
Railways, which is responsible for taking
forward proposals for a high-speed rail link
between London and the Channel Tunnel.
Proposed Privatisation
The Government wishes to improve services
as rapidly as possible and considers that
privatisation—giving the private sector the
opportunity to operate existing services and
introduce new ones—is the best way to bring
this about for both passengers and freight
customers. Its proposals, published in July
1992, include:
• the franchising of all British Rail’s
existing passenger services to the private
sector;
• the transfer of British Rail’s existing
freight and parcels operations to the
private sector;
• the creation of a new right of access to
the rail network for private operators of
both passenger and freight services;
• the separation of track from train
operations, expected in April 1994, under
which British Rail will be divided into
track management—Railtrack—and a unit
to operate passenger services until they
are franchised to the private sector;
• the creation of two independent
authorities responsible to the
Government—a Rail Regulator to oversee
the fair application of arrangements for
track access and charging, and a
Franchising Director responsible for
negotiating, awarding and monitoring
franchises;
• opportunities for the private sector to
lease stations; and
• improved grant arrangements for
individual rail services or groups of
services.
Legislation has been introduced in
Parliament to secure these objectives. The
Government has set British Rail the aim of
privatising Red Star, its parcels service,
during 1993.

BRITAIN 1994: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Operations
In 1992-93 British Rail’s turnover, including
financial support and income from other
activities but excluding internal transactions,
was £3,863 million, of which £2,153 million
was derived from rail passenger services and
£635 million from freight services. It received
grants of £1,150 million as compensation for
the public service obligation to operate
sections of the passenger network in the
Regional sector and Network SouthEast that
would not otherwise cover their cost.
As part of the Citizen’s Charter initiative,
British Rail has agreed detailed service
standards with the Government for the
InterCity, Network SouthEast and Regional
Railways sectors and published its Passenger’s
Charter. Compensation is payable to
passengers when service falls by more than a
small margin below these standards. Several
standards have since been raised as part of a
1993 review. Service is also being improved
through better information, staff training and
extra assistance for disabled passengers. British
Rail launched its TrackRecord initiative in
May 1992, keeping passengers informed of
reliability and punctuality at main stations
throughout the country. Quality of service is
one of the key objectives that the Government
has set for British Rail.
British Rail has a substantial investment
programme, which totalled £1,354 million in
1992-93. Major areas of expenditure in British
Rail’s investment programme include rolling
stock and facilities for Channel Tunnel traffic
from the opening of the tunnel (see p. 255)
and new rolling stock and infrastructure
improvements in Network SouthEast.
Safety continues to be a priority for British
Rail. Railways remain one of the safest means
of transport, with the number of significant
train accidents per million miles in 1991-92
the lowest on record. British Rail’s safety plan,
first published in 1991, shows a commitment
to achieving even higher standards of railway
safety.
Passenger Services
The passenger network (see map facing
inside back cover) comprises a fast inter-city
network, linking the main centres of Great
Britain; local stopping services; and
commuter services in and around the large
conurbations, especially London and south¬
east England. British Rail runs some 750
InterCity trains a day, serving about 90
business and leisure centres. InterCity 125
trains, travelling at maximum sustained
speeds of 125 mph (201 km/h) are the
world’s fastest diesel trains. With the
introduction of the new electric InterCity 225
trains, British Rail now has more trains
running at over 100 mph (160 km/h) than
any other country in Europe.
About 30 per cent of route-mileage is
electrified, including British Rail’s busiest
InterCity route, linking London, the West
Midlands, the North West and Glasgow. The
most recent major electrification scheme was
that for the east coast main line between
London and Edinburgh (including the line
from Doncaster to Leeds). This scheme,
covering some 644 km (400 miles) and
costing £531 million at 1991 prices,
commenced full passenger services
between London King’s Cross and
Edinburgh in July 1991, using InterCity 225
electric trains.
A new generation of diesel multiple-unit
trains has been introduced on regional
services, while many of the older electric
multiple units used for commuting services in
London and south-east England are being
replaced by more efficient rolling stock. The
first of a new generation of ‘Networker’ trains
entered service in Kent in November 1992,
and some 674 coaches will be in service by
mid-1994. Investment in the trains and
associated track improvements will total £800
million. A diesel version is being brought into
service on lines to the west of London, with
some 240 vehicles due to be delivered
between 1992 and 1994.
Three major new rail links to airports have
recently been built or are planned:
• a new link between Stansted airport and
London Liverpool Street, which opened
in 1991;
• a link to connect Manchester airport to
the Manchester to Wilmslow (Cheshire)
line, which opened in May 1993; and
254
TRANSPORT AND COMMUNICATIONS
• a £235 million project for a line between
London Paddington and Heathrow
airport, to be built as a joint venture with
BAA pic, the airport’s owner.
Freight
Over 90 per cent of rail freight traffic is of
bulk commodities, mainly coal, coke, iron and
steel, building materials and petroleum. The
opening of the Channel Tunnel will present
an important opportunity for non-bulk freight
movement. The Government makes grants to
encourage companies to move goods by rail
rather than road; some 200 schemes have been
assisted since 1975 at a cost of £78 million. It
is intended that freight users will enjoy rights
of open access to the rail network from April
1994. This will allow the introduction of
services by new rail freight operators and
companies operating on their own account.
One of the largest ever grants to help
companies move freight by rail rather than
road was announced in June 1992. A total of
£4.25 million will assist in the construction of
facilities to move 500,000 tonnes of coal a year
from the Neath Valley to Cardiff docks. This
will remove some 25,000 lorry movements a
year from the south Wales road network.
Northern Ireland
In Northern Ireland the Northern Ireland
Railways Company Ltd, a subsidiary of the
Northern Ireland Transport Holding Company,
operates the railway service on some 320 km
(200 miles) of track. It published a revised
passenger charter in November 1992. This
includes a compensation scheme that operates if
targets for punctuality and reliability are not
met. Reports on the quality of service are
published in conjunction with the General
Consumer Council for Northern Ireland.
Channel Tunnel
Work is almost complete on the Channel
Tunnel, the largest civil engineering project in
Europe to be financed by the private sector.
Services through the tunnel are estimated to
start in early 1994, with the full range of
services operating by mid-1994. The project,
which is estimated to have cost £8,400
million up to the opening, is being
undertaken by Eurotunnel, a British-French
group which has a 55-year concession
agreement from the British and French
governments. This gives Eurotunnel the right
to build the tunnel and operate it for 55
years. Construction is being carried out for
Eurotunnel by Transmanche Link, a
consortium of ten British and French
construction companies. The first link-up
under the Channel, that of the central service
tunnel, took place in December 1990, and
break-through of the two rail tunnels was
achieved by mid-1991.
Eurotunnel Services
Eurotunnel will operate shuttle trains through
the tunnel between the terminals near
Folkestone and Calais, with the journey
taking about 35 minutes from platform to
platform. Eurotunnel trains will provide a
drive-on, drive-off service, with separate
shuttle trains for passenger and freight
vehicles. Car and coach passengers will stay
with their vehicles during the journey. Lorry
drivers will travel separately from their
vehicles, in a carriage at the front of the
shuttle. When full services are established,
Eurotunnel plans to run passenger shuttle
services every 15 minutes and freight shuttle
services every 20 minutes at peak periods. As
traffic grows, it should be possible for the
frequency of services to be increased.
British Rail Services
British Rail plans to invest some £1,400
million in new passenger and freight rolling
stock and infrastructure improvements for
Channel Tunnel services; over £1,000 million
has already been approved. Some 30 high¬
speed through passenger services are planned
to run each day between the London terminal
at Waterloo and Paris or Brussels, starting in
summer 1994 and using specially-designed
international rolling stock. Further rolling
stock, incorporating additional modifications,
is on order to provide through passenger day-
services from the Midlands, northern
England and Scotland to the mainland of
255
BRITAIN 1994: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Europe. Rolling stock is on order to provide
overnight passenger services from Scotland,
the North West, south Wales and the South
West, as well as from London, to continental
destinations.
Nine regional intermodal freight terminals
will be established for Channel Tunnel
services. With the infrastructure
improvements that British Rail has under
way, and the design of wagons that British
Rail intends to use, well over 90 per cent of
standard continental swap-bodies and
containers will be able to travel over the lines
between the tunnel and the British terminal
network, even though the British loading
gauge is smaller than the continental loading
gauge. The terminal facilities will allow the
easy transfer of freight between road and rail.
British Rail forecasts that it will transport
some 6 million tonnes of freight a year
through the tunnel.
To meet the forecast growth in demand
for through rail services, additional capacity
will eventually be required between London
and the Channel Tunnel. In March 1993 the
Government announced detailed proposals for
the route of a new high-speed rail link
crossing the River Thames and running
through east London to a second London
terminal, for which the preferred location is
St Pancras. It is intended that the £2,500
million project is taken forward as a joint
venture between the private and public
sectors. The Government has said that it is
willing to provide substantial public sector
support. The route is being designed so that
it can also carry freight if necessary.
Railways in London
London Underground Ltd operates services
on 392 km (244 miles) of railway, of which
about 167 km (105 miles) are underground.
The system has 248 stations, with 459 trains
operating in the peak period. Some 728
million passenger journeys were made on
London Underground trains in 1992-93.
Major investment in the Underground is
planned, including an extension of the Jubilee
Line to Stratford (east London) via Docklands
and the north Greenwich peninsula, dependent
upon negotiations over a substantial private
sector contribution. A proposed CrossRail
scheme would link Paddington with Liverpool
Street via a tunnel which would be used by
British Rail as well as Underground trains.
Much work is also under way updating the
existing system, including a £750 million
modernisation of the Central Line and the
refurbishment of over 200 trains at a cost of
£195 million. Total LUL investment will be
about £500 million in 1993-94, rising to over
£600 million in 1995-96.
LUL now has a charter that sets out
standards of service to passengers and the
compensation arrangements that apply if
these standards are not met.
The Docklands Light Railway (DLR), a
12-km (7.5-mile) route with 17 stations,
provides a service between the City of
London and Docklands. An extension
eastward to Beckton in the Royal Docks is
expected to open in autumn 1993 and, subject
to private finance being available, the line
may be extended under the River Thames to
Lewisham (south-east London). The
ownership of the DLR was transferred from
LT to the London Docklands Development
Corporation in April 1992. The Government
is currently considering the best way of
privatising the DLR.
A light rail network, which would link
Wimbledon, Beckenham and New Addington
to the centre of Croydon, is being promoted
by LT and the London borough of Croydon.
The 28-km (18-mile) network could be open
by 1997.
Other Urban Railways
Other urban railways in Great Britain are the
Glasgow Underground and the Tyne and
Wear Metro, a 59-km (37-mile) light rapid
transit system. In Greater Manchester the
first phase of the 31-km (19-mile) Metrolink
light rail system was officially opened in July
1992. Owned by the Greater Manchester
Passenger Transport Executive and operated
and maintained by GMML, a private sector
consortium, it links Manchester’s main
railway termini with Bury and Altrincham.
Midland Metro, a major light rail project in
the West Midlands, has been approved by
Parliament. Light rail schemes are being
256
TRANSPORT AND COMMUNICATIONS
considered in a number of other areas,
including Bristol, Cardiff, Chester, Cleveland,
Edinburgh, Glasgow, Leeds, Nottingham, and
Portsmouth.
The Government has allocated nearly
£120 million in 1993-94 to local
authorities in England in support of
local passenger transport schemes. Of
this, some £50 million is allocated
towards the construction of the 29-km
(18-mile) South Yorkshire Supertram
system in Sheffield. The system is
scheduled to be completed by the end
of 1995.
Private Railways
There are over 100 small, privately owned
passenger-carrying railways in Great Britain,
mostly operated on a voluntary basis and
providing limited services for tourists and
railway enthusiasts. The main aim of most of
these railways is the preservation and
operation of steam locomotives. They are
generally run on old British Rail branch lines,
but there are also several narrow-gauge lines,
mainly in north Wales.
INLAND WATERWAYS
Inland waterways are popular for recreation,
make a valuable contribution to the quality of
Britain’s environment, play an important part
in land drainage and water supply, and are
used to a limited extent for freight-carrying.
The most significant amounts of freight are
carried on the Rivers Thames, Forth,
Humber and Mersey and the Manchester
Ship Canal.
A government working group was
established in December 1992 to study the
use of the River Thames for transport. It
aims to identify the scope for private sector
development which would assist in fulfilling
the river’s potential for freight and passenger
traffic.
The publicly owned British Waterways
Board (BWB) is responsible for some
3,200 km (2,000 miles) of waterways in Great
Britain. The majority of waterways are
primarily for leisure use, but about 620 km
(385 miles) are maintained as commercial
waterways. The BWB is developing its
historical heritage for recreational and
commercial use, often in conjunction with the
private sector. In 1992-93 the BWB’s
turnover amounted to £84.6 million,
including a government grant of
£51.1 million to maintain its waterways to
statutory standards.
SHIPPING AND PORTS
In March 1993 British companies owned 704
trading vessels of 13.6 million deadweight
tonnes. Among the ships owned by British
companies were 169 vessels totalling 8.1
million deadweight tonnes used as oil,
chemical or gas carriers and 507 vessels
totalling 5.5 million deadweight tonnes
employed as dry-bulk carriers, container ships
or other types of cargo ship. Some 73 per
cent of British-owned vessels are registered in
Britain or British dependent territories such
as Bermuda.
The tonnage of the British-registered
trading fleet has been declining in recent
years. In recognition of this and in response
to the 1990 report of a joint government and
shipping industry working party, the
Government has simplified technical
procedures and regulations for the purpose of
ship registration. The Government also
makes funds available for Merchant Navy
officer training, the repatriation of crews in
the deep-sea trades and to support a Reserve
of ex-seafarers willing to serve in the
Merchant Navy in an emergency.
Cargo Services
About 94 per cent by weight (76 per cent by
value) of Britain’s overseas trade is carried by
sea. In 1992 British seaborne trade amounted
to 311 million tonnes (valued at £178,000
million) or 1,240,000 million tonne-km
(770,000 million tonne-miles). British-
registered ships carried 19 per cent by weight
and 36 per cent by value. Tanker cargo
accounted for 44 per cent of this trade by
weight, but only 7 per cent by value; dry
cargoes including foodstuffs and
257
BRITAIN 1994: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
manufactured goods accounted for
93 per cent by value.
Virtually all the scheduled cargo-liner
services from Britain are containerised. The
British tonnage serving these trades is
dominated by a relatively small number of
private sector companies and, in deep-sea
trades, they usually operate in conjunction
with other companies on the same routes in
organisations known as ‘conferences’. The
object of these groupings is to ensure regular
and efficient services with stable freight rates,
to the benefit of both shipper and shipowner.
In addition to the carriage of freight by liner
and bulk services between Britain and the rest
of Europe, there are many roll-on, roll-off
services to carry cars, passengers and
commercial vehicles.
Passenger Services
In 1992 there were 33 million international
sea passenger movements between Britain and
the rest of the world, compared with some 82
million international air movements. Almost
all the passengers who arrived at or departed
from British ports travelled to or from the
continent of Europe or the Irish Republic. In
1992 some 72,000 people embarked on
pleasure cruises from British ports. Traffic
from the southern and south-eastern ports
accounts for a substantial proportion of traffic
to the continent of Europe. The main British
operators are Sealink Stena Line, P & O and
Hoverspeed, although not all their vessels are
under the British flag. Services are provided
by roll-on, roll-off ferries, hovercraft,
hydrofoils and high-speed catamarans. There
has been a trend towards larger vessels in
recent years as the ferry companies prepare
for competition from the Channel Tunnel.
For example, P & O has recently introduced
the Pride of Burgundy, which can carry 600
cars, on the Dover-Calais route, and the
Pride of Bilbao, at 37,500 tonnes the largest
ferry plying out of a British port, on the
Portsmouth-Bilbao route.
Domestic passenger and freight ferry
services also run to many of the offshore
islands, such as the Isle of Wight, the Orkney
and Shetland islands, and the islands off the
west coast of Scotland. It is estimated that in
1991 there were some 36 million passengers
on such internal services.
Merchant Shipping Legislation and
Policy
The Government’s policy is one of minimum
intervention and the encouragement of free
and fair competition. However, regulations
administered by the Department of Transport
provide for marine safety and welfare, the
investigation of accidents and the prevention
and cleaning up of pollution from ships.
Britain also plays an important role in the
formulation of shipping policy within the
EC. The first stage of a Common Shipping
Policy involved agreement in 1986 on
regulations designed to:
• liberalise the Community’s international
trade;
• establish a competitive regime for
shipping; and
• enable the Community to take action to
combat protectionism from other
countries and to counter unfair pricing
practices.
For the second stage, now under
consideration, a range of measures has been
proposed to harmonise operating conditions
and strengthen the competitiveness of
Community members’ merchant fleets. Some
measures, such as facilitating the transfer of
ships between member states’ registers and
liberalising shipping within member states,
have already been agreed. The Government
has welcomed a European Commission
document, A Common Policy on Safe Seas,
which sets out an action programme for
maritime safety and pollution prevention
within the Community.
Ports
There are about 80 ports of commercial
significance in Great Britain, and in addition
there are several hundred small harbours that
cater for local cargo, fishing vessels, island
ferries or recreation. Port authorities are of
three broad types—trusts, local authorities
and companies—and most operate with
statutory powers under private Acts of
258
TRANSPORT AND COMMUNICATIONS
Parliament. Major ports controlled by trusts
include Aberdeen, Dover, Ipswich, Milford
Haven and 7 yne. Local authorities own many
small ports and a few much larger ports,
including Portsmouth and the oil ports in
Orkney and Shetland. The Ports Act 1991
facilitates the transfer of trust ports fully to
the private sector; Clyde, Forth, Medway,
Tees and Hartlepool and the Port of London
Authority dock undertaking at Tilbury have
already moved to the private sector.
Associated British Ports Holdings pic (a
private sector company) operates 22 ports,
including Cardiff, Grimsby and Immingham,
Hull, Newport, Southampton and Swansea.
Together its ports handled 105 million tonnes
of cargo in 1992. Other major ports owned by
companies include Felixstowe, Liverpool,
Manchester and a group of ferry ports,
including Harwich (Parkeston Quay) and
Stranraer.
Port Traffic
In 1992 traffic through the ports of Britain
amounted to 495 million tonnes, comprising
150 million tonnes of exports, 182 million
tonnes of imports and 163 million tonnes of
domestic traffic (which included offshore
traffic and landings of sea-dredged
aggregates). About 54 per cent of the traffic
was in fuels, mainly petroleum and petroleum
products.
Britain’s main ports, in terms of total
tonnage handled, are given in Table 17.3.
Sullom Voe (Shetland), Milford Haven and
Forth mostly handle oil, while the main ports
for non-fuel traffic are Dover, Felixstowe,
Grimsby and Immingham, Liverpool,
London, and Tees and Hartlepool.
Container and roll-on, roll-off traffic in
Britain has more than trebled since 1975 to
93 million tonnes in 1992 and now accounts
for about 77 per cent of non-bulk traffic. The
leading ports for container traffic are
Felixstowe, London and Southampton. Those
for roll-on, roll-off traffic are Dover (Britain’s
leading seaport in terms of the value of trade
handled), Felixstowe, Portsmouth and
Ramsgate.
Development
Most recent major port developments have
been at east- and south-coast ports. For
example, at Felixstowe a £50 million
extension to the terminal was completed in
1990, and a new £100 million terminal on the
River Medway caters for deep-sea container
traffic. Recent investment by Associated
British Ports includes:
• a £14 million extension of the oil
terminal at Immingham;
• an £11 million roll-on, roll-off terminal
at Hull; and
• a new riverside quay at King’s Lynn,
costing £3 million.
Purpose-built terminals for oil from the
British sector of the North Sea have been

BRITAIN 1994: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
built at Hound Point on the Forth, on the
Tees, at Flotta and at Sullom Voe (one of the
largest oil terminals in the world). Supply
bases for offshore oil and gas installations
have been built at a number of ports, notably
Aberdeen, Great Yarmouth and Heysham.
Safety at Sea
HM Coastguard Service, part of the
Department of Transport, is responsible for
co-ordinating civil maritime search and rescue
operations around the coastline of Britain. In
a maritime emergency the coastguard calls on
and co-ordinates facilities such as:
• coastguard helicopters and cliff rescue
companies;
• lifeboats of the Royal National Lifeboat
Institution (a voluntary body);
• Ministry of Defence aeroplanes,
helicopters and ships; and
• merchant shipping and commercial
aircraft.
In 1992 the Coastguard Service co¬
ordinated action in some 8,530 incidents
(including cliff rescues), in which 14,530
people were assisted. The establishment of
new coastal search and rescue consultative
committees was announced in 1992. These
aim to improve liaison between the
coastguards, potential users of the rescue
services and interested authorities.
Compliance with rules of behaviour when
navigating in traffic separation schemes
around the shores of Britain is mandatory for
all vessels of countries party to the
Convention on the International Regulations
for Preventing Collisions at Sea 1972. The
most important scheme affecting British
waters is in the Dover Strait, the world’s
busiest seaway. Britain and France jointly
operate the Channel Navigation Information
System, which provides navigational
information and also monitors the movement
of vessels in the strait. A new radar system
was officially opened in October 1993,
providing increased coverage of the area.
Following the loss of the tanker MV Braer
off Sumburgh in the Shetland Islands in
January 1993, the British Chamber of
Shipping agreed a voluntary code for the
routeing and operation of tankers around
Britain’s coast. A government inquiry has
also been set up to examine whether further
measures are appropriate to protect the
coastline from pollution from merchant
shipping.
The lighthouse authorities, which between
them control about 370 lighthouses and other
lights and buoys, are:
• the Corporation of Trinity House, which
covers England, Wales and the Channel
Islands;
• the Northern Lighthouse Board, for
Scotland and the Isle of Man; and
• the Commissioners of Irish Lights for
Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic.
They are funded mainly by light dues
levied on shipping in Britain and Ireland.
The Ports Act 1991 provided for the transfer
of certain lights and buoys to harbour
authorities where these are used mainly for
local rather than general navigation.
Responsibility for pilotage within harbours
rests with harbour authorities under the
Pilotage Act 1987.
CIVIL AVIATION
An innovative British air transport industry
responds to the demands of both
international and domestic passengers.
Airlines are seeking opportunities for
modernisation, and this is complemented by
the work of the aviation authorities in
negotiating new international rights and
improving facilities such as air traffic control.
British airlines are entirely in the private
sector, as are a number of the major airports.
Role of the Government
The Secretary of State for Transport is
responsible for aviation matters, including:
• negotiation of air service agreements with
more than 100 other countries;
• control of air services into Britain by
overseas airlines;
• British participation in the activities of
international aviation bodies;
• aviation security policy;
260
TRANSPORT AND COMMUNICATIONS
• environmental matters, such as aircraft
noise and emissions;
• investigation of accidents; and
• airports policy.
The Government’s civil aviation policy
aims to maintain high standards of safety and
security and to achieve environmental
improvements through reduced noise and
other emissions from aircraft. It is concerned
to promote the interests of travellers by
encouraging a competitive British industry,
and is committed to encouraging more
international services to and from regional
airports. The Government has taken the lead
in the EC and with bilateral partners in
negotiating freer arrangements within which
airline competition can flourish; agreement
was reached within the EC in 1992 on a
further package of liberalisation measures.
New arrangements with an increasing number
of countries are resulting in better provision
of services at more competitive fares.
Civil Aviation Authority
The Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) is an
independent statutory body, responsible for
the economic and safety regulation of the
industry and, jointly with the Ministry of
Defence, for the provision of air navigation
services. Its board members are appointed by
the Secretary of State for Transport. The
CAA’s primary objectives are to ensure that
British airlines provide air services to satisfy
all substantial categories of public demand
at the lowest charges consistent with a high
standard of safety and to further the
reasonable interests of air transport users.
Air Traffic
Total capacity offered on all services by
British airlines amounted to 23,200 million
available tonne-km in 1992: 17,100 million
tonne-km on scheduled services and 6,100
million tonne-km on non-scheduled services.
The airlines carried 38.2 million passengers
on scheduled services and 24.5 million on
charter flights; some 83 million passengers
travelled by air (international terminal
passengers) to or from Britain, a 14 per cent
increase on 1991.
The value of Britain’s overseas trade
carried by air in 1992 was some £44,140
million—20 per cent of exports by value and
18 per cent of imports. Air freight is
important for the carriage of goods with a
high value-to-weight ratio, especially where
speed is essential.
British Airways
British Airways pic is one of the world’s
leading airlines. In terms of international
scheduled services it is the largest in the
world. During 1992-93 British Airways’
turnover was £5,566 million (including
£5,519 million from airline operations), and
the British Airways group carried
28.1 million passengers on scheduled and
charter flights both domestically and
internationally.
The British Airways scheduled route
network serves 155 destinations in 72
countries. Its main operating base is
London’s Heathrow airport, but services from
Gatwick and regional centres such as
Manchester and Birmingham have been
expanding. Scheduled Concorde supersonic
services are operated from London Heathrow
to New York, Washington and, in the
summer, Toronto, crossing the Atlantic in
about half the time taken by subsonic aircraft.
In March 1993 British Airways had a fleet of
241 aircraft, the largest fleet in Western
Europe, comprising 7 Concordes, 56 Boeing
747s, 7 McDonnell-Douglas DC-10s, 5
Lockheed TriStars, 42 Boeing 757s, 10
Airbus A320s, 74 Boeing 737s, 20 Boeing
767s, 6 BAC One-Elevens and 14 BAe
Advanced Turboprops. A total of 68 aircraft
were on firm order.
Other Airlines
Other major British airlines include:
• Air UK, which has 28 aircraft and is
the only British airline to operate from
all three main airports in the London
area (Heathrow, Gatwick and Stansted);
• Britannia Airways, the world’s largest
charter airline, which carried over 6.9
million passengers in 1992 and has 33
aircraft;
261
BRITAIN 1994: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
• British Midland, which operates a large
network of scheduled services, and has 31
aircraft; and
• Virgin Atlantic, which operates scheduled
services between Britain, five North
American destinations and Tokyo, using
eight Boeing 747 aircraft, with four
more 747s and four Airbus A340s
on order.
Helicopters and Other Aerial Work
Helicopters are engaged on a variety of work,
especially operations connected with Britain’s
offshore oil and gas industry. The main
operators in Britain are Bond Helicopters,
Brintel Helicopters and Bristow Helicopters,
with 47, 22 and 64 helicopters respectively.
Light aircraft and helicopters are also
involved in other activities, such as charters,
search and rescue services, crop-spraying,
aerial surveying and photography, and police
and air ambulance operations.
Air Safety
The CAA is responsible, through its Safety
Regulation Group, for all aspects of civil
aviation safety. It licenses flight crew, ground
engineers, air traffic control officers,
aerodromes and fire and rescue services, and
it certifies the airworthiness of aircraft.
Every company operating aircraft used for
commercial purposes must possess an Air
Operator’s Certificate, which is granted by
the CAA when it is satisfied that the
operator is competent to secure the safe
operation of its aircraft. The CAA’s flight
operations inspectors, all of whom are
experienced airline pilots, and airworthiness
surveyors check that satisfactory standards
are maintained. All aircraft registered in
Britain must be granted a certificate of
airworthiness by the CAA before being
flown. In this and many other aspects of its
work, the CAA is increasingly working to
standards developed with its European
partners in the Joint Airworthiness
Authorities.
Each member of the flight crew of a
British-registered aircraft, every ground
engineer who certifies an aircraft fit to fly,
and every air traffic controller must hold the
appropriate official licence issued by the CAA.
Except for those with acceptable military or
other qualifying experience, all applicants for a
first professional licence must have undertaken
a full-time course of instruction which has
been approved by the CAA.
Air Traffic Control and Navigation Services
Civil and military air traffic control over
Britain and the surrounding seas, including a
large part of the North Atlantic, is carried out
by the National Air Traffic Services (NATS),
jointly responsible to the CAA and the
Ministry of Defence. NATS also provides air
traffic control at most of the major British
airports.
Britain plays a major role in European air
traffic control developments through
participation in a number of international
forums. Britain has put forward several
European initiatives, including the centralised
management of traffic flows throughout
Europe, which is being progressively
implemented over the period 1991-95. Within
Britain, NATS has an investment programme
currently running at around j£80 million a
year, which includes the construction of a new
air traffic control centre for England and
Wales, due to be completed in 1996. A scheme
for a new centre for Scotland is under
consideration by NATS.
Airports
Of the 148 licensed civil aerodromes in
Britain, about one-fifth handle more than
100,000 passengers a year each. Of these, 13
handle over 1 million passengers a year each
(see Table 17.4). In 1992 Britain’s civil
airports handled a total of 107.8 million
passengers (106.1 million terminal passengers
and 1.7 million in transit), and 1.2 million
tonnes of freight. Heathrow airport is the
world’s busiest airport for international travel
and is Britain’s most important airport for
passengers and air freight, handling 45 million
passengers (including transit passengers) and
758,000 tonnes of freight in 1991. Proposals
have been put forward for a fifth terminal,
which will be the subject of a public inquiry
262
TRANSPORT AND COMMUNICATIONS
and could eventually handle 30 million
passengers a year. Gatwick is also one of the
world’s busiest international airports.
Ownership and Control
Seven airports—Heathrow, Gatwick, Stansted
and Southampton in south-east England, and
Glasgow, Edinburgh and Aberdeen in
Scotland—are owned and operated by BAA
pic. Together they handle about 73 per cent
of air passengers and 84 per cent of air cargo
traffic in Britain.
Many of the other airports are controlled
by local authorities. A total of 15 major local
authority airports now operate as Companies
Act companies. The Government is
encouraging the introduction of private capital
into these new companies. It is intended that
Belfast International Airport will be privatised
in the second half of 1994.
The CAA has responsibility for the
economic regulation of the larger airports. It
has powers to take action to remedy practices
considered to be unreasonable or unfair, in
particular any abuse of an airport’s monopoly
position, and also to limit increases in charges
to airlines at certain airports. All airports used
for public transport and training flights must
also be licensed by the CAA for reasons of
safety. Stringent requirements, such as the
provision of adequate fire-fighting, medical
and rescue services, must be satisfied before a
licence is granted. Strict security measures
are in force, and the Aviation and Maritime
Security Act 1990 provides for greater
powers to enforce security requirements.
Tighter requirements for aviation
security were announced by the
Government in February 1993. In
particular, airlines will have to
account for all baggage and subject
any unaccompanied or unaccounted
item to security controls before
carrying it. It is provisionally
envisaged that all baggage at British
airports will be screened by April 1996.
Development
Major expansion has been undertaken at
several airports, including:
• Birmingham, where a second terminal
was opened in 1991, increasing capacity
to 6 million passengers a year;
• Manchester, where the first phase of a
second terminal opened in spring 1993,
increasing capacity by one-half to 18
million passengers a year; and
• Stansted, in Essex, where a new terminal
was opened in March 1991, with an
initial capacity of 8 million passengers a
year.

BRITAIN 1994: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Communications
The telecommunications industry is one of
the most rapidly growing sectors of the
British economy. Postal services also continue
to be important, with the volume of mail
in Britain growing rather than declining
despite the growth in electronic means of
communication in recent years.
TELECOMMUNICATIONS
Major changes have occurred since 1981, with
the progressive introduction of competition
into the markets for telecommunications
equipment and services. In 1984 British
Telecommunications (BT) was privatised, and
it faces increasing competition in the
provision of services over fixed links. The
main feature of the regulatory regime is an
independent industry regulator, the Director
General of Telecommunications.
Duopoly Review
In 1991 a major review of government
telecommunications policy resulted in the
publication of a White Paper, Competition and
Choice: Telecommunications Policy for the
1990s. This stated that the Government
would end the ‘duopoly policy’, under which
only two companies, BT and Mercury
Communications, were permitted to run
fixed-link telecommunications systems. Other
important points of the review were:
• greater freedom for existing mobile
telecommunications operators and the
ability of cable television operators to
provide telephone services in their own
right;
• more effective and streamlined
procedures for the interconnection of
systems;
• guidelines for the introduction of ‘equal
access’, by which customers can exercise
choice over the trunk operator that
carries their calls; and
• the establishment of a new regime for
national numbering, and the modification
of operators’ licences to allow for the
introduction of number portability.
Office of Telecommunications
The Office of Telecommunications (OFTEL),
a non-ministerial government department, is
the independent regulatory body for the
telecommunications industry. It is headed by
the Director General of Telecommunications,
among whose functions are to:
• ensure that licensees comply with the
conditions of their licences;
• initiate the modification of licence
conditions by agreement or a reference to
the Monopolies and Mergers
Commission;
• promote effective competition in the
telecommunications industry;
• provide advice to the President of the
Board of Trade on telecommunications
matters; and
• investigate complaints.
The Director General also has a duty
to promote the interests of consumers in
respect of prices, quality and variety in
telecommunications services.
Under the White Paper proposals,
OFTEL will be taking over responsibility for
administering the new national telephone
numbering scheme. It will also oversee the
introduction of a limited ‘number portability’
scheme, enabling someone who wishes to
change service provider at the same address
to retain their existing number, rather than
change it, as at present.
OFTEL’s 1992 quality of service report,
published in December 1992, showed that
written complaints and enquiries to OFTEL
ranged between 2,000 and 3,000 a quarter.
The largest category was disputes over bills,
but the number of cases was decreasing,
possibly because the introduction of itemised
billing and premium-rate call barring was
giving customers more control over bills.
BT
In 1984 BT was reconstituted as a public
limited company, and a majority of the
ordinary voting shares were sold to private
investors. In December 1991 the Government
sold a further tranche of shares in a public
offer, reducing its holding in BT to about 22
264
TRANSPORT AND COMMUNICATIONS
per cent. The sale of the remaining holding
took place in July 1993.
BT runs one of the world’s largest public
telecommunications networks, including:
• 20.1 million residential lines;
• 6 million business lines;
• about 58,000 telex connections;
• more than 104,000 public payphones; and
• a wide range of specialised voice, data,
text and visual services.
The inland telephone and telex networks
are fully automatic. International direct
dialling is available from Britain to 200
countries, representing 99 per cent of the
world’s telephones.
Network Modernisation
BT has invested more than £17,000 million in
the modernisation and expansion of its network
to meet the increasing demand for basic
telephone services and for more specialised
services. The company has more than 2
million km (1.2 million miles) of optical fibre
laid in its network in Britain, a higher
proportion than any other world operator.
There are more than 3,650 digital and modern
electronic exchanges serving some 80 per cent
of telephone lines. The combination of digital
exchange switching and digital transmission
techniques, using optical fibre cable and
microwave radio links, is substantially
improving the quality of telephone services. It
also makes possible a wider range of services
through the company’s main network.
General Services
BT’s services include:
• a free facility for emergency calls to the
police, fire, ambulance, coastguard,
lifeboat and air-sea rescue services;
• directory enquiries;
• various chargeable operator-connected
services, such as reversed-charge calls and
alarm calls;
• an operator-handled Freefone service and
automatic ‘LinkLine’ facilities that enable
callers to contact organisations anywhere
in Britain, either free or at local-call rates;
• Callstream, a premium-rate service which
allows callers to obtain information from
independent providers; and
• network services such as three-way
calling, call waiting and call diversion,
which are available to customers on
digital exchanges.
Under a public payphone service
modernisation programme, a total of £165
million has been spent on modernisation and
additional provision on sites convenient for
travellers, such as railway stations and
motorway service areas. A number of cashless
call services are available, including the
Phonecard service using prepaid cards and
phones that accept credit cards. Phonecard
payphones account for more than 19,000 of
the total of 113,000 payphones. There are
about 280,000 private rented payphones on
premises to which the public has access and
these are also being upgraded with push¬
button equipment.
BT Electronic Information Services (an
electronic mail and information service) forms
part of the company’s portfolio of global
network services. Through links with other
databases, a wide range of other services,
such as company accounting and market
research information, banking services,
holiday booking and reservation facilities,
insurance and financial markets information,
and BT’s telephone directories, are available.
International Services
BT is the second largest shareholder in the
International Telecommunications Satellite
Organisation (of which 125 countries are
members) and in the European
Telecommunications Satellite Organisation.
It is also a leading shareholder in the
International Maritime Satellite Organisation,
with interests in a number of other consortia.
A substantial proportion of the
intercontinental telephone traffic to or from
Britain is carried by satellite. BT operates
satellite earth stations in the London
Docklands and at Goonhilly Downs
(Cornwall), Madley (near Hereford) and
Aberdeen. Its range of digital transmission
services includes a number available overseas,
including ‘Satstream’ private-circuit digital
265
BRITAIN 1994: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
links covering North America and Western
Europe using small-dish aerials, and an
‘International Kilostream’ private-circuit
service available to the United States,
Australia and most major business centres in
Asia and the rest of Europe. Extensive direct-
dial maritime satellite services are available for
vessels worldwide. In-flight operator-
controlled telephone call facilities are available
via Portishead radio station near Bristol.
Digital transmission techniques have been
introduced for services to the United States,
Japan, Hong Kong and Australia via the
Madley and Goonhilly stations.
Recent advances in submarine cable design,
with the use of optical fibre technology, have
significantly increased capacity. A high-
capacity transatlantic optical fibre cable (TAT
9), which cost about £250 million and can
carry about 75,000 telephone calls
simultaneously, came into operation in 1992 to
supplement an earlier link.
BT’s overseas consultancy service,
Telconsult, has so far completed 270 projects
in more than 60 countries.
Mercury Communications
Mercury Communications Ltd, a subsidiary
of Cable and Wireless pic and BCE, is
licensed as a public telecommunications
operator in Britain. Mercury has constructed
its own long-distance all-digital network
comprising over 5,690 km (3,560 miles) of
optical fibre cables and 2,700 km (1,685
miles) of digital microwave links. The
network runs from the north of Scotland to
the south coast, serving over 100 cities and
towns across Britain. Coverage is enhanced
through Mercury’s own city cable networks
and through partnerships with local cable
television operators. Service is also provided
over microwave connections.
Mercury offers a full range of long¬
distance and international telecommunications
services for both business and residential
customers. In addition to voice and data
transmission, the company supplies
sophisticated messaging systems, mobile
telecommunications and a range of equipment
for customers’ premises. Major customers can
have a direct digital link between their
premises and the Mercury network. A
number of routeing devices have also been
developed to enable customers to use
Mercury indirectly via their existing exchange
lines. Residential customers can buy a
Mercury-compatible phone and gain access to
the company’s network at the push of a
button. In addition, customers will soon be
able to use the Mercury network by dialling
an access code.
International services are provided by
satellite communications centres in London’s
Docklands and in Oxfordshire, as well as by
submarine cable links to Europe and the
United States.
Other Operators
Other operators include Kingston
Communications, which is the long-
established network operator for the Kingston
upon Hull area of Britain.
The duopoly review (see p. 264) allowed
other would-be operators to apply for licences
to provide telecommunications services over
fixed links. By June 1993, the Government
had received 59 applications, and 21 licences
had been granted. Major licences have been
granted to lonica, COLT, Energis (a
subsidiary of National Grid) and Scottish
Hydro-Electric. lonica is installing a new
national network using radio to provide the
final connection to customers. COLT is
focusing on business customers in the
Greater London area. Energis and Scottish
Hydro-Electric are the first two electricity
companies to expand their interests into
telecommunications, using their infrastructure
as a platform for installing new optical fibre
networks.
Mobile Communications
The Government has encouraged the
expansion of mobile telecommunications
services. It has licensed Vodafone Ltd and
Telecom Securicor Cellular Radio Ltd to run
competing national cellular radio systems.
Considerable investment has been made in
establishing their networks to provide
increased capacity for the growing numbers
of cellular radio telephone users (over 1.3
266
TRANSPORT AND COMMUNICATIONS
million by the end of 1992). The two
companies will also run the new pan-European
mobile system, known as GSM, in Britain.
Britain was the first country to offer
personal communications network (PCN)
services, which are intended to allow the same
telephone to be used at home, at work and as
a portable wherever there is network capacity.
In 1991 the Government issued licences to
three operators—Mercury Personal
Communications Ltd, Microtel
Communications Ltd and Unitel Ltd (which
has since merged with Mercury Personal
Communications to form Mercury One-2-
One) to run PCNs in the frequency range
around 1.8 gigahertz. The Mercury One-2-
One service was launched in September 1993.
Hutchison launched its ‘Rabbit’ telepoint
service in 1992. It allows calls to be made
within range of a base station situated in a
public place, and the handset can be used
within the home as a cordless telephone.
National Band Three Ltd is licensed to
offer a nationwide trunked radio service,
while 15 licences have now been awarded for
London and regional services. Four licences
to operate mobile data networks have also
been granted, and another eight to run
nationwide paging networks.
Cable Television
The Government has licensed 121
companies that were awarded local cable
television franchises to run broadband cable
telecommunications systems. All 62 systems
due to be in operation by the end of 1993 will
provide television programmes, but many also
offer voice telephony services. The
Government concluded in the duopoly review
that cable operators should be able to offer
voice telephony in their own right, which
they could previously provide only in
conjunction with BT or Mercury. By May
1993 the cable operators had installed 156,000
telephone lines in Britain, compared with
2,200 lines in January 1991.
Cable & Wireless
Cable and Wireless pic provides a wide range
of telecommunications in some 50 countries
worldwide. Its main business is the provision
and operation of public telecommunications
services in over 30 countries and territories,
including Hong Kong, the United States and
Japan, under franchises and licences granted
by the governments concerned. It also
provides and manages telecommunications
services and facilities for public and private
sector customers, and undertakes consultancy
work. It operates a fleet of 11 ships and three
submersible vehicle systems for laying and
maintaining submarine telecommunications
cables. In recent years the company has been
constructing and bringing into service a
broadband digital network linking major
world economic and financial centres in
Europe, north America and the Pacific rim.
Cable & Wireless is pursuing a strategy
of providing premium services for
business customers, expanding basic
telecommunications services and building up
mobile communications businesses around
the world.
POSTAL SERVICES
The Post Office, founded in 1635, pioneered
postal services and was the first to issue
adhesive postage stamps as proof of advance
payment for mail.
The Royal Mail provides deliveries to 24.5
million addresses and handles over 61 million
letters and parcels each working day, which
comes to over 15,400 million items a year.
Some 180 million parcels were handled in
1991-92. Mail is collected from over 100,000
posting boxes, as well as from post offices
and large postal users.
Mail sorting is increasingly done through
mechanised letter offices; some 80 are now in
operation. The British postcode system is one
of the most sophisticated in the world,
allowing mechanised sorting down to part of
a street on a postman’s round and, in some
cases, to an individual address.
Britain has good international postal
services, with prices among the cheapest.
Royal Mail International dispatches
659 million items a year, including some 600
million by air. It has its own mail handling
centre at Heathrow, opened in 1989, which
handles some four-fifths of outward airmail.
267
BRITAIN 1994: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
It uses 1,400 flights a week to send mail
direct to over 300 destinations worldwide.
Post Office Counters Ltd handles a wide
range of transactions; it acts as an agent for
the letters and parcels businesses, government
departments, local authorities and Girobank,
which was transferred to the private sector in
1990. There are over 19,000 post offices, of
which some 900 are operated directly by the
Post Office. The remainder are franchise
offices or are operated on an agency basis by
sub-postmasters.
Post Office Specialist Services
The Post Office offers a range of specialist
services. Parcelforce ‘Datapost’, a door-to-
door delivery service, provides overnight
delivery throughout Britain and an
international service to over 160 countries.
‘Datapost Sameday’ provides a rapid delivery
within or between more than 100 cities and
towns in Britain. The Philatelic Bureau in
Edinburgh is an important outlet for the Post
Office’s philatelic business, including sales to
overseas collectors or dealers. The British
Postal Consultancy Service offers advice and
assistance on all aspects of postal business to
overseas postal administrations, and over 50
countries have used its services since 1965.
Competition in Postal Services
The Post Office has a monopoly on the
conveyance of letters within Britain, but the
President of the Board of Trade has the
power to suspend the monopoly in certain
areas or for certain categories of mail and to
license others to provide competing services.
He has suspended the monopoly on letters
subject to a minimum fee of £1, and has
issued general licences enabling mail to be
transferred between document exchanges and
allowing charitable organisations to carry
Christmas cards. As set out in the Citizen’s
Charter, the Government intends to introduce
wider competition in postal services by:
• the reduction of the present £1 letter
monopoly to a level much closer to the
price of a first-class stamp;
• an extended discount system, so that the
Post Office could offer further discounts
to users who carry their mail in bulk as
far as the final delivery office; and
• the licensing of ‘niche’ services under the
monopoly limit.
Under these proposals, the President of
the Board of Trade would be advised by a
new regulator on ways of preventing the Post
Office from cross-subsidising its services in
ways which may be unfair to its competitors
or to specific groups of customers. The
Government has subsequently announced its
intention to privatise Parcelforce, the Post
Office’s parcels operation, in due course. An
essential requirement would be the
continuation of a universal parcels service at a
uniform and affordable price. The
Government is also conducting a review of
the Post Office’s organisation and structure,
which builds upon the proposals set out in
the Citizen’s Charter. Both public and private
sector options are being considered.
Private Courier and Express Service
Operators
Private-sector couriers and express operators
are able to handle time-sensitive door-to-door
deliveries, subject to a minimum fee of j£l.
The courier/express service industry has
grown rapidly and the revenue created by the
carriage of these items is estimated at over
£3,000 million a year. Britain is one of the
main providers of monitored express
deliveries in Europe, with London an
important centre for air courier/express traffic.

Britain has a long tradition of research and innovation in science, technology
and engineering in universities, research institutes and industry. Its record of
achievement is in many ways unsurpassed, from the contributions of Isaac
Newton to physics and astronomy in the 16th and 17th centuries (theory of
gravitation and three laws of motion) and the inventions of Michael Faraday
in the 19th century (the first electric motor, generator and transformer) to
more recent breakthroughs in the 20th century.
INTRODUCTION
British achievements in science and
technology in the 20th century include
fundamental contributions to modern
molecular genetics through the discovery of
the three-dimensional molecular structure of
DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) by Francis
Crick, Maurice Wilkins, James Watson and
Rosalind Franklin in 1953.
Further notable contributions over the
past 20 years have been made by Stephen
Hawking in improving the understanding of
the nature and origin of the universe; Brian
Josephson in superconductivity (abnormally
high electrical conductivity at low
temperatures); Martin Ryle and Anthony
Hewish in radio-astrophysics; and Godfrey
Hounsfield in computer-assisted tomography
(a form of radiography) for medical diagnosis.
Much pioneering work was done during
the 1980s. For example, in 1985 British
Antarctic Survey scientists discovered the
hole in the ozone layer over the Antarctic.
Also in 1985 Alec Jeffreys invented DNA
fingerprinting, a forensic technique which can
identify an individual from a small tissue
sample. More recently there have been
several breakthroughs in genetics research,
including the identification of the gene in the
Y chromosome responsible for determining
sex, and the identification of other genes
linked to diseases, including cystic fibrosis
and a type of inherited heart disease. Gene
therapy has begun on the treatment of cystic
fibrosis. The world’s first pig with a
genetically modified heart has been bred by
scientists at Cambridge University, an
important milestone in breeding animals as
organ donors for people.
Nobel prizes for science have been won by
70 British citizens, more than any other
country except the United States. The two
most recent prize-winners were Richard
Roberts (medicine) and Michael Smith
(chemistry).
Research and Development Expenditure
Total expenditure in Britain on scientific
research and development (R & D) in 1991
was £11,906 million, 2.1 per cent of gross
domestic product. Some 50 per cent was
provided by industry and 35 per cent by
269
BRITAIN 1994: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
government. Significant contributions were
also made by private endowments, trusts and
charities. In many cases private-sector and
state industries finance their own research
and run their own laboratories. Industry also
funds university research and finances
contract research at government
establishments. Some charities have their own
laboratories and offer grants for outside
research. Contract research organisations
carry out similar R & D for companies and
are playing an increasingly important role in
the transfer of technology to British industry.
Total spending on R & D in industry
amounted to £1,168 million in 1991-92. Of
this total, industry’s own contribution was 69
per cent, with 15 per cent from government
and the rest from overseas. The main areas of
expenditure were electronics (£2,180 million,
amounting to 28 per cent of the total);
chemicals (£1,886 million); and aerospace
(£1,121 million). Some examples of recent
notable R & D projects in these sectors are
given below.
Electronics
British firms and research organisations, with
government support, are involved in the
development and application of the family of
‘three-five’ semiconductor materials (such as
gallium arsenide). These materials are used
mainly in microwave devices in satellite
communications and radar equipment, and
are leading to the development of much faster
computers.
BT (British Telecom) has led in the
development of optical fibre communications
systems and has paved the way for simpler
and cheaper optical cables by laying the first
non-repeatered cable over 100 km (62 miles)
long, and by developing the first all-optical
repeater. Britain also has a world lead in the
transmission of computerised data along
telephone lines for reproduction on television
screens. Up to 800 R & D projects are carried
out by BT at any one time; a recent example
is the development of a video handset with an
optical telephone link. Around two-thirds of
its research is in software engineering.
The transputer, a powerful ‘computer on a
chip’, was designed and built in Britain.
Several companies have developed powerful
machines based on the transputer.
Chemicals
Research performed by the chemicals industry
over the past few years has led to significant
technological and commercial breakthroughs.
ICI has pioneered the microbial production of
a biodegradable plastic, Biopol, and is at the
forefront of global efforts to develop
substitutes for chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs).
Pharmaceuticals is the most research¬
intensive sector of the chemicals industry
(see p. 162). Research conducted by Zeneca,
Glaxo, SmithKline Beecham and Fisons has
led to the development of the first successful
beta-blockers, drugs used in the treatment of
cardiovascular conditions; semi-synthetic
penicillins; vaccines; and treatments for
cancer, asthma, migraine and arthritis. Glaxo
is Britain’s biggest pharmaceutical company.
Its new £500 million research centre at
Stevenage (Hertfordshire) is to be opened in
1994. It manufactures the world’s best-selling
pharmaceutical, Zantac, which is used in the
treatment of gastric ulcers.
Among a host of other research interests
are the application of biotechnology to
pharmaceuticals, disease-resistant crops, new
forms of food, plant science, and the
development of advanced materials such as
engineering plastics. The biotechnology sector
consists of some 70 companies whose
activities include the development and
manufacture of products using genetic
engineering techniques.
Aerospace
Britain has led the world in many aspects of
aerospace R & D over the past 80 years.
Pioneering achievements include radar, jet
engines, Concorde, automatic landing, vertical
take-off and landing, flight simulators and
ejector seats. British Aerospace, with Marconi
and Dowty Boulton Paul, developed a system
known as ‘fly-by-wire’, in which flying
control surfaces are moved by electronic
rather than mechanical means. GEC Avionics
has also developed the world’s first optically
signalled (‘fly-by-light’) system. The concept
270
SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
of head-up display (HUD) was pioneered
and developed in Britain. This system
electronically projects symbols into the pilot’s
view, avoiding the need to look down at
instruments. GEC Avionics has developed a
holographic HUD, which enables pilots to
fly at high speeds at very low altitude in
darkness.
Government Policy and Organisation
Organisation to 1 April 1994
Science and technology issues are the
responsibility of a Cabinet Minister, the
Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, acting
on behalf of the Prime Minister. The
Minister is supported by the Office of
Science and Technology (OST)—part of the
Office of Public Service and Science within
the Cabinet Office—headed by the
Government’s Chief Scientific Adviser. The
OST receives independent advice from
eminent scientists, technologists, engineers
and industrialists.
In addition to its role in overall science
policy and co-ordination, the OST is
responsible for the science budget and the
five government-financed research councils:
the Science and Engineering Research
Council (SERC), the Medical Research
Council (MRC), the Natural Environment
Research Council (NERC), the Agricultural
and Food Research Council (AFRC) and the
Economic and Social Research Council
(ESRC). (Organisational changes to these
councils, taking effect from April 1994, are
described on p. 272.) OST funding provides
assistance for research, through the research
councils, in the following ways:
• grants and contracts to universities and
other higher education establishments and
to research units;
• funding of research council
establishments;
• support for postgraduate study; and
• subscriptions to international scientific
organisations.
The OST also provides support to
universities through programmes administered
through the Royal Society and the Royal
Academy of Engineering (see p. 282).
Finance
Government finance for R & D goes to
research establishments, institutions of higher
education and private industry, as well as to
collaborative research programmes.
Total net government R & D
expenditure (both civil and defence) in
1992-93 was £5,404 million, of which £2,954
million was devoted to civil science. The
science budget (net of receipts) totalled £994
million in 1992—93. The planned net
expenditure of £1,142 million for the
research councils in 1994-95 represents a 23
per cent increase in real terms compared with
1991-92.
Among other government departments,
the Ministry of Defence (MoD—see p. 278)
has the largest research budget. The main
civil departments involved are the
Department of Trade and Industry (DTI—
see p. 276), the Ministry of Agriculture,
Fisheries and Food (MAFF—see p. 279) and
the Department for Education (DFE—see
p. 279).
Future Plans
A White Paper Realising Our Potential: A
Strategy for Science, Engineering and
Technology was published in May 1993,
containing the first major policy review on
science for over 20 years. The Government’s
strategy is to improve Britain’s
competitiveness and quality of life by
maintaining the excellence of science,
engineering and technology in Britain. This
will be done by:
• developing stronger partnerships with
and between the science and engineering
communities, industry and the research
councils;
• supporting the science and engineering
base to advance knowledge, increase
understanding and produce highly
educated and trained people;
• contributing to international research
efforts, particularly European research;
271
BRITAIN 1994: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
• promoting the public understanding of
science, technology and engineering; and
• ensuring the efficiency and effectiveness
of government-funded research.
A number of changes are planned to the
organisation and direction of government-
funded science and technology:
• A new Council for Science and
Technology will be set up by the end of
October 1993. It will be chaired by the
Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster
and will involve research customers,
industrialists, academics, business people
and departmental chief scientists. It will
provide advice to assist in the setting of
research priorities, and will draw on the
findings of a new Technology Foresight
Programme which will be produced by
the end of 1994.
• A new ‘Forward Look’ will be published
by the Government each year. This will
give industrialists and researchers a
regular statement of the Government’s
strategy.
• The research council system will be
restructured. SERC and AFRC will cease
to exist in their present form. Two new
councils, the Engineering and Physical
Sciences Research Council and the
Particle Physics and Astronomy Research
Council, will divide between them most
of SERC’s portfolio. A third, the
Biotechnology and Biological Sciences
Research Council, will take over
responsibility for the AFRC programme
and SERC’s work in biology and
biotechnology. All councils will have
‘mission statements’ with commitments
to enhancing industrial competitiveness
and quality of life. Management
structures will be modified, and councils
will have part-time chairmen and women
selected to bring in industrial and
commercial experience. These changes
will take effect on 1 April 1994. A
Director General of Research Councils
within OST will advise ministers on the
performance and needs of the science and
engineering base.
• The customer-contractor principle will be
maintained and strengthened.
• The OST will play the major role in co¬
ordinating science and technology issues
involving more than one department.
• Improved co-ordination of European and
other international negotiations is
planned.
RESEARCH COUNCILS
Each research council is an autonomous body
established under Royal Charter, with
members of its governing council drawn from
the universities, professions, industry and the
Government. Councils conduct research
through their own establishments and by
supporting selected research, study and
training in universities and other higher
education institutions. In addition to funding
from the OST, they also receive income for
research commissioned by government
departments and from the private sector.
Income from commissioned research is
particularly important for the AFRC and
NERC.
LINK is an important scheme for the
research councils’ collaboration with industry.
It is designed to bridge the gap between
scientific research and the resulting
commercial applications. It encourages
collaboration on high-quality, industrially
relevant research between industry and higher
education institutions and research bodies.
Under the scheme, government funds 50 per
cent of costs and industry the other half.
Formerly a joint DTI-OST project, in 1993
the OST was given the leading responsibility
for LINK in line with its responsibilities for
cross-governmental projects.
By May 1993 government funding
worth £200 million had been
committed to 32 LINK programmes,
mainly in the areas of biotechnology,
advanced materials, advanced
manufacturing and electronics, and
oil exploration. A new LINK
programme plans to use micro¬
organisms to clean contaminated soil
and water.
Institutions undertaking research with the
support of research council grants have the
272
SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
rights and responsibility for the commercial
exploitation of that research, subject to prior
agreement with the sponsoring research
council. Universities and research institutes
may make use of the expertise of the British
Technology Group (BTG—see p. 281) to
patent and license their inventions.
Science and Engineering Research
Council
On 1 April 1994 SERC is to be split into two
research councils and its responsibilities
reallocated. Until then SERC is responsible
for supporting research and postgraduate
training in pure and applied science and
engineering outside the areas of agriculture,
medicine and the environment covered by the
other research councils. With the largest share
of research council funding, expenditure in
1992- 93 totalled £524 million, including:
• research grants, chiefly to higher
education institutions (£198.8 million);
• contributions to international
organisations (£103.2 million—see
p. 284); and
• funding of postgraduate training
(£85.2 million).
The Council has funded interdisciplinary
research centres in fields such as high-
temperature superconductivity, engineering
design, molecular sciences, high performance
materials, and optical- and laser-related
science and technology. It has developed
stronger links with industry to improve the
transfer of knowledge from the science and
engineering base. Collaboration between
higher education and industry has been
encouraged, partly by sponsoring co-ordinated
research programmes in areas of special
industrial concern. SERC’s allocation for
1993- 94 is £582 million. The increase in
funding is benefiting the development of new
materials, clean technologies, earth
observation and atmospheric chemistry.
SERC is the largest single national source of
support for postgraduate students.
SERC maintains six research
establishments: the Rutherford Appleton
Laboratory at Chilton (Oxfordshire), which is
the largest; Daresbury Laboratory in
Warrington (Cheshire); Royal Greenwich
Observatory in Cambridge; the Royal
Observatory in Edinburgh; and two overseas
observatories on La Palma in the Canary
Islands, and Hawaii. These centres of
specialised research have experimental
facilities beyond the resources of individual
academic institutions; they also undertake
contract research.
Until 1 April 1994 SERC’s research
support is organised under three boards,
covering science and materials; engineering
and technology; and particles, space and
astronomy.
Science and Materials
The Science and Materials Board’s main
objective is to ensure the vitality of the core
sciences—chemistry, physics, biology and
mathematics—and of materials science. The
Board supports academic and
interdisciplinary research, and promotes.
collaboration between the academic sector,
industry and the international scientific
community. Research is supported through
grants and by providing access to major
world-class facilities. It may be either on a
national basis, such as the ISIS pulsed
neutron source at the Rutherford Appleton
Laboratory, or through international
collaboration, such as projects at the
Institut Laue-Langevin and the European
Synchrotron Radiation Facility in Grenoble
(see p. 284).
Engineering and Technology
The Engineering and Technology Board
supports fundamental and strategic research
into the development of advanced technology.
It initiates and sustains co-ordinated
programmes of research which may be
developed by others to give direct benefit to
industry, particularly the aerospace, electrical
engineering, power generation, mechanical
engineering, and motor vehicle sectors. With
the DTI, the Board supports the improved
use of information technology for all
categories of user.
The Clean Technology programme,
launched in 1992 with the AFRC, aims to
273
BRITAIN 1994: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
stimulate research leading to new technologies
to prevent pollution caused by industry and
agriculture. In collaboration with the MAFF,
the Coastal Engineering Research Programme
is investigating beach erosion and estuary
pollution. SERC has contributed about £1
million towards a new coastal research facility
at Wallingford (Oxfordshire), where advanced
computer and modelling techniques are being
developed to investigate problems in coastal
protection.
Particles, Space and Astronomy
Particle physics funding is provided to allow
researchers in higher education institutions
access to leading facilities such as those at
CERN (the European Organisation for
Nuclear Research—see p. 284) and DESY
(Deutsches Electronen Synchrotron).
The Particles, Space and Astronomy Board
supports a number of eminent researchers in
theoretical particle physics who have gained
an international reputation for their work on
the unification of the fundamental forces of
nature.
The Board’s support for space science
includes contributions to international
programmes (see pp. 284-5), ground-based
astronomy and geophysics. In optical
astronomy SERC is a principal partner in the
international observatory on La Palma in the
Canary Islands. The observatory’s four
telescopes include the 4.2-m William
Herschel. Opened in 1987, it is the third
largest single-mirror optical telescope in the
world. On Mauna Kea, Hawaii, SERC has a
3.8-m infra-red telescope, the largest
telescope in the world designed specifically
for infra-red observations, and the 15-m
James Clerk Maxwell radio telescope (built in
collaboration with the Netherlands and
Canada). Such telescopes have proved
invaluable to scientists researching the
creation of the universe. A centre is planned
to co-ordinate data from four satellite-borne
instruments in the Solar Heliospheric
Observatory (SOHO) cluster satellite
missions, due to be launched in 1995 (see
p. 285). This programme has been set up to
investigate the sun and its impact on the
Earth’s environment.
Medical Research Council
The MRC is the main government agency
supporting medical research. Its budget
amounted to £253 million in 1992-93, of
which £228 million came from the science
budget. The Council supports research in its
own establishments and through its grant
systems to research workers at higher
education institutions and hospitals. The
MRC’s major research establishments are the
National Institute for Medical Research at
Mill Hill, London; the Clinical Research
Centre at Northwick Park Hospital, London;
and the Laboratory of Molecular Biology at
Cambridge. Interdisciplinary research centres
have been established in molecular medicine,
protein engineering, cell biology, brain
activity and human behaviour, brain repair,
and toxicology.
The Council’s scientists and doctors have
pioneered developments in molecular
biology, therapeutic clinical trials, applied
psychology, and methods of imaging the body
such as magnetic resonance and ultrasound.
Larger research programmes include
psychiatric and neurological (like Alzheimer’s)
disease, heart and respiratory ailments,
cancer, tropical medicine, intra-uterine and
infant origin of adult disease, and infection
and immunity.
Recent important medical
developments include: the discovery
of gene defects linked to a form of
Alzheimer’s disease and to the
commonest form of inherited heart
disease; the construction of a silicon
neuron which acts like a human brain
cell; the development of artificial
blood; the development of a
treatment for rheumatoid arthritis
using humanised antibodies; and the
discovery that folic acid prevents
spina bifida and other birth defects.
Major projects currently being undertaken
are:
• specially funded work on AIDS;
• research on vaccines against meningitis
and whooping cough;
274
SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
• the Human Genome Mapping project,
involving mapping of the complete
sequence of 100,000 genes in a human
cell;
• the genetic and neurosciences approach
to human health;
• the Clinical Research Initiative, which
aims to carry forward major advances in
the laboratory for the benefit of patients;
and
• physiological mechanisms and public
health, which covers research in
nutrition, the environment, diabetes and
imaging techniques.
Technology Transfer
The MRC encourages collaboration between
its establishments and industry in order to
promote the transfer of skills and
technologies, the exploitation of its
discoveries, and the development of new
health care products. The MRC Collaborative
Centre at Mill Hill, London, and the Clinical
Research Centre provide an important
technology transfer function for the MRC.
The Council has set up a company,
Therexsys, to harness commercially the gene
therapy technologies developed by its
researchers.
Natural Environment Research Council
NERC seeks to advance understanding of the
biological, physical and chemical processes of
the planet, and how the natural environment
is changing, either by natural causes or
through human activities. Its objectives
include contributions to exploration and
exploitation of natural resources, land-use
planning, environmental protection and
conservation, energy supply and aid to
overseas countries. High priority is given to
the successful transfer of technology from the
science base to government and the private
sector.
In 1991-92 about £129 million (74 per
cent) of NERC’s funds came from the
science budget, with the remainder coming
from commissioned work for public
authorities and industry in Britain and
overseas.
The Council supports research and
training in 15 NERC institutes, units and
research centres and also in universities. It
also provides and operates a range of facilities
for use by the environmental science
community. NERC institutes include the
British Geological Survey (BGS), the
Institute of Terrestrial Ecology, the Institute
of Oceanographic Sciences Deacon
Laboratory, and the British Antarctic Survey.
NERC conducts local and regional
research in Britain and in other countries,
while also participating in major international
environmental projects, such as the World
Climate Research Programme. Examples of
NERC research include:
• the Land Ocean Interaction Study
(LOIS), a major new project to study the
dynamics of coastal environments and the
flow of various materials into and across
the coastal zone from the air, from the
land and rivers and from the sea. The
study will provide the basis for
predictions of the impact of future
natural and man-made changes on the
coasts;
• the Terrestrial Initiative in Global
Environment Research (TIGER), a
programme involving research institutes
and universities which focuses on the
causes and consequences of climate
change at sites in Britain and in selected
tropical sites; and
• the British Institutions Reflection
Profiling Syndicate (BIRPS) which, using
seismic techniques to study geology at
great depth, is helping to explain the
structure and processes in the Earth’s
continental crust and how it has been
formed. Results are of scientific
importance and of commercial relevance
to the mineral resources industry.
Among applied projects in progress
overseas are initiatives in biological pest
control; regeneration of tropical hardwoods;
drip irrigation techniques for tropical crops;
and surveys of potential resources, such as
freshwater and underground water supply
and geothermal energy.
Several environmental data centres have
been established at NERC sites. The UK
275
BRITAIN 1994: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Environmental Change Network, launched in
1992, provides an early warning system to
detect the impact of environmental change on
the ecology of Britain.
Recent major achievements in
environmental research include:
• production of the BGS map
series—1:250,000 scale—of Britain’s
offshore areas;
• evidence of a link between
hydrogen peroxide production and
thinning of the ozone layer in the
southern hemisphere; and
• improved understanding of
complex interactions in the
middle atmosphere affecting
changes in the global ozone layer.
Agricultural and Food Research Council
The AFRC supports research underpinning
agriculture, food and the biologically based
industries, including the pharmaceutical,
chemical and health care industries. Research
is carried out at eight AFRC institutes, at
Horticulture Research International and in
higher education institutions. The Council
also provides scientific advice to The Scottish
Office Agriculture and Fisheries Department
on research in the Scottish Agricultural
Research Institutes.
The Council’s funding in 1992-93 totalled
£168 million, primarily drawn from the
science budget and from MAFF for
commissioned research. In addition, it
receives funding from other government
departments, the European Community and
commercial companies.
Significant advances have been made in
the study of modified and novel oilseed crops
for industry; genome mapping in cattle and
chickens; strategies to combat plant virus
replication; and preserving diversity in the
countryside.
Economic and Social Research Council
The ESRC is Britain’s leading research
agency for the social sciences. Its main aim is
to enable government, business and the public
to find out more about social and economic
change and the reasons behind it. It does this
by supporting social science research in
British higher education institutions and
independent research institutes; by investing
in the training of social scientists; and by
developing and improving research methods
and data sources.
Subject areas supported by the Council
include economics, education, environment
and planning, industry, information
technology, management, politics, psychology
and sociology. In 1992-93 it received nearly
£46 million (95 per cent of its funding) from
the science budget, and has been allocated
over £53 million in 1993-94.
Recent Council initiatives include the
Innovation Agenda campaign, a series of
seminars and research reports aimed at
highlighting the contribution that social
science is making towards improving the
competitiveness of the British economy. The
Council has also commissioned major new
research programmes into contracts and
competition in the public and private sectors;
local government; the nation’s diet; transport
and environment; and law and order.
GOVERNMENT DEPARTMENTS
Department of Trade and Industry
Direct government support for research in
industry is led by the Department of Trade
and Industry. Although most industrial
research and development is financed by
industry itself, the DTI provides assistance
where there is a sound case for doing so.
In 1991-92 the DTI spent £365 million on
R & D, covering general industrial innovation,
aeronautics, space (see p. 284), nuclear and
non-nuclear energy and support for statutory,
regulatory and policy responsibilities. A
further £113 million was allocated to
technology transfer and related activities.
The largest part of the DTI’s R & D
expenditure on energy is on nuclear energy
(£83 million in 1992-93), most of which is
carried out by the former United Kingdom
Atomic Energy Authority, now AEA
Technology. The DTI also funds research in
276
SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
support of offshore oil and gas technology,
coal technology and renewable energy.
DTI Industrial Innovation Programmes
The DTFs policy on science and technology
builds on the commitment contained in the
White Paper to improve the partnership
between government, industry and the science
base. The balance of DTFs industrial
innovation programmes has shifted away from
supporting technology generation towards
concentrating on the exploitation and transfer
of technology and the promotion of
innovation. In particular, the DTI is:
• encouraging industry to collaborate with
the science base in R & D projects under
the LINK initiative (see p. 272);
• putting more effort into helping Firms of
all sizes work together to undertake
R & D projects, including those under
the EUREKA initiative (see p. 284);
• facilitating companies’ access to
technology from overseas and helping
small and medium-sized establishments to
identify technological opportunities and
potential partners, both in Britain and
overseas;
• designing its innovation services for local
delivery through the ‘One-stop Shops’
(see p. 145);
• continuing direct single-company support
to smaller firms under the SMART
competition and the SPUR scheme (see
p. 146) for the development of new
products and processes; and
• concentrating support from the DTFs
innovation budget for industry R & D
collaboration on those projects which will
result in exceptional economic benefits.
To carry out these measures, the provision
for DTI’s budget for industrial innovation
increased from some £110 million in 1991-92
to about £125 million in 1992-93.
A number of schemes support the
development and demonstration of new
environmental technology. Projects receiving
funding include recycling, treatment of
industrial effluent, and monitoring
atmospheric emissions.
Aeronautics
The DTPs Civil Aircraft Research and
Demonstration Programme (CARAD)
supports research and technology
demonstration in the aircraft and aeroengine
industry, helping it to compete effectively in
world markets. The programme is part of a
national aeronautics research effort, with over
half of the research work supported being
conducted in industry and the universities,
and the remainder at the Defence Research
Agency (see p. 278). Priority areas are aircraft
exhaust emissions, advanced materials, and
safety problems such as explosion hazards. In
1992-93 CARAD funding amounted to
£26.4 million. Around 28 per cent was used
to finance the DTPs contribution to the
construction of the European Transonic
Windtunnel test facility in Cologne. This
proportion will fall in future years, with the
facility becoming fully operational in
mid-1997.
Launch Aid is a scheme providing
government assistance—£31 million in
1992-93—for specific development projects in
the aerospace industry. Westland is currently
receiving aid for its participation in the
commercial EH 101 helicopter.
Industrial Research Establishments
The DTI has three research establishments.
Their primary role is to provide the
Government with an effective source of
scientific and technological expertise. They
supply technological services to industry and
also undertake research commissioned by
industry. The laboratories are also involved in
a variety of international activities.
• The Laboratory of the Government
Chemist is the focus for chemical
measurement within government. It
provides both public and private sectors
with a comprehensive service based on
analytical chemistry and promotes sound
chemical measurement in Britain in
support of the National Measurement
System.
• The National Engineering Laboratory
(NEL) carries out a range of technical
277
BRITAIN 1994: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
services, including R & D, testing and
consultancies in engineering and related
disciplines. It also maintains British
Standards of flow measurement, which
are of special importance in the oil and
gas industries. The NEL manages
technology transfer programmes for the
DTI in open systems, as well as
operating the National Wind Turbine
Centre.
• The National Physical Laboratory (NPL)
is Britain’s national standards laboratory,
with responsibility for maintaining
national measurement standards for
physical quantities. It supplies essential
calibration and technology transfer
services for industry, and undertakes
research on standards for engineering
materials and information technology.
The NPL is also the base for the
National Measurement Accreditation
Service, which provides accreditation of
calibration and testing laboratories in
both the public and private sectors.
The three laboratories are now executive
agencies. Consultants are examining options
on the DTFs laboratories, including the
possibilities of privatisation or rationalisation.
The DTI’s former Warren Spring Laboratory
has been merged with AEA Technology to
create a new National Environmental
Technology Centre.
Technology Transfer
The DTI concentrates support on helping
firms gain access to, and assimilate,
technology; building up partnerships among
firms; working with higher education;
learning from overseas; and ensuring firms
have the facilities to enable them to innovate
and to do business better. The DTI is
significantly improving companies’ access to
science and technology by making innovation
services available locally—for example,
through Business Link. Business Link will
help sustained partnerships to be formed; it
will bring together those in the public and
private sectors offering business support
services (including the DTI’s technology and
innovation services) for the benefit of the
local company customer. Many local
innovation networks already exist which bring
together expertise in higher education
institutions, technical colleges, industrial
research organisations and other bodies. The
DTI intends to build on these networks and
improve access to them for small and
medium-sized establishments.
DTI initiatives to enhance companies’
awareness of management best practice will
continue through the Managing in the 90s
programme (see p. 154), which will be
extended to include the management of
innovation. The DTI Innovation Unit works
nationally and regionally, predominantly
through the use of secondees from industry,
to promote innovation best practice. The
DTI is also developing a more comprehensive
information service about technology
overseas.
Ministry of Defence
Expenditure by the Ministry of Defence on
research and development in 1992-93
amounted to more than £2,800 million. Some
£474 million of this was medium- and long¬
term applied research relevant to military
needs, much of it carried out in the MoD’s
Defence Research Agency (DRA) and other
smaller establishments. The Government is
committed to achieving a gradual reduction
in real terms in spending on defence R & D.
Several research establishments merged to
form the Defence Research Agency in 1991.
With an annual turnover of just under £800
million, it is the largest single scientific
employer in Britain. Its role is to provide
scientific and technical services primarily to
the MoD and also to other government
departments.
The DRA subcontracts some £200 million
of research to industry and universities,
ensuring that their know-how is harnessed to
meeting military requirements. The DRA
also works closely with industry in order to
ensure that scientific and technological
advances are taken forward at an early stage
into development and production. This
technology transfer is not just confined to the
defence industry but has also led to
important ‘spin-offs’ from defence into civil
278
SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
markets, in fields ranging from new materials
and electronic devices to advanced
aerodynamics. The latter in particular has
been instrumental in giving Britain a leading
role in civil aircraft design.
The DRA’s work for other government
departments in 1992-93 amounted to
£46 million. A further £23 million of
work was carried out for non-government
customers.
Recent technological innovations by the
DRA include the invention of a technique for
detecting low concentrations of gas at great
distances at sea, which has potential civil
applications for the identification of hazardous
gases.
Other Government Departments
Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food
MAFF co-ordinates its research programme
with The Scottish Office Agriculture and
Fisheries Department, the Department of
Agriculture for Northern Ireland and the
AFRC (see p 276). It also covers the research
interests of the Welsh Office Agriculture
Department.
Its research programme reflects the
Ministry’s wide-ranging responsibilities for
protection and enhancement of the rural and
marine environment, food safety and quality,
improving animal health and welfare, the
prevention of flooding and coastal erosion,
and improving the economic performance of
the agriculture, fisheries and food industries.
Research expenditure deployed with
contractors in 1992-93 was £124 million,
including the AFRC (£35 million); ADAS
(see p. 239—£17 million); Horticulture
Research International (£14.5 million);
Central Science Laboratory (£10.8 million);
and the Central Veterinary Laboratory
(£9.2 million).
Department for Education
The DFE remains the main source of public
funding for the universities. Together with
the Scottish and Welsh education
departments, the DTI and the Department of
Employment, the DFE funds a number of
schemes for training full-time students and
those working in industry in the latest
technology.
Department of the Environment
The Department of the Environment funds
research in several policy areas:
environmental protection, including
radioactive substances; water; the countryside;
planning and inner cities; local government;
housing; building and construction; and
energy efficiency. The three largest sub-
programmes are those on pollution-related
climate change, regional and urban air
quality, and the safe disposal of radioactive
waste. Total research expenditure in 1992-93
was £94 million.
Department of Health
The Department of Health has introduced
the first comprehensive R & D strategy for
the National Health Service in England and
Wales. This focuses on improving methods of
health care and achieving a cost-effective use
of resources. The Department also manages a
Health and Personal Social Services research
programme concerned with the needs of
ministers and policy-makers, with emphasis
on improving efficiency.
Overseas Development Administration
The Overseas Development Administration
(ODA) conducts research programmes which
are directly targeted on the main needs of
developing countries. Some of these may be
addressed by adapting suitable existing
Western technology, while others are unique
to the developing world and therefore require
special treatment.
The ODA supports research worth over
£34 million a year on renewable natural
resources and the environment, with the
objective of developing basic technologies with
a regional or global application (see p. 307).
It also supports the work of the
Consultative Group on International
Agricultural Research and the EC’s Science
and Technology for Development
programme.
279
BRITAIN 1994: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Using the expertise of agencies such as the
Transport Research Laboratory, the British
Geological Survey, Hydraulics Research Ltd
and the Institute of Hydrology, the ODA
supports a research programme worth around
£10 million a year to tackle infrastructure
problems. It also commissions research from
universities and industry. Current programmes
include reduced cost sewerage systems; water
disinfection and waste treatment techniques;
simple pump technology; and heat storage
technology for cooking.
The Scottish Office
The Scottish Office both contracts and
undertakes itself a wide range of R & D
commissions. Total R & D expenditure in
1992-93 was £72 million.
RESEARCH IN UNIVERSITIES
The new higher education funding councils in
England, Scotland and Wales (see p. 401) are
the largest single source of finance for
universities in Great Britain. About 40 per
cent of research carried out in universities is
financed from resources allocated by these
bodies. These funds contribute to the cost of
academic staff—who usually teach as well as
carry out research—and pay for support staff,
administration, equipment and
accommodation. In Northern Ireland the
universities are funded by the Department of
Education for Northern Ireland.
The research councils also support
scientific research in the universities and other
institutions of higher education in two main
ways. First, they provide postgraduate awards
to over a quarter of postgraduate students in
science and technology. Secondly, they give
grants and contracts to universities and other
institutions for specified projects, particularly
in new or developing areas of research. The
research councils have become responsible for
meeting all the costs of the research projects
they support in universities and other higher
education institutions, except for costs
associated with the salaries of permanent
academic staff and computing costs. These are
met by the higher education institutions.
Research performance of departments is a key
element in the selective allocation of funding
to universities.
The other main channels of support for
scientific research in universities are
government departments, charities and
industry. The European Community also
provides substantial funding. Universities are
expected to recover the full cost of short-term
commissioned research from the Government
and industry.
The high quality of research in universities,
and their marketing skills, have enabled them
to attract more funding from a larger range of
external sources, the main growth in funding
having been in contract income from industry.
Co-operation continues between the
universities, industry and the Government in
joint projects. The research income of
universities from industry and other outside
sources is rising rapidly and amounted to
£110 million in 1992.
Recent Research Developments
Universities in Britain have achieved a number
of recent technological breakthroughs and
enjoy a world-class reputation:
• A team of British and Japanese researchers
at Cambridge University has made a
breakthrough in semiconductor
technology, which will enable microchips
to store 500,000 times more memory data
and consume far less power than those
currently available. The development is
expected to have far-reaching implications
for portable computers, including the
storage of sound and moving video
images.
• Researchers at Imperial College, London,
have developed extra-thin computer wires,
using thin film layers of crystals. These
will be vital in linking increasingly tiny
components, such as miniature electronic
switches, used in ultra-fast computers.
• Scientists from Cambridge and Sheffield
universities and a Cambridge
biotechnology company have created a
genetically disabled version of the herpes
virus that could induce protective
immunity against infection more
efficiently than vaccination.
280
SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
Science Parks
Science parks are partnerships between higher
education institutions and industry to
promote commercially focused research, often
involving advanced technology. By mid-1993
there were 40 such parks in operation, at or
near universities, with accommodation for
over 1,000 companies. Most are involved in
computing, electronics, instrumentation,
robotics, electrical engineering, chemicals and
biotechnology. Research, development and
training activities are prevalent, rather than
large-scale manufacturing. The biggest
science park is at Cambridge, with some 85
companies on site. The most recently opened
parks are at Oxford, Cranfield, Westlakes
(Cumbria) and York.
A growing number of universities now
offer industry interdisciplinary research
centres with exploitable resources. These
include access to analytical equipment, library
facilities and worldwide databases as well as
academic expertise.
OTHER ORGANISATIONS
Charitable Foundations
The combined contribution of charitable
foundations to medical research in Britain
in 1992-93 was about £320 million.
The Wellcome Trust made the greatest
contribution to this overall total, at over
£77 million. The next largest spender was
the Imperial Cancer Research Fund at
£50 million.
British Technology Group
British Technology Group (BTG) is among
the world’s leading technology transfer
companies. It promotes the profitable
commercialisation of technology by:
• developing and protecting technology
arising from research carried out by
individuals, universities and other
research organisations which BTG
considers will be commercially viable;
• licensing the resulting intellectual
property rights to companies throughout
the world; and
• assessing the commercial potential of
companies’ proprietary technology and
licensing this technology to other
companies worldwide.
BTG administers over 9,000 patents
covering more than 1,500 technologies. In
1992-93 the Group’s total revenue exceeded
£26 million. Annual sales value of products
currently licensed by BTG amounts to
more than £1,500 million. The company is
owned by a consortium consisting of BTG
management, employees and financial
institutions.
Professional Institutions and Learned
Societies
There are numerous technical institutions
and professional associations in Britain, many
of which promote their own disciplines or the
education and professional well-being of their
members.
The Council of Science and Technology
Institutes has seven member institutes
representing biology, chemical engineering,
chemistry, food science and technology,
geology, hospital physics and physics. The
Engineering Council promotes the study of
all types of engineering in schools and other
organisations, in co-operation with its 240
industry affiliates. These include large private
sector companies and government
departments. Together with 42 professional
engineering institutions, the Council
accredits courses in higher education
institutions. It also advises the Government
on a range of academic, industrial and
professional issues.
More than 300 learned societies play an
important part in the promotion of science
and technology through meetings,
publications and sponsorship.
The Royal Society
The most prestigious learned society is the
Royal Society, founded in 1660. It has over
1,100 Fellows and over 100 Foreign
Members, many of whom serve on
governmental advisory councils and
committees concerned with research. The
Society’s expenditure in 1992-93 was nearly
281
BRITAIN 1994: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
£22 million. Nearly 80 per cent of funding is
derived from the Government, the remainder
coming from private sources.
The Society encourages scientific research
and its application through a programme of
meetings and lectures, publications, and by
awarding grants, fellowships and other
funding. It recognises scientific and
technological achievements through election
to the Fellowship and the award of medals
and endowed lectureships. As the national
academy of sciences, it represents Britain in
international non-governmental organisations
and is involved in a variety of international
scientific programmes. It also facilitates
collaborative projects and the exchange of
scientists through bilateral agreements with
academies and research councils throughout
the world. It gives independent advice on
scientific matters, notably to government, and
represents and supports the scientific
community as a whole.
The Society is increasingly active in
promoting science understanding and
awareness among the general public, as well
as science education. It also supports research
into the history of scientific endeavour.
Royal Academy of Engineering
The national academy of engineering in
Britain is the Royal Academy of Engineering,
which was founded in 1976 and received its
Royal Charter in 1982. The Academy, which
has some 900 Fellows and 43 Foreign
Members, promotes the advancement of
engineering for the benefit of the public. It
administers a grant from the OST amounting
to £1.7 million in 1993-94, which accounts
for nearly 30 per cent of its total budget.
Other Societies
In Scotland the Royal Society of Edinburgh,
established in 1783, promotes science by
awarding scholarships, organising meetings
and symposia, publishing journals and
awarding prizes. It also administers fellowship
schemes for post-doctoral research workers.
Three other major institutions publicise
scientific developments through lectures and
publications for specialists and for
schoolchildren. Of these, the British
Association for the Advancement of Science
(BAAS), founded in 1831, is mainly
concerned with science, while the Royal
Society of Arts, dating from 1754, deals with
the arts and commerce as well as science.
The Royal Institution, founded in 1799, also
performs these functions and runs its own
research laboratories.
The Committee on the Public
Understanding of Science (COPUS), set up
in 1986 by the Royal Society, the BAAS, and
the Royal Institution, acts as a focus for a
broad-ranging programme in Britain to
improve public awareness of science and
technology. It recommends initiatives to its
sponsoring bodies and promotes activities of
other organisations and institutions.
Zoological Gardens
The Zoological Society of London, an
independent scientific body, runs London
Zoo, which occupies some 15 hectares
(36 acres) of Regent’s Park, London. The zoo
has successfully operated a captive breeding
programme to conserve some of the world’s
most endangered animals, such as Brazilian
golden lion tamarins. The Society is
responsible for the Institute of Zoology,
which carries out research in conservation
and comparative medicine. It also organises
scientific meetings and symposia, and
publishes scientific journals.
Whipsnade Wild Animal Park near
Dunstable (Bedfordshire) is also managed by
the Society. Other well-known zoos include
those at Edinburgh, Bristol, Chester, Dudley
and Marwell (near Winchester).
Botanic Gardens
The Royal Botanic Gardens, founded in
1759, cover 121 hectares (300 acres) at Kew
in west London and a 187-hectare (462-acre)
estate at Wakehurst Place, Ardingly, in West
Sussex. They contain the largest collections
of living and dried plants in the world.
Research is conducted into all aspects of
plant life, including physiology, biochemistry,
genetics, economic botany and the
conservation of habitats and species. Kew has

the world’s largest seed bank for wild origin
species and is active in programmes to return
endangered plant species to the wild. It
participates in joint research programmes in
52 countries.
The Royal Botanic Garden in Edinburgh,
founded in 1670, is a centre for research into
taxonomy (classification of species), for the
conservation and study of living plants and
for horticultural education.
Scientific Museums
The Natural History Museum, which
includes the Geological Museum, has
60 million specimens ranging in size from a
blue whale skeleton to minute insects. It is
one of the world’s principal centres for
research into natural history, offering an
advisory service to institutions all over the
world. The museum is keen to promote
public appreciation of nature conservation and
in 1991 opened a major exhibition on ecology,
illustrating the diversity of living species.
The Science Museum promotes
understanding of the history of science,
technology, industry and medicine. Its
extensive collection of scientific instruments
and machinery is complemented by
interactive computer games and audio-visual
equipment for visitors to use. In this way the
museum explains scientific principles to the
public and documents the history of science,
from early discoveries to space age
technology. These two museums are in South
Kensington, London. Other important
collections include those of the Museum of
Science and Industry in Birmingham, the
Museum of Science and Industry in
Manchester, the Museum of the History of
Science in Oxford, and the Royal Scottish
Museum, Edinburgh.
INTERNATIONAL SCIENTIFIC
RELATIONS
European Community
Since 1984 the European Community has run
a series of R & D framework programmes in
a number of strategic sectors, with the aim of
strengthening the scientific and technological
basis of European industry and improving its
international competitiveness. The Third
Framework Programme lasts from 1990 to
1994, with an EC budget of 6,600 million
ECUs (£5,079 million). It covers the
following broad categories:
• information and communication
technologies;
• industrial and material technologies;
• the environment;
• life sciences and technologies;
• energy; and
• human capital and mobility.
Negotiations on the Fourth Framework
Programme are well under way.
Britain hosts the Joint European Torus
nuclear fusion project (JET), based at
Culham, Oxfordshire. In an experiment
conducted in December 1991, JET produced
a power release of 1 megawatt for a period of
two seconds. This is regarded as a potentially
significant step towards demonstrating the
feasibility of fusion as an energy source.
Other International Activities
EUREKA is an industry-led scheme to
encourage co-operation in the development
and production of high-technology products
with the aim of improving Europe’s
competitiveness in world markets. The
members of EUREKA are the 12 countries
of the EC, six European Free Trade
Association members, Hungary, Turkey and
the European Commission.
In June 1993, 193 new projects were
announced by EUREKA members, the total
number of agreed projects reaching 816. The
49 new British projects involve a total of 76
British organisations.
The European Co-operation in the Field
of Scientific and Technical Research (COST)
programme encourages the co-ordination of
national research activities. There are
currently 25 member states, including the
12 EC countries. Of 77 current COST
actions, Britain participates in 65.
Britain is a member of CERN (European
Organisation for Nuclear Research) in
Geneva. Its contributions to CERN, to the
283
BRITAIN 1994: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
high-flux neutron source at the Institut
Laue-Langevin and to the European
Synchrotron Radiation Facility, both in
Grenoble, are currently paid through SERC.
The European Synchrotron Radiation
Facility, due for completion in 1998, has
received 12 per cent of its total costs from
Britain. British scientists and engineers had a
role in designing and constructing detectors
for three of the four major experimental
stations of the Large Electron Positron
collider at CERN. SERC is also a partner in
the European Incoherent Scatter Radar
facilities in northern Scandinavia, which
conduct research on the middle and upper
atmosphere.
Through the MRC, Britain participates
in the Human Frontier Science Program,
which supports international collaborative
research in neuroscience and molecular
biology. Britain is to host the European
Bioinformatics Institute at Cambridge, which
will be fully operational by 1995. As an
outstation of the European Molecular Biology
Laboratory, the Institute will provide up-to-
date information on molecular biology and
genome sequencing. Britain is also a member
of the science and technology committees of
international organisations such as the
Organisation for Economic Co-operation and
Developmen, NATO (North Atlantic Treaty
Organisation) and various specialised agencies
of the United Nations.
A number of intergovernmental and inter¬
agency agreements have been concluded with
other countries for co-operation in science
and technology. Among non-governmental
organisations, the research councils, the Royal
Society and the British Academy were
founder members of the European Science
Foundation in 1974. The research councils
also maintain a joint office in Brussels to
further European co-operation in research.
Staff in British Embassies and High
Commissions promote contacts in science and
technology between Britain and overseas
countries: there are science and technology
sections at British Embassies in Paris, Bonn,
Washington, Tokyo and Moscow.
The British Council (see p. 290)
promotes better understanding and
knowledge of Britain and its scientific and
technological achievements. It encourages
exchanges of specialists, supplies specialised
information, and fosters co-operation in
research, training and education. The Council
also identifies and manages technological,
scientific and educational projects in
developing countries.
Space Activities
Britain’s support for civil space research is
co-ordinated by the British National Space
Centre (BNSC), a partnership between
various government departments and research
councils. BNSC encourages industry to
exploit opportunities in space, based on
appraisal of project costs and potential
technological and commercial benefits.
Through BNSC, Britain spent some
£170 million on space activities in 1992-93,
financed mainly by the DTI and SERC.
Around 62 per cent—£106 million—was
devoted to programmes shared with the
European Space Agency (ESA). The
remainder supported a programme of R & D
in government establishments, universities
and industry.
The major part of Britain’s space
programme is concerned with satellite-based
Earth observation (remote sensing) for
commercial and environmental applications.
Britain has committed around £60 million to
the ESA’s satellite ERS-1, which was
launched in 1991 and provides all-weather,
24-hour coverage of the Earth. Britain
provided the main active microwave
instrument for ERS-1, along with a
precision instrument to measure thermal
infra-red emissions from the sea surface.
British remote sensing instruments are also
being flown on the Upper Atmosphere
Research satellite launched and operated by
the United States National Aeronautics and
Space Administration (NASA).
The Earth Observation Data Centre at
Farnborough (Hampshire), operated by the
National Remote Sensing Centre, processes
the data output from ERS-1 and successor
missions. It is also one of the ESA’s four
processing and archiving facilities which
store and distribute remotely-sensed data
for both scientific and commercial purposes.
284
SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
Britain is also contributing £284 million to
the Columbus Polar Platform and ENVISAT-
1 programmes. The Columbus programme is
Europe’s contribution to the International
Space Station project, led by the United
States. ENVISAT will be the first of a new
generation of ESA environmental satellite
missions to utilise the Polar Platform.
In space science, Britain participates in all
of the ESA’s missions. These range from the
investigation of Halley’s Comet (1986) and
the comet Grigg Skjellerup (1992) by the
British-built Giotto spacecraft to the Ulysses
solar polar probe, which will become the first
spacecraft to overfly the poles of the sun.
Britain is contributing substantially to the
Cluster and SOHO missions to be launched
in 1995 to study the sun, the Earth’s
magnetosphere and the solar wind. It is also
expected that Britain will participate in the
ESA’s X-ray spectroscopy mission due for
launching in 1999.
There are bilateral arrangements for space
research between Britain and other countries,
notably the United States through NASA,
the Commonwealth of Independent States
and Japan. British groups have participated
in several NASA space science missions,
developing, for example, the wide-field
camera for Germany’s X-ray satellite ROSAT
and a spectrometer for the Japanese-built
Yohkoh satellite.
In Europe, Britain is both a leading
producer and main user of satellite
communications technology, exploiting
commercially the expertise developed within
the ESA’s satellite communications
programmes.

Britain is a member of some 120 international organisations, including the
United Nations (UN), NATO (North Atlantic Treaty Organisation) and the
European Community (EC). Closer co-operation between member states of
the EC is the central aim of the Maastricht Treaty on European Union, which
was ratified by Britain in August 1993. Britain plays an active part in
maintaining international peace and security and is fully involved, for
example, in efforts to bring about peace in former Yugoslavia. Britain also
protects the interests of its dependent territories, which include Hong Kong,
the Falkland Islands and Gibraltar.
ADMINISTRATION
The Foreign & Commonwealth Office (FCO)
is in charge of overall foreign policy. The
Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary is
responsible for the work of the FCO and the
Diplomatic Service. He is assisted by five
ministers without Cabinet rank, one of whom
is the Minister for Overseas Development
responsible for the Overseas Development
Administration (ODA). The FCO’s
Permanent Under-Secretary of State is head
of the Diplomatic Service and provides
advice to the Foreign and Commonwealth
Secretary on all aspects of foreign policy.
Work overseas is carried out by
Diplomatic Service staff, staff from other
government departments and locally engaged
personnel. About 26 per cent of frontline
diplomatic staff are engaged on
political/economic work, 17 per cent on
commercial work, 20 per cent on entry
clearance to Britain, 8 per cent on consular
work, 6 per cent on aid administration, 4 per
cent on information and 3 per cent on other
activities, such as culture, and science and
technology. Heads of post account for the
remaining 16 per cent.
Britain remains committed to maintaining
a worldwide diplomatic presence. There are
British embassies and high commissions in
140 countries and missions at nine
international organisations.
Other Departments
Other government departments, too, are
concerned with overseas relations and foreign
policy. The Ministry of Defence is
responsible for British defence policy and for
liaison with Britain’s allies and NATO; it also
289
BRITAIN 1994: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
controls and administers the armed forces.
The Department of Trade and Industry
(DTI) has an important say on international
trade policy and commercial relations with
other countries, including other EC member
states. The FCO and the DTI have a joint
export promotion organisation—Overseas
Trade Services (see p. 203). The Treasury is
involved in British international economic
policy and is responsible for Britain’s
relations with the World Bank and other
international financial institutions.
When other departments are involved the
FCO decides policy in consultation with
them. The department with the main interest
usually takes the lead, particularly in EC
matters and international economic policy.
The FCO co-ordinates EC policy through the
Cabinet Office European Secretariat.
The British Council
The British Council is the main agency for
British cultural relations overseas and is
represented in 100 countries. Its activities are:
• helping people to study, train or make
professional contacts in Britain;
• enabling British specialists to teach,
advise or establish joint projects
abroad;
• teaching English and promoting its use;
• providing library and information
services;
• promoting British education, science and
technology; and
• making British arts and literature more
widely known.
The Council is financed partly by a grant
from the FCO. The training and education
programmes organised by the Council on
behalf of the ODA and the FCO are another
important source of revenue. About a quarter
of the Council’s income comes from its own
earnings.
The Council runs 143 libraries and
information centres and 72 English language
teaching centres. In 1991-92 nearly
8.5 million loans of books and other materials
were made to 500,000 library members. Up to
80,000 students at any one time were taking
part in the Council’s English courses.
INTERNATIONAL ORGANISATIONS
The United Nations
Britain is a member of the United Nations
and one of the five permanent members of
the Security Council along with France, the
People’s Republic of China, Russia and the
United States. It is the sixth largest
contributor to the UN budget. Britain is fully
committed to the principles of the UN
Charter and believes that all member states
should ensure that the organisation maintains
peace, assists developing countries effectively
and protects human rights and fundamental
freedoms. Under the UN Charter, member
states are committed to:
• refrain from the threat or use of force
against the territory or political
independence of any state; and
• seek solutions to their disputes by
peaceful means.
The Charter recognises and permits the
right of individual or collective defence
against armed attack and the existence of
regional arrangements designed to maintain
security.
The European Community
Britain is an active and committed member of
the European Community, which was set up
by the 1957 Treaty of Rome (see p. 294). As
one of the larger countries, it provides two of
the 17 members of the European
Commission, which puts forward policy
proposals, executes decisions taken by the
Council of Ministers and ensures that
Community rules are correctly observed.
Britain is represented at each meeting of the
EC Council of Ministers, which is the
Community’s main decision-taking body.
Each Council consists of government
ministers from the 12 member states,
representing national interests in the subjects
under discussion—for example, trade,
agriculture or transport. Each member state
has a permanent representative at Community
headquarters in Brussels.
The membership of the European
Parliament will increase from 518 to 567 in
290
OVERSEAS RELATIONS
1994 and Britain’s allocation of seats will rise
to 87. Of its current 81 representatives, 66
were elected in England, eight in Scotland,
four in Wales and three in Northern Ireland.
The Parliament, which is consulted
about major Community decisions, has
substantial shared power with the Council of
Ministers over the setting of the Community
budget.
The European Court of Justice interprets
and adjudicates on Community law; there are
13 judges, one from each member state and
an extra one to prevent a deadlock. Six
advocates-general advise the Court. The
Court is assisted by a Court of First Instance,
which handles certain cases brought by
individuals and companies.
Britain is also represented on the Court of
Auditors, which examines Community
revenue and expenditure to see that it is
legally received and spent.
Community policies are implemented by:
• regulations, which are legally binding on
all member states;
• directives, which are binding on the
member states to which they are
addressed, but which allow national
authorities to decide on methods of
implementation;
• decisions, which are binding on member
states, firms or individuals; and
• recommendations, which have no binding
force.
NATO
Membership of NATO is the keystone of
British defence policy (see pp. 309-14).
NATO is based on the principle of collective
security and its core security functions are to:
• provide a foundation for security in
Europe;
• deter aggression and defend member
states against it; and
• provide a forum for allied transatlantic
consultation.
Each of the 16 member states has a
permanent representative at NATO
headquarters in Brussels. The main decision¬
taking body is the North Atlantic Council, at
which foreign ministers meet at least twice
a year. Permanent representatives meet
on a weekly basis at other meetings of the
Council. Defence ministers attend meetings
of the Defence Planning Committee and the
Nuclear Planning Group.
Western European Union
Britain is one of the nine members of the
Western European Union, which is the main
forum for co-operation and consultation on
defence issues for NATO’s European
members. The current membership is
Belgium, Britain, France, Germany, Italy,
Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Portugal and
Spain. It is being widened to include Greece
as the tenth full member. Iceland, Norway
and Turkey are becoming associate members,
and Denmark and the Irish Republic observer
members. For further information, see p. 311.
Council of Europe
Britain is a founding member of the Council
of Europe, which is open to any European
parliamentary democracy accepting the rule
of law and the protection of fundamental
human rights and freedoms. The member
states co-operate on culture, education, sport,
health, crime and drug prevention, youth
affairs and the improvement of the
environment. In 1950 the Council adopted its
European Convention on Human Rights
(see p. 302).
The Commonwealth
There are 50 members of the
Commonwealth, including Britain. It is a
voluntary association of states, nearly all of
which were British territories to which
independence was granted. The members are
Antigua and Barbuda, Australia, Bahamas,
Bangladesh, Barbados, Belize, Botswana,
Britain, Brunei, Canada, Cyprus, Dominica,
The Gambia, Ghana, Grenada, Guyana,
India, Jamaica, Kenya, Kiribati, Lesotho,
Malawi, Malaysia, Maldives, Malta,
Mauritius, Namibia, Nauru, New Zealand,
Nigeria, Pakistan, Papua New Guinea, Saint
Christopher and Nevis, Saint Lucia, Saint
291
BRITAIN 1994: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Vincent and the Grenadines, Seychelles,
Sierra Leone, Singapore, Solomon Islands,
Sri Lanka, Swaziland, Tanzania, Tonga,
Trinidad and Tobago, Tuvalu, Uganda,
Vanuatu, Western Samoa, Zambia and
Zimbabwe. Nauru and Tuvalu are special
members, entitled to take part in all
Commonwealth meetings and activities, with
the exception of Commonwealth Heads of
Government meetings.
Consultation between member states takes
place through:
• meetings of heads of government;
• specialised conferences of other ministers
and officials;
• diplomatic representatives known as high
commissioners; and
• non-governmental organisations.
The Queen is recognised as head of the
Commonwealth and is head of state in some
member countries.
The Commonwealth Secretariat promotes
consultation, disseminates information, and
organises heads of government meetings,
ministerial meetings and other conferences. It
administers co-operative programmes agreed
at these meetings, including the
Commonwealth Fund for Technical Co¬
operation, which provides expertise to
Commonwealth developing countries.
Membership of the Commonwealth enables
Britain to play a responsible part alongside
other nations in aiding the development and
stability of the Third World. Some two-thirds
of British aid (see p. 304) goes to
Commonwealth countries. The British
Government participates fully in all
Commonwealth activities and welcomes it as a
means of consulting and co-operating with
peoples of widely differing cultures.
Other International Bodies
Britain is a member of many other inter¬
national bodies, including the International
Monetary Fund, which regulates the
international financial system and provides a
source of credit for member countries facing
balance of payments difficulties.
In addition, Britain, along with 23 other
industrialised countries, belongs to the
Organisation for Economic Co-operation and
Development (OECD), which promotes
economic growth, helps less developed
countries and encourages worldwide trade
expansion.
Other organisations to which Britain
belongs or extends support include the
regional development banks in Africa, the
Caribbean, Latin America and Asia.
BRITAIN’S DEPENDENT
TERRITORIES
Britain’s dependent territories have a
combined population of about 6 million, of
whom 5.8 million live in Hong Kong. Most
territories have considerable self-government,
with their own legislature. Britain is generally
responsible for defence, security, external
affairs, the civil service and the judiciary.
The territories are:
• Anguilla;
• Bermuda;
• British Antarctic Territory;
• British Indian Ocean Territory;
• British Virgin Islands;
• Cayman Islands;
• Falkland Islands;
• Gibraltar;
• Hong Kong;
• Montserrat;
• Pitcairn, Ducie, Henderson and Oeno;
• St Helena and St Helena Dependencies
(Ascension and Tristan da Cunha);
• South Georgia and the South Sandwich
Islands; and
• Turks and Caicos Islands.
Few are rich in natural resources, and
some are scattered groups of islands. There
are no permanent inhabitants in the British
Antarctic Territory, British Indian Ocean
Territory or South Georgia and the South
Sandwich Islands.
Britain’s policy is to help the inhabitants
of the dependent territories to take
independence if they want it and where it is
practicable to do so. The reasonable needs of
the dependent territories are a first call on
the British aid programme.
292
OVERSEAS RELATIONS
Hong Kong
In 1984 an agreement was signed between
Britain and the People’s Republic of China on
the future of Hong Kong, 92 per cent of
which is leased from China until 1997. Under
the Sino-British Joint Declaration, which was
ratified by the two governments in 1985,
Britain is responsible for the administration of
Hong Kong until 30 June 1997. Hong Kong
will then become a Special Administrative
Region (SAR) of China, but its capitalist
system and lifestyle will remain unchanged
for at least 50 years. With the exception of
foreign affairs and defence, the Hong Kong
SAR will enjoy a high degree of autonomy
and its government and legislature will be
composed of Hong Kong people.
In September 1991 direct elections took
place for the first time for 18 seats in the
Legislative Council. Another 21 of the 60
seats were elected indirectly. In October
1992 the Governor announced a package
of constitutional proposals designed to
extend the franchise for the 1995 Council
elections.
In April 1993 the British and Chinese
governments started talks with the intention
of reaching an understanding on the 1995
election arrangements. Britain wants these
elections to be open, fair and acceptable to
the people of Hong Kong. Another important
objective is that the Council elected in 1995
should be able to serve for its full four-year
term, during which Hong Kong will revert to
Chinese sovereignty in 1997.
Falkland Islands
The Falkland Islands are the subject of a
territorial claim by Argentina but the
inhabitants wish to remain under British
sovereignty. The Government does not accept
the Argentine claim to sovereignty and is
committed to defend the Islanders’ right to
live under a government of their own
choosing. The Islanders’ right of self-
determination is set out in the 1985 Falkland
Islands Constitution.
In 1982 Argentina invaded and occupied
the Islands but its forces were expelled as a
result of British military action following
Argentina’s failure to abide by United
Nations resolutions requesting its forces to
withdraw. In recent years Britain and
Argentina, while maintaining their respective
positions on sovereignty, have restored
diplomatic relations and continue to discuss
their common interests in the South Atlantic,
such as fisheries conservation.
Gibraltar
Gibraltar is the subject of a territorial claim
by Spain. Britain is committed to honouring
the wishes of the people of Gibraltar on their
future, as set out in the 1969 Gibraltar
Constitution. Britain and Spain, while
maintaining their respective positions on
sovereignty, are pledged to increase practical
co-operation between Gibraltar and Spain to
the benefit of both peoples.
THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITY
As a European power, Britain is concerned
first of all with the prosperity and security of
this area of the world.
The main instrument for achieving
European prosperity is the European
Community, which is an association of 12
democratic nations—Belgium, Britain,
Denmark, France, Germany, Greece, the
Irish Republic, Italy, Luxembourg, the
Netherlands, Portugal and Spain.
The British Government is strongly in
favour of enlarging the Community to
include other democratic nations in
Europe. In early 1993 accession
negotiations were launched with
Austria, Finland, Norway and Sweden.
A target date of 1 January 1995 has
been set for accession.
Britain regards the Community as a means
of strengthening democracy and reinforcing
political stability in Europe, and of increasing
the collective strength of member states in
international negotiations. The Government
wants Britain to be at the heart of a
Community in which member states work
effectively together by pooling their ideas and
resources for shared purposes, provided that
293
BRITAIN 1994: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
The European Community
such objectives cannot be achieved by
member states acting on their own.
The Community had its origins in the
resolve by Western European nations,
particularly France and Germany, not to
allow wars to break out again between
themselves. The Rome Treaty defined
Community aims as the harmonious
development of economic activities, a
continuous and balanced economic expansion
and an accelerated rise in the standard of
living. These objectives were to be achieved
by the creation of a common internal market
and progressive harmonisation of economic
policies involving:
• the elimination of customs duties
between member states;
• free movement of goods, people, services
and capital;
• a common commercial policy towards
other countries;
• the elimination of distortions in
competition within the common market;
• the creation of a Social Fund to improve
job opportunities for workers and raise
their standard of living;
• the adoption of common agricultural and
transport policies; and
• the association of overseas developing
countries with the Community in order
to increase trade and promote economic
and social development.
These objectives have been confirmed and
augmented by the Single European Act of
1986 and the 1991 Maastricht Treaty on
European Union.
European Union
The Rome Treaty’s signatories declared
themselves ‘determined to establish the
foundations of an ever closer union between
the peoples of Europe’. This aim was restated
in the Maastricht Treaty.
The nature of European union has never
been formally defined. Successive British
294
OVERSEAS RELATIONS
governments have opposed the creation of a
unitary state or federal structure in which
national sovereignty would be submerged. In
practice, European union has been a step-by-
step process of greater co-operation, building
on existing policies and elaborating new ones
within the framework of the Treaties.
Maastricht Treaty
The Maastricht Treaty amends the Rome
Treaty and makes other new commitments. It:
• introduces the concept of Union
citizenship as a supplement to national
citizenship, provides some measure of
institutional reform and strengthens
control of the Community’s finances;
• provides on an intergovernmental basis
for a common foreign and security policy
and for greater co-operation on issues
concerned with justice and home affairs;
• clarifies and codifies Community
competences in areas such as regional
strategy, consumer protection, education
and vocational training, the environment
and public health;
• provides for moves towards economic
and monetary union; and
• embodies the principle of subsidiarity
under which action is taken at
Community level only if its objectives
cannot be achieved by member states
acting alone.
The 1992 Edinburgh summit agreed to
apply a subsidiarity test to all future
proposals for Community action. A review of
existing EC legislation is under way to ensure
that it conforms to the subsidiarity principle.
Following approval by Parliament, the
Treaty was ratified by Britain in August
1993. All the other member states have also
ratified the Treaty.
Economic and Monetary Union
During the negotiations on economic and
monetary union (EMU), the Government
sought to ensure that:
• there would be no commitment by
Britain to move to a single monetary
policy or single currency;
• monetary matters would remain a
national responsibility until the
Community moved to a single currency
and monetary policy;
• member states would retain primary
responsibility for their economic policies;
and
• there were clear and quantifiable
convergence conditions which member
states would have to satisfy before
moving to a single currency.
The Treaty provides for progress towards
EMU in three stages: the first—completion
of the single market—has been achieved (see
p. 296). Under stage 2, a European Monetary
Institute will be established with a largely
advisory and consultative role. Although the
Institute will prepare for stage 3, monetary
policy will still be a national responsibility.
Member states will co-ordinate economic
policies in the context of agreed non-binding
policy guidelines. The British Government
supports the first and second stages of EMU.
Under the Treaty a single currency is
envisaged by 1 January 1999, although
member states will have to satisfy certain
criteria on inflation rates, government deficit
levels, currency fluctuation margins and
interest rates. A special protocol recognises
that Britain is not obliged or committed to
move to this final stage of EMU without a
separate decision to do so by the Government
and Parliament at the appropriate time.
The Community Budget
The Community’s revenue consists of:
• levies on agricultural imports;
• customs duties;
• the proceeds of a notional rate of value
added tax (VAT) of up to 1.4 per cent
on a standard ‘basket’ of goods and
services; and
• contributions from member states based
on gross national product (GNP).
Overall Community revenue is limited by
a ceiling of 1.2 per cent of Community GNP.
When it first joined the Community,
Britain made a net contribution to the budget
far in excessfof that justified by its share of
295
BRITAIN 1994: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
GNP. Following a series of negotiations to
put this right, Britain has received since
1984 a rebate which is worth some £2,000
million a year.
An agreement on future Community
finance was reached at the 1992 Edinburgh
summit. Under this there is no increase in
the revenue ceiling until 1995, when it will
rise ifl steps, reaching 1.27 per cent of
Community GNP in 1999. The revenue
system will be reformed to ensure that
member states’ contributions reflect more
accurately their relative prosperity.
Agricultural spending will be less than half
the Community budget by the end of the
century, compared with 80 per cent in 1973
and 50 per cent at present. More resources
will be allocated to the poorer regions of the
Community.
Single Market
The Single European Act set the deadline of
31 December 1992 for the completion of the
single market. The Edinburgh summit
agreed that this programme had been
successfully completed in all essential
respects. The Government believes that the
single market will reduce business costs,
stimulate efficiency and encourage the
creation of jobs and wealth. The single
market programme covers, among other
things, the liberalisation of capital
movements, the opening up of public
procurement markets and the mutual
recognition of professional qualifications.
Transport
Britain fully supports the liberalisation of
transport in the Community. Measures so far
taken include the removal of permits and
quotas on road haulage and the
establishment of a single market in civil
aviation. Airlines meeting established safety
and common financial fitness criteria are
entitled to an operating licence allowing
virtually unrestricted access to routes within
the Community. They are free to set fares
and rates according to their commercial
judgment.
In 1992 a regulation was agreed on slot
allocation at airports designed to back up the
single market in aviation; it aims to protect
the legitimate interests of established carriers
while promoting competition by assisting new
entrants.
The opening of the Channel Tunnel in
1994 (see p. 255) will improve Britain’s links
with other member states.
European Economic Area
In 1992 the Community reached an
agreement with the seven members of the
European Free Trade Association (EFTA) to
extend free movement of goods, services and
capital to the EFTA countries in a new
European Economic Area (EEA, see p. 201).
Implementation of this agreement was
delayed by the result of a referendum in
Switzerland which narrowly turned down
Swiss membership of the EEA. The EEA is
expected to be the world’s largest single
market when it comes into operation.
Trade
Britain is the world’s fifth largest trading
nation and the Community is the world’s
largest trading bloc, accounting for about a
third of all trade.
The British Government fully supports a
world open trading system on which EC
member states depend for future economic
growth and jobs.
Under the Rome Treaty, the European
Commission speaks on behalf of Britain and
the other EC member states in international
trade negotiations, such as the various rounds
of the General Agreement on Tariffs and
Trade (GATT). The Commission negotiates
on a mandate agreed by the Council of
Ministers.
For further information on trade, see
Chapter 15.
The Environment
The Community is at the forefront of many
international measures on environmental
issues, such as car exhaust pollution and the
depletion of the ozone layer. For further
information, see pp. 349-50.

in premature babies.
OVERSEAS RELATIONS
Agriculture and Fisheries
The Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) is
designed to secure food supplies and to
stabilise markets. It has also, however, created
overproduction and unwanted food surpluses,
placing a burden on the Community budget.
The Common Fisheries Policy is
concerned with the rational conservation and
management of fishery resources. The
operation of these policies, and Britain’s
advocacy of CAP reform, are described in
Chapter 17.
Structural Funds
The EC Structural Funds are designed to:
• promote economic development in poorer
regions;
• improve regions seriously affected by
industrial decline;
• combat long-term unemployment;
• train young people to find jobs; and
• promote development in rural areas.
Infrastructure projects and productive
investments are financed by the European
Regional Development Fund. The European
Social Fund supports training and
employment measures for the long-term
unemployed and young people. The
Guidance Section of the European
Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund
supports agricultural restructuring and some
rural development measures. A new fund to
support restructuring in the fishing industry
was created in 1993.
Other Community programmes aim to
assist the development of new economic
activities in regions affected by the
restructuring of traditional industries such as
steel, coal and shipbuilding.
The European Investment Bank, a non-
profit-making institution, lends at competitive
interest rates to public and private capital
projects. Lending is directed towards:
• less-favoured regions;
• transport infrastructure;
• protection of the environment;
• improving industrial competitiveness; and
• supporting loans to small and medium¬
sized enterprises.
The Bank also provides loans in support
of the Community’s policy of co-operation
with the countries of the Mediterranean
basin, Central and Eastern Europe and the
African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) states
(see pp. 201-2).
The Maastricht Treaty provides for the
setting up of a Cohesion Fund in order to
reduce the gaps between the prosperity of the
poorest member states of the Community and
the others. The Fund will finance projects on
environmental protection and transport
infrastructure in Spain, Portugal, Greece and
the Irish Republic.
Employment and Social Affairs
In Britain’s view, Community social policy
should be primarily concerned with job
creation and with maintaining a well-educated
and trained workforce to ensure
competitiveness in world markets. The
Government supports:
• measures to safeguard health and safety
at work, freedom of movement for
workers, Community-wide recognition of
professional and vocational qualifications
and equal opportunities at work; and
• practical measures to increase jobs and
cut unemployment.
The Government is opposed to measures
which, in its view, would impose further
regulations and costs on employers and
damage Community competitiveness. For this
reason, the Government negotiated a clause
in the Maastricht Treaty, under which new
and far-reaching Community powers in the
social area apply only to the other 11 member
states and not to Britain.
Research and Development
Community research collaboration is
promoted primarily through a series of
framework programmes defining priorities
and setting out the overall level of funding.
The British Government actively encourages
British companies and organisations to
participate in collaborative research and
297
BRITAIN 1994: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
development (R & D) with European
partners.
Under the current programme, which ends
in 1994 (see p. 284), priority is given to
information technology (ESPRIT),
telecommunications (RACE) and industrial
materials and technologies; however, there are
other important programmes covering the
environment, biotechnology, agriculture,
health and energy. There is also a scheme for
the exchange of researchers.
INTERNATIONAL PEACE AND
SECURITY
Britain believes that states should not use, or
threaten, force against other sovereign states
and that they should resolve their disputes by
peaceful means.
The United Nations has the authority to
seek to resolve disputes which threaten
international peace and stability. In January
1992 a special meeting of the UN Security
Council was convened by Britain at the level
of heads of state or government. The
meeting:
• reaffirmed that all disputes should be
settled peacefully in accordance with the
,UN Charter;
• requested the Secretary General to make
recommendations on a more effective role
for the UN in preventive diplomacy and
as peacemaker and peacekeeper; and
• committed Council members to arms
control and the conclusion of a
convention on chemical weapons.
Peacekeeping
Britain is playing a full role in the expansion
of UN peacekeeping and is one of the largest
contributors of troops to UN operations. In
addition, it pays its assessed share of 6.4 per
cent of the costs of UN peacekeeping.
By the end of 1993 there are likely to be
nearly 100,000 troops taking part in 15 UN
operations. British troops are serving on
peacekeeping missions in Cyprus and
Kuwait, as well as in former Yugoslavia
and Cambodia. Their tasks include mine
clearance, logistic support, relief convoy
escort, naval monitoring and acting as
unarmed military observers.
Former Yugoslavia
Britain is committed to supporting efforts to
establish a lasting and equitable peace in
former Yugoslavia and is deeply involved in
efforts to relieve suffering caused by the
fighting in Bosnia-Herzegovina and to
prevent it spreading.
Since the outbreak of inter-ethnic hostilities
in mid-1991 the European Community and
the UN have led the search for peace. In
September 1991 the EC established a peace
conference to try and obtain a ceasefire
between Serbian and Croatian forces. It also
set up a mission based in Zagreb to monitor
tension and to resolve conflict at local level. In
February 1992 the UN Protection Force
(UNPROFOR) was set up to monitor a
ceasefire between Serbia and Croatia.
On the basis of recommendations made by
an arbitration commission attached to the EC
Conference, the EC recognised Slovenia and
Croatia in January 1992 and Bosnia-
Herzegovina in April 1992. Serbia and
Montenegro proclaimed themselves the
Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, which has
not achieved international recognition and is
excluded from nearly all international forums.
Britain and some of its EC partners
recognised the former Yugoslav republic of
Macedonia by voting for its admission to the
UN in April 1993.
In April 1992 the conflict in Bosnia
between Serbs, Croats and Muslims
escalated. The UN imposed sanctions in May
on Serbia and Montenegro because of their
failure to take measures to cease military
intervention in Bosnia. In August 1992
Britain, as President of the EC, convened the
London Conference, co-chaired by the
British Prime Minister and the UN Secretary
General. The Conference brought together all
the main parties to the conflict, who agreed
to documents setting out clear principles for
a negotiated settlement. Efforts to resolve the
conflict on the basis of these principles have
continued in the International Conference
on the former Yugoslavia under the
co-chairmanship of EC and UN mediators.
298
OVERSEAS RELATIONS
Fighting in Bosnia has displaced many
people from their homes, some 2 million
people becoming dependent on humanitarian
relief. The airlift of humanitarian supplies to
Sarajevo began in June 1992. UNPROFOR’s
mandate was enlarged in September 1992 to
provide for military escorts for the aid
convoys. Britain subsequently deployed 2,400
troops to the UN for this purpose. Since the
beginning of the crisis, the EC and its
member states have contributed some
£400 million to the aid effort. Britain’s total
EC and bilateral contributions are over
£140 million.
Cambodia
Between 1991 and 1993 the United Nations
was involved in the implementation of an
international peace agreement designed to end
13 years of civil war in Cambodia. Britain and
the other permanent members of the UN
Security Council agreed on the main
principles for a settlement, which were
endorsed by the UN General Assembly in
1990. These formed the basis of the 1991
Paris agreements creating the UN
Transitional Authority in Cambodia
(UNTAC). In May 1993 UNTAC organised
free and fair elections to a constituent
assembly and its mandate ended when the
assembly formed a new government in
September 1993. Britain contributed over
6 per cent of UNTAC’s costs and provided
over 120 personnel to UNTAC’s military
component, including the commander of a
mine clearance training unit. Some 40 British
polling station officers helped to run the 1993
election. Britain has pledged $30 million of
aid since October 1991 to assist the
reconstruction of Cambodia.
EASTERN EUROPE AND THE
FORMER SOVIET UNION
With the formation of democratically elected
governments in Eastern and Central Europe,
the European security situation has been
transformed. Remaining Russian forces in the
eastern part of Germany will be withdrawn
by 1994.
In November 1990 NATO member states
and former Warsaw Pact states signed a joint
declaration in Paris saying that:
• they were no longer adversaries and
would build new partnerships; and
• they would only maintain enough
military forces to prevent war and
provide for effective defence.
In 1991 the North Atlantic Co-operation
Council was established, in which
consultations between NATO members and
former Communist countries take place on
issues such as defence planning, civilian-
military relations and arms control. The
Eastern and Central European countries are
implementing policies designed to achieve a
pluralist democracy, the rule of law, respect
for human rights and a market economy.
Former Soviet Republics
The three Baltic states—Estonia, Latvia and
Lithuania—which were annexed by the
Soviet Union in 1940—regained
independence following the failure of a
military coup in Moscow in August 1991. At
the end of 1991 the Soviet Union was
replaced by 12 separate states. The threat of
a simultaneous full-scale attack on NATO’s
European fronts has been effectively
removed.
Britain and its EC partners welcomed the
fact that Russia had taken over responsibility
for the former Soviet Union’s international
obligations. They agreed to recognise the
independence of the former Soviet republics,
subject to certain assurances, namely:
• respect for the provisions of the UN
Charter and commitments on the rule of
law, democracy and human rights;
• guarantees for the rights of minorities
and ethnic and national groups;
• respect for the inviolability of frontiers;
• acceptance of commitments on arms
control and nuclear non-proliferation;
and
• a commitment to settle by agreement all
regional disputes.
Having obtained the necessary assurances,
the Community recognised all the former
Soviet republics as independent countries.
299
BRITAIN 1994: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Economic Help
Because of the vast economic problems
created by the fall of Communism, Britain
and other Western countries took action to
help deal with these and promote the
development of market economies. Britain
and other OECD countries set up the
European Bank for Reconstruction and
Development to channel investment to the
region. The European Community’s PHARE
scheme, worth some £700 million in 1992, is
designed to assist the process of reform and
development of infrastructure; Britain
contributes about 18 per cent of the budget.
Independent states of the former Soviet
Union receive help through a separate
Community programme (TACIS), which
concentrates on financial services, transport,
food distribution, energy (including nuclear
safety) and human resource development.
Know How Fund and Other Schemes
The British Government decided that more
needed to be done to finance the transfer of
skills to assist the economic transformation.
In June 1989 it therefore launched its Know
How Fund, which now covers Albania,
Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Hungary,
Poland, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, the
Baltic States and the countries of the former
Soviet Union. Since 1989 over £113 million
has been spent by the Fund. By 1993 over
700 projects were either under way or
completed.In 1993-94 the Know How Fund
budget is £53 million.
The Fund concentrates on limited areas of
key importance to economic reform and the
functioning of a democratic society. Priority
sectors include energy, financial services,
management training, food production and
distribution, small business and public sector
reform.
Britain is giving full support to the
Russian Government’s economic reform
programmes. Under the Know How Fund, a
total of £120 million in technical assistance
has been pledged for Russia alone. In
November 1992 a British-Russian
co-operation treaty was signed in London in
which both countries emphasised their
willingness to promote more business links
between the two countries. British export
credits will support several projects,
including the construction of a polyethylene
complex for a Russian gas company and the
building of a new terminal at Moscow
airport. Under a separate defence
agreement, British and Russian chiefs of
staff exchange views on defence policy and
arms control.
Another British scheme is designed to
contribute to the development of a modern
and efficient financial services industry in
the former Soviet Union. Financed by the
Treasury, salaried secondments are made to
British firms operating in banking,
accountancy, law, insurance, stockbroking
and financial and actuarial services. Total
British investment in the scheme will be
about £20 million over three years.
EC Association Agreements
The European Community is strengthening
its relations with the former Communist
countries by concluding association
agreements with Bulgaria, the Czech
Republic, Hungary, Poland, Romania and
Slovakia. In 1992 the Community agreed to
negotiate partnership and co-operation
agreements with all the states of the former
Soviet Union. Negotiations with Russia,
Belarus, Kazakhstan and Ukraine are under
way. The purpose of all these agreements is
to open up trade, develop co-operation and
hold regular consultations on key
international issues.
Trade and co-operation agreements have
been concluded with Albania, Slovenia and
the three Baltic states.
OTHER REGIONS
The Middle East
Arab-Israeli Dispute
British policy towards the Arab-Israeli
dispute is in line with the European
Council’s 1980 and 1989 declarations setting
out two basic principles—the right of all
countries in the area, including Israel, to
300
OVERSEAS RELATIONS
live within recognised and guaranteed
frontiers, and the right of the Palestinian
people to self-determination. Britain and the
other EC member states are playing a
constructive and active role in the multilateral
aspects of the Middle East peace negotiations
based on UN Security Council Resolutions
242 and 338. These were inaugurated at the
1991 Madrid Conference co-sponsored by the
United States and the former Soviet Union.
In September 1993 a major breakthrough
occurred in negotiations between Israel and
the Palestine Liberation Organisation, when
both sides agreed to recognise each other and
signed a declaration of principles.
The Gulf Conflict
As a permanent member of the UN Security
Council, Britain strongly condemned Iraq’s
invasion of Kuwait in August 1990 and
supported all the Council’s resolutions
designed to force Iraqi withdrawal and
restore international legality. Because of
Iraq’s failure to withdraw, its forces were
expelled in February 1991 by an international
coalition led by the United States, Britain,
France and Saudi Arabia acting under the
UN mandate.
As part of the agreement ending
hostilities, the Security Council authorised
the creation of a Special Commission to
supervise the elimination of Iraq’s weapons of
mass destruction and set out a number of
other ceasefire conditions. UN economic
sanctions against Iraq, introduced in August
1990, still apply because of the Iraqi
Government’s failure to comply fully with
these conditions.
Britain takes an active part in helping to
apply UN-approved ‘no-fly zones’ over Iraq
designed to monitor the actions of the Iraqi
regime and deter military attacks against
civilians in southern and northern areas of
the country.
Southern Africa
For many years Britain has been concerned
with the affairs of Southern Africa. Positive
developments in the region since 1989 have
included:
• a trend towards more accountable
government and liberal economic
policies with countries committed to a
greater degree of democracy; and
• steady progress towards non-racial
democracy in South Africa.
British policy towards South Africa is to:
• encourage multi-party negotiations on
the building of a new constitution; and
• help end political violence and
intimidation.
A successful political settlerdent must be
underpinned by a return to economic
growth. Britain therefore supports the
lifting of all remaining sanctions against
South Africa. Britain contributes to EC and
Commonwealth Observer Missions in South
Africa. Through its aid programme, the
British Government is helping to prepare
black South Africans to play their full part
in the government and economy of their
country. Some £10 million was contributed
in 1992 and a similar amount was given to
EC programmes.
Asia-Pacific Region
Britain has long-standing political interests
in the Asia-Pacific region. These stem
originally from Commonwealth links,
particularly in the South-Asian sub¬
continent, and from its responsibility for
Hong Kong (see p. 292). There are also
large-scale economic and commercial
interests. Because economic growth rates in
East and South-East Asia continue to
outstrip those elsewhere, important
export and investment opportunities are
being created for British companies, as
well as investment into Britain which
increases jobs and benefits from technology
transfer.
This shift of economic power is being
accompanied by greater political
liberalisation in countries like South Korea,
Taiwan, Thailand and Vietnam. Moreover,
Japan, China, India and the Association of
South-East Asian Nations (Malaysia,
Singapore, Indonesia, the Philippines,
Thailand and Brunei) are becoming much
more influential in world politics.
301
BRITAIN 1994: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Assistance to British exporters forms a
vital part of the activities of all British
diplomatic posts in the region. Britain is also
stepping up political dialogue with the main
countries there and is working to make the
most of opportunities offered in areas such as
educational exchanges, technical co-operation,
science and technology and English teaching.
North and South America
Britain has long-established political and
cultural links with the United States. In
particular, as founding members of NATO,
both countries are closely involved in
Western defence arrangements (see p. 311)
and work together as permanent members of
the UN Security Council.
Britain has welcomed the replacement of
authoritarian regimes in Latin America by
constitutionally elected governments and
believes that these changes, together with the
trend towards free market economies, present
many opportunities for Britain to strengthen
its relations with countries in the region.
There is a British post in every Latin
American country and the programme of
ministerial visits to the region has increased
in recent years, notable examples being the
Prime Minister’s visit to Columbia and Brazil
in 1992 and the Foreign and Commonwealth
Secretary’s visit to Argentina and Chile in
early 1993.
HUMAN RIGHTS
In formulating its foreign policy, Britain
attaches great importance to promoting
universal respect for human rights. This is an
obligation under the UN Charter, reinforced
by human rights law in the form of UN and
regional human rights treaties. Human rights
violations can now no longer be insulated
from external criticism on the grounds that
they are a domestic matter. The British
Government believes that the expression of
concern about violations of human rights
does not mean interference in a state’s
internal affairs.
The Universal Declaration of Human
Rights was adopted by the UN General
Assembly in 1948. Since this is not a legally
binding document, the General Assembly
adopted two international covenants in 1966,
placing legal obligations on those states
ratifying or acceding to them. The covenants
came into force in 1976, Britain ratifying
both in the same year. One covenant deals
with economic, social and cultural rights and
the other with civil and political rights. States
which are parties to the covenants undertake
to submit periodic reports detailing
compliance with their terms. Each covenant
has a UN treaty monitoring committee which
examines these reports. Britain recognises the
competence of these committees to receive
and consider state-to-state complaints.
Other international conventions to which
Britain is a party include those on:
• the elimination of racial discrimination;
• the elimination of all forms of
discrimination against women;
• prevention of genocide;
• the abolition of slavery;
• the status of refugees;
• the status of stateless people;
• the political rights of women;
• consent to marriage;
• the rights of the child; and
• the ending of torture and other cruel,
inhuman or degrading treatment or
punishment.
The Council of Europe
Britain is bound by the Council of Europe’s
Convention for the Protection of Human
Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, which
covers:
• the right to life, liberty, security and a
fair trial;
• respect for private and family life, home
and correspondence;
• freedom of thought, conscience and
religion;
• freedom of expression;
• freedom of peaceful assembly and
association;
• the right to have a sentence reviewed by
a higher tribunal; and
302
OVERSEAS RELATIONS
• the prohibition of torture and other
inhuman or degrading treatment.
Complaints about violations of the
Convention are made to the European
Commission of Human Rights in Strasbourg.
Although one state may lodge a complaint
against another, most complaints are brought
against states by individuals or groups. The
Commission decides whether cases are
admissible and, if so, examines the matter
with the parties with a view to achieving a
friendly settlement. If this fails, the
Commission or the state concerned can refer
the case to the European Court of Human
Rights, which rules on whether the
Convention has been breached. Britain
accepts the Court’s compulsory jurisdiction
and the right of individual petition.
Conference on Security and Co-operation
in Europe
In 1975 Britain was among the states which
signed the Helsinki Final Act containing,
among other things, commitments to respect
human rights and fundamental freedoms.
In 1989 Final Act signatories recognised
the need to improve implementation of these
commitments. In 1991 it was agreed that
states could invite experts to examine human
rights cases or situations in their own
territories or that of another participating
state. States have also agreed to provide
written responses and meet requests for
bilateral meetings on human rights issues.
In order to improve monitoring there is a
High Commissioner on National Minorities,
as well as fact-finding missions and seminars
run by the Office for Democratic Institutions
and Human Rights.
Westminster Foundation for Democracy
Following consultations between the British
Government and the British political parties,
the Westminster Foundation for Democracy
was set up in 1992 to assist in building and
strengthening pluralistic democratic
institutions overseas.
The three main political parties (see p. 50)
are represented on the Board of Governors,
who are appointed by the Foreign and
Commonwealth Secretary. There is also a
representative of the smaller political parties,
plus non-party figures drawn from business,
trade unions, the academic world and other
non-governmental organisations. The Foreign
& Commonwealth Office has a non-voting
advisory member. The Foundation is
independent and the British Government can¬
not veto projects the Board chooses to support.
Projects supported by the Foundation may
include the development of:
• election systems, administration or
monitoring;
• parliaments or other representative
institutions;
• political parties;
• free media;
• trade unions; and
• human rights groups.
The aim is to build up organisations
which can be self-sustaining and to assist
projects designed to achieve concrete results.
The Foundation is concentrating its efforts
initially on Central and South-Eastern
Europe, the former Soviet Union and on
anglophone Africa. It does, however, consider
sympathetically applications for projects
elsewhere in the world.
INTERNATIONAL CRIME
The British Government attaches importance
to action against international terrorism and
to international co-operation against drug
traffickers and organised crime. Britain and
the other members of the European
Community have agreed not to export arms
or other military equipment to countries
clearly implicated in supporting terrorist
activity, and to take steps to prevent such
material being diverted for terrorist purposes.
It is EC policy that:
• no concessions should be made to
terrorists or their sponsors; and
• there should be solidarity between
member states in the prevention of
terrorism.

trafficking. In December 1991 Community
member states agreed to set up a central
European Police Office (EUROPOL) to
provide Community-wide intelligence about
serious crime. As a first step in this process,
a EUROPOL Drugs Unit will be established.
All EC member states belong to the
International Criminal Police Organisation
(INTERPOL).
British liaison with INTERPOL is
provided by the National Criminal
Intelligence Service (see p. 79).
Under the Maastricht Treaty, work in
these areas will be intensified through
increased inter-governmental co-operation.
DEVELOPMENT CO-OPERATION
The aim of Britain’s overseas aid effort to
developing countries is the promotion of
sustainable economic growth and social
development in order to improve the quality
of life and reduce poverty, suffering and
deprivation in developing countries.
In 1991-92 British aid to developing
countries was over £1,800 million. Of this,
£983 million was allocated bilaterally and
£831 million through international
organisations such as the European
Community (£431 million), the World Bank
Group (£228 million), the United Nations
agencies (£137 million) and the regional
development banks (£33 million). Assistance
to former Communist countries in Europe
totalled £36 million; bilateral technical
assistance to these countries is given through
the Know How Fund (see p. 300).
From 1994—95 there will be a unified aid
budget covering assistance to developing .
countries and to Eastern and Central Europe
and the former Soviet Union.
The British aid programme seeks to:
• promote economic liberalisation;
• enhance productive capacity;
• promote good government;
• help developing countries to define and
carry out poverty reduction programmes;
• promote improved education and health;
• improve the social, economic, legal and
political status of women in developing
countries; and
• assist developing countries to tackle
national environmental problems.
Economic Liberalisation
Sustainable development requires sound
economic policies designed to encourage
investment, give incentives to producers and
improve public sector efficiency. Britain
provides:
• balance of payments support;
• technical co-operation for countries
undertaking policy and institutional
reforms; and
• support for the private sector, including
small enterprises, and assistance with
the reform of the public sector and the
management of public expenditure.
British multilateral aid supports the
financing of reforms through contributions
to the World Bank Group and the European
Development Fund.
Most British support for reforms has
gone to eight low-income countries in the
Special Programme of Assistance for Africa
led by the World Bank. Bilateral balance of
payments support is conditional on
recipients sticking to reform programmes
agreed with the International Monetary
Fund and the World Bank.
Assistance with economic liberalisation
has been significant in Eastern Europe and
the former Soviet Union.
Britain encourages more efficient and
effective public expenditure programmes to
ensure priority for basic social and economic
services and provides aid to improve public
infrastructure and utilities.
Good Government
Good government, including respect for
human rights, popular participation in
decision-taking and the rule of law, remains
a central concern of the British aid
programme. In 1991, £50 million was
committed to public sector and civil service
reform, police training, improved
accounting and audit procedures, legal
sector assistance and assistance in
democratic procedures. The Know How
304
OVERSEAS RELATIONS
Fund Finances similar activities in Eastern
Europe and the former Soviet Union.
In some circumstances good government
concerns override other factors and result in a
cessation or reduction in all but emergency aid.
Reducing Poverty
About 80 per cent of bilateral aid allocable by
income group is directed towards low-income
countries with gross national product of less
than $750 per head in 1990. In India, Pakistan
and Bangladesh—the major grant recipients in
Asia—projects include rural development,
urban slum upgrading and the provision of
health, population and educational services for
poor people. Some of these are carried out in
conjunction with non-governmental
organisations.
Britain encourages recipient countries to
focus social expenditure on the needs of the
poor. It also helps these countries to establish
affordable social safety nets designed to assist
the poor and the vulnerable. In addition, the
Government encourages multilateral
initiatives, such as those of the European
Community and the World Bank, to
strengthen poverty reduction programmes.
Education
Britain places a high priority on assistance for
education and training. About £112 million of
the British bilateral aid programme goes to
education; projects supported emphasise
literacy and numeracy and skills which build
on these. The aid is concentrated so that it
benefits the community as a whole and
develops skills needed to achieve sustainable
economic development. British aid also helps
education ministries plan and manage their
systems more efficiently and equitably.
One of the most ambitious education
projects supported by British aid is the
provision of teacher training to 150,000
primary school teachers in 50,000 schools in
Andhra Pradesh, India. Another is the
provision of over 1 million books to 170
secondary schools in Jamaica; there is also a
teacher training programme for 4,000
secondary teachers annually and a textbook
development programme for less able pupils.
Training for project personnel and
scholarship awards for overseas students from
developing countries are an essential part of
the aid programme. In 1992-93 some 13,000
training awards were granted, most of which
were taken up in British universities and
further education colleges. Some training is
provided in the trainee’s own country or in
other countries.
Assistance is given for the provision of
books and journals. The Education Low-
Priced Books Scheme provides textbooks for
purchase by students at subsidised prices in
about 86 developing countries. The Ranfurley
Library Service is a registered charity which
supplies books free of charge to education
institutions and libraries in developing
countries.
Support is also given for distance learning
activities through the Commonwealth of
Learning in Vancouver. The ODA is helping
to finance a database at the British Open
University’s International Centre for Distance
Learning. The database provides information
about distance learning courses available to
students throughout the Commonwealth and
elsewhere.
Health
The ODA invests over £100 million a year
on health care, water and sanitation, and
population projects. The main aim is to help
bring affordable health care services to the
poorest and most vulnerable sections of the
community. To ensure effective use of these
resources, assistance is targeted on a number
of countries and special attention is given to:
• strengthening primary health care
services, particularly for women and
children;
• improving control of communicable
diseases;
• helping to establish management systems
to ensure the provision of good-quality
care at an affordable cost; and
• improving access to reproductive health
services.
Britain assists countries to develop family
planning programmes designed to help
women in particular to exercise choice over
305
BRITAIN 1994: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
their own fertility. ODA spending totalled
£29 million in 1992, which represents an
increase of over 60 per cent compared with
1988. This concentrates on improving the
availability, accessibility and quality of family
planning services, as well as information
about them. No support is given for any
programme in which there is an element of
coercion of individuals to practise family
planning. In 1992 the ODA agreed new
contraceptive supply projects in Kenya,
Ghana and Zimbabwe and a large new health
and population programme in Bangladesh
which is co-funded with the World Bank and
other donors.
New population projects have been
approved during the last two years in
Bangladesh, Pakistan, Malawi, Nigeria,
Ghana, Namibia, Zimbabwe and South
Africa.
The ODA provides finance to the
United Nations Population Fund
(£9 million in 1992) and the
International Planned Parenthood
Federation (£7.5 million in 1992) for
population initiatives undertaken
by these organisations. Support is
also given to the World Health
Organisation’s (WHO) Special
Programme of Research and Training
in Human Reproduction (£2.75 million
in 1992).
In addition, the ODA supports a number
of other WHO programmes dealing with
tropical diseases, acute respiratory infection
and diarrhoeal diseases. Britain funds the
International Centre for Diarrhoeal Diseases
Research in Bangladesh and provides funds to
the London and Liverpool Schools of
Tropical Medicine and for individuals and
institutions to undertake research on health-
related subjects.
Britain gives high priority to international
efforts to reduce the spread of HIV and
AIDS. The Government fully supports the
work of the WHO in co-ordinating
international action. It has committed
£30 million to the WHO’s Global
Programme on AIDS, which provides
technical support and policy guidance to
developing countries for the establishment
and implementation of national AIDS control
programmes.
Other assistance includes a grant of
£1.5 million over three years to the
International Planned Parenthood Federation
for the development of its Sexual Health
Programme and some £4.5 million for
research into the demographic, behavioural,
social and economic aspects of AIDS in the
developing world. Assistance amounting to
£2.3 million has also been provided under a
joint funding scheme to British-based non¬
governmental organisations for small AIDS-
related projects in developing countries.
Britain’s share of the European Community’s
AIDS Programme is about £2.7 million.
Women in Development
The successful implementation of British
aid objectives requires the active
involvement of women in economic and
political decision-taking.
To this end, Britain supports the
promotion of female literacy and recognises
the need to remove barriers to economic
participation by women. The ODA funds
projects aimed at providing women with
additional skills, giving them access to credit
and enabling them to develop small-scale
business initiatives. Support is also given to
training courses to help women overcome the
barriers to advancement in public
administration.
The Environment
Britain helps developing countries tackle
national and local environmental concerns
such as forestry conservation, biodiversity,
energy efficiency and sustainable agriculture.
Forestry
There are over 200 British aid projects
under way or in preparation at a cost of
£161 million. These are designed to:
• enable developing countries to maximise
the economic and social benefits they
enjoy from their forests in a sustainable
way;
306
OVERSEAS RELATIONS
• limit deforestation by tackling its causes
and supporting projects concerned with
conservation; and
• promote the reforestation of degraded
land.
In addition, the ODA helps finance 46
other forestry projects run by non¬
governmental organisations, and 50 research
projects to improve the productivity of
forests.
Climate Change
Some £40 million is being given to the
Global Environment Facility, which helps
developing countries meet the cost of
measures to control climate change. In
addition, nearly $14 million is being
contributed to the Montreal Protocol Fund,
which assists these countries to comply with
the Montreal Protocol on the ozone layer
(see p. 356).
The British aid programme is supporting:
• increased efficiency of fuel use in
countries such as Pakistan, Ghana and
Uganda;
• economic reform programmes
addressing the question of energy pricing;
and
• projects in India to make more effective
use of power generating capacity.
Biodiversity
Britain supports 78 projects concerned with
biodiversity. In Kenya, for example, the ODA
is helping the National Museum to conserve
the country’s native flora; a British botanist is
working with museum staff on a system to
identify plant species at risk and to conserve
them.
The ODA also assists conservation of the
world’s genetic material in gene banks,
botanic gardens and zoos. One of the most
important priorities for a secure future is the
safeguarding of the unique genetic material in
food and fodder crops and wild plants.
British support is given to the International
Board for Plant Genetic Resources, the
International Rice Research Institute and the
International Crops Research Institute for the
Semi-Arid Tropics.
Industry and Urban Pollution
Examples of British aid projects dealing with
environmental problems in cities include:
• a £68 million project to improve the
living conditions of people in five Indian
cities—Calcutta, Vijayawada, Hyderabad,
Indore and Vishakhapatnam. This
includes investment in roads and other
essential services, health facilities and
nursery schools; and
• a study of air pollution problems in
Mexico City caused by industrial
activities in and around Tula. A similar
study is being funded in northern Chile.
Water Resources
In 1992 British aid provided £39.7 million
for water-related projects, including
£16.8 million devoted to the provision of
clean drinking water and/or sanitation in
over 30 developing countries.
New projects committed in 1993 include:
• training in water resources management
in Bangladesh, China and Chile:
• groundwater assessment studies in China
and Mexico;
• provision of rural drinking water supply
and sanitation in Zimbabwe; and
• assistance with fish farming in Cambodia,
India and Mozambique.
Renewable Natural Resources
Britain funds some £34 million of research
each year in renewable natural resources.
This covers programmes in agriculture,
fisheries, forestry, livestock, land resources
assessment, pest control and post-harvest
technology.
The Natural Resources Institute is the
ODA’s scientific arm and runs three
programmes focused on environmental
concerns. These are:
• the Resource Assessment and Farming
Systems Programme, in which
environmental monitoring and
identification of areas for conservation
play an important part;
307
BRITAIN 1994: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
• the Integrated Pest Management
Programme, which aims to improve pest
control by minimising disturbance of
wildlife habitats and relying less heavily
on chemical pesticides; and
• the Food Science and Crop Utilisation
Programme.
Desertification
Britain is taking an active part in United
Nations negotiations on a desertification
convention. It has commissioned expert
papers on the issues to be addressed by such
a convention and on institutional
arrangements arising from it. The ODA has
also funded participation by developing
countries in the negotiations.
Emergency Relief
The ODA’s Disaster Unit co-ordinates the
British Government’s response to natural and
man-made disasters worldwide; it also
provides relief to refugees and displaced
people. To do so, it funds operations carried
out by agencies such as the United Nations,
the Red Cross, Oxfam and Save the Children.
As part of co-ordinated international
responses, the ODA provides funds, supplies
and personnel. Direct relief operations are
mounted to address specific needs, which are
assessed by trained personnel sent out to
direct the British effort on the ground.
Britain strongly supports UN actions in
complex emergencies. In 1992 a joint
British-German proposal led to the
establishment of the UN’s Department of
Humanitarian Affairs, responsible for
co-ordinating prompt responses to
emergencies.
In 1992-93 British humanitarian relief aid
amounted to over £160 million. In addition,
the British public sends substantial sums for
emergency relief overseas through non¬
governmental organisations.
The Private Sector
Increasing emphasis is being placed on capital
market development and case-by-case
technical assistance to private sector
organisations. A Small Enterprise
Development Fund was set up in 1990 to
investigate and promote new projects and
activities. Britain is supporting the
establishment of a Business Extension and
Advisory Service in Zimbabwe and a training
programme at the Entrepreneur Development
Institute in India.
The Commonwealth Development
Corporation (CDC) promotes economic
development by providing loans, equity funds
and management services for financially
viable investments in agriculture, fisheries,
minerals, industry, public utilities, transport,
communications and housing. In 1992 the
CDC invested just over £175 million in 98
projects in 32 countries. By the end of 1992
it had investments and commitments worth
£1,448 million in 316 projects:
• £547 million in Africa;
• £491 million in Asia;
• £270 million in the Caribbean and Latin
America;
• £134 million in Pacific Islands; and
• £7 million in other areas.

The strength of the regular armed forces, all volunteers, was nearly 271,000 in
mid-1993—133,000 in the Army, 79,300 in the Royal Air Force (RAF), and
58,500 in the Royal Navy and Royal Marines. There were 18,800 women
personnel—7,500 in the Army, 6,800 in the RAF, and 4,400 in the Royal Navy.
INTRODUCTION
British forces’ main military roles are to:
• ensure the protection and security of
Britain and its dependent territories;
• ensure against any major external threat
to Britain and its allies; and
• contribute towards promoting Britain’s
wider security interests through the
maintenance of international peace and
security.
Most of Britain’s nuclear and conventional
forces are committed to NATO (North
Atlantic Treaty Organisation) and about 95
per cent of defence expenditure to meeting
its NATO responsibilities. In recognition of
the changed European security situation (see
p. 310), Britain’s armed forces are being
restructured in consultation with other
NATO allies.1
Under these plans, the strength of the
armed forces is being cut by 22 per cent,
leaving by the mid-1990s some 119,000 in the
Army, 70,000 in the RAF and 52,500 in the
Royal Navy and the Royal Marines. This
involves reductions in main equipment of:
NATO’s 16 member countries are Belgium, Britain, Canada,
Denmark, France, Germany, Greece, Iceland, Italy,
Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Spain, Turkey
and the United States.
• three Tornado GR1 squadrons, four
Phantom squadrons, two Buccaneer
squadrons and part of a squadron of
Nimrod maritime patrol aircraft;
• 12 submarines, nine destroyers and
frigates and 13 mine countermeasures
ships; and
• 327 main battle tanks.
Civilian staff employed by the Ministry of
Defence will be reduced from 169,100 in
1991 to 135,000 by the mid-1990s.
NATO STRATEGY
As a member of NATO, Britain fully
supports the Alliance’s current strategic
concept, under which its tasks are to:
• help provide a stable security
environment, in which no country is able
to intimidate or dominate any European
country through the threat or use of
force;
• serve as a transatlantic forum for Allied
consultations affecting member states’
vital interests;
• deter aggression and defend member
states against military attack; and
• preserve the strategic balance within
Europe.
309
BRITAIN 1994: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
NATO has always sought to achieve its
objectives through political as well as military
means. The new NATO strategy therefore
seeks to:
• reduce the risk of conflict;
• increase confidence and understanding
between all European states; and
• expand the possibilities of partnership
among all European countries.
Military Strategy
NATO military policies reflect the following
fundamental precepts:
• none of the Alliance’s weapons will ever be
used except in self-defence and it does not
consider itself to be anyone’s adversary;
• it will retain enough military strength to
convince potential aggressors that the use
of force against one member state will be
met with collective and effective action by
all the allies;
• the European members will assume a
greater degree of responsibility for the
defence of Europe; and
• the transatlantic link will be enhanced in
parallel with the emergence of a
European security identity and defence
role.
An integrated military structure will be
retained, including common force and
operational planning, multinational military
formations, joint exercises, common standards
for equipment, co-operation on infrastructure
and armaments, and, where appropriate, the
stationing of forces outside home territory on
a mutual basis. Britain takes part in the
integrated military structure.
The size, readiness, availability and
deployment of NATO forces will continue to
reflect the Alliance’s defensive nature. NATO
strategy involves:
• the deployment in Europe of smaller,
highly mobile forces;
• a move away from the concept of forward
defence towards a reduced forward
presence; and
• the scaling back of the state of readiness
of Allied armed forces and a reduction in
training requirements and exercises.
New Force Structure
In future there will be greater emphasis on
multinational forces, as part of collective
defence. In 1991 NATO defence ministers
agreed the basis of the new force structure, to
be achieved by 1995, involving:
• immediate and rapid reaction forces,
available at short notice, capable of
providing an early military response to a
crisis;
• main defence forces to deter attack and
defend against aggression; and
• reinforcements providing operational and
strategic reserves in times of crisis or
war.
NATO maritime reaction forces will
be based on two multinational Standing
Naval Forces for the Atlantic and the
Mediterranean, supplemented as necessary by
other maritime forces able to respond to a
range of contingencies. Britain will contribute
Harrier, Tornado and Jaguar aircraft to
multinational air reaction forces.
Britain has been invited to lead the
major element of the land reaction
forces: the Allied Command Europe
Rapid Reaction Corps, which was
established in October 1992 in order to
provide an early military response to
a crisis.
The radical changes in the European
security situation mean that NATO can have
a reduced reliance on non-strategic nuclear
weapons. All of NATO’s ground-launched
and naval tactical nuclear weapons were
removed by July 1992 and the number of air
delivered nuclear weapons has been reduced
by over a half. Since October 1991 the size of
the NATO stockpile of non-strategic nuclear
weapons has been reduced by over 80 per cent.
Western European Union
Although European countries supply most of
NATO’s forces, as well as military facilities
for US forces stationed in Western Europe,
all Allies are agreed that Europe needs to take
on a larger share of the burden of providing
310
DEFENCE AND ARMS CONTROL
international security. It has, therefore, been
agreed that the Western European Union
(WEU—see p. 291) should be the best
vehicle for this.
Britain, in common with other Allies,
believes that the WEU should be built up as
an effective bridge between NATO defence
structures and the developing political and
security policies of the 12 EC member states.
NUCLEAR FORCES
The Royal Navy’s independent nuclear
deterrent remains the ultimate guarantee of
Britain’s security. The Polaris strategic
nuclear force, assigned to NATO but
remaining at all times under the control of
the British Government, enables Britain to
provide a second and independent centre of
decision-making within the Alliance, thereby
adding to deterrence.
The Polaris force now comprises three
nuclear submarines, each one equipped with
16 Polaris missiles armed with improved
British nuclear warheads. The Polaris force is
being replaced by four British-built
submarines, each of which will be capable of
accommodating Trident D5 missiles bought
from the United States. This force will
ensure that one boat is always at sea,
invulnerable to pre-emptive attack. Trident’s
nuclear warheads are British-designed and
built.
The Government has no intention of
increasing Britain’s nuclear capability beyond
the minimum level necessary to ensure
adequate deterrence, and plans for Trident do
not involve using the system’s full capacity.
The number of warheads deployed will be
decided nearer completion and will be
reviewed in the light of changes in the
strategic environment and any improvements
in defensive capabilities.
The armed forces also possess non-
strategic nuclear weapons, providing a link
between strategic and conventional forces.
Because of the end of the Cold War, Britain
has made substantial reductions in these
weapons, including the elimination of
maritime non-strategic nuclear weapons and a
reduction of over a half in the stockpile of
WE 177 free-fall nuclear bombs. The
remainder of these bombs will be deployed
on eight squadrons of dual-capable Tornado
aircraft, all of which are available to NATO.
DEFENCE OF BRITAIN
The armed forces continue to have day-to-
day responsibilities for safeguarding Britain’s
territory, airspace, territorial waters and those
of the dependent territories.
Air Defence
The air defence of Britain and the
surrounding seas is maintained by a
sophisticated system of layered defences.
Continuous radar cover is provided by an
improved United Kingdom Air Defence
Ground Environment, supplemented by the
RAF’s six Boeing Sentry airborne early
warning (AEW) aircraft. The RAF also
provides six squadrons of all-weather
Tornado F3 interceptor aircraft, supported by
tanker aircraft and, in wartime, 50 armed
Hawk trainer aircraft. In addition, the Royal
Navy’s air defence destroyers are also linked
to the improved air defence system,
providing radar and electronic warfare
coverage and surface-to-air missiles. Ground-
launched Rapier missiles will continue to
defend the main RAF bases. From the end of
the century Eurofighter 2000, a collaborative
project involving Britain, Germany, Italy and
Spain, is planned to be the cornerstone of the
RAF’s capability, including air defence.
Role of the Navy
In addition to contributing to Britain’s air
defence, the Royal Navy plays a key part in
keeping open the country’s sea lanes, ports
and anchorages. The Navy’s flotilla of patrol
craft and mine countermeasures vessels,
which makes an important contribution to
this task, is being modernised, with the
Sandown class single-role minehunters
replacing the ageing Ton class.
The Army
By the mid-1990s there will be 17 regular
infantry battalions—compared with 21 at
311
BRITAIN 1994: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
present—earmarked for home defence, rising
to 18 after 1997, when British forces will be
withdrawn from Hong Kong. These will be
augmented by regular engineer, signals and
aviation units and armoured reconnaissance
regiments, infantry battalions and supporting
units of the Territorial Army (TA). The
diminution of the land threat to Britain will
in future allow the TA to take on a greater
part of the home defence task, as well as
becoming increasingly a flexible general
reserve. The Home Service Force, formed
in 1985 to guard key points, is being
absorbed within the TA.
Dependent Territories
Britain continues to maintain garrisons in
Hong Kong, the Falkland Islands and
Gibraltar. In Hong Kong, Britain is to
reduce the garrison in stages until 1997,
when the territory will become part of
China. Gibraltar provides headquarters and
communications facilities for NATO in the
Western Mediterranean.
British forces are stationed on the
Falkland Islands to deter possible aggression
from Argentina, which maintains its claim to
the Islands. These forces include air defence
aircraft, Hercules tankers, helicopters and
Rapier surface-to-air missiles. There is an
infantry company group and the Royal Navy
is present in adjacent waters.
Northern Ireland
The armed forces continue to support the
Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC) in the
fight against terrorism in Northern Ireland.
There are 18 infantry units, six of which
comprise the home service element of the
Royal Irish Regiment. The Royal Navy
carries out patrols to prevent arms
smuggling, while the Royal Marines provide
troops to meet Navy and Army
commitments.
The armed forces help deter and combat
terrorist activity through foot patrols, vehicle
check points, patrols to combat cross-border
attacks by terrorists and specialist assistance,
including helicopter support, bomb disposal
and search teams.
Other Functions
Other functions performed by the armed
forces in Britain include military assistance to
civil ministries where it is necessary to
maintain the essentials of life in the
community or undertake urgent work of
national importance. Other duties include
fishery protection, operations against drug
smugglers and search and rescue operations.
INTERNATIONAL COMMITMENTS
Defence of Europe
The defence of the European mainland is
essential not merely for the defence of Britain
and other NATO members but for Western
security and stability as a whole. It is,
therefore, important for NATO that British
and North American forces remain there in
peacetime.
Britain’s Contribution
Britain’s main contribution to the defence of
mainland Europe is provided by the British
Army and the RAF. The number of regular
Army personnel based in mainland Europe in
peacetime is being reduced from some
56,000 in April 1991 to about 23,000 in the
mid-1990s.
Some 55,000 regular British soldiers will be
assigned to NATO’s new Allied Command
Europe Rapid Reaction Corps (see p. 314).
This will comprise:
• an armoured division made up of three
armoured brigades, each of which will
have two armoured regiments and two
infantry regiments based in Germany; and
• a more lightly-equipped division, based in
Britain, of two mechanised brigades.
In addition, Britain will provide the
permanent commander for the Corps and
contribute to the headquarters infrastructure
and combat support. An airborne brigade will
also join one of the two multinational
divisions in the Corps. Britain will continue
to base part of an infantry brigade in Berlin
until Russian forces leave the eastern part of
Germany in 1994.
312
DEFENCE AND ARMS CONTROL
On mobilisation the British force would be
increased by a substantial number of TA
troops in formed units and individual
reservists.
The armoured division, to be deployed in
Germany from the mid-1990s, will be
equipped with the new Challenger 2 tank,
which will serve in two regiments and replace
the remaining Chieftain tanks in the Royal
Armoured Corps. The Challenger 2 will
significantly improve armoured forces,
particularly in NATO’s Rapid Reaction
Corps. There are plans to replace the Lynx
anti-tank helicopter with an attack helicopter
designed to increase the effectiveness of the
Army’s airmobile forces.
The Royal Artillery will gain more new
anti-armour capability with the procurement
of Phase 2 ammunition for the Multiple
Launch Rocket System. These rockets are
designed to scatter anti-tank mines at long
range. The AS90 self-propelled howitzer,
which is replacing the Abbot and M-109
guns, began entering service in 1992.
The RAF is making a major contribution
to NATO’s air reaction force. Up to 80
aircraft from squadrons based in Britain and
Germany will be made available, including
Tornado F3s, offensive support Harriers,
offensive support and reconnaissance Jaguars,
and strike/attack Tornado GRIAs. Rapier
surface-to-air missiles will also be assigned to
this task. Logistical and tactical support is
provided by the tanker, transport and
helicopter forces.
Major improvements to the Army’s air
defence are being planned, including
the Starstreak high velocity missile,
the next generation of Rapier missiles
and a new air defence command and
control system.
Since 1991 RAF forces in Germany have
undergone significant restructuring. The
number of squadrons has been reduced to
four Tornado GR1 strike/attack squadrons,
two Harrier offensive support squadrons and
a mixed Puma/Chinook support helicopter
squadron. Two bases in Germany have been
closed, leaving RAF Bruggen and RAF
Laarbruch as the main operating bases.
Maritime Defence
NATO is dependent on the free use of the
sea, since all supply and reinforcement from
North America has to go through the Atlantic
and the Channel. Britain and the other
European members of NATO rely on trade
and raw materials from overseas.
Most Royal Navy ships are committed to
NATO. Permanent contributions are made to
NATO’s standing naval forces in the
Atlantic and the Mediterranean, and a mine
countermeasures vessel is allocated to the
standing naval force in the Channel. These
forces would form part of the immediate
reaction forces available to NATO in the
event of a crisis.
The Royal Navy will also make a
considerable contribution to NATO’s
reaction, main and augmentation forces. This
will include:
• three anti-submarine warfare (ASW)
aircraft carriers, operating Sea Harrier
FRS1 fighters and ASW Sea King
helicopters, to be replaced later with the
modernised Sea Harrier, FRS2 and the
EH 101 Merlin helicopters respectively;
• about 35 destroyers and frigates, mainly
multi-role Type 22 and Type 23 frigates;
and
• 12 nuclear-powered attack submarines.
The amphibious forces—including two
assault ships, a newly ordered carrier
deploying helicopters and the Royal
Marines—will be retained for deployment
throughout the NATO area. From 1995 the
RAF’s Buccaneer maritime attack aircraft will
be replaced by specially modified Tornado
GRls, equipped with the Sea Eagle missile.
The RAF will also continue to provide
Nimrod maritime patrol aircraft, and search
and rescue helicopters.
Specialist Reinforcement Forces
Combat units based in Britain form an
important part of NATO’s mobile
reinforcement forces. There is an infantry
battalion group, including artillery, engineer,
and communications elements and support
helicopters for the Allied Mobile Force
313
BRITAIN 1994: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
available for deployment at short notice. A
Royal Marines brigade forms part of a joint
British-Netherlands amphibious force and is
assigned to the Supreme Allied Commander
Atlantic as part of NATO’s rapid reaction
forces.
Assisting these reinforcement forces are
RAF Fighters and a strengthened air transport
force. In addition, a Harrier squadron could
be deployed as part of NATO’s strategic air
reserve. There are various other individual
reinforcement forces, including units of the
Special Air Forces.
Wider Security Interests
In addition to their commitment to collective
defence against direct attack on an ally,
Britain and the other NATO members
believe that Alliance security can be affected
by other events.
An example of rapid response to such an
event occurred in 1991, when Britain, the
United States and other NATO members
contributed forces which helped to expel Iraqi
forces from Kuwait (see p. 301).
Britain continues to deploy the Armilla
naval patrol, designed to provide reassurance
and assistance to merchant shipping in and
around the Gulf area.
Since mid-1992 NATO has been closely
involved in operations in support of UN
efforts to resolve the crisis in former
Yugoslavia (see p. 298). In July 1992 a
NATO maritime operation was mounted in
the Adriatic in co-ordination with operations
undertaken by the WEU (see p. 311) to
monitor and enforce compliance with UN
Security Council resolutions imposing
economic sanctions on Serbia and
Montenegro. NATO’s early-warning aircraft
are monitoring the no-fly zone established
over Bosnia-Herzegovina, established by the
UN Security Council in November 1992.
NATO has also provided elements of its
Northern Army group, Central Europe,
command for the operational headquarters of
the UN Protection Force in Bosnia.
In addition to its contribution to NATO
maritime and air operation, Britain has 2,500
personnel in the UN Protection Force in
Bosnia (see p. 299).
British Garrisons
A British garrison is maintained in Brunei at
the request of the Brunei Government.
Britain is committed to keeping a Gurkha
battalion there until 1998.
There is also a British garrison in Belize,
originally maintained to deter and, if
necessary, defend against possible
Guatemalan aggression. As Guatemala now
recognises Belize’s sovereignty and
independence, Britain will transfer
responsibility for the defence of Belize to the
Belize Government in January 1994. Jungle
warfare training will continue in Belize.
Military Assistance
Britain provides military assistance to other
countries in order to contribute to regional
stability. In 1991-92 some 4,200 students
from 72 countries attended military training
courses in Britain. In early 1993, some 370
British servicemen were on loan in 30
countries.
In the Middle East Britain is helping a
number of Gulf states to reorganise, train and
equip their armed forces and has undertaken
a programme of air and land exercises in the
area.
Naval deployments take place outside
Europe to develop military links with other
countries and to support Britain’s security
interests. In 1992, for instance, a Royal Navy
task group went to South East Asia and the
Far East, visiting some 24 countries in the
Asia Pacific Rim and the Indian Ocean, the
Gulf and the Mediterranean.
THE ARMED FORCES
Commissioned Ranks
Commissions, either by promotion from the
ranks or by direct entry based on educational
and other qualifications, are granted for short,
medium and long terms. All three Services
have schemes for school, university and
college sponsorships.
Commissioned ranks receive initial training
at the Britannia Royal Naval College,
Dartmouth; the Royal Military Academy,
314
DEFENCE AND ARMS CONTROL
Sandhurst; or in the Royal Air Force College,
Cranwell. This is followed by specialist
training, often including degree courses at
Service establishments or universities.
Higher training for officers is provided by
the Royal Naval College, Greenwich; the
Army Staff College, at Camberley; and the
Royal Air Force Staff College, at Bracknell.
Selected senior officers and civilian officials
attend the Joint Services Defence College,
Greenwich, and the Royal College of Defence
Studies, London, which is also attended by
officers and officials from other countries.
These provide the wider background
necessary for those destined to fill higher
appointments.
Non-commissioned Ranks
Engagements for non-commissioned ranks
range from 3 to 23 years, with a wide choice
of length and terms of service. Subject to a
minimum period of service, entrants may
leave at any time, at 18 months’ notice (12
months for certain engagements). Discharge
may also be granted on compassionate
grounds, by purchase or on grounds of
conscience.
Throughout their Service careers non¬
commissioned personnel receive basic training
supplemented by specialist training. Study
for educational qualifications is encouraged
and Service trade and technical training lead
to nationally recognised qualifications.
Reserve Forces
Trained reserve and auxiliary forces
supplement the regular forces on mobilisation
and are able immediately to take their places
either as formed units or as individual
reinforcements. They are also a link between
the Services and the civil community. Some
members of these forces become reservists
following a period of regular service (regular
reserve); others are volunteers who train in
their spare time. Volunteer reserve forces
include the TA, which is responsible for the
direct defence of Britain as well as providing
a flexible general reserve.
Other volunteer forces include the Royal
Naval and Royal Marines Reserves, the Royal
Naval Auxiliary Service, the Royal Auxiliary
Air Force and the Royal Air Force Volunteer
Reserve.
In the summer of 1993 regular reserves
totalled 261,700 and volunteer reserves and
auxiliary forces 81,700. Cadet forces, which
make a significant contribution to recruitment
in the regular forces, numbered 137,000.
ADMINISTRATION
Defence Budget
The estimated defence budget for 1993-94 is
£23,520 million, with expenditure plans for
1994- 95 and 1995-96 of £23,750 million and
£23,220 million respectively. The
Government anticipates a reduction in the
budget of 12 per cent in real terms between
1990-91 and 1995-96, excluding costs of
redundancies and the Gulf War (see p. 301).
Britain spent 4.1 per cent of Gross
Domestic Product (GDP) on defence in 1992;
this is expected to reduce to 3.2 per cent by
1995- 96.
Defence Management
Within the Ministry of Defence a military-
civilian Defence Staff is responsible for
defence policy and strategy, operational
requirements and commitments. An Office of
Management and Budget handles budgets
and resources. Each Service Chief of Staff
reports through the Chief of Defence Staff to
the Defence Secretary on matters related to
the fighting effectiveness, management,
efficiency and morale of his Service. The
management of the three services is exercised
through executive committees of their Service
Boards, which are chaired by their respective
Chiefs of Staff and act in accordance with
centrally determined policy objectives and
budgets. The Procurement Executive deals
with the purchase of equipment, including
equipment collaboration with allies and
friendly nations.
Military and civilian managers have
greater discretion in the most efficient use of
their allocated resources. This approach aims
to promote better value for money and to
provide clear direction for local managers.
315
BRITAIN 1994: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Defence Procurement
About 39 per cent of the defence budget is
spent on defence equipment, making the
Ministry of Defence one of British industry’s
largest customers. Contracts are awarded by
open international competition where
possible. Strict guidelines ensure companies
are given the maximum incentive to perform
efficiently.
Research is undertaken by the Ministry’s
Defence Research Agency and other smaller
establishments (see p. 278).
Alliance Co-operation
Britain favours international co-operation on
defence equipment wherever it makes
economic and military sense by reducing
costs and improving standardisation. It
therefore plays an active role in NATO’s
Conference of National Armaments Directors,
which promotes equipment collaboration
between NATO members.
Britain is also a member of the WEU’s
Western European Armaments Group
(WEAG), which is the main European forum
for consultations about armaments.
Current collaborative projects involving
Britain include:
• Eurofighter 2000 (with Germany, Italy
and Spain);
• anti-tank guided weapons (with Belgium,
France, Germany and the Netherlands);
and
• the EH101 helicopter (with Italy).
Britain is also discussing with France and
Italy arrangements for the development of a
new air defence frigate, planned to enter
service early in the next decade.
Many weapons systems in production or
in service with British forces are the result of
equipment collaboration with NATO
members. These include:
• the Harrier GR5 aircraft (with the
United States);
• Tornado aircraft (with Germany and
Italy); and
• Jaguar aircraft (with France).
The Scorpion reconnaissance vehicle range
is a British-Belgian project. Britain has
produced with Germany and Italy a 155-mm
towed howitzer, the FH70. The multiple
launch rocket system programme, in which
Britain participates, is another NATO
project.
A further example of NATO co-operation
is an air defence system, funded by 14
nations, which comprises radar and computer
centres providing NATO with early warning
of attack over an area stretching from
northern Norway to eastern Turkey.
Civil Defence
Civil defence is based on the peacetime
arrangements of government departments,
local government authorities and emergency
services, supplemented by the efforts of
voluntary organisations.
Following the end of the Cold War, civil
defence arrangements have been reviewed and
changes made. New regulations, which came
into force in August 1993, removed obsolete
civil defence duties previously placed on local
authorities. At the same time local authorities
are being encouraged to develop
arrangements capable of responding to any
crisis, whether in peace or war.
Civil defence spending is being reduced to
reflect the new situation. In 1992-93
spending was about £60 million and is
forecast to be reduced to just under £38
million in 1994-95.
ARMS CONTROL
Britain and the other members of NATO are
pledged to pursue further progress in arms
control and confidence-building measures.
Far reaching and historic treaties limiting
nuclear weapons and conventional forces in
Europe have recently been signed.
Nuclear Arms Control
In July 1991 the United States and the
former Soviet Union signed the first
Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty, under
which an equal limit of 6,000 nuclear
warheads on each side was agreed, with an
316
DEFENCE AND ARMS CONTROL
equal sub-limit of 4,900 ballistic missile
warheads. The Treaty required the parties to
reduce their strategic missiles and warheads
by about 35 per cent over 15 years, including
a reduction of up to 50 per cent in the most
destabilising systems.
In January 1993 the United States and
Russia signed a new treaty agreeing to reduce
their strategic nuclear weapons by two-thirds
within ten years.
The United States and Russia eliminated
their intermediate-range nuclear weapons
under a separate treaty signed in 1987.
Conventional Weapons
The most potent conventional weapons held
within Europe by NATO allies and the
former Warsaw Pact states are regulated by
the Conventional Armed Forces in Europe
(CEE) Treaty, signed in Paris in November
1990. It entered into force in November 1992.
The objectives of the Treaty are to eliminate
disparities of forces and the capacity for
launching surprise and large-scale offensive
action.
Under the Treaty the NATO countries
and the members of the former Warsaw Pact
are restricted to common ceilings in five
categories of equipment. The ceilings for both
groups of states are 20,000 tanks, 30,000
armoured combat vehicles, 6,000 pieces of
artillery, 2,000 attack helicopters and 6,800
combat aircraft.
Conventional weapons above the agreed
ceilings must be destroyed or rendered
permanently unfit for further military use by
November 1995. ‘Intrusive’ arrangements to
verify compliance are included in the Treaty.
In July 1992 an agreement was concluded
containing measures to limit, and where
necessary reduce, the personnel strength of
national armed forces within Europe.
Chemical Weapons
Britain took a leading part in the recent
negotiations on a chemical weapons ban.
These were completed in June 1992 and the
text of a convention was adopted by the UN
General Assembly in November 1992. Britain
has signed the convention, which is expected
to enter into force in 1995. It bans the
production, stockpiling and use of chemical
weapons. There is a system of ‘challenge’
inspection to verify compliance and, once
ratified, the convention will provide for the
monitoring of chemicals which could be
used to make weapons.
Britain abandoned its chemical weapons
in the late 1950s.
Non-Proliferation
Britain aims:
• to prevent the proliferation of nuclear
weapons;
• to ban the manufacture and possession
of chemical and biological weapons;
• to control the transfer of ballistic
missiles and their components and
technology; and
• to prevent accumulations of
conventional armaments which create
regional instability.
To this end, the Government is a
signatory to a number of international
agreements for the control of proliferation
of weapons of mass destuction, including
the 1968 Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT)
on nuclear weapons and the 1993 Chemical
Weapons Convention. A review conference
is to be held in 1995 to consider the length
of the NPT’s extension. The British
Government will be seeking an indefinite
extension.
Nuclear Testing
In July 1993 the United States President
announced an extension of a US
moratorium on nuclear testing till the end
of September 1994, as a possible precursor
to a comprehensive test ban treaty.
Negotiations on this treaty are due to start
in the Conference on Disarmament early in
1994.
The British Government’s policy has
been to carry out only the minimal testing
necessary to maintain the safety and
credibility of its nuclear deterrent. In
supporting the goal of a test ban treaty, the
Government will wish to ensure that it has
317
BRITAIN 1994: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
the means to maintain the highest standards
of nuclear safety in the long term while also
wishing to see the proposed treaty promote
efforts to prevent the proliferation of nuclear
weapons.
UN Register of Arms Transfers
Following a British initiative, the UN
General Assembly voted to establish a
universal and non-discriminatory register of
conventional arms transfers. The register is
designed to introduce greater openness and
make it easier for the international
community to monitor an excessive arms
build-up in any one country. The register
came into effect in January 1992, requiring
participating states to provide details of their
import and export of seven major categories
of weapons.
Confidence-building Measures
Steps have been taken in recent years to
implement important confidence-building
measures regarding military exercises and
other activities in Europe.
The Conference on Security and Co¬
operation in Europe (CSCE) provides a
forum for dialogue on such measures as arms
control. Participants include the republics of
the former Soviet Union, the other European
states and the United States and Canada. All
are committed to working for improvements
in European security, including promotion of
human rights, democracy and the rule of law.
Under the Stockholm agreement
concluded in 1986, CSCE member states
agreed on a number of measures, including:
• prior notification of military activities
above a certain size;
• invitation of military observers to
notifiable activities;
• an exchange of annual forecasts of
notifiable activities planned for up to two
years ahead, according to the size of the
activity; and
• ‘challenge’ inspections.
In 1990 the Paris CSCE summit agreed
further measures, including:
• annual exchanges of military information
on forces, equipment and budgets;
• further prior notification of military
manoeuvres;
• provisions for the exchange and
evaluation of information on military
forces; and
• the establishment of a common
communications network linking all
CSCE capitals.
In May 1992 these measures entered into
force; new commitments were added,
including a risk reduction mechanism and
arrangements for military contacts.
Open Skies Treaty
Britain played an important role in the
negotiations leading to the signing in March
1992 of the Open Skies Treaty by all NATO
member states, Russia, Belarus, Georgia,
Ukraine and the six Central European states
of Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Hungary,
Poland, Romania and Slovakia. The Treaty
will allow flights over the entire territories of
its participants by aircraft equipped with
sensors, cameras and radar with the ability to
detect military activity and equipment in all
weathers, day and night.
The Treaty, which is of unlimited
duration, will be phased in over three years;
when fully in force, it will play a
valuable stabilising role by allowing the major
CSCE countries to check on military
deployments.

Job creation, training, rents-to-mortgages schemes, and improving security
and lighting on estates are just some of the many strategies employed in
Britain with the aim of enhancing both the urban and rural environments,
and ensuring the availability and diversity of tenure of suitable housing.
Urban Regeneration
Despite much progress in urban
regeneration, areas of deprivation still exist.
These relatively small areas can have a
blighting effect on a city’s image. The
Government is therefore continuing to
tackle urban deprivation with a range of
programmes, bringing together a
comprehensive package for revival in
England, involving government
departments in a co-ordinated effort.
Increased private sector involvement is
being sought. Urban problems in Scotland,
Wales and Northern Ireland are being
tackled by Partnerships, the Programme for
the Valleys and Belfast Action Teams
respectively, as well as by many other
government programmes.
Leasehold Reform, Housing and Urban
Development Act
The Leasehold Reform, Housing and
Urban Development Act 1993 will establish
a new Urban Regeneration Agency for
England. It will take over responsibility for
the Government’s Derelict Land Grant
programme (see p. 325), the payment of
City Grant (see p. 321) and the work of
English Estates (see p. 147).
Urban Initiatives
City Action Teams
Eight City Action Teams (CATs) co¬
ordinate government efforts in inner city
areas (see map, pp. 324-5) and encourage
partnerships between business, local and
central government, the voluntary sector
and local people. They bring together senior
officials of three government departments—
Employment, Environment, and Trade and
Industry—to ensure that the main
programmes for which each is responsible
are working together effectively. CATs are
primary points of contact with local
authorities on City Challenge (see p. 322).
Each CAT has a small budget to assist
co-ordination of government action in the
inner city. CAT grants are available to local
authorities, expanding businesses, local
community groups and voluntary
organisations working in or moving to an
inner city area.
321
BRITAIN 1994: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Task Forces
Task Forces were first set up in 1986 and are
small teams which operate in the most
deprived urban areas. They consist primarily
of civil servants, but include secondees from
local authorities and the private and
voluntary sectors. Task Forces concentrate on
the economic regeneration of designated
inner city areas, by improving local people’s
employment prospects, by supporting
training and education initiatives, and by
identifying and removing barriers to their
employment. They also aim to stimulate
enterprise development and strengthen the
capacity of communities to meet local needs.
Once a Task Force area has improved
prospects for continued regeneration and
local organisations have been strengthened,
the Task Force is closed. As part of a rolling
programme of openings and closures, a total
of 16 Task Forces has been maintained.
Since their inception they have committed
some £127 million in support of 5,000
projects.
Urban Programme
The Urban Programme is a special allocation
to local authorities in addition to their
normal resources. In England, it is
concentrated on 57 target areas where the
problems are greatest and the levels of
deprivation most severe, so as to achieve a
greater impact with available funds. The local
authorities concerned receive 75 per cent
grant from central government to cover
spending on approved projects, with a
further 25 per cent in supplementary credit
approvals for capital projects.
In 1992-93 the Urban Programme in
England was estimated to have supported 788
new firms, helped to create or preserve
40,000 jobs and supported 74,100 training
places. It improved 1,000 buildings and about
2,100 hectares (5,100 acres) of unsightly land.
It also supported environmental improvement
schemes for 52,600 dwellings. From 1993-94,
no new projects will be supported through
the Urban Programme, although projects
approved in previous years will continue to
be funded.
Capital Partnerships
The Government announced its £600
million Capital Partnership programme,
several elements of which related to urban
regeneration, in November 1992. The
various components of Capital Partnership
provided incentives to top up the estimated
£1,750 million of local authority capital
receipts released by the Government from
spending controls1 between November 1992
and December 1993, to be spent on projects
best placed to stimulate growth.
Components of the programme included:
• Housing Partnership, which made use of
Estate Action funding and a new
Housing Partnership Fund; and
• Urban Partnership, using a new Urban
Partnership Fund within the Urban
Programme.
Under the scheme, local authorities
eligible for Urban Partnership Fund
resources could bid for assistance with new
1993-94 projects. Money from this source
would supplement funds denied from their
own capital receipts—money coming from
the sale of capital assets such as land. The
Fund will help to support 82 new projects
in 46 inner city areas. Local authorities will
contribute about £33 million in capital
receipts, and the projects are estimated to be
attracting over £130 million in private sector
resources.
City Challenge
Under the City Challenge initiative,
launched in 1991, local authorities are
invited, in partnership with the private and
voluntary sectors, local communities and
government agencies, to submit imaginative
and comprehensive plans for regenerating
key neighbourhoods by tackling the
problems of physical decay, lack of
opportunity and poor quality of life. The
best of these proposals receive government
1 In general, some 50 per cent of most local government capital
receipts (and 75 per cent of housing receipts) had to be retained
for debt redemption; in November 1992 the Government
announced that for a one-year period local authorities would be
free to spend all their capital receipts on new capital projects.

URBAN REGENERATION AND HOUSING
funding of £7.5 million a year over five
years, subject to satisfactory progress being
made towards achieving agreed targets and
objectives. Public sector investment of over
£ 1,000 million in City Challenge is expected
to attract considerable additional private
sector investment.
There have been two rounds of the City
Challenge competition. In the first pilot
round, 11 of the 15 local authorities in
England invited to submit bids were
selected to draw up detailed plans for action
which commenced in April 1992. The 20
successful authorities in the second round
competition, which was open to all 57
Urban Programme authorities, began work
on their five-year programmes in April
1993.
Urban Development Corporations
A total of 13 urban development
corporations (UDCs) have been set up by
the Government to reverse large-scale urban
decline. London Docklands and Merseyside
were established in 1981. By the end of
March 1992 the London Docklands
Development Corporation had received over
£1,347 million in government grant and
secured private investment commitments of
over £9,000 million, with £5,700 million
having been spent. It has reclaimed about
600 hectares (1,500 acres) of derelict land
for housing, commercial and recreational
use. Over 17,000 homes have been
completed and, up to March 1992, 49,000
jobs had been attracted to the area. The
Merseyside Development Corporation has
reclaimed 337 hectares (832 acres) of
derelict land, and 342,000 sq m (3.7 million
sq ft) of commercial or industrial floorspace
have been built or refurbished in its area.
Eleven further UDCs have been set up:
Birmingham Heartlands, Black Country
(West Midlands), Bristol, Leeds, Central
Manchester, Plymouth, Sheffield, Trafford
Park (Greater Manchester), Teesside, and
Tyne and Wear in England; and Cardiff
Bay in Wales. UDCs cover about 16,000
hectares (about 40,000 acres), and public
expenditure on the programme will be £316
million in 1993-94.
City Grant
City Grant is available to encourage private
sector developments in inner cities in
England. It is paid direct to the private sector
for projects which contribute to the economic
and environmental regeneration of Urban
Programme areas. By May 1993, 330 schemes
had been approved, with £292 million of
public money bringing in £1,230 million of
private investment. Under these schemes,
some 40,000 jobs and 9,700 homes were being
provided and 700 hectares (1,720 acres) were
being reclaimed. Under the provisions of the
Leasehold Reform, Housing and Urban
Development Act, responsibility for this
programme will be undertaken by the new
Urban Regeneration Agency.
Education, Training and Employment
The first of a network of City Technology
Colleges was opened near Birmingham in
1988; 15 are currently in operation. Intended
to raise educational standards, the colleges are
established jointly by the Government and
industry.
A number of schools/industry ‘Compacts’
have been introduced since August 1988 in
nearly all English Urban Programme areas.
Employers work with schools to guarantee a
job with training for all school-leavers aged 16
to 18 who meet agreed targets for motivation
and achievement. By July 1993 there were 62
Compacts in operation in inner city areas,
with some 180,000 young people, 10,000
employers and training organisations and
about 800 schools involved, creating over
9,000 jobs and training places.
Training programmes such as Youth
Training for young people and Training for
Work, the new adult programme (see p. 127),
are helping many people in the inner cities.
About one-third of the young people
participating in Youth Training are from
inner cities. There are some 110 Employment
Service ‘outreach’ staff based in or visiting
inner city areas, helping unemployed people
look for jobs and encouraging them to
participate in employment and training
programmes. In 1992-93, there were about
500 inner city Jobclubs, many catering for

people with literacy and numeracy or
language difficulties. In addition,
Employment Service regional directors have
funds for innovative projects to help
unemployed people in inner cities and other
deprived areas back into work or training.
Many of the independent Training and
Enterprise Councils (see p. 126) are working
in Task Force areas, City Challenge areas or
other pockets of deprivation.
Other Measures
Higher than average crime rates, and the fear
of crime, are particular problems in the inner
cities. Safer Cities projects bring together all
sections of the local community to tackle
crime and the fear of crime. A total of 20
Safer Cities projects are under way, and have
initiated over 3,150 crime prevention and
community safety measures with funding of
more than £19 million. The Government’s
objective is to achieve up to 40 Safer Cities
projects within the present Parliament. The
starting point for a project is the preparation
of a detailed local crime profile, which the
local team can then use to draw up an action
plan. Examples of help include providing
activities for young people otherwise likely to
commit crime and fitting good quality locks
to houses on estates with a high burglary rate.
Safer Cities successes include:
• a scheme in East London which
has reduced repeat racial
incidents by 50 per cent;
• a motor education project in
Bradford which has reduced the
number of new car crime
offenders by 74 per cent; and
• an 80 per cent reduction in
burglaries on an estate in Salford
as a result of improved security
measures undertaken as part of a
community regeneration scheme.
The Government encourages tourism as a
force for the improvement of inner city areas.
Several major projects which create a cultural
and artistic focus for inner city regeneration
have been undertaken. Examples include the
development of the Museum of Science and
Technology in the Castlefields area of
Manchester and the International
Convention Centre in Birmingham. The
English Tourist Board and regional tourist
boards encourage promotional activities in
inner city areas through local initiatives
which bring together the tourist boards,
local authorities, the private sector and other
agencies.
The Government’s priorities for inner
city housing are to secure a wide range of
good quality housing available for rent or
purchase, and to improve conditions and
opportunities for residents, particularly on
local authority estates (see p. 334).
Enterprise and Simplified Planning
Zones
Since 1981 the Government has set up 33
enterprise zones (see map, pp. 324-5). Each
zone runs for a period of ten years from
designation; many of the zones have
therefore already reached the end of their
lives. Benefits in the zones include:
• exemption from the national non¬
domestic rate (the local property tax
payable by non-domestic property
owners);
• 100 per cent allowances for corporation
and income tax purposes for capital
expenditure on industrial and
commercial buildings;
• a much simplified planning system; and
• a reduction in government requests for
statistical information.
In January 1994 there will be ten zones
operating, although five of these will expire
before the end of the year. Three new zones
will be designated during the year in areas
affected by job losses in the mining industry.
At present, there is no intention to extend
the enterprise zone scheme generally,
although further zones may be created in
exceptional circumstances.
Simplified planning zones (SPZs) can
help local authorities to secure development
in parts of their areas. An SPZ scheme,
which also lasts for ten years, provides full
planning permission for specified types of
development. Like enterprise zones, from
326
URBAN REGENERATION AND HOUSING
which the concept was derived, SPZs are
useful as part of an overall package to
generate private sector interest in an area.
The procedures for establishing an SPZ were
recently streamlined to encourage their use. By
March 1993, there were six zones in operation.
Land Reclamation and Use
The new Urban Regeneration Agency will co¬
ordinate efforts to bring derelict land back
into effective use and provide new
opportunities for local people. Its role will be
to promote the reclamation of derelict land
throughout England and develop it in
partnership with the private, public and
voluntary sectors.
In England government grants are available
to local authorities and to other public bodies,
to the private sector and to nationalised
industries for the reclamation of such land to
bring it into beneficial use or to improve its
appearance. Since 1979 some 18,600 hectares
(46,000 acres) of derelict land in England
have been reclaimed with the help of Derelict
Land Grant. The 1993-94 programme of
£103 million should allow an additional 1,800
hectares (some 4,500 acres) to be reclaimed.
The total amount of derelict land in England
fell by 11 per cent between 1982 and 1988.
In Scotland responsibility for derelict land
reclamation rests with the enterprise bodies
Scottish Enterprise, Highlands and Islands
Enterprise and the Local Enterprise
Companies. They may acquire and reclaim
land either by agreement or compulsorily;
increasingly they seek to work with the
private sector to bring land back into use. In
Wales the Welsh Development Agency may
acquire and reclaim land or make grants to
local authorities for that purpose. Land use
is also encouraged by the Land Authority
for Wales, a statutory body with powers to
make land available for development in
circumstances where the private sector would
find this difficult or impossible. In Northern
Ireland grants may be paid to landowners
who restore or improve derelict sites.
Registers of Unused and Under-used Land
The Department of the Environment is
currently increasing its efforts to promote
the sale and development of vacant and
under-used public sector land. Information
is being assembled on key sites with
development potential, and where there are
no firm plans to market or develop land,
action will be taken to encourage and
promote the sale of sites. Until 1989, the
Secretary of State for the Environment
maintained a central register of unused or
under-used land in the ownership of public
bodies. Since then, the owners have had the
responsibility for maintaining their own
registers. Under the ‘Public Request to
Order Disposal’ scheme, members of the
public are encouraged to request the
Secretary of State to order public bodies to
dispose of such land on the open market.
This process has been simplified by the
Leasehold Reform, Housing and Urban
Development Act 1993, which removed the
need for a site to be entered on the
Secretary of State’s register before a
direction to dispose could be issued.
Registers are also published for certain
areas of Wales.
Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland
Wales
Spending on the Urban Programme in
Wales is some £28.4 million in 1993-94. All
local authorities are eligible to apply.
Spending has been targeted at wards rather
than at whole districts, so that small pockets
of deprivation in otherwise prosperous areas
can benefit. Over a quarter of the total has
been targeted at the ten most deprived
districts in Wales. The Government aims to
remove much of the remaining major
industrial dereliction in Wales by the end of
the 1990s.
The Programme for the Valleys, launched
in 1988, was an extensive programme of
economic and urban regeneration, covering
an area of some 2,200 sq km (860 sq miles)
in the south Wales valleys (see map, p. 325).
The Programme ended in March 1993. In
April 1993 the Secretary of State for Wales
launched a new five-year Programme for
the Valleys.'Tt involves increased levels of
327
BRITAIN 1994: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
factory building, land clearance and Urban
Programme support, and action, among
other things, to:
• create long-term access to employment
through education, training and
transport;
• strengthen local communities;
• improve the environment; and
• improve the quality of housing.
Some £17 million of Urban Programme
support will benefit the Valleys in 1993-94.
The Cardiff Bay Development
Corporation was set up in 1987 to bring
forward redevelopment in an area of south
Cardiff, once its commercial centre. By
April 1993 the Corporation had received
£191 million in government grant.
Government support for the Corporation in
1993-94 will be £45 million. The
Corporation’s regeneration strategy includes
proposals for the construction of a barrage
across Cardiff harbour mouth, which would
create a large freshwater lake and 12 km
(7 miles) of waterside frontage. It is expected
that more than 23,000 new jobs will be
created and that over £1,200 million of
private investment will be attracted.
Scotland
In 1988 the Government set out in the
White Paper New Life for Urban Scotland its
strategy for improving the quality of life for
people living on peripheral estates in
Scotland. Building on the experience
gained from inner city regeneration schemes
such as the Glasgow Eastern Area Renewal,
the main aim of the strategy was to
encourage residents to take more
responsibility for the improvement of their
own communities.
The focus of this effort was the
establishment of four Partnerships in areas
of Dundee, Edinburgh, Glasgow and Paisley.
These are led by The Scottish Office and
involve other bodies and groups, including
Scottish Enterprise (see p. 147), Scottish
Homes (see p. 332), the local authorities, the
private sector and the local communities.
Their objectives include plans to:
• improve the type and tenure mix of
housing available to local people;
• improve employment prospects by
providing increased avenues for training
and further education; and
• tackle social and environmental problems
on the estates.
Other peripheral estates and inner city
areas continue to receive substantial support
through such sources as the Urban
Programme, Scottish Homes and Scottish
Enterprise. The Government is committed
to seeking ways to improve the Partnerships
and to strengthening the Urban Programme
in Scotland by emphasising those projects
which form part of a concerted effort to
assist a deprived area.
The Urban Programme in Scotland has
grown from £44 million in 1988-89 to over
£81 million in 1993—94. In addition to any
new projects approved, these resources
already support about 1,200 existing projects.
Five Safer Cities programmes have been
launched in Scotland, including projects
in Edinburgh, Glasgow and Dundee.
Another is being established in Aberdeen.
Central funding for the programme in
1993-94 is £900,000.
The Local Enterprise Companies (see
p. 143), working under contract to Scottish
Enterprise, have substantial budgets and a
flexible range of powers and functions to
improve the environment and encourage
business and employment in their areas. In
particular, Scottish Enterprise operates a
Local Enterprise Grants for Urban Projects
scheme, which aims to encourage private
sector investment for projects in deprived
areas. The areas of need in which the
scheme operates include the four
Partnership areas, and other areas showing
similar characteristics of deprivation. Local
Enterprise Companies can also support
projects in their areas.
The Compact scheme (see p. 323) has
been introduced in Scotland, with ten
Compacts in operation and four under
consideration. Some 9,000 young people
and 1,000 employers and training
organisations are involved with the
operational Compacts. The Training and
328
URBAN REGENERATION AND HOUSING
Enterprise Grants scheme is designed to
increase access to employment opportunities
for young and long-term unemployed people.
Northern Ireland
A comprehensive development programme
aims to revitalise the commercial areas of
Belfast. In 1993-94 regeneration programmes
had a combined allocation of over
£34 million. Nine Action Teams have been
established to tackle the problems of
particularly deprived areas of the city. The
‘Making Belfast Work’ initiative, launched in
1988, is designed to reinforce the efforts to
alleviate the economic, educational, social and
environmental problems in the most
disadvantaged areas of Belfast. In addition to
extensive funding already allocated to
mainstream departmental programmes,
Making Belfast Work has provided a further
£124 million for the period 1988-89 to
1993-94. The Laganside Corporation was
established in 1989 to regenerate Belfast’s
riverside area. Its government grant in
1993-94 is £5.3 million.
Housing
The pattern of housing tenure has changed
considerably in recent years, with a
substantial increase in owner-occupation and
a decline in private renting.
Administration
The Secretary of State for the Environment
in England and the Secretaries of State for
Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland are
responsible for formulating housing policy
and supervising the housing programme.
Although the policies are broadly similar
throughout Britain, provisions in Northern
Ireland and Scotland differ somewhat from
those in England and Wales.
The construction or structural alteration
of housing is subject to building regulations
laid down by the Government. In addition,
most new houses are covered by warranty
arrangements provided either by the
National House-Building Council or the
Housing Standards Company Ltd. Both
organisations set standards and enforce
them by inspection, and provide cover
against major structural defects for not less
than ten years.
In November 1992 the Government
announced a £750 million housing
market package to take houses off the
market. In England £580 million was
used to enable housing associations to
buy 18,000 new, empty or refurbished
properties for letting to homeless
families. A further £50 million was
used to provide cash incentives to
housing association and local authority
tenants to enable them to buy houses
on the open market and release their
existing accommodation for housing
homeless families.
The promotion of home ownership and
more choice in the rented sector are central
to government housing policy. New house
construction is undertaken by both public
and private sectors, but most dwellings are
now built by the private sector for sale to
owner-occupiers. Housing associations
are becoming the main providers of new
housing in the subsidised rented sector.
Local authorities are being encouraged to
see their housing role as more of an
enabling one, working with housing
associations and the private sector to
increase the supply of low-cost housing
for rent without necessarily providing it
themselves. This allows them to concentrate
their resources on improving the
management of their own stock. In order
to stimulate the private rented sector, which
has declined to less than 8 per cent of the
total stock, rents on new private sector
lettings in Great Britain have been
deregulated.
Leasehold Reform, Housing and Urban
Development Act 1993
The provisions of this Act will introduce:
• a collective right for residential
leaseholders in blocks of flats in England
329
BRITAIN 1994: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
and Wales2 to acquire the freehold of
their block at market prices;
• a right for leaseholders who live in blocks
that do not qualify for freehold purchase
to buy an extended lease;
• a nationwide rents-to-mortgages scheme,
which will enable council tenants to buy
their homes on payment of an initial sum
requiring mortgage payments no greater
than the rent, the remainder not needing
to be paid off until resale;
• a right to improve, under which council
tenants will receive compensation for
certain home improvements which they
undertake;
• a right for tenants’ organisations to
manage estates where they want to take
on that role; and
• compulsory competitive tendering for
local authority housing management.
have the right to buy the homes they occupy.
Local authorities have been asked to
encourage low-cost home ownership in a
variety of ways. Scottish Homes has a
scheme to encourage private developers to
build for owner-occupation or market rents
in areas they would not normally consider.
In 1992-93 the funding available was about
£26 million. In Northern Ireland shared
ownership has been developed by the
Northern Ireland Co-ownership Housing
Association.
The Government also funds cash
schemes. Under these, local authority and
housing association tenants are given grants
to help them purchase housing in the
private sector. The council homes released
by these tenants moving out are then
available to be re-let to homeless families.
Mortgage Loans
Home Ownership
Over the last 40 years the proportion of
people owning their own homes has risen
from 29 per cent to 67 per cent, and the
number of owner-occupied dwellings in
Great Britain amounted to over 15.8 million
at the end of 1992, compared with some 4.1
million in 1950. Most public sector tenants
2
Leasehold is not a common form of residential tenure in
Scotland; consequently the provisions with regard to leasehold
will not apply there.
Most people buy their homes with a
mortgage loan, with the property as security.
Building societies are the largest source of
such loans, although banks and other
financial institutions also take a significant
share of the mortgage market, while some
companies make loans for house purchase
available to their own employees. The
amount that lenders are prepared to
advance to a would-be house purchaser is
generally calculated as a multiple of his or
her annual income, typically up to two-and-a-

half times earnings, and the term of the
loan is commonly 25 years. The two main
forms of mortgage are ‘repayment’ and
‘endowment’ mortgages. In the former, the
borrower repays principal and interest on the
sum outstanding. In the latter, he or she pays
only interest to the lender but also puts
money into an endowment policy, which on
maturity provides a lump sum to repay the
principal. Owner-occupiers get tax relief on
interest payments on mortgages of up to
^30,000 on their main home; from April
1994 this will be assessed at 20 per cent
rather than the basic rate of 25 per cent.
A package of measures to protect
homeowners from unnecessary repossession
owing to arrears was announced by the
Government in December 1991. These
include provision for benefits covering
mortgage interest to be paid directly to
lenders, and agreement with the mortgage
lenders on the introduction of schemes to
help borrowers in difficulty remain in their
homes. Government figures show that
mortgage possession orders in 1992 were 11
per cent down on the 1991 total, and a
higher proportion of the orders that were
made were suspended. Figures from the
Council of Mortgage Lenders show that the
number of properties actually repossessed in
the second half of 1992 was 16 per cent lower
than in the second half of 1991.
Social Housing
Public Sector Housing
Most of the public housing in Great Britain
is provided by 460 local housing authorities.
These are:
• the district councils in England and
Wales, apart from in London;
• the London borough councils and the
Common Council of the City of London;
and
• in Scotland, the district and islands
councils.
Public housing is also provided by the new
town authorities, Scottish Homes (which has
a stock of about 60,000 houses) and the
Development Board for Rural Wales,
although the latter aims to transfer all its
1,200 houses to other social landlords in the
short term. The Northern Ireland Housing
Executive is responsible for the .provision and
management of public housing in Northern
Ireland. Public housing authorities in Great
Britain own some 5 million houses and flats;
the Northern Ireland Housing Executive
owns 160,000 homes. A few local authorities
have transferred all their housing stock to
housing associations, and others are
considering doing so.
Local authorities meet the capital costs of
new house construction and of modernisation
of their existing stock by:
• raising loans on the open market;
• borrowing from the Public Works Loan
Board (an independent statutory body set
up to make loans to local authorities);
• using part of the proceeds from the sale
of local authority houses and other assets;
or
• drawing on their revenue accounts.
Councils must maintain housing revenue
accounts on a ‘ring-fenced’ basis to keep
them separate from other council funds. The
Government provides local authorities in
England and Wales with Housing Revenue
Account Subsidy, worth more than £3,900
million in England alone in 1993-94. Local
authority housing investment programmes in
England will total some £1,920 million in
1993-94. In Scotland, Housing Support
Grant of almost £36 million is available for
1993-94; local authorities have been given
£393 million in capital allocations to build
new homes or improve existing ones. In
Northern Ireland, the Housing Executive’s
capital programme is financed mainly by
borrowing from government and receipts
from house sales. In 1993—94 borrowing will
total £81 million. Revenue expenditure is
financed by rental income and by a
government grant, which in 1993-94 is some
£159 million.
Housing Associations
Housing associations, which are non-profit-
making, are now the main providers of
additional low-cost housing for rent and for
331
BRITAIN 1994: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
sale to those on low incomes and in the
greatest housing need. Many associations
specialise in providing accommodation to
meet the special needs of the elderly,
disabled people and the mentally ill. The
housing association sector is expanding
rapidly; associations own, manage and
maintain over 600,000 homes and some
55,000 hostel bed-spaces in England alone,
providing homes for well over 1 million
people; over 60,000 new homes for rent or
shared ownership were provided in 1992-93.
People in housing need with insufficient
income to obtain a mortgage for outright
purchase may be able to buy a share in a
house which a housing association has
developed, or which they themselves have
chosen on the open market. They pay rent
on the share retained by the association and
may purchase it later if they wish.
In Great Britain housing schemes carried
out by associations qualify for Housing
Association Grant if the association concerned
is one of about 2,800 registered with the
Housing Corporation (in England), Scottish
Homes or Housing for Wales. These three
organisations are statutory bodies which
supervise and pay grant to housing
associations in their respective parts of Great
Britain. Broadly similar assistance is available
to associations in Northern Ireland.
The Government has increased the
resources distributed to housing associations
through the Housing Corporation’s capital
programme from £ 1,062 million in 1990-91
to ^1,280 million in 1993-94. The
Government also aims to increase the
amount of private finance being used by
housing associations, allowing more homes
to be built with the available public
resources than would otherwise be the case. It
is anticipated that around 170,000 homes will
be provided over the three years 1992-93 to
1994—95.
In 1993-94 Scottish Homes’ total
programme expenditure is expected to be
about £372 million, of which about £260
million will go to housing associations.
Housing for Wales is managing a
programme of £197 million in 1993-94,
with a target of providing 4,000 new homes.
On current plans, government provision to
the housing association movement in Wales
will be over £500 million between 1991-92
and 1994—95. Northern Ireland’s registered
housing associations started 1,000 units of
accommodation in 1992-93, and now have a
stock of 12,300 units for rent. They have a
1993-94 budget of £36 million, with a
target to start 850 new units of rented
accommodation. Government plans provide
for total funding of some £195 million over
the period 1992-93 to 1995-96.
In England and Wales the rights of
housing association tenants are protected
under Tenants’ Guarantees, which are
issued by the Housing Corporation and
Housing for Wales. They cover matters
such as tenancy terms, principles for
determining rent levels and the allocation of
tenancies. Under these guarantees, tenants
receive contractual rights in addition to
their basic statutory rights, and associations
are required to set and maintain rents at
levels affordable by those in low-paid
employment. In Scotland, similar non-
statutory guidance, in the form of a model
tenancy agreement, has been implemented
as proposed jointly by Scottish Homes and
the Scottish Federation of Housing
Associations.
Tenants ’ Rights
Legislation gives public sector tenants in
England and Wales statutory rights,
including security of tenure. Under the
Tenants’ Choice provisions, public sector
tenants have the right to change their
landlord where they are not satisfied with
the service provided by their local
authority. With a few exceptions, secure
tenants with at least two years’ public sector
standing are entitled to buy their house or
flat at a discount which depends on the
length of tenancy (the ‘right to buy’).
Similar provisions are made for Scotland
and Northern Ireland. Some 1.8 million
council, housing association and new town
homes were sold in Great Britain between
April 1979 and the end of 1991.
Government support is focused on tenants
rather than on property through the housing
benefit system. Depending on their personal
332
URBAN REGENERATION AND HOUSING
circumstances, occupiers may qualify for
housing benefit to help them pay their rent
(see p. 396).
The Government launched a new
Tenant’s Charter in England in
January 1992 as part of its Citizen’s
Charter initiative. Many of the new
rights for council tenants which it
promised are being introduced in the
Leasehold Reform, Housing and
Urban Development Act, such as the
right to receive recompense for
improvements that the tenant makes
to the property. New Tenant’s
Charters for Scotland, Wales and
Northern Ireland have also been
launched.
Housing for the Elderly
Sheltered housing, which comprises
accommodation with an alarm system and the
services of a resident warden, may be
provided for elderly people who need
support. Increasing emphasis is being placed
on schemes to help elderly people to continue
to live in their own homes, such as
adaptations to existing housing to meet their
needs. Home improvement agencies help the
elderly, people with disabilities and those on
low incomes to carry out repairs and
improvements to their properties; a
permanent government grant regime was
introduced in 1991 to support this work.
Over £4 million of government help will go
to home improvement agencies in 1993-94 in
England alone, which will enable the number
of agencies supported to be increased to 122,
seven more than in the previous year.
Rural Housing
Social changes have put pressure on rural
housing in many areas. Where there is a need
for low-cost housing in rural areas, therefore,
the Government has announced that sites
which would not normally be released for
housing development can exceptionally be
used, provided arrangements are made to
reserve the housing for local needs. The
Housing Corporation has also funded a
special rural programme to build houses in
small villages: between 1989-90 and 1992-93
it approved the building of around 5,500 such
homes.
Similar arrangements were introduced in
Wales in 1991. Housing for Wales has a
major role, alongside local authorities, in
rural housing provision in Wales. In
Scotland, considerable progress is being
made through the range of initiatives
launched in 1990 as part of the Scottish
Homes Rural Strategy. In Northern Ireland,
the Housing Executive operates a rural
strategy which directs special action both in
its primary responsibility for public housing
and also on the house renovation grant
scheme for private housing, which it
administers. A new housing association was
registered there in 1992 to tackle housing
need in rural areas.
Privately Rented Housing
There has been a steady decline in the
number of rented dwellings available from
private landlords, from over 50 per cent of
the housing stock in 1950 to 7 per cent in
Great Britain in 1990.
The Government’s policy is to increase
the availability of privately rented
accommodation by removing disincentives to
letting. To accomplish this, from January
1989, new private sector lettings were
deregulated, and two new forms of tenancy
were introduced:
• the assured tenancy, which gives the
tenant long-term security in return for a
freely negotiated market rent; and
• the assured shorthold tenancy (short
assured tenancy in Scotland), which is
for a fixed term, again at a free market
rent.
Existing lettings are unaffected; they
continue on the old basis. Also, the law
concerning harassment of tenants was
strengthened. Tenants and most other
residential occupiers may not be evicted
without a court order. A ‘Rent a Room’
scheme encourages homeowners to let
333
BRITAIN 1994: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
rooms to lodgers without having to pay tax
on the rent they receive; rents of up to
about £62 a week are now tax-free.
In Northern Ireland only certain pre-
1956 properties subject to rent restriction
come under statutory control. Rent levels
are linked to those of the Northern Ireland
Housing Executive, and both landlords and
tenants may apply to a rent assessment
committee for rent determination in cases
where the current rent is considered to be
inappropriate. Rent increases are allowed only
for properties which meet a prescribed
standard. The only assured tenancies in
Northern Ireland are those on properties
made available under a business expansion
scheme; shorthold tenancies are available.
Homelessness
Under the homelessness legislation, local
authorities have a duty to secure permanent
accommodation for households which they
accept as unintentionally homeless and in
priority need. The latter category includes
pregnant women, people with dependent
children, and those who are vulnerable
because of old age, mental or physical
handicap or other special reasons.
A three-year government programme of
measures to tackle the problem of people
sleeping rough in central London has
provided about 950 new places in short¬
term hostels and about 2,200 permanent
and 700 leased places in accommodation
for hostel dwellers to move on into. Some
£86 million is being made available to
continue the initiative until 1996. A further
£20 million is being spent in the period to
1994-95 specifically to help mentally-ill
people who are sleeping rough.
An audit of the main sites in London
where people sleep rough, carried out by
voluntary organisations in November 1992,
found some 420 people sleeping rough,
down from 1,000 or more at the beginning of
the Rough Sleepers Initiative in 1990.
Improving Existing Housing
In urban areas of Britain slum clearance and
redevelopment used to be major features of
housing policy, but there has been a trend in
recent years towards the retention of existing
communities, accompanied by the
modernisation and conversion of sub-standard
homes. Housing conditions have improved
considerably, but problems remain in some
areas where there are concentrations of
dwellings lacking basic amenities or requiring
substantial repairs, and there are still some
pockets of unfit housing for which demolition
is the best solution. The emphasis now is on
area renewal, with an integrated approach to
renewal and renovation.
In Scotland, Scottish Homes has been
given a major role in tackling housing-related
urban dereliction and providing rural housing
opportunities, in co-operation with local
communities, the private sector, local
authorities and other statutory agencies.
Some groups of tenants are joining together
to form community-based housing
associations and tenant ownership co¬
operatives.
The Government is committed to
introducing a pilot homesteading scheme
under which local authorities would be
encouraged to offer those in housing need the
chance to restore suitable council properties
in exchange for a reduced rent or the
opportunity to buy at a reduced price.
Estate Action Programme
The Estate Action programme provides local
authorities in England with additional
resources to regenerate their run-down
housing estates. Funds are provided to enable
authorities to carry out an agreed package of
measures on an estate, including physical
refurbishment and improved management.
Since the Estate Action programme began in
1985, more than £1,250 million has been
allocated to or earmarked for over 1,000
schemes. In 1993-94 some £356 million is
available for 225 continuing schemes and up
to 167 new schemes. As a result of the
Housing Partnership initiative (see p. 322), it
has been possible to increase the number of
new schemes in the 1993-94 programme by
almost 20 per cent.
In Wales, local authorities can bid for
Estate Partnership funding to tackle the
334
URBAN REGENERATION AND HOUSING
problems of selected estates; some
£13.3 million of central and local government
money and private sector funding has been
allocated for 1993—94. This programme,
which is distinct from the English scheme of
the same name, parallels Estate Action in
England but is designed to address the
different problems typical of Welsh council
estates.
Housing Action Trusts
Housing Action Trusts (HATs) can be
established in England to focus resources on
some of the most run-down areas of
predominantly local authority housing. The
Government can designate a HAT for a
particular area or estate, subject to a tenants’
vote. If the majority of tenants who vote
support the proposal, the HAT would be
established by parliamentary order. It takes
over responsibility for the housing in its
designated area in order to renovate it,
improve the housing management, the
environment and living and social conditions,
and stimulate local enterprise. The tenants
participate fully in the work of a HAT. On
completion of its work, the Trust is wound
up and its property transferred to other
owners and managers, such as housing
associations or tenants’ co-operatives, or back
to the local authority. Tenants are consulted
on their future landlords. Tenants as well as
local authorities may apply for the
establishment of a HAT. By April 1993 three
HATs had been established, with two more
expected to be established, having secured
ballot approval, and other proposals were
under consideration.
House Renovation Grants
Nearly 1.3 million home improvement grants,
worth almost £4,487 million, were paid in
respect of privately owned dwellings in
England alone between 1983 and 1992. In
England and Wales, local authorities give
mandatory renovation grants to enable unfit
dwellings to be brought up to a revised
fitness standard, with discretionary grants
available for a wider range of works. Grants
of up to 100 per cent may be available,
subject to a test of the applicant’s resources.
Grants are also available in certain
circumstances for the provision of facilities
for disabled people and for the repair of
houses in multiple occupation and of the
common parts of blocks of flats. Minor
works assistance is also available to help
people in receipt of income-related benefits,
particularly the elderly, with small-scale
works.
In Scotland, local authorities give grants
for improvement and repair. Scottish Homes
also has the power to provide grants to
complement the role of local authorities in
private house renewal.
In Northern Ireland, grants are provided
on a similar basis to that in England and
Wales through the House Renovation Grants
scheme, administered by the Northern
Ireland Housing Executive. In isolated rural
areas, a grant to replace dwellings which
cannot be restored is also available through
this scheme.
Renewal Areas
Renewal areas in England and Wales are
intended to provide a sharper focus to area
action, covering both renovation and
selective redevelopment and taking account
of a range of issues wider than just housing.
Authorities are free to declare renewal areas
without the specific consent of the
Secretaries of State for the Environment
and for Wales, provided they fulfil certain
criteria. Authorities have additional powers
to buy land in renewal areas and to carry
out improvement works for which additional
government support is available.
In Scotland housing action area powers
are available for the improvement of areas in
which at least half the houses fail to meet a
statutory tolerable standard. Since 1975,
1,844 housing action areas have been
declared. Outside such areas in Scotland
local authorities have powers to apply
improvement orders to houses below the
statutory tolerable standard or lacking
certain basic amenities. Local authorities
may also give grants towards improving the
environment of mainly residential areas.
Considerable progress has been made in
335
BRITAIN 1994: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
improving housing conditions in Northern
Ireland. Some 97 per cent of its dwellings
have all amenities, 91 per cent are classified
as fit and 89 per cent are in a good state of
repair. Urban renewal has been promoted
through redevelopment and housing action
area activity. Since 1977, 53 housing action
areas have been declared.

Britain seeks to balance the demands for land from business, housing,
transport, farming and leisure, and to protect the environment by means of a
statutory system of land-use planning and development control. Government
agencies and voluntary bodies work to conserve Britain’s natural heritage and
historic monuments. Britain is committed to a number of international
treaties and obligations on conservation.
Planning
Direct responsibility for land-use planning1 in
Great Britain lies with local authorities. The
Secretaries of State for the Environment,
Wales and Scotland have overall
responsibility for the operation of the system.
The Department of the Environment brings
together the major responsibilities in England
for land-use planning, housing and
construction, countryside policy and
environmental protection. The Welsh Office
and The Scottish Office have broadly
equivalent responsibilities. In Northern
Ireland the Department of the Environment
for Northern Ireland is responsible for
planning matters through six divisional
planning offices, which work closely with the
district councils.
In Great Britain these departments
provide national and regional guidance on
planning matters, while strategic planning at
For further details see Planning (Aspects of Britain: HMSO,
1992).
the county level is the responsibility of the
county councils. District councils are
responsible for local plans and development
control. In the metropolitan areas and
London, the borough and district councils are
preparing new unitary development plans for
each administrative area. In Scotland the
planning context is set by The Scottish
Office and planning functions are undertaken
by regional and district councils, whose
responsibilities are divided on a basis broadly
similar to that in England and Wales. In the
more rural regions and the islands, the
regional and islands councils respectively have
responsibility for planning.
Development Plans
The present development plan system in
England and Wales involves structure, local
and unitary development plans:
• structure plans, setting out broad policies
for the development and use of land, are
adopted by county councils, which also
adopt minerals and wastes local plans;
337
BRITAIN 1994: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
• local plans, prepared in general
conformity with the adopted structure
plan, and providing detailed guidance for
development expected to start within
about ten years, are adopted by district
councils; and
• unitary development plans, setting out
both strategic and detailed land use and
development policies, are adopted by
metropolitan districts or London
boroughs.
Members of the public have an
opportunity to express their views on the
planning of their area during the early stages
of plan preparation.
In Scotland structure plans are prepared
by regional or islands authorities, and local
plans by those districts with planning
responsibilities, and by general planning and
islands authorities. Under Northern Ireland’s
single-tier system, plans are prepared by the
Department of the Environment for Northern
Ireland.
The Planning and Compensation Act 1991
introduced improvements in the efficiency
and effectiveness of the planning system.
Decisions on planning applications and
appeals are to be made in accordance with the
relevant development plan unless material
considerations indicate otherwise. The
majority of local planning authorities are
aiming to complete and adopt plans covering
the whole of their areas by the end of 1996.
When formulating their plans, planning
authorities must take account of any strategic
or regional guidance issued by the Secretary
of State as planning policy guidance notes
and regional policy guidance notes. The
Government’s aim is for full use to be made
of urban land for new development, having
regard to the need to retain green spaces
within the urban environment and the need
to ensure that the cumulative effects of
development do not harm the character of
established residential areas.
Green Belts
‘Green Belts’ are areas intended to be left
open and free from inappropriate
development. Their purposes are to:
• restrict the sprawl of large built-up areas;
• safeguard the surrounding countryside;
• prevent neighbouring towns merging;
• preserve the special character of historic
towns; and
• assist in urban regeneration.
They also have a recreational role. Green
Belts have been established around major
cities, including London, Edinburgh,
Glasgow, Merseyside, Greater Manchester
and the West Midlands, as well as several
smaller towns. Some 1.5 million hectares (3.8
million acres) are designated as Green Belt in
England and 200,000 hectares (500,000 acres)
in Scotland. The Government attaches great
importance to the protection of Green Belts
and expects local planning authorities to do
likewise when considering planning
applications.
Development Control
Certain minor developments do not need
specific planning permission. However, most
development does require this. Applications
are dealt with in the light of development
plans and other material planning
considerations, including national and
regional guidance. In 1992 some 473,000
applications for planning permission were
received in England alone; in total, 369,000
applications were granted in this period.
Local planning authorities in England and
Wales are required to publicise planning
applications locally. Methods commonly used
include site notices, newspaper advertising
and neighbour notification. In Scotland a
neighbour notification system requires the
applicant to notify the owners and occupiers
of land and buildings adjoining the site of a
proposed development when the application
is submitted to the local planning authority.
The applicant has a right of appeal to the
Secretary of State if the local authority
refuses planning permission, grants it with
conditions attached, or fails to decide an
application within an agreed period (usually
eight weeks). The great majority of appeals
are decided on the basis of written
submissions. However, either party has
the right to be heard by an inspector at a
public local inquiry or, where a less formal
338
PLANNING AND CONSERVATION
arrangement is appropriate, at a hearing.
A local inquiry is usually held for more
complicated or controversial applications.
Similar provision is made in Northern Ireland
for the hearing of representations at public
inquiries. For planning applications which do
not give rise to public inquiries, the applicant
has a right of appeal to the independent
Planning Appeals Commission.
The Secretaries of State can direct that a
planning application be referred to them for
decision. This power to ‘call in’ is generally
exercised only for proposals which raise
planning issues of national or regional
importance. The applicant and the local
planning authority have the right to be heard
by a person appointed by the Secretary of
State, and a public inquiry will normally be
held. In Northern Ireland, major planning
applications are dealt with under the Planning
(NI) Order 1991, which allows for a public
inquiry in certain circumstances.
Environmental Impact Assessment
Planning applications for certain types of
development must be accompanied by an
environmental impact assessment. This
should describe the likely significant
environmental effects and measures proposed
to minimise adverse consequences. These
statements are made available to the public
and to statutory bodies such as the
Countryside Commission and English Nature
(see p. 343). The planning authority must
take into consideration the environmental
statement, and any representations received
on it, before granting planning permission.
Architectural Standards
High standards in new building are welcomed
by the Government, although it encourages
local planning authorities not to impose their
architectural tastes on developers. The
Department of the Environment, in
collaboration with the independent Royal
Institute of British Architects (RIBA) and the
National House-Building Council, sponsors
the biennial Housing Design Awards Scheme
for England and Northern Ireland, with
categories for renovation and new building.
Scotland and Wales have similar award
schemes. Royal Fine Art Commissions for
England and Wales and for Scotland advise
government departments, planning authorities
and other public bodies on questions of
public amenity or artistic importance. An Art
for Architecture scheme, funded by the
Department of National Heritage, is receiving
£100,000 in 1993-94 to enable artists and
craftspeople to be involved in the design of
buildings from the planning stage.
The RIBA, the principal professional body
for architects, together with the Architects
Registration Council of the United Kingdom,
exercises control over standards in
architectural education and encourages high
architectural standards in the profession. The
Royal Incorporation of Architects in Scotland
is allied to it, as is the Royal Society of
Ulster Architects. Following a review of the
arrangements for the registration of
architects, the Government proposes to move
to a system of self-regulation through the
chartered professional institutions.
A major RIBA study of the architectural
profession is being undertaken with
government support of £20,000. The
strategic study will lay the foundations of a
new strategy for architects to meet the major
changes taking place in the industry. Many
ideas have already been generated.
Conservation
Britain has for many years had policies and
laws designed to protect both its natural
environment and built heritage. For example,
the first Act of Parliament to protect old
buildings, the Ancient Monuments Protection
Act, was passed as long ago as 1882. A wide
variety of designations are used to protect
areas, sites and monuments that are of special
interest to conservationists, and various
organisations work towards the conservation
of differing aspects of Britain’s national
heritage. Many of these groups have very
large memberships.
Britain is also involved in international
conservation efforts and has signed important
agreements with other countries to protect
wildlife, habitats and heritage sites. Britain
339
BRITAIN 1994: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
participated fully in the United Nations
Conference on Environment and
Development (UNCED), popularly known as
the ‘Earth Summit’, held in Rio de Janeiro in
June 1992, and is committed to carrying the
process forward. Among the agreements
reached was a framework convention on
climate change (see p. 356), a convention on
biodiversity, ‘Agenda 21’ (an action
framework for the 21st century), a declaration
setting out clear principles for sustainable
development, and a declaration for the
management of forests. Britain played an
active role in the first meeting of the United
Nations Commission on Sustainable
Development in June 1993 and will
participate in its work.
Administrative Arrangements
The Department of the Environment is
responsible for countryside policy and
environmental protection in England; the
Department of National Heritage has
responsibility for the listing of buildings and
for scheduled ancient monuments. The
Welsh Office, The Scottish Office
Environment Department and the
Department of the Environment for Northern
Ireland have broadly equivalent
responsibilities. Agencies such as English
Nature, English Heritage, the Countryside
Commission and their equivalents carry out
many functions on behalf of the Government.
The present arrangements for the nature
conservation and countryside agencies were
largely established by the Environmental
Protection Act 1990, the most recent piece of
major environmental legislation, and, in
Scotland, by the Natural Heritage (Scotland)
Act 1991. In addition, the local authorities
and a wide range of voluntary organisations
are actively involved in environmental
conservation and protection.
This Common Inheritance
The environment White Paper This Common
Inheritance, published in September 1990,
was the first comprehensive statement by the
Government of its policy on issues affecting
the environment. It summarised more than
350 proposals for tackling such diverse issues
as global warming, pollution control, the
regulation of land use and planning, the rural
economy, the countryside and wildlife. Two
anniversary progress reports have been
published, which reviewed progress and set
out commitments to many further actions to
protect the environment. The Government has
established an Environmental Action Fund
(see p. 348) which is, among other things,
helping voluntary groups in England take
forward the initiatives in the White Paper.
The Government intends to establish a
Millennium Fund, subject to parliamentary
approval. This would be supported by the
proceeds of the proposed National Lottery
(see p. 482). Among the things which the
Millennium Fund could support are:
• the restoration of the buildings that
symbolise and enrich British life;
• help for local communities and voluntary
groups to run their own Millennium
projects for local restoration schemes; and
• Millennium bursaries for young or newlv
retired people offering their time to
schemes designed to change the face of
Britain by the year 2000.
Built Heritage
Lists of buildings of special architectural or
historical interest are compiled by the
Government, in England with the advice of
English Heritage. It is against the law to
demolish, extend or alter the character of any
‘listed’ building without special consent from
the local planning authority or the appropriate
Secretary of State. The local planning
authority can issue temporary ‘building
preservation notices’ to protect unlisted
buildings that are in danger while
consideration is given to listing. In Northern
Ireland the Department of the Environment
for Northern Ireland is directly responsible for
the listing of buildings.
Ancient monuments are similarly protected
through a system of scheduling. English
Heritage, the government agency responsible
for the conservation of historic remains in
England, has embarked upon a programme to
evaluate all known archaeological remains in
340
PLANNING AND CONSERVATION
England. This is expected to result in a
significant increase in the number of
scheduled monuments.

Many of the royal palaces and parks are
open to the public; their maintenance is the
responsibility of the Secretaries of State for
National Heritage and for Scotland. English
Heritage manages some 400 properties on
behalf of the Secretary of State for National
Heritage, advises him on applications for
consent to alter or demolish scheduled
monuments and listed buildings, and gives
grants for the repair of ancient monuments,
historic buildings and buildings in
conservation areas in England. Most of its
monuments are open to the public.
Government funding for English Heritage is
£100 million in 1993-94.
English Heritage announced proposals
for the future management of its
historic properties in October 1992.
This is an extension of an existing
policy to encourage local management
of some less complex sites by suitable
local organisations where there
is enthusiasm and expertise.
Management agreements are proposed
to protect individual monuments and
monitor public access.
The environment White Paper also
announced that the Government had invited
English Heritage to prepare a register of
historic landscapes and battlefields. Progress
on these registers is now well under way. The
registers, like the existing register of historic
parks and gardens, will be without direct legal
effect, but will alert the Government, local
planning authorities and others to the
significance of these sites when considering
development plans and applications for
planning permission.
In Scotland and Wales similar functions
are performed by Historic Scotland, which
cares for 330 monuments, and by Cadw:
Welsh Historic Monuments, which manages
127, with advice from an Ancient
Monuments Board for each country. Historic
Scotland and Cadw are executive agencies
within The Scottish Office and the Welsh
Office respectively. The Department of the
Environment for Northern Ireland has 173
historic monuments in its care, and is advised
by a Historic Buildings Council and a
Historic Monuments Council.
The National Heritage Memorial Fund
helps towards the cost of acquiring,
maintaining or preserving land, buildings,
works of art and other items of outstanding
interest which are also of importance to the
national heritage. In 1992-93 the Fund
assisted in the preservation of 81 heritage
items.
Local planning authorities have designated
7,800 ‘conservation areas’ of special
architectural or historic interest in England;
there are over 350 in Wales, 556 in Scotland
and 40 in Northern Ireland. These areas
receive special protection through the
planning system. Grants and loans are
available from the appropriate historic
buildings and monuments body for works
which make a significant contribution towards
the preservation or improvement of a
conservation area.
Industrial, Transport and Maritime
Heritage
Britain was the first country in the world to
industrialise on a large scale, and many
advances in manufacturing and transport
were pioneered in Britain. This has resulted
in a large industrial heritage, the importance
of which is being increasingly recognised.
Important sites are scheduled or listed; one of
the most important, the Ironbridge Gorge,
where Abraham Darby (1677-1717) first
smelted iron using coke, has been designated
a World Heritage Site (see p. 348). Other
341
BRITAIN 1994: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
museums have also been set up, devoted to
the preservation of industrial buildings and
equipment.
Britain, which pioneered railways, has a
fine heritage of railway buildings and
structures, and there is an active movement to
preserve it. Volunteers are very active in this.
A large number of disused railway lines have
been bought by railway preservation societies
and returned to operation, often using
preserved steam locomotives, and several
railway museums have been established.
Important reminders of Britain’s maritime
past are also preserved. The historic naval
dockyard at Chatham has been opened to the
public; at Portsmouth HMS Victory, Nelson’s
flagship, HMS Warrior, the world’s first iron
battleship, and the remains of Mary Rose,
raised from the seabed in 1982, are open to
the public. The Imperial War Museum has
preserved the cruiser HMS Belfast, which is
open to the public in the Pool of London.
Isambard Kingdom Brunei’s SS Great
Britain, the world’s first large screw-driven
ship, is preserved in Bristol. A voluntary
body, the Maritime Trust, has been
established to preserve vessels and other
maritime items of historic or technical
interest. The Trust’s vessels include the
clipper Cutty Sark at Greenwich.
Voluntary Sector
The Government supports the work of the
national amenity societies and others in the
protection of Britain’s heritage. In England
the Department of National Heritage has
offered to make grants totalling £422,000 to
23 such organisations in 1993-94.
Among the organisations which campaign
for the preservation and appreciation of
buildings are:
• the Society for the Protection of Ancient
Buildings;
• the Ancient Monuments Society;
• the Georgian Group;
• the Architectural Heritage Society of
Scotland;
• the Ulster Architectural Heritage Society;
• the Victorian Society; and
• the Council for British Archaeology.
While funded largely by private donations,
the amenity societies have paid professional
staff and statutory responsibilities, in
recognition of which they receive government
support.
The National Trust (for Places of Historic
Interest or Natural Beauty), a charity with
over 2 million members, owns and protects
229 historic houses open to the public, in
addition to over 230,000 hectares (568,000
acres) of land in England, Wales and
Northern Ireland. Scotland has its own
National Trust. The Civic Trust makes
awards for development and restoration work
which enhances its surroundings. It
undertakes urban regeneration projects and
acts as an ‘umbrella’ organisation for nearly
1,000 local amenity societies. There are
associate trusts in Scotland, Wales and north¬
east England.
The Countryside and Nature
Conservation
Four government agencies are responsible for
countryside policy and nature conservation in
Great Britain:
• the Countryside Commission and English
Nature, which act in England;
• the Countryside Council for Wales
(CCW); and
• Scottish Natural Heritage (SNH).
A Joint Nature Conservation Committee
(JNCC) has also been established as the
mechanism through which the three nature
conservation agencies in England, Wales and
Scotland fulfil their responsibilities for
international and Great Britain-wide nature
conservation matters. The JNCC also
undertakes research and sets standards for
data, monitoring and other matters. It
includes representatives from Northern
Ireland and independent members, and has a
supporting specialist staff.
The countryside agencies are
complemented by the rural development
agencies, the objective of which is to
encourage diversification of rural enterprise
and thereby ensure a prosperous countryside.
In England the Rural Development
Commission is responsible for the
342
PLANNING AND CONSERVATION
diversification of the rural economy. It gives
assistance for converting redundant buildings
into workspaces, which create job
opportunities while avoiding the need for new
building. It has also taken part in measures to
promote ‘green’ tourism.
Countryside Agencies
The countryside agencies are responsible for
enhancing the natural beauty and amenity of
the countryside and encouraging the
provision of facilities for open-air recreation
as well as providing for the needs of those
who live and work in the countryside.
Activities aided by these bodies include the
provision by local authorities (sometimes in
association with other bodies) and private
individuals of country parks and picnic sites,
often within easy reach of towns; the
provision or improvement of recreational
paths; and the encouragement of amenity
tree-planting schemes. Total funding in
1993-94 is over £40 million for the
Countryside Commission, £19 million for the
CCW and over £36 million for SNH. The
countryside agencies undertake research
projects and experimental schemes, often
working in consultation with local authorities
and voluntary organisations. They give
financial assistance to public, private and
voluntary organisations, and individuals
carrying out countryside conservation,
recreation and amenity projects.
The Countryside Commission runs the
Countryside Stewardship scheme, launched in
1991, which offers incentives to farmers and
other land managers to enhance or restore
valuable landscapes and habitats and improve
access to, and enjoyment of, the countryside.
In 1991, 900 agreements were made covering
30,000 hectares (74,000 acres). For the second
year a further 1,300 agreements, covering
31,000 hectares (77,000 acres), were reached.
In Wales an equivalent scheme is being run
on a pilot basis by the CCW. Called Tir
Cymen, it adopts a slightly different approach
in that it applies to entire farms. Under
government proposals announced in August
1993, the Countryside Stewardship scheme is
to become part of Britain’s package of
agricultural environment measures. Part of
the reform of the Common Agricultural
Policy (see p. 235), the package has been sent
to the European Commission for approval.
The Government launched Rural
Action, a joint scheme of English
Nature, the Countryside Commission
and the Rural Development
Commission, in December 1992. The
scheme, worth £3.2 million over the
first three years, is designed to help
communities in rural areas carry
forward their own ideas on caring for
and improving the environment.
4 he Countryside Commission recognises
over 210 country parks and over 230 picnic
sites in England. A further 24 country parks
and about 30 picnic sites in Wales are
recognised by the CCW. In Scotland there
are 36 country parks, and many local
authority and private sector schemes for a
variety of countryside facilities have been
approved for grant aid by SNH.
Nature Conservation Agencies
English Nature, the CCW and SNH are
responsible for nature conservation in their
areas. This includes:
• establishing and managing nature
reserves;
• advising the Government;
• identifying and notifying Sites of Special
Scientific Interest (SSSIs);
• providing general information and advice;
• giving grants; and
• supporting and conducting research.
English Nature’s funding for 1993-94 is
almost £38 million.
There are 245 national nature reserves
covering some 168,000 hectares (415,000
acres) and two marine nature reserves,
surrounding the islands of Lundy, off the
Devon coast, and Skomer, off the coast of
Dyfed. Some 5,650 SSSIs have been notified
in Great Britain for their plant, animal,
geological or physiographical features. Local
authorities have declared about 280 local
nature reserves in England alone.
343
BRITAIN 1994: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
County nature conservation trusts, urban
wildlife trusts and the Royal Society for the
Protection of Birds (RSPB) play an important
part in protecting wildlife, having established
between them some 1,800 reserves. The county
and urban trusts are affiliated to a parent
organisation, the Royal Society for Nature
Conservation. The RSPB is the largest
voluntary wildlife conservation body in Europe.
In Northern Ireland both nature and
countryside conservation are the responsibility
of the Department of the Environment for
Northern Ireland through its Environment
Service. In 1993-94 total funding for the
Environment Service is some £19.7 million,
including £6.9 million for pollution control
measures. The Council for Nature
Conservation and the Countryside advises the
Department on nature conservation matters,
including the establishment and management of
land and marine nature reserves and the
declaration of Areas of Special Scientific
Interest. Some 44 national nature reserves have
been established and 40 Areas of Special
Scientific Interest declared.
Wildlife Protection
Wildlife in Great Britain is protected
principally by the Wildlife and Countryside
Act 1981. This has:
• extended the list of protected species;
• restricted the introduction into the
countryside of animals not normally found
in the wild in Britain; and
• afforded greater protection for SSSIs and
introduced provision for marine nature
reserves.
There is also provision for reviews of the
list of protected species to be conducted by the
three official nature conservation agencies,
acting jointly through the JNCC, every five
years and submitted to the Secretary of State
for the Environment. In Northern Ireland
separate legislation on species and habitat
protection is in line with the rest of Britain.
Species Recovery and Reintroduction
Considerable research and management is
carried out to encourage the recovery of
populations of species threatened with
extinction. The three nature conservation
agencies have also set up recovery
programmes for threatened species of plants
and animals, such as the dormouse, the
Plymouth pear and the fen raft spider. The
aim is to ensure the survival of self-sustaining
populations of these species in the wild.
In areas where species have become
extinct, schemes can be devised to
reintroduce them into areas which they
used to inhabit. For example, the red kite
had died out in England and Scotland,
although it was still found in Wales and
mainland Europe. An international project
was therefore co-ordinated by the JNCC and
the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds
to bring adult birds from Sweden and Spain
and release them into the wild in areas which
the species no longer inhabited. Other species
that have been reintroduced in recent years
include the white-tailed sea eagle and the
Large Blue butterfly. The Royal Botanic
Gardens at Kew holds some 3,000 plant
specimens which are extinct or under severe
threat in the wild, and has had some success
with reintroduction projects.
Reliable information on the numbers and
distribution of species is important in
planning conservation strategies. Much
research work is therefore done by
conservation organisations to record and
monitor animal populations. There are both
national and local recording schemes, the
latter usually collecting information on a
county basis. Table 23.2 shows statistically
significant changes in the populations of
British bird species identified in recent
research.
Tree Preservation and Planting
Tree preservation orders enable local
authorities to protect trees and woodlands in
the interests of amenity. Once a tree is
protected, it is in general an offence to cut
down, reshape or generally wilfully destroy it
without permission. The courts can impose
substantial fines for breaches of such orders.
Where protected trees are felled in
contravention of an order or are removed
because they are dying, dead or dangerous, a

replacement tree must be planted. Local
authorities have powers to enforce this.
Tree planting is encouraged through
various grant schemes. The planting of
broadleaved trees has increased tenfold since
1985. Major new initiatives include a project
to create a new national forest in the
Midlands and 12 community forests near
large towns and cities. These are aimed at
enhancing the environment and providing
new opportunities for leisure and recreation.
In Scotland substantial areas of woodland are
being planted between Edinburgh and
Glasgow under the Central Scotland
Woodland Initiative.
Hedgerows
In July 1992 the Government launched a
hedgerow incentive scheme in England.
Administered by the Countryside
Commission, it provides grants for managing
hedgerows in environmentally sensitive ways.
The scheme has provision for payments of
£4.3 million over the period 1993-94 to
1995-1996. The CCW launched a hedgerow
renovation scheme in December 1992.
The Coast
Local planning authorities along the coastline
are responsible for planning land use at the
coast; they also attempt to safeguard and
enhance the coast’s natural attractions and
preserve areas of scientific interest. The
protection of the coastline against erosion and
flooding is administered centrally by the
Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food,
the Welsh Office and The Scottish Office.
Operational responsibility lies with local
authorities and the National Rivers Authority
(see p. 227). Certain stretches of undeveloped
coast of particular scenic beauty in England
and Wales are designated as heritage coast;
jointly with local authorities, the countryside
agencies have defined 45 coasts, protecting
1,525 km (948 miles). There are 29 marine
consultation areas in Scotland. Statutory
bodies taking decisions that affect these areas
will be asked to consult SNH.
The National Trust, through its
Enterprise Neptune campaign, raises funds to
acquire stretches of coastline of great natural
beauty and recreational value. Some £18
million has been raised so far and the Trust
now protects 861 km (535 miles) of coastline
in England, Wales and Northern Ireland. The
National Trust for Scotland also owns large
parts of the Scottish coastline and protects
others through conservation agreements.
National Parks, Areas of Outstanding
Natural Beauty and National Scenic Areas
The Countryside Commission and the CCW
can designate National Parks and areas of
outstanding natural beauty (AONBs), subject
to confirmation by the Secretaries of State for
the Environment and for Wales respectively.
Ten National Parks have been established
in England and Wales. Their aim is first to
provide protection for the outstanding
countryside they contain and secondly to
provide opportunities for access and outdoor
recreation. They are ‘national’ in the sense
that they are of value to the nation as a
whole. However, most of the land remains in
private hands. Special National Park
authorities have been set up, one for each
park. Among other things, they:
• act as the development control authority
for their areas;
345
BRITAIN 1994: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
• negotiate public access and land
management agreements and encourage
farmers to manage their land in the
traditional way;
• plant trees and look after footpaths; and
• set up information centres and employ
rangers.
The Norfolk and Suffolk Broads have
their own independent authority and enjoy
protection equivalent to that of a National
Park. It is intended that the New Forest in
Hampshire should enjoy similar protection.
A total of 39 AONBs have been
designated, covering around 2 million
hectares (4.8 million acres) in England and
83,000 hectares (205,000 acres) in Wales.
They comprise parts of the countryside
which lack extensive areas of open country
suitable for recreation and hence National
Park status, but which nevertheless have an
important landscape quality. Local authorities
are encouraged to give special attention to
AONBs in their planning and countryside
conservation work.
In Scotland there are four regional parks
and 40 National Scenic Areas, covering more
than 1 million hectares (2.5 million acres),
where certain kinds of development are
subject to consultation with SNH and, in the
event of a disagreement, with the Secretary
of State for Scotland. Working parties have
made recommendations for the management
of the Cairngorms and for Loch Lomond and
the Trossachs, two areas of outstanding
natural importance in Scotland. In the wider
countryside SNH provides grants for a range
of countryside projects.
In Northern Ireland the Council for
Nature Conservation and the Countryside
advises the Department of the Environment
for Northern Ireland on the preservation of
amenities and the designation of areas of
outstanding natural beauty. Nine such areas
have been designated, covering 285,000
hectares (705,000 acres); seven areas are
being managed as country parks and one as
a regional park.
There are 11 forest parks in Great
Britain, covering some 244,000 hectares
(603,000 acres) and administered by the
Forestry Commission. There are nine in
Northern Ireland, where they are
administered by the Forest Service of the
Department of Agriculture.
Public Rights of Way and Open Country
County and metropolitan district councils in
England and Wales are responsible for
keeping public rights of way signposted and
free from obstruction. Public paths are
usually maintained by these highway
authorities, which also supervise
landowners’ duties to repair stiles and gates.
In Scotland, planning authorities are
responsible for asserting and protecting
rights of way. Local authorities in Great
Britain can create paths, close paths no
longer needed for public use and divert
paths to meet the needs of either the public
or landowners. Farmers in England and
Wales are required by law rapidly to restore
public paths damaged by agricultural
operations. In England and Wales there are
some 225,000 km (140,000 miles) of rights

of way. There are 11 approved national trails
in England and Wales, covering over 3,100
km (1,900 miles), and three approved long¬
distance routes in Scotland, covering some
580 km (360 miles). The Countryside
Commission intends to help authorities bring
all rights of way in England into good order
by the end of the century, and a Parish Path
Partnership scheme has been introduced,
which is designed to stimulate local
involvement and improvement. The CCW
intends to establish a network of public rights
of way by 1995.
There is no automatic right of public
access to open country, although many
landowners allow it more or less freely. Local
planning authorities in England and Wales can
secure access by means of agreements with
landowners. If agreements cannot be reached,
authorities may acquire land or make orders
for public access. Similar powers cover
Scotland and Northern Ireland; in Northern
Ireland the primary responsibility lies with
district councils. In Scotland there is a
tradition of freedom to roam, based on
tolerance between landowners and those
seeking reasonable recreational access to the
hills.
Common land totals an estimated 600,000
hectares (1.5 million acres) in England and
Wales, but a legal right of public access exists
to only one-fifth of this area. Common land is
usually privately owned, but people other than
the owner may have various rights over it, for
example, as pasture land. Commons are
protected by law and cannot be built on or
enclosed without the consent of the
Secretaries of State for the Environment or
Wales; this consent is normally only given for
minor public works. There is no common
land in Scotland or Northern Ireland.
Voluntary Sector
Many voluntary organisations are concerned
to preserve the amenities of the countryside,
including the Council for the Protection of
Rural England, the Campaign for the
Protection of Rural Wales, the Association for
the Protection of Rural Scotland and the
Ulster Society for the Preservation of the
Countryside.
International Action
Britain plays a full part in international
action to conserve wildlife. Its international
obligations include the Berne Convention on
the conservation of European wildlife and
natural habitats, and EC directives on the
conservation of wild birds and of natural
habitats and wild fauna and flora. The
implementation of the latter directive,
which was adopted in May 1992, entails
the designation of Special Areas of
Conservation (SACs). Together with
Special Protection Areas (SPAs) designated
under the birds directive, the SACs will
contribute to a Community-wide network of
protected sites to be known as ‘Natura
2000’. Some 70 SPAs have already been
designated.
Britain is also party to the Ramsar
Convention on wetlands of international
importance. Some 62 sites in Britain have
been designated under this convention,
together with a further site in one of
Britain’s dependent territories. Other
conservation measures promoted by the
Government have included a ban (in
conjunction with other EC countries) on the
import of whale products and harp and
hooded seal pup skins, and stricter controls
for the protection of wild birds. Britain is a
party to the Convention on International
Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna
and Flora, which prohibits international
trade in endangered species and regulates
trade in less threatened species by means of
a permit system.
The Convention on Biological Diversity
was signed by over 150 countries, including
Britain, at the June 1992 ‘Earth Summit’. It
requires countries to:
• identify and monitor their genetic
resources;
• set up protected areas to safeguard these
resources; and
• develop national strategies for the
conservation and sustainable use of
biological diversity.
A national action plan is due to be
published by the end of 1993. Wide
consultation has been held on this.
347
BRITAIN 1994: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Environmental Improvement Schemes
The Government assists local voluntary
organisations to promote projects such as
creating parks, footpaths and other areas of
greenery in cities; conserving the industrial
heritage and the natural environment; and
recycling waste. The Department of the
Environment makes grants through the
Urban Programme (see p. 322) and the new
Environmental Action Fund, worth about
£4 million in 1993-94, to support projects
with either direct or indirect environmental
gains. The Civic Trust has been chosen to
manage a Local Projects Fund, from which
some £350,000 will be available in 1993-94.
The Welsh Office made £500,000 available
in 1992-93 to voluntary organisations under
its Environment Wales initiative. The
Scottish Office Environment Department is
making £334,000 available in 1993-94 to
environmental organisations under its Special
Grants (Environmental) Programme, and a
further £420,000 to UK2000 Scotland, a
partnership between central and local
government, voluntary bodies and the private
sector, which carries out practical
environmental improvements. Scottish
Enterprise and Highlands and Islands
Enterprise (see p. 147) are responsible for
environmental improvement and land
reclamation in Scotland. The Government’s
programme of Environmentally Sensitive
Areas (see p. 238) supports environmentally
sensitive practices that protect and enhance
the countryside.
The Groundwork Foundation manages a
network of trusts which work in partnership
with public bodies, the private sector,
voluntary organisations and individuals, and
aims to tackle environmental problems arising
from dereliction and vandalism and to
increase public awareness of the opportunities
to change and improve local environments.
Government funding for England in 1993-94
for the Groundwork Foundation is £5.6
million; a target has been set of establishing
50 trusts in England and Wales by 1995.
World Heritage Sites
Britain is fully represented in the World
Heritage List, which was established under
the World Heritage Convention to identify
and secure lasting protection for those parts
of the world heritage of outstanding universal
value. So far 13 sites in Britain have been
listed. These are:
• Canterbury Cathedral, with St
Augustine’s Abbey and St Martin’s
Church, in Kent;
• Durham Cathedral and Castle;
• Studley Royal Gardens and Fountains
Abbey, in North Yorkshire;
• Ironbridge Gorge, with the world’s first
iron bridge and other early industrial
sites, in Shropshire;
• the prehistoric stone circles at
Stonehenge and Avebury, in Wiltshire;
• Blenheim Palace, in Oxfordshire;
• the city of Bath, in Avon;
• Hadrian’s Wall;
• the Tower of London;
• the Palace of Westminster, Westminster
Abbey and St Margaret’s, Westminster,
also in London;
• the islands of St Kilda, in Scotland;
• the castles and town walls of King
Edward I, in north Wales; and
• the Giant’s Causeway and Causeway
Coast, in Northern Ireland.
Support for these sites can be
considerable. For example, English Heritage
is proposing a scheme to integrate
Stonehenge with its historic landscape and
minimise 20th-century intrusions upon the
scene. The plans involve removing the
present unsightly visitor facilities and the
road which carries traffic close to the
monument. A new visitor centre would be
built some distance from the stones.

For more than a century Britain has been developing policies to protect the
environment against pollution from industry and other sources. Laws were
introduced at an early stage to control air and water pollution—for example,
the Alkali Act 1863 and, more recently, the Clean Air Acts 1956 and 1968.
Legislation has been revised regularly to meet changing circumstances. The
Environmental Protection Act 1990, which applies to Great Britain, has
strengthened the existing system of protection against pollution. Legislation
sets out a wide range of powers and duties for central and local government,
covering all types of pollution, from greenhouse gases to litter.
Introduction
Britain supports international co-operation on
matters of environmental protection.
Increasingly, much of Britain’s legislation on
pollution control is being developed in
collaboration with other member states of the
European Community and organisations such
as the Organisation for Economic Co¬
operation and Development and the United
Nations and its agencies. Britain is taking a
leading position in the development of a
European ecolabelling scheme. Recently, with
increasing scientific understanding of global
pollution problems, the Government has been
considering how its own policies and actions
can be further guided by the principle of
‘sustainable development’, the theme of a
major United Nations conference in June
1992 (see p. 356). Assistance is also given to
developing countries for environmental
projects; an Environmental Know How Fund
was set up in April 1992 to help Eastern
Europe and the former Soviet Union.
Many environmental objectives were
achieved during the British presidency of the
European Community in the second half of
1992. These included agreement on:
• a regulation accelerating the phasing out
of ozone-depleting substances;
• a common position on a new directive to
extend stringent standards on exhaust
pollutants;
• a regulation on waste shipments and a
decision on ratification by the
Community of the Basel Convention on
transboundary movements of hazardous
wastes;
349
BRITAIN 1994: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
• the formal adoption of a directive on the
harmonisation of programmes for
reduction of pollution caused by waste
from the titanium dioxide industry; and
• a resolution responding to the European
Commission’s Fifth Environmental Action
Programme, which sets out the strategy
for the Community’s environmental
policy to the year 2000 and which came
into effect from January 1993.
Broad agreement was also reached on a
Community-wide eco-management and audit
scheme.
Administration
Executive responsibility for pollution control
is divided between local authorities and
central government agencies. Central
government makes policy, exercises general
budgetary control, promotes legislation and
advises pollution control authorities on policy
implementation. The Secretary of State for
the Environment has general responsibility for
co-ordinating the work of the Government on
environmental protection. In Scotland and
Wales the respective Secretaries of State are
responsible for pollution control co-ordination
within their countries. In Northern Ireland,
this responsibility rests with the Department
of the Environment for Northern Ireland.
Local authorities also have important duties
and powers. They are responsible for matters
such as:
• collection and disposal of domestic
wastes;
• keeping the streets clean from litter;
• control of air pollution from domestic and
from many industrial premises; and
• noise and general nuisance abatement.
The National Rivers Authority (NRA) is
responsible for monitoring water quality and
the control of water pollution in England and
Wales, on which it is expected to spend £90
million in 1993-94. In Scotland, the river
purification authorities have statutory
responsibility for water pollution control; the
seven mainland authorities forecast
expenditure of over £12 million in 1993-94.
In Northern Ireland, water quality is
monitored by the Environment Service of the
Department of the Environment for Northern
Ireland. In England and Wales Her Majesty’s
Inspectorate of Pollution (HMIP) has an
important role in the control of emissions to
land, air and water from certain industrial
processes through the mechanism of
‘integrated pollution control’ (see p. 351).
The Government is committed to bringing
together the functions of HMIP and the
NRA, together with those presently exercised
by waste regulation authorities, into a single
Environment Agency. A Scottish
Environment Protection Agency, with broadly
similar responsibilities, is also proposed.
A permanent network of the
environmental enforcement agencies
of EC member states was established
in November 1992, during Britain’s
presidency of the Community. Its first
meeting was hosted by HMIP.
An independent standing Royal
Commission on Environmental Pollution
advises the Government on national and
international matters concerning the pollution
of the environment, on the adequacy of
research and on the future possibilities of
danger to the environment. So far it has
produced 17 reports.
An Environmental Partnership was
announced in November 1992 as part of the
Capital Partnership initiative (see p. 322).
This supports local authority programmes for
recycling, waste management and dealing
with contaminated land and landfill gas.
Business and Consumer Involvement
The Government takes part in a number
of initiatives to involve businesses in
environmental matters and to help the
consumer play a part.
Advisory Committee on Business and the
Environment
The Advisory Committee on Business and
the Environment consists of 25 business
350
CONTROL OF POLLUTION
people appointed by the Government to serve
in a personal capacity rather than as
representatives of particular interests. It is
charged, among other things, with providing
advice to the Government on environmental
issues relevant to business. It aims to help
encourage best environmental practice within
British businesses.
The Committee’s main work is carried on
through its working groups. These have so
far examined global warming, recycling,
environmental management, the financial
sector, and commercial and export
opportunities.
Other Business Initiatives
These include, for example:
• the Chief Executive’s Guide and DIY
Workbook, published by Business in the
Environment, part of the voluntary group
Business in the Community;
• the launch of an Environment Business
Forum by the Confederation of British
Industry (CBI), which is open to all
businesses whether or not they are
members of the CBI; and
• many local and supplier initiatives around
the country.
Eco-audit
In June 1993 the European Community
adopted regulations for a voluntary
Community-wide scheme of eco-audits. This
will initially be targeted at the manufacturing,
power and waste disposal sectors.
Registrations will apply to individual sites
rather than to companies’ entire operations,
but each company will be required to
establish an environmental policy before any
of its sites can be registered. The company
would then have to prepare an environmental
statement, open to the public, for each site it
wishes to register; this statement would have
to be validated by an accredited independent
verifier. A full cycle of environmental audits
at each site would have to be conducted at
least once every three years.
Each EC member state is required to have
established a competent body to maintain a
register of sites by July 1994. The scheme
should be fully operational by April or May
1995.
British Standard on Environmental
Management
The British Standards Institution (see p. 155)
has published BS7750, a full standard for
environmental management systems which
can be used by any organisation and is
compatible with the EC eco-audit scheme.
Certification of management systems under
BS7750 is one means by which companies
can seek to satisfy the requirements of the
EC scheme. BS7750 shares many features of
the widely-used BS5750 quality management
standard and is expected to be certified in a
similar way.
Ecolabelling
Many consumers wish to take environmental
considerations into account when buying
goods. The Government has therefore taken a
leading part in developing the European
ecolabelling scheme, based on a common
label across the Community. The scheme will
be voluntary and will apply to all consumer
goods except food and pharmaceuticals.
Criteria will be developed for individual
product groups to identify those products
which are less harmful to the environment
throughout their lifecycle. The aim is to
encourage manufacturers to produce more
products that are less harmful to the
environment.
Integrated Pollution Control
Under the Environmental Protection Act
1990 a system of ‘integrated pollution control’
(IPC) is being phased in to control certain
categories of industrial pollution. The
potentially most harmful processes are
specified for IPC, and require authorisation
from HMIP. Less harmful air pollution is
controlled under a system of local authority
air pollution control. In granting
authorisation for releases under IPC, the
Inspectorate requires the use of the best
351
BRITAIN 1994: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
available techniques not entailing excessive
cost to prevent or minimise polluting
emissions and to ensure that any releases are
made harmless. The staff of HMIP has been
increased considerably to allow the full
implementation of IPC; staffing rose from
227 in April 1991 to 334 in February 1993.
In England and Wales, the NRA is
responsible for monitoring waters receiving
discharges authorised under IPC.
Her Majesty’s Industrial Pollution
Inspectorate is the Scottish equivalent of
HMIP, and administers IPC jointly with the
river purification authorities. In Northern
Ireland broadly similar controls are exercised
by the Environment Service, and proposals
are being formulated for the introduction of a
system of air pollution control similar to IPC.
The Government is pressing for the
introduction of IPC on the British model
within the EC.
The Land
Certain local authorities are designated as
waste collection, waste disposal or waste
regulation authorities, responsible for
different parts of the process of dealing with
controlled wastes. Legislation has also
established a licensing system for waste
disposal sites, treatment plants and storage
facilities receiving controlled wastes. It
provides for a more intensive control system
for special wastes, namely those which
contain or consist of substances dangerous to
life. HMIP, the NRA and the Hazardous
Waste Inspectorate for Scotland may advise
local authorities on how to improve their
control of waste management and on how to
work towards environmentally acceptable
standards for dealing with hazardous wastes.
In Northern Ireland similar advice is offered
to district councils by the Environment
Service.
Part II of the Environmental Protection
Act strengthens existing controls on waste
disposal. Responsibility for proper handling
of waste will be imposed on everyone who
has control of it from production to final
disposal or reclamation. Authorities will be
able to refuse licences if the applicant is not a
fit and proper person. Operators will now
remain responsible for their sites until the
waste regulation authority is satisfied that no
future hazard is likely to arise. In England
and Wales local authorities’ waste disposal
operations are being transferred to ‘arm’s
length’ companies or private contractors so as
to separate them from the authorities’ other
jobs of setting policies and standards, and
enforcement. Subject to further legislation,
the Government intends that its proposed
Environment Agency would take over local
authority waste regulation functions.
In Scotland, the responsibility for the
collection and disposal of refuse and the
regulation of waste management activities
remains with the district and islands councils,
whose waste management function is
examined by the Hazardous Waste
Inspectorate. In Northern Ireland
responsibility for the collection, disposal and
regulation of waste rests with the district
councils.
Litter
It is a criminal offence to leave litter in any
public place in the open air or to dump
rubbish except in designated places. The
maximum penalty for this, previously set at
£400, was increased under the Environmental
Protection Act to £1,000, and was raised
again in October 1992 to £2,500. The Act
also introduced new powers for the public to
apply to the courts for litter abatement orders
and new duties on local authorities to keep
their public land as free of litter and refuse
(including dog faeces) as practicable. Similar
powers are due to come into force in
Northern Ireland in 1994.
A Tidy Britain Group survey carried
out one year after the implementation
of the Environmental Protection Act
1990 showed that Britain’s streets were
about 13 per cent cleaner in 1992 than
in 1991.
To help counteract the problem of litter,
financial support—totalling £2.9 million in
1993-94—is given to the Tidy Britain Group,
which is recognised as the national agency for
litter abatement. It provides a comprehensive
352
CONTROL OF POLLUTION
litter abatement programme in collaboration
with local authorities and the private sector.
The Group secures sponsorship from
industry to undertake litter abatement
promotions and programmes such as its
Neighbourhood Care Scheme. The Group’s
activities were extended to Northern Ireland
with the establishment in 1991 of Tidy
Northern Ireland.
Recycling and Materials Reclamation
The Government encourages the reclamation
and recycling of waste materials wherever
this is practicable; its target is for half of all
recyclable household waste to be reused by
2000. Under the Environmental Protection
Act 1990, local authorities have to make
plans for the recycling of waste. The Act
also requires waste disposal authorities in
England to pay ‘recycling credits’ to waste
collection authorities to pass on the reduced
costs of disposal where waste is recycled.
From April 1994 the credit will be increased
so that the full amount saved must be passed
on. In Wales and Scotland, the same
authorities handle waste collection and
disposal.
The Government has supported pilot
‘Recycling City’ initiatives in Sheffield,
Cardiff, Dundee and the county of Devon,
which have tested a variety of collection and
sorting methods. Trial collections of
recyclable waste are being supported and
monitored in these and other locations.
Members of the public can deposit used
glass containers for recycling in bottle
banks—-there are over 8,000 such sites in
Britain, and it is anticipated that there will
be 10,000 by 1995. There are also similar
‘can banks’ and ‘paper banks’ and, in some
cases, plastics or textiles banks to collect
these materials for recycling. In addition,
voluntary organisations arrange collections of
waste material, and can be paid a recycling
credit by the local authority for doing so.
Discussions with industry aimed at
improving markets for collected recyclable
waste have led to voluntary targets, such as a
40 per cent recycled content of newspapers
by 2000, and grant aid for research and new
plant.
Water
In general, it is against the law to allow any
polluting matter to enter water in Britain
except in accordance with a legal
authorisation. In England and Wales the
NRA is responsible for protecting water
quality. Its principal method of controlling
water pollution is through the regulation of
all effluent discharges into groundwaters,
inland and coastal waters (except those
releases subject to IPC, which are controlled
by HMIP). Discharge consents issued by the
NRA specify what may be discharged and set
limits on the volume and content of effluent,
in order to achieve appropriate water quality
standards. The NRA maintains public
registers containing information about
discharge consents, authorisations from
HMIP and water quality. HMIP maintains
registers of authorisations and associated
monitoring. Similar arrangements apply in
Scotland, where control is exercised by
the river purification authorities. The
Department of the Environment for Northern
Ireland’s Environment Service is responsible
for controlling water pollution in Northern
Ireland.
Government proposals for statutory water
quality objectives for England and Wales,
together with a new system of classifying
river quality, were published in a consultation
paper in December 1992. The objectives,
which would be phased in gradually, would
specify for each individual stretch of water
the standards that should be reached and the
target date for achieving them. The system of
statutory water quality objectives would
provide the framework for the NRA to set
consents.
Over the past 30 years, notable progress
has been made in cleaning up the previously
heavily polluted major estuaries of the east
coast of England and Scotland—the Thames,
Humber, Tees, Tyne and Forth—which now
support varied populations of fish and other
wildlife. A 25-year scheme, supported by the
Government and the EC, aims to reduce
river pollution and improve water quality
throughout the Mersey river basin and
estuary. Other major schemes in progress
include programmes to improve water quality
353
BRITAIN 1994: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
in the Clyde in Scotland and the Lagan in
Northern Ireland.
More than 95 per cent of the population
in Britain live in properties connected to a
sewer, and sewage treatment works serve
over 80 per cent of the population. In
England and Wales the water industry is
planning to spend some ,£ 14,000 million (at
1989 prices) up to the year 2000 on
improving sewerage, sewage treatment and
disposal. Progressively higher treatment
standards for industrial waste effluents and
new measures to combat pollution from
agriculture are expected to bring further
improvements in water quality. In Scotland,
sewage treatment and disposal come within
the water and sewerage programme, which
will total more than £728 million in the three
years to 1995-96.
The Government is committed to meeting
the requirements of a number of EC
directives for the protection and
improvement of water quality, for example,
on the quality of surface water for abstraction
for drinking water supply, the quality needed
to support freshwater fisheries, the quality of
water for bathing areas (see below) and the
treatment of urban waste water.
Bathing Waters and Coastal Sewage
Discharges
The Government has announced investment
of around £2,200 million by the water
industry to provide treatment of coastal
sewage discharges. A £2,000 million
programme to improve the quality of
Britain’s bathing waters should be largely
complete by the end of 1995. In the 1992
tests of bathing water quality, it was found
that 79 per cent of identified bathing waters
(358 out of 455) in Britain met the
mandatory coliform bacteria standards of the
EC bathing water directive, compared with
66 per cent of beaches in 1988. The
Government expects all but a handful of
bathing waters to meet the directive’s
standards by 1995. The NRA is responsible
for monitoring compliance with the directive.
In 1990 the Government announced that the
sea dumping of sewage sludge would be
terminated completely by the end of 1998.
Marine Environment
In September 1992 a new Convention for the
Protection of the Marine Environment of the
North East Atlantic was agreed in Paris. It
covers both land and sea, sets targets for the
introduction of additional safeguards for the
area, and requires contracting parties to take
all possible steps to prevent or eliminate
pollution through an action plan subject to
annual review. Britain is also a leading
participant in the series of North Sea
Conferences, an international forum of
countries bordering the North Sea. Good
progress is being made in meeting North Sea
Conference targets for reducing the input of
dangerous substances into the sea. For
example, inputs of cadmium and mercury to
the North Sea fell by 61 per cent and 52 per
cent respectively between 1985 and 1990.
International action on the prevention of
pollution by ships is taken through the
International Maritime Organization (IMO).
Britain applies all international requirements
to all ships in British waters and to British
ships wherever they are. Enforcement is
undertaken by the Department of Transport.
Work is continuing within the IMO on
further measures.
The Marine Pollution Control Unit
(MPCU), part of the Department of
Transport, is responsible for dealing with
major spillages of oil or other hazardous
substances from ships at sea. The
arrangements for dealing with pollution are
set out in the national contingency plan
developed by the MPCU. The Unit has at its
disposal a variety of counter-pollution
equipment, including:
• remote sensing surveillance aircraft;
• aerial and seaborne spraying equipment;
• stocks of dispersants; and
• mechanical recovery and cargo transfer
equipment.
In January 1993 the MPCU co-ordinated
counter-pollution operations following the
grounding of the MV Braer in the Shetland
Islands. After this incident the Government
set up an inquiry to advise on whether any
further measures were appropriate to protect
354
CONTROL OF POLLUTION
the coast of Britain from pollution from
merchant shipping.
In order to minimise the environmental
effect of offshore oil and gas operations,
special conditions designed to protect the
environment are included in licences for oil
and gas exploration. These conditions are set
in consultation with a number of bodies with
environmental interests, including the
relevant government departments and the
Joint Nature Conservation Committee
(see p. 342). Before commencing offshore
operations, the operators are required to have
oil spill contingency plans drawn up. In
addition, all discharges that contain oil are
controlled under the Prevention of Oil
Pollution Act 1971, and limits are set for the
permissible level of oil discharged. In
response to requests from the North Sea
Conference, progressively tighter limits on oil
discharged with drill cuttings have been set.
This has resulted in the quantity of oil
discharges from this source from installations
in British waters falling from 18,500 tonnes
in 1988 to 6,000 tonnes in 1992.
Britain ended the dumping of industrial
waste at sea in 1992. Waste has not been
licensed for incineration at sea since 1990.
Under the North East Atlantic Convention,
and the earlier convention it replaces, the
dumping at sea of most types of waste will be
phased out over the next few years.
Air
Responsibility for clean air rests primarily
with local authorities. Under the Clean Air
Act 19931 and the Clean Air (Northern
Ireland) Order 1981 they may declare ‘smoke
control areas’ within which the emission of
smoke from chimneys is an offence. About
two-thirds of the dwellings in conurbations
are covered by smoke control orders—around
6,340 are in force. Those industrial processes
with the greatest potential for harmful
emissions are controlled under the
Environmental Protection Act 1990, in
England and Wales by HMIP, and are
becoming subject to IPC. Processes with a
' This Act consolidated earlier legislation on air pollution,
including the Clean Air Acts 1956 and 1968.
significant but lesser potential for air
pollution require approval from local
authorities. Also, under the Clean Air Act,
local authorities control emissions of dark
smoke from trade and industrial premises.
The 1990 Act also provides local authorities
in England and Wales with streamlined
powers to deal with statutory nuisances,
including smoke, dust and smells. Similar
legislation is being introduced in Northern
Ireland.
Air quality in Britain has improved
considerably in the last 30 years. Total
emissions of smoke in the air have fallen by
over 85 per cent since 1960. The domestic
smoke control programme has been
particularly important in achieving this result.
London and other major cities no longer have
the dense smoke-laden ‘smogs’ of the 1950s
and in central London winter sunshine has
increased by about 70 per cent since 1958.
Since 1990, daily air pollution data from
the British monitoring network has been
made available to the public by the
Department of the Environment’s Air Quality
Bulletins. These give the concentrations of
three main pollutants—ozone, nitrogen
dioxide and sulphur dioxide—and grade air
quality on a scale between ‘very poor’ and
‘very good’. The information features in
television and radio weather reports, and
appears in many national and local
newspapers. The data are also available on a
special free telephone number and on
videotext systems.
A comprehensive government review of
urban air quality was announced in January
1992. Three independent committees of
experts have been established to advise on
different aspects of the problem, and will set
guidelines and targets for air quality. Britain’s
automatic air quality monitoring network is
also being extended and upgraded at a cost of
3^10 million.
Climate Change
The greenhouse effect is a natural
phenomenon which keeps the earth at a
temperature that can sustain life. But
increasing man-made emissions of
‘greenhouse gases’, such as carbon dioxide,
355
BRITAIN 1994: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
methane and nitrous oxide, are leading to
greater concentrations of these gases in the
atmosphere. In 1988 the United Nations
Environment Programme and the World
Meteorological Organisation established the
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change
to consider climate change and possible
responses to it. Britain chairs the working
group which assesses the scientific evidence
on climate change. It has concluded that man¬
made emissions would lead to additional
warming of the earth, and that, without any
change in emissions, global average
temperature would increase by 0.3°C a
decade, which would be faster than at any
time over the past 10,000 years. Such changes
could have major effects on the world.
In December 1990 the United Nations set
up an Intergovernmental Negotiating
Committee to draw up a framework
convention on climate change. Britain played
a leading role in the negotiations towards the
convention, which was opened for signature
at the United Nations Conference on
Environment and Development meeting in
Rio de Janeiro in June 1992. This commits
all signatories to devising and reporting on
the measures that they propose to take to
combat climate change. Britain sees the
outcome of the negotiations as a significant
first step in the global response to climate
change; the review process incorporated into
the convention is one of its most important
aspects. Britain was one of over 150 countries
that signed the convention at the UNCED
meeting.
The Government has also announced that
it is prepared to return Britain’s carbon
dioxide emissions to 1990 levels by 2000,
provided other countries take similar action.
To meet this target, energy efficiency
measures are the first priority; further steps
are likely in the longer term. Current
measures to combat the problem include:
• an increased budget for the Energy
Efficiency Office (see p. 208);
• a major three-year publicity campaign on
the greenhouse effect and energy use in
the home;
• tighter building regulations to promote
the energy efficiency of new houses;
• a government pledge to achieve a 15 per
cent improvement in the energy
efficiency of its buildings over a five-year
period;
• a review of the potential of renewable
energy sources; and
• significant increases in the tax on
domestic and vehicle fuels.
Britain is also making a major research
effort into global warming. The Hadley
Centre for Climate Prediction and Research
was opened in 1990 to build on the climate
modelling programme of the Meteorological
Office. The Department of the
Environment’s total expenditure on research
related to climate change will be over £14
million in 1993-94. A major venture to
investigate the role of the ice-covered
Southern Ocean in regulating levels of carbon
dioxide in the atmosphere was launched by
the British Antarctic Survey in September
1992. Data collected from two research
vessels will be used to produce a
mathematical model of carbon cycling
at the ice edge.
Ozone Layer
The Government is committed to the earliest
possible phasing out of all ozone-depleting
substances. Britain was one of the first 25
signatories to the Montreal Protocol, which
deals with the protection of the ozone layer,
and hosted the second meeting of the
parties in June 1990, which substantially
strengthened the protocol. The protocol was
further strengthened in November 1992. The
supply of chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), 1,1,1
trichloroethane and carbon tetrachloride is to
be phased out by the end of 1995 and halons
by the end of 1993. There is provision for
exemptions for any essential uses. Controls
were also introduced on methyl bromide and
on hydrochlorofluorocarbons (transitional
substances with less ozone-depleting capacity
than CFCs, which are needed in a number of
areas if industry is to move away from CFCs
quickly). They are to be phased out by 2030.
Tighter intermediate reductions for many
substances were also agreed. European
Community legislation requires CFCs and
356
CONTROL OF POLLUTION
carbon tetrachloride to be phased out by the
end of 1994, again with exemptions for any
essential uses.
Emissions of Sulphur Dioxide and Oxides of
Nitrogen
Sulphur dioxide and oxides of nitrogen are
the main gases that lead to acid rain. The
principal sources are combustion plants that
burn fossil fuels, such as coal-fired power
stations, and, for oxides of nitrogen, road
transport. National sulphur dioxide emissions
have fallen by over 40 per cent since 1970
and the Government has initiated a
substantial programme to ensure that this fall
continues. For example, under the EC
directive on the control of emissions from
large combustion plants, the Government has
published a national plan setting out phased
reductions in emissions from existing plants
of oxides of nitrogen to 1998 and of sulphur
dioxide to 2003.

The damaging effect of acid depositions
from combustion processes on freshwaters
and soils has been demonstrated by scientific
research. The Government is spending about
£10 million a year on an extensive research
programme into the causes and effects of acid
rain, and the likely results of possible
abatement technologies. Lower emissions of
sulphur dioxide over the past 20 years (see
Table 24.1) have led to the first signs of a
decrease in acidification in some lochs in
south-west Scotland.
Vehicle Emissions
There are about 24 million vehicles on
Britain’s roads, contributing substantially to
Britain’s total emissions of carbon dioxide,
carbon monoxide, hydrocarbons and oxides of
nitrogen. Since 1970 a series of increasingly
stringent regulations on cars and light vans
has been implemented by the Government to
bring carbon monoxide emissions from each
new car down by over 90 per cent and
hydrocarbon and nitrogen oxide emissions by
over 80 per cent. Strict new standards for
these vehicles were brought into force in
January 1993 throughout the EC. These will
reduce emissions from new cars by
approximately 60 per cent over the previous
standards and require almost all new petrol-
engined cars to be fitted with catalytic
converters. Further limits are being
considered for application in 1996. The
Community is committed to looking into
possible controls on carbon dioxide emissions
from cars.
Britain has also pressed the Community to
introduce very strict emission standards for
heavy goods vehicles and buses starting in
1993, with a further, much stricter phase in
1996. This will introduce stricter limits for
gaseous emissions and, for the first time,
limits on particulate emissions. The
Government has introduced checks on
exhaust emissions into the annual test of
vehicle roadworthiness, measuring carbon
monoxide and hydrocarbons. These limits are
also subject to enforcement at roadside spot-
checks. The sulphur content of industrial gas
oils and diesel fuel is also controlled by EC
legislation and will be subject to a further
reduction in the next few years.
The amount of lead in the air in Britain
has fallen by 70 per cent since the permitted
lead content in petrol was reduced in 1986
from 0.4 to 0.15 grammes a litre and
unleaded petrol was introduced. Britain took
a leading role in negotiating an EC directive
which required unleaded petrol to be made
available throughout the Community by
October 1989. Practically all petrol stations in
Britain now sell unleaded petrol, and since
1990 new cars must have been manufactured
to be capable of running on it. The
Government has encouraged the use of
cleaner fuel by introducing a substantial tax
differential in favour of unleaded petrol.
Demand for it has risen rapidly, and
357
BRITAIN 1994: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
unleaded petrol now accounts for over half of
all petrol sold in Britain.
Internationally developed standards have
also been introduced to control the emission
from civil aircraft of smoke, vented fuel and
unburned hydrocarbons. Current indications
are that aircraft contribute only a small
amount to overall pollution, although the
Government is funding further research and
taking a leading role in European studies on
this issue.
Noise
Local authorities have a duty to inspect their
areas for noise nuisance, except from aircraft
noise, and to investigate complaints about it.
They must serve a noise abatement notice
where the noise is judged to be a statutory
nuisance. They can also designate ‘noise
abatement zones’, within which registered
levels of noise from certain premises may not
be increased without their permission. There
are also specific provisions in law to:
• control noise from construction and
demolition sites;
• control the use of loudspeakers in the
streets; and
• enable individuals to take independent
action through the courts against noise
amounting to a nuisance.
Tougher measures against noise were
proposed in the environment White Paper.
Many of its commitments were endorsed by
an independent working party. It reported in
October 1990 with 33 recommendations,
many of which have now been implemented.
The Government also has an environmental
noise research programme, spending on
which is expected to be about £650,000 in
1993-94.
Transport is a major source of noise, and
control measures are aimed at reducing it at
source, through requirements limiting the
noise that aircraft and motor vehicles may
make, and at protecting people from its
effects. Operational measures are also used to
minimise the effects of aircraft noise.
Regulations set out the permissible noise
levels for various classes of new vehicle.
Government research also looks at ways of
reducing noise, and has demonstrated the
feasibility of tougher noise limits for heavy
goods vehicles.
Compensation may be payable for loss in
property values caused by physical factors,
including noise from new or improved public
works such as roads, railways and airports.
Regulations also enable highway authorities to
carry out or make grants for insulation of
homes that would be subject to specified
levels of increased noise caused by new or
improved roads. Noise insulation may be
provided where construction work for new
roads may seriously affect nearby homes.
Britain has played a leading role in
negotiations aimed at the gradual phasing out
of older, noisier subsonic jet aircraft. Flying
non-noise certificated aircraft has been
banned in Britain, and since 1990 British
operators have no longer been allowed to add
to their fleets further ‘Chapter 2’ aircraft
(noisier planes, as classified by international
agreement). A complete ban on the operation
of Chapter 2 aircraft will begin to be
implemented in April 1995, and it is intended
to phase out all these types by April 2002.
Various operational restrictions have been
introduced to reduce noise disturbance
further at Heathrow, Gatwick and Stansted,
where the Secretary of State for Transport
has assumed responsibility for noise
abatement. These measures include:
• restrictions on the type and number of
aircraft operating at night;
• the routeing of departing aircraft on
noise-preferential routes; and
• quieter take-off and landing procedures.
The population disturbed by aircraft
noise2 at Heathrow fell from 1.47 million in
1978 to 562,000 in 1989, even though the
number of air transport movements increased.
This was largely because of the phasing out
of older, noisier aircraft. Under government
proposals announced in March 1993, airfields
will be given powers to enforce noise
amelioration schemes. The Secretary of State
would be given powers to compel the airfield
authorities to prepare such a scheme. Local
2 That is, living within the 35 Noise and Number Index noise
contour, which is regarded as the onset of disturbance.
358
CONTROL OF POLLUTION
authorities would have powers to act against
the owner of an airfield who did not take
reasonable steps to ensure that an agreed
scheme was operated effectively.
Radioactivity
Man-made radiation represents only a small
fraction of that to which the population is
exposed; most is naturally occurring. A large
proportion of the man-made radioactivity to
which the public is exposed comes from
medical treatments, such as X-rays.
Nevertheless, the man-made fraction is
subject to stringent control. Users of
radioactive materials must be registered by
HMIP in England and Wales, and
equivalents in Scotland and Northern
Ireland, and authorisation is also required for
the accumulation and disposal of radioactive
waste. The Health and Safety Executive
(HSE—see p. 139), through its Nuclear
Installations Inspectorate, is the authority
responsible for the granting of nuclear site
licences for major nuclear installations. No
installation may be constructed or operated
without a licence granted by the Executive.
The National Radiological Protection
Board (NRPB) provides an authoritative
point of reference on radiological protection.
Following the accident at the Chernobyl
nuclear power station in the then Soviet
Union in 1986, the Government has set up a
national radiation monitoring network and
overseas nuclear accident response system
(RIMNET). An interim version has been
operating since 1988. This is being replaced
during 1993 by a larger and more fully
automated system with 92 monitoring
stations across Britain.
In 1987 the Government announced
measures to deal with the problem of radon,
a naturally occurring radioactive gas which
can accumulate in houses. These included a
free survey by the NRPB for householders
living in radon-affected areas. In 1990 the
Government halved the level at which it is
recommended that householders take action
to reduce radon in their homes. The NRPB
has designated Cornwall, Devon,
Northamptonshire and parts of Derbyshire
and Somerset as ‘radon-affected areas’ (areas
where more than 1 per cent of the houses
exceed the action level). An updated
edition of the Government’s advice booklet
for householders was published in October
1992.
Radioactive Waste Disposal
Radioactive wastes vary widely in nature and
level of activity, and the methods of disposal
reflect this. Some wastes can be disposed of
safely in the same way as other industrial and
household wastes. UK Nirex Ltd is
responsible for developing a deep disposal
facility for solid low-level and intermediate-
level radioactive waste. It is currently
concentrating its detailed
geological investigations on an area near the
British Nuclear Fuels site at Sellafield, in
Cumbria. As part of these studies, Nirex
intends to construct an experimental rock
laboratory, known as a ‘rock characterisation
facility’.
The 1992 results of monitoring
foodstuffs show that radioactivity in
foodstuffs remains well below levels
that would pose a risk to the public.
Over 6,000 samples of milk, fruit,
vegetables and meat were analysed.
The Department of the Environment is
sponsoring research, in collaboration with
other countries, into disposal of high-level or
heat-generating waste. This waste will first be
stored in vitrified form for at least 50 years to
allow the heat and radioactivity to decay. In
September 1992 Britain agreed not to dispose
of radioactive waste at sea in the north-east
Atlantic for at least 15 years, and only
thereafter under tight conditions. The
Department of the Environment’s 1992-93
budget for research into environmental
radioactivity and radioactive waste was
£1 million.
Genetically Modified Organisms
Genetically modified organisms (GMOs) have
many potential beneficial uses. However,
there are risks that their heritable genetic
material might persist in the environment in
359
BRITAIN 1994: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
harmful ways. The Environmental Protection
Act 1990 and regulations which came into
force in February 1993 contain powers to
ensure that any risks to the environment,
including human populations, from the
release of GMOs are prevented or minimised.
The new legislation sets up a consent system
for experimental releases of GMOs and for
the EC-wide approval of GMO products.
The Department of the Environment acts as
the administrative contact for those applying
for consent. The Government hopes that,
with further experience of releases, it will be
able to agree simplified procedures for the
clearance of low-risk GMOs so that their
benefits may be enjoyed as soon as possible
with the least burden on industry consistent
with safety.
Environmental Research
Research into environmental protection is
essential to the Government’s environmental
policies. It has been estimated that its total
spending on environmental research and
development in 1993-94 will be ^300-^400
million, including work in areas such as
renewable energy. The Department of the
Environment expects to devote about 01
million in 1993-94 to research into subjects
including:
• climate change;
• atmospheric pollution and its
monitoring;
• toxic chemicals and GMOs;
• waste disposal; and
• water quality and health.
Other departments have substantial
programmes, notably the Ministry of
Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, The
Scottish Office Agriculture and Fisheries
Department and other official bodies such as
the NRA and the Meteorological Office.
The European Network of Environmental
Research Organisations was set up in March
1993, with British participation, to facilitate
the exchange of environmental information
between some 3,000 researchers.
Research Councils
Basic and strategic research is carried out by
the government-funded research councils (see
pp. 272-6). All have a role in environmental
protection research, but particularly
important is the Natural Environment
Research Council (NERC), which has a
science budget allocation of £140 million in
1993-94, plus expected receipts of about £42
million from commissioned research and
other income. The NERC undertakes and
supports research in the environmental
sciences and funds postgraduate training. Its
programmes encompass the marine, earth,
terrestrial, freshwater, polar and atmospheric
sciences. The NERC lays stress on
international collaborative work on global
environmental issues. For example, it is
helping to develop global atmospheric climate
models and strengthening atmospheric
research in the Arctic. A major research
programme, the Terrestrial Initiative in
Global Environmental Research aims to assess
the likely impact of climate change on Britain
and elsewhere. The NERC also co-ordinates
the development and operation of the
Environmental Change Network.

Major Policy Developments 363 Personal Social Services 383
The National Health Service 366
Total spending on health and social services in 1993-94 is expected to be
£36,292 million: £36,000 million on health and £292 million on social services.
Recent developments include an increase in practice nurses at doctors’
surgeries, projects designed to improve health care in inner city areas and
among ethnic minorities, and new procedures for assessing the care needs for
individuals within the community.
The National Health Service (NHS) provides
a full range of medical services which are
available to all residents, regardless of their
income. Local authority personal social
services and voluntary organisations provide
help and advice to the most vulnerable
members of the community. These include
elderly, physically disabled and mentally ill
people, those with learning disabilities
(mental handicap) and children in need of
care.
Central government is directly responsible
for the NHS, administered by a range of
local health authorities and boards throughout
Britain acting as its agents, and for the social
security system. Personal social services are
administered by local authorities but central
government is responsible for establishing
national policies, issuing guidance and
overseeing standards. Joint finance and
planning between health and local authorities
aim to prevent overlapping of services and to
encourage the development of community
services.
Spending on the health service has
increased substantially in real terms since
1980, and is planned to grow further over the
next two years. More patients are being
treated than ever before. Spending on the
personal social services is determined by local
authorities. Central government has
restricted the total expenditure of individual
local authorities, but spending has risen
substantially in real terms since the late
1970s, reflecting the priority given to this
sector.
The NHS health programme consists of:
• Hospital and Community Health
Services (HCHS), providing all hospital
care and a range of community health
services;
• Family Health Services (FHS), providing
general medical, dental and
pharmaceutical services and some
ophthalmic services, and covering the
cost of medicines prescribed by general
practitioners (GPs);
• Central Health and Miscellaneous
Services (CHMS), providing services
most effectively administered centrally,
such as welfare food and support to the
voluntary sector; and
• the administrative costs of the health
departments.

BRITAIN 1994: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Major Policy Developments
Reforms in Management
The NHS and Community Care Act 1990
introduced wide-ranging reform in
management and patient care in the health
and social care services. The NHS reforms,
which came into effect in 1991, aim to give
patients, wherever they live in Britain, better
health care and greater choice of service, as
follows:
1. Health authorities have been given a new
role as purchasers of health care on behalf of
their local residents, responsible for assessing
local health care needs and ensuring the
availability of a full range of services to meet
identified health needs. They ensure that
those needs are met within existing resources.
2. Each health authority is funded to buy
health care for its local residents through
arranging contracts with hospitals and other
health service units in either the public or
private sector. For the first time hospitals are
directly funded for the number of patients
they treat, making it easier for GPs to refer
patients outside their area if treatment
elsewhere is faster and better. However,
powers exist for allocating resources where
the urgent need for treatment does not allow
NHS contracts to be arranged in advance.
3. The contracts agreed between health
authorities and hospitals set out the quality,
quantity and cost of the services to be
delivered during the year. The contracts
secured by each health authority are based on
wide consultation with all local GPs.
4. Hospitals may apply to become self-
governing NHS trusts (see p. 371),
independent of local health authority control
but remaining within the NHS. They are
accountable to the relevant health department,
treating NHS patients, and are funded largely
through general taxation, under contracts with
health authorities.
5. GPs from larger medical practices may
apply to join the general practitioner
fundholding scheme (see p. 370), under
which they receive an annual budget directly
from the health authority, enabling them to
buy certain hospital services for their patients.

HEALTH AND SOCIAL SERVICES
The reforms in community care provision,
which came into force between April 1991 and
April 1993, establish a new financial and
managerial framework which aims to secure the
delivery of good quality services in line with
national objectives. They are intended to enable
vulnerable groups in the community to live as
independently as possible in their own homes
for as long as they are able and wish to do so,
and to give them a greater say in how they live
and how the services they need should be
provided. (For fuller details see p. 384.)
Broadly similar changes have been
introduced under separate legislation in
Northern Ireland, where health and personal
social services are provided on an integrated
basis by health and social services boards.
The Patient’s Charter
Patient’s Charters, which came fully into force
in April 1992, are part of the health
departments’ response to the Citizen’s Charter
(see p. 64). Patient’s Charters support the
objectives of the NHS reforms: to improve
standards of health care and sensitivity to
patients in the NHS. They set out for the first
time the rights of patients and the standards of
care they can expect to receive from the NHS.
The Government believes that patients should
know what they can expect from the NHS and
that the staff who provide services should
understand what is expected of them. The
responsibility for implementing the Patient’s
Charters rests with all parts of the NHS,
English regions, purchasers and providers, and
is carried out mainly through contract
arrangements.
As well as restating the existing rights that
patients have under the NHS, the Patient’s
Charter in England introduced three new
rights. These are that patients must:
• be given detailed information on local
health services, including quality standards
and maximum waiting times;
• be guaranteed admission for treatment no
later than two years from the date of being
placed on a waiting list; and
• have any complaint about NHS services
investigated, and receive a full reply as
soon as possible.
In England the Patient’s Charter also sets
national charter standards. These are not
legal rights but specific standards of service
which the NHS aims to provide. These
include respect for the individual patient;
waiting times for ambulances, clinical
assessment in accident and emergency
departments and appointments in out-patient
clinics; and cancellation of operations. Also
included are local charter standards of service
which health authorities aim to provide
(see below).
Separate Patient’s Charters have been
developed for Scotland, Wales and Northern
Ireland.
As a result of the Charter initiative, many
local projects have been put into operation to
help improve NHS services. There are now
initiatives on every aspect of the Patient’s
Charter—from setting up translation services
in 140 languages to encourage access to
services, to asking patients for their views on
improving services.
From April 1993 every family health
services authority must have its own charter
setting out the new national standards which
it must meet and giving details of targets and
local standards. In addition, family health
services authorities are working with and
supporting GPs and primary health care
teams to produce local GP practice charters.
In response to the Charter Right to
Information, English regions have set up
health information services. These can
provide details of the times people have to
wait for treatment for all specialties in local
hospitals, as well as information from
hospitals further afield (see p. 371).
Developing Health Strategies
The Government emphasises the importance
of promoting health as well as treating illness.
Preventive health services such as health
education, and the responsibility that
individuals have for their own health, play a
major part in this. While great progress has
been made in eliminating infectious diseases
such as poliomyelitis and tuberculosis, there
is still scope for greater success in controlling
the major causes of early death and disability.
The White Paper The Health of the
365
BRITAIN 1994: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Nation, published in 1992, sets out a strategy
for improving health. This is the first time a
strategy has been developed for health in
England and its long-term aim is to enable
people to live longer, healthier lives. It sets
targets for improvements in the following
areas:
• coronary heart disease and stroke (the
major cause of premature death in
England);
• cancers (the second biggest cause of
premature death);
• accidents (the commonest cause of death
in those under 30);
• mental illness (a leading cause of ill-
health and, through suicides, of death);
and
• HIV/AIDS and sexual health
(HIV/AIDS is perhaps the greatest new
public health threat this century—see
p. 379—and there is much scope for
reducing sexually transmitted diseases
and unwanted pregnancies).
Targets are set for reducing death rates (for
example, from coronary heart disease and
stroke in those under 65 by at least 40 per
cent by the year 2000), for reducing ill-health
(such as the incidence of invasive cervical
cancer by at least 20 per cent by 2000) and
for reducing risk behaviour (for example, the
percentage of smokers to no more than 20
per cent of the population by 2000). While
the NHS will have a central role in working
towards the targets, the strategy also
emphasises that there is a role for everyone in
improving the nation’s health.
The White Paper also sets out the
Government’s objective of ensuring the
provision of effective family planning services
for those people who want them. The
conception rate for those under 16 years is a
matter of particular concern.
Strategies have also been developed for
Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. In
Wales, where the first of Britain’s four
national health strategies was published in
1990, areas for improvement include, among
others: cancers; cardiovascular disease;
maternal and early child health; physical
disability; mental handicap and mental health;
and injuries. Scotland’s national strategy,
published in 1992, places special emphasis on
smoking, alcohol misuse, coronary heart
disease, and cancer.
National action is under way in these
areas. It includes interdepartmental
taskforces, work with professional and
voluntary bodies and the provision of
guidance setting out a range of possible
actions for each tier of the NHS. At local
level, the NHS is being encouraged to form
‘healthy alliances’ for joint working with
agencies ranging from the voluntary sector
through to industry and the media. Progress
towards the targets will be monitored
regularly and formally reviewed, and periodic
progress reports will be published.
The Government’s health strategy has
been welcomed by the World Health
Organisation, which described it as a model
that other countries might follow.
Improving London’s Health Services
Proposals to improve the standard of
London’s health services were announced in
February 1993. These include:
• developing better, local and accessible
primary and community health services;
• providing a better-balanced hospital
service, on fewer sites;
• streamlining specialist services; and
• consolidating medical education and
research, chiefly through mergers of free¬
standing undergraduate medical colleges
with multifaculty colleges of London
University.
The National Health Service
The NHS is based upon the principle that
there should be a full range of publicly
provided services designed to help the
individual stay healthy. The services are
intended to provide effective and appropriate
treatment and care where necessary while
making the best use of available resources. All
taxpayers, employers and employees
contribute to its cost so that those members
of the community who do not require health
366
HEALTH AND SOCIAL SERVICES
care help to pay for those who do. Some
forms of treatment, such as hospital care, are
provided free; others (see p. 368) may be
charged for.
Growth in real spending on the health
service is being used to meet the needs of
increasing numbers of elderly people and to
take full advantage of advances in medical
technology. It is also used to provide more
appropriate types of care, often in the
community rather than in hospital, for
priority groups such as elderly and mentally
ill people and those with learning disabilities
(mental handicap). Increased spending has, in
addition, been allocated to combat the
growing problems arising from alcohol and
drug misuse; and to remedy disparities in
provision between the regions of Britain.
The Government stresses the need for
collaboration between the public and private
health sectors and for improving efficiency in
order to secure the best value for money and
the maximum patient care. Measures to
achieve more effective management of
resources in the NHS have included:
• appointing at regional, district and unit
levels general managers drawn from
inside and outside the health service;
• improving the accountability of health
authorities for the planning and
management of their resources;
• increasing the proportion of total staff
who provide direct patient care, such as
doctors and nurses; and
• introducing a range of programmes to
provide services at lower cost.
Considerable savings have been made through
competitive tendering for hospital cleaning,
catering and laundry services. At the end of
1992 the Government announced that total
annual savings from competitive tendering up
to 1990-91 were estimated at £626 million.
Economies are also made in prescribing by
restricting the use of expensive branded
products in favour of cheaper but equally
effective equivalent medicines.
ADMINISTRATION
The Secretary of State for Health in England
and the Secretaries of State for Scotland,
Wales and Northern Ireland are responsible for
all aspects of the health services in their
respective countries. The Department of
Health is responsible for national strategic
planning in England. The Scottish Office
Home and Health Department, the Welsh
Office and the Department of Health and
Social Services in Northern Ireland have
similar responsibilities.
District health authorities in England and
Wales and health boards in Scotland are
responsible for securing hospital and
community health services in their areas.
England, because of its greater size and
population, also has regional authorities
responsible for regional planning, resource
allocation, major capital building work and
certain specialised hospital services best
administered on a regional basis. The
authorities and boards co-operate closely with
local authorities responsible for social work,
environmental health, education and other
services. Family health services authorities
(health boards in Scotland) arrange for the
provision of services by doctors, dentists,
pharmacists and opticians, as well as
administering their contracts. Community
health councils (local health councils in
Scotland) represent local opinion on the health
services provided.
In Northern Ireland health and social
services boards are responsible for all health
and personal social services in their areas. The
representation of public opinion on these
services is provided for by area health and
social services councils.
Finance
Over 80 per cent of the cost of the health
service in Great Britain is paid for through
general taxation. The rest is met from:
• the NHS element of National Insurance
contributions, paid by employed people,
their employers, and self-employed people
(13.9 per cent);
• charges towards the cost of certain items
such as drugs prescribed by family
doctors, and general dental treatment
(3.9 per cent); and
367
BRITAIN 1994: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
• other receipts, including land sales and
the proceeds of income generation
schemes (1.4 per cent).
Health authorities may raise funds from
voluntary sources. Certain hospitals increase
their revenue by taking private patients who
pay the full cost of their accommodation and
treatment.
Almost 80 per cent of medical prescription
items are supplied free. Prescription charges
do not apply to the following:
• children under 16 years (or students
under 19 and still in full-time education);
• expectant mothers and women who have
had a baby in the past year;
• women aged 60 and over and men aged
65 and over;
• patients suffering from certain medical
conditions;
• war and armed forces disablement
pensioners (for prescriptions which relate
to the disability for which they receive a
war pension);
• people who are receiving income support
or family credit (see p. 397); and people
or families with low incomes.
There are proportional charges for all types
of general dental treatment, including dental
examination. However, women who were
pregnant when the dentist accepted them for
treatment or who have had a baby in the past
year, anyone under the age of 18 (or 19 if in
full-time education), people receiving income
support or family credit, and families on low
incomes, do not have to pay. Sight tests are
free to children, those on low incomes and
certain other priority groups. Some
disadvantaged groups receive help with the
purchase, repair and replacement of
spectacles.
Hospital medical staff are salaried and may
be employed full time or part time. Family
practitioners (doctors, dentists, opticians and
pharmacists) are self-employed and have
contracts with the NHS. GPs are paid by a
system of fees and allowances designed to
reflect responsibilities, workload and practice
expenses. Dentists providing treatment in
their own surgeries are paid by a combination
of capitation fees for treating children,
continuing care payments for adults
registered with the practice, and a
prescribed scale of fees for individual
treatments. Pharmacists dispensing from
their own premises are refunded the cost of
the items supplied, together with
professional fees. Ophthalmic medical
practitioners and ophthalmic opticians
taking part in the general ophthalmic service
receive approved fees for each sight test
carried out.
Staffing
The NHS is one of the largest employers in
the world, with a workforce of nearly
1 million people. During the past ten years
there has been a rise in the numbers of
‘direct care staff and a fall in the numbers
of support staff. The sharp fall in the
numbers of directly employed ancillary staff
and of maintenance and works staff reflects
the continuing effect of competitive
tendering (see p. 367). Staff costs account
for two-thirds of total NHS expenditure and
70 per cent of current expenditure on
hospitals and community health services.
For example, between 1981 and 1991:
• the number of medical and dental staff
in England rose by 18 per cent to
48,600, while in Scotland the increase
was 38 per cent to 7,890;
• the number of nursing and midwifery
staff, who make up 50 per cent of the
workforce, increased in England by 1
per cent (including agency staff) to
396,200; in Scotland the rise was 6 per
cent to 75,068; and
• the number of scientific, professional
and technical staff in England rose by
33 per cent; in Scotland this increase
was 32 per cent.
The Government’s aim throughout the
service is progressively to introduce greater
pay flexibility in order to allow managers to
relate pay to local markets and reward
individual performance. A number of
measures are being taken to provide a more
effective workforce through better
management development, education and
training (see p. 382).
368
HEALTH AND SOCIAL SERVICES
Health Service Commissioners
There are three posts of Health Service
Commissioner (one each for England,
Scotland and Wales) for dealing with
complaints from members of the public about
the health service. The three posts are held
by the same person, who is also the
Parliamentary Commissioner for
Administration (Ombudsman), reporting
annually to Parliament (see p. 58).
The Health Service Commissioner can
investigate complaints that a person has
suffered injustice or hardship as a result of:
• a failure in a service provided by an
NHS authority;
• a failure to provide a service which an
NHS authority has a duty to provide; or
• a maladministration connected with
action taken by or on behalf of an NHS
authority.
The Health Service Commissioner’s
jurisdiction does not extend to complaints
about clinical judgment, GPs, personnel
matters and the use of a health authority’s
discretionary powers; separate procedures
exist for these. In Northern Ireland the
Commissioner for Complaints has a similar
role. An independent review of all aspects of
NHS complaints procedures is in progress.
FAMILY HEALTH SERVICES
The family health services are those given to
patients by doctors, dentists, opticians and
pharmacists of their own choice. They remain
the first point of contact most people have
with the NHS. Every year there are about
200 million consultations with family doctors
and about 30 million visits to the dentist.
Many of those who visit their family doctor
or dentist need no clinical treatment but
instead healthy lifestyle counselling and
preventive health care advice. The
Government’s longstanding policy has been
to build up and extend these services in order
to improve health and relieve pressure on the
far more costly secondary care sector.
GPs provide the first diagnosis in the case
of illness and either prescribe a suitable
course of treatment or refer a patient to the
more specialised services and hospital
consultants. About four-fifths of GPs in
Britain work in partnerships or group
practices, often as members of primary
health-care teams. The teams also include
health visitors and district nurses, and
sometimes midwives, social workers and other
professional staff employed by the health
authorities. About a quarter of GPs in Great
Britain and about half in Northern Ireland
work in health centres, where medical and
nursing services are provided. Health centres
may also have facilities for health education,
family planning, speech therapy, chiropody,
assessment of hearing, physiotherapy and
remedial exercises. Dental, pharmaceutical
and ophthalmic services, hospital out-patient
and supporting social work services, may also
be provided.
There have been substantial increases in
primary health care staff in recent years. For
example, in England between 1978 and 1991,
the number of GPs increased by 22 per cent
(to 25,700), and average patient list size fell
by 16 per cent (to over 1,900), while the
number of family dentists increased by 27 per
cent (to 15,000). The number of GP practice
nurses increased almost ninefold—to 8,800 in
1991.
Special funds have been earmarked by the
Government for improving the quality of
primary health care in inner city areas.
Efforts have also been made to improve
health services for black and ethnic minority
groups. These include new health projects in
Britain’s Chinese communities, a project in
Cardiff for the Somali refugee community,
and increased central funding for health
information material to be produced in many
minority languages.
The Government has welcomed a recent
report which recommends ways in which the
role of community pharmacists could be
developed to increase their contribution to
health care.
Eye Services
Entitlement to free NHS sight tests is
restricted to people on low incomes, children,
and those with particular medical needs.
Spectacles are supplied by registered
369
BRITAIN 1994: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
ophthalmic and dispensing opticians but
unregistered retailers may also sell spectacles
to most adults. Children, people on low
incomes and those requiring certain complex
lenses receive a voucher towards the cost of
their spectacles.
Recent Developments
GP Fundholders
GP practices with 7,000 patients or more
(6,000 in Scotland) may apply for
fundholding status. This is a voluntary
scheme which gives larger medical practices
the opportunity to manage sums of NHS
money for the benefit of their patients. It
aims to improve services for patients and
enable GPs to explore more innovative
methods of providing health care. GP
fundholders are responsible for part of their
own NHS budgets, enabling them to buy
certain non-urgent hospital services.
Prescription charges and part of the cost of
running the practice are also covered.
Fundholders may negotiate for services
directly with hospitals from both public and
private sectors in any district or regional
health authority in Britain. The scheme was
expanded in April 1993 to enable GP
fundholders to buy NHS community nursing
services for their patients, including district
nursing and health visiting services and
community psychiatric and community
mental handicap nursing.
By April 1993 over 6,700 GPs in more
than 1,340 practices in Great Britain had
become fundholders. Around a quarter of the
population are now registered with a
fundholding GP.
Contracts
The performance-related contract for GPs,
which came into effect in 1990, was the first
major reform of the family doctor service for
over 20 years. It is designed to raise
standards of care, extend the range of services
available to patients and improve patient
choice. The changes are intended to make it
easier for patients to see their GP at times
convenient to them; easier for patients to
change doctors; and to encourage doctors to
practise more preventive medicine.
The new contract for dentists, introduced
in 1990, aims at improving care and
providing more information to patients about
general dental services. As a result NHS
dental care now includes preventive care as
well as restorative treatment. All adult
patients are now offered ‘continuing care’,
and dentists are encouraged to practise more
preventive dentistry for children. There are
also incentives for dentists to undertake
further training.
Clinical Audit
Clinical audit has been introduced in all
health authorities. This is the systematic,
critical analysis by doctors at all levels in the
health service of the quality of the clinical
care they give their patients, including the
procedures used for diagnosis and treatment,
the use of resources and the resulting
outcome. In 1993-94 the Government is
allocating almost £52 million to continue to
develop clinical audit in the hospital and
community health services.
Health Visitors, District Nurses and
Midwives
Health visitors are responsible for the
preventive care and health promotion of
families, particularly those with young
children. They have a public health role
identifying local health needs and working
closely with GPs, district nurses and other
professions. District nurses give skilled
nursing care to people at home or elsewhere
outside hospital; they also play an important
role in health promotion and education.
Midwives give care, support and teaching
to women throughout pregnancy and birth
and for up to 28 days after the baby is born.
They work in hospital maternity units, health
centres and GP surgeries and in the woman’s
home. Almost all babies are born in hospital
but some antenatal care and most postnatal
care is given in the community. The care
given may be from a midwife, an obstetrician
or a GP, depending on the woman’s need
and preferences.
370
HEALTH AND SOCIAL SERVICES
HOSPITAL AND SPECIALIST SERVICES
A full range of hospital services is provided by
district general hospitals. These include
treatment and diagnostic facilities for in¬
patients, day-patients and out-patients;
maternity departments; infectious diseases
units; psychiatric and geriatric facilities;
rehabilitation facilities; and other forms of
specialised treatment. There are also specialist
hospitals or units for children, people
suffering from mental illness, those with
learning disabilities, and elderly people, and
for the treatment of specific diseases.
Examples of these include the world-famous
Hospital for Sick Children, Great Ormond
Street, and the Royal Brompton National
Heart and Lung Hospital, both in London.
Hospitals designated as teaching hospitals
combine treatment facilities with training
medical and other students, and research work.
Many of the hospitals in the NHS were
built in the 19th century; some, such as
St Bartholomew’s and St Thomas’ in London,
trace their origins to much earlier charitable
foundations.
Much has been done to improve and extend
existing hospital buildings and many new
hospitals have been or are being opened. Since
1979 in Great Britain over 700 health building
schemes, each costing £1 million or more, have
been completed. A further 371 schemes are at
various stages of development. This is the
largest sustained building programme in the
history of the NHS.
Recent policy in England and Wales has
been to provide a balanced hospital service
centred around a district general hospital,
complemented as necessary by smaller, locally
based hospitals and facilities.
A new development in hospital planning in
England and Wales is the nucleus hospital.
This is designed to accommodate a full range
of district general hospital facilities and is
capable of being built in self-contained phases
or as an extension to an existing hospital. By
mid-1993, 84 nucleus hospitals had been
completed. A further 39 are at various stages
of construction or planning. Those already
open have proved economical to build and are
providing high-quality and cost-effective
services to patients.
The world’s first low-energy nucleus
hospital, which is expected to use less than
half the energy of a conventional nucleus
hospital, opened on the Isle of Wight in
1991. A second, in Northumberland, is
expected to open later in 1993.
The hospital service is now treating more
patients a year than ever before. Between
1978 and 1991—92 lengths of stay for in¬
patients declined and the number of people
treated as day patients more than trebled, to
1.5 million.
Newer forms of treatment and
diagnosis are being made more widely
available. These include kidney
dialysis, hip replacements, laser
treatment and body scanning.
In 1986 the Government launched a drive
to reduce hospital waiting lists and times. In
England and Wales in 1993-94 nearly
£42 million is being invested in a variety of
projects, including mobile operating theatres,
to improve waiting times for patients. In
England in 1992-93 the number of patients
waiting over a year for hospital treatment fell
by 45 per cent to a record low of 56,000 (and
by almost 20 per cent to 7,000 in Wales),
while the number of patients waiting more
than two years fell from 51,000 to fewer than
1,700. Regions no longer have any patients
waiting more than two years for in-patient or
day-case treatment. Since April 1993 there
has been a new guarantee that no one should
wait more than 18 months for a hip or knee
replacement or a cataract operation.
Community services such as the
psychiatric nursing service, day hospitals, and
local authority day centres have expanded so
that more patients remain in the community
and others are sent home from hospital
sooner.
NHS Trusts
Under the NHS and Community Care Act
1990 hospitals and other health service units
(for example, ambulance services and
community health services) may apply to
become independent of local health authority
control and establish themselves as self-
371
BRITAIN 1994: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
governing NHS Trusts. The Trusts remain
within the NHS, accountable through the
NHS Management Executive to the Secretary
of State and finally to Parliament. NHS
Trusts are required to publish their business
plans and annual reports and accounts, and to
hold at least one public meeting a year.
Each NHS Trust is run by a board of
directors. Trusts are free to employ their own
staff and set their own rates of pay, although
staff transferring to Trust employment retain
their existing terms and conditions of service.
Trusts are also free to carry out research and
provide facilities for medical education and
other forms of training. They derive their
income mainly from NHS contracts to
provide services to health authorities and GP
fundholders. They may treat private patients
and generate income provided this does not
interfere with NHS obligations. By April
1993, 323 NHS Trusts were operational
in Great Britain, delivering over two-thirds
of NHS hospital and community health
services.
Private Medical Treatment
The Government’s policy is to welcome cost-
effective co-operation between the NHS and
the independent sector in meeting the
nation’s health needs. It believes that this will
benefit the NHS by adding to the resources
devoted to health care and offering flexibility
to health authorities in the delivery of
services. Some health authorities share
expensive facilities and equipment with
private hospitals, and NHS patients are
sometimes treated (at public expense) in the
private sector to reduce waiting lists. The
scale of private practice in relation to the
NHS is, however, very small.
It is estimated that about three-quarters of
those receiving acute treatment in private
hospitals or NHS hospital pay-beds are
covered by health insurance schemes, which
make provision for private health care in
return for annual subscriptions. Over 3
million people subscribe to such schemes,
half of them within group schemes, some
arranged by firms on behalf of employees.
Subscriptions often cover more than one
person (for example, members of a family)
and the total number of people covered by
private medical insurance in Britain is
estimated at over 7 million. The Government
has introduced tax relief on private health
insurance premiums paid by people aged 60
and over to encourage the increased use of
private health facilities.
Many overseas patients come to Britain for
treatment in private hospitals and clinics, and
Harley Street in London is an internationally
recognised centre for medical consultancy.
There is a growing interest in alternative
therapies such as homoeopathy and
acupuncture, which are mainly practised
outside the NHS. Under legislation passed in
1993 osteopathy became the first
complementary therapy to achieve statutory
regulation.
Organ Transplants
Over the past 25 years there have been
significant developments in transplant surgery
in Britain. The United Kingdom Transplant
Support Service Authority provides a
centralised organ matching and distribution
service. During 1992, 1,642 kidney
transplants were performed. A similar service
exists for corneas and, in 1992, 2,423 were
transplanted.
Heart transplant operations have been
conducted at Papworth Hospital in
Cambridgeshire and Harefield Hospital in
London since 1979. There are six other
designated heart transplant centres in
England, while Scotland’s first unit opened in
Glasgow in 1991.
A programme of combined heart and lung
transplants is in progress and in 1992, 325
heart, 89 lung, and 53 heart-lung transplants
were performed. The world’s first combined
heart, lungs and liver transplant operation
was carried out at Papworth in 1987.
There are six designated liver transplant
units in England and 506 liver transplants
were performed in 1992. Scotland’s first liver
transplant centre opened in Edinburgh in
1992. A voluntary organ donor card system
enables people to indicate their willingness to
become organ donors in the event of their
death. Commercial dealing in organs for
transplant is illegal.
372
HEALTH AND SOCIAL SERVICES
Blood Transfusion Services
Blood transfusion services are run by the
National Blood Authority in England, the
Scottish National Blood Transfusion Service
and the Common Health Services Agency in
Wales.
Around 2.5 million donations are given
each year by voluntary unpaid donors and
separated into many different life-saving
products for patients. Red cells, platelets and
other products with a limited ‘shelf life’ are
prepared at regional transfusion centres and
the more complex processing of plasma
products is undertaken at the Bio Products
Laboratory in Elstree (Hertfordshire) and the
Protein Fractionation Centre in Edinburgh.
Each of the three national bodies co¬
ordinates programmes for donor recruitment,
retention and education, and donor sessions
are organised regionally, in towns, villages
and workplaces. Donors are normally aged
between 18 (17 in Scotland) and 70. Regional
transfusion centres are responsible for blood
collection, screening, processing and regional
blood banks. They also provide wide-ranging
laboratory, clinical, research, teaching and
advisory services and facilities. These are
subject to nationally co-ordinated quality
audit programmes.
Britain is completely self-sufficient in
‘fresh’ blood products and the National Blood
Authority aims to meet fully the demand for
plasma products in England. Scotland is
already self-sufficient in all blood products.
Ambulance and Patient Transport
Services
NHS emergency ambulances are available free
of charge for cases of sudden illness or
collapse, and for doctors’ urgent calls. Rapid
response services, in which paramedics use
cars and motor cycles to reach emergency
cases, have been introduced in a number of
areas, particularly London and other major
cities with areas of high traffic density.
Helicopter ambulances serve many parts of
England and an integrated air ambulance
service is available throughout Scotland.
Non-emergency patient transport services
are available to NHS patients considered by
their doctor (or dentist or midwife) to be
medically unfit to travel by other means. The
principle applied is that each patient should
be able to reach hospital in a reasonable time
and in reasonable comfort, without detriment
to his or her medical condition. In many
areas the ambulance service organises
volunteer drivers to provide a hospital car
service for non-urgent patients.
Patients on income support, family credit
or with low incomes may have their travelling
expenses reimbursed. (In Scotland this also
applies to patients in the Highland and
Islands Development Area who travel 30
miles or more by land or five or more miles
by sea to hospital.)
Rehabilitation
Rehabilitation services are available for
elderly, young, disabled and mentally ill
people, and those with learning disabilities
who need such help to resume life in the
community. These services are offered in
hospitals, centres in the community and in
people’s own homes through co-ordinated
work by a range of professional workers.
Medical services may provide free artificial
limbs and eyes, hearing aids, surgical
supports, wheelchairs, and other appliances.
Following assessment, very severely
physically disabled patients may be provided
with environmental control equipment which
enables them to operate devices such as alarm
bells, radios and televisions, telephones, and
heating appliances. Nursing equipment may
be provided on loan for use in the home.
Local authorities may provide a range of
facilities to help patients in the transition
from hospital to their own homes. These
include the provision of equipment, care from
home helps, and professional help from
occupational therapists and social workers.
Voluntary organisations also provide services,
complementing the work of the statutory
agencies and widening the range of services.
Hospices
A number of hospices provide care for
terminally ill people (including children),
either directly in in-patient or day-care units
373
BRITAIN 1994: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
or through nursing and other assistance in
the patient’s own home. Control of symptoms
and psychological support for patients and
their families form central features of the
modern hospice movement, which started in
Britain and is now worldwide. Some hospices
are administered entirely by the NHS; the
rest are run by independent charities, some
receiving support from public funds. The
number of voluntary hospices has more than
doubled in the past ten years. There are
about 200 hospices in England, providing
almost 3,000 beds; and in Scotland 13
independent voluntary hospices providing
almost 230 beds.
The Government is seeking to provide a
level of public funding for the hospice
movement which matches voluntary
donations. In 1993-94, £32.3 million is being
allocated to health authorities to enable them
to offer increased support to hospices and
similar organisations, while a further £5.6
million has been allocated to enable them to
arrange for drugs to be supplied to hospices
without charge. An extra £5 million is to be
given to health authorities to help them pay
for hospice care as part of the community
care changes (see p. 384). In Scotland health
boards have been allocated £2.7 million for
1993-94 to cover 50 per cent of the running
costs of hospices in their areas and £400,000
has been provided for hospice pharmaceutical
services. The National Council for Hospice
and Specialist Palliative Care Services, which
covers England, Wales and Northern Ireland,
was launched in 1992. Its Scottish
counterpart is the Scottish Partnership
Agency for Palliative and Cancer Care,
established in 1991.
Parents and Children
Special preventive services are provided
under the health service to safeguard the
health of expectant mothers and of mothers
with young children. Services include free
dental treatment, dried milk and vitamins;
health education; and vaccination and
immunisation of children against certain
infectious diseases (see p. 379). Pregnant
women receive antenatal care from their GPs
and hospital clinics, and women in paid
employment have the right to visit the
clinics during working hours. Some 99 per
cent of women have their babies in hospital,
returning home shortly afterwards to be
attended by a midwife or health visitor and,
where necessary, their GP.
The Government attaches great
importance to improving the quality of
maternity services, and to making them
more responsive to women’s wishes on how
care is provided. A government report
published in August 1993 recommends
giving women greater choice over the care
they receive during pregnancy and
childbirth.
A comprehensive programme of health
surveillance is provided for pre-school
children in clinics run by the community
health authorities, and increasingly by GPs.
This enables doctors, dentists and health
visitors to oversee the physical and mental
health and development of pre-school
children. Information on preventive services
is given and welfare foods are distributed.
The school health service offers health care
and advice for schoolchildren, including
medical and dental inspection and treatment
where necessary.
Child guidance and child psychiatric
services provide help and advice to families
and children with psychological or emotional
problems.
In recent years special efforts have been
made to improve co-operation between the
community-based child health services and
local authority social services for children.
This is particularly important in the
prevention of child abuse and for the health
and welfare of children in care.
Human Fertilisation and Embryology
The world’s first ‘test-tube baby’ was born in
Britain in 1978, as a result of the technique
of in vitro fertilisation. This opened up new
horizons for helping with problems of
infertility and for the science of embryology.
The social, ethical and legal implications
were examined by a committee of inquiry
under Baroness Warnock (1984) and led
eventually to the passage of the Human
Fertilisation and Embryology Act 1990.
374
HEALTH AND SOCIAL SERVICES
I his Act set up the Human Fertilisation
and Embryology Authority (HFEA) to
control and license centres providing certain
infertility treatments and centres undertaking
human embryo research and storage of
gametes and embryos.
It also:
• permitted research to be carried out on
embryos for up to 14 days after
fertilisation;
• defined the legal status and rights of
children born as a result of in vitro
fertilisation and techniques involving
donation; and
• clarified the legal position on surrogate
motherhood (the practice where one
woman bears a child for another).
The HFEA maintains a code of practice
giving guidance about licensed centres and
reports annually to Parliament. These
provisions constitute one of the most
comprehensive pieces of legislation on
assisted reproduction and embryo research in
the world.
Legislation to ban commercial surrogacy
agencies, and advertising of or for surrogacy
services, was passed in 1985.
Family Planning
Free family planning advice and treatment
are available to women from family doctors
and from health authority family planning
clinics, which also make services available to
men. The Health of the Nation White Paper
(see p. 365) recognises the need for providing
effective family planning services for people
who want them.
Abortion
The Abortion Act 1967, as amended in 1990,
allows the ending of a pregnancy of up to 24
weeks by a doctor if two doctors consider
that continuing the pregnancy would involve
greater risk of injury to the physical or
mental health of the woman (or to any
existing children of the family) than having
an abortion. There are three categories in
which no time limit applies: where there is a
risk of grave permanent injury to the physical
or mental health of the woman; where there
is a substantial risk of fetal handicap; or
where continuing the pregnancy would
involve a risk to the life of the pregnant
woman greater than that of the pregnancy
being terminated. The Act does not apply in
Northern Ireland.
In 1991, 179,522 legal abortions were
performed in England and Wales,
compared with 186,912 in 1990, a decrease
of 4 per cent. This was the first decrease
in the annual number of abortions since
1983.
Drug Misuse
The misuse of dangerous drugs, such as
heroin, cocaine and amphetamines, is a
serious social and health problem, and the
Government has made the fight against such
misuse a major priority. Its strategy
comprises action to reduce the supply of
illicit drugs from abroad; to promote more
effective law enforcement by the police and
Customs services; and to maintain tight
controls on medicinal drugs that can be
misused. It also includes action to maintain
effective deterrents against misuse; to
develop effective programmes to treat and
rehabilitate misusers; and to prevent people
who are not misusers from starting, through
educational programmes and publicity
campaigns.
Research on various aspects of drug
misuse is funded by several government
departments. The Government is advised
on a wide range of matters relating to
drug misuse and connected social problems
by the Advisory Council on the Misuse of
Drugs.
Drug Statistics
Recent drug statistics show that between
1991 and 1992:
• the number of notified drug addicts
increased by 19 per cent (to 24,700)—
in line with the prevailing upward
trend—while the number of new addicts
notified increased by 21 per cent to
9,700.
375
BRITAIN 1994: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
• the proportion of those notified who are
addicted to heroin, the most frequently
reported drug, fell to below 70 per cent
but this is balanced by an increase in
notifications of addiction to methadone,
which now accounts for over 40 per cent
of notifications.
• fewer than 10 per cent were reported to
be addicted to cocaine although the
proportion is increasing;
• in general the highest numbers of all
categories of notified addicts are to be
found in London and the north west of
England; and
• the proportion of addicts injecting drugs
continues to fall and now represents 54
per cent of the total.
Prevention
The Government began a major national
publicity campaign in 1985 to persuade
young people not to take drugs, and to advise
parents, teachers and other professionals on
how to recognise and combat the problem.
Subsequent phases of the campaign have
warned of the dangers of heroin misuse and
of the risks of transmitting HIV, the virus
which causes AIDS (see p. 379), through the
sharing of injecting equipment. Since
1991-92 the focus of the campaign has
changed to give greater emphasis to locally-
based campaigns.
A major initiative in November 1992,
during Britain’s presidency of the
European Community, was European
Drug Prevention Week. This was
marked by events throughout Europe,
including a range of activities in
Britain at European, national and
local levels, where the week focused
on raising awareness among young
people of the dangers of drug and
solvent misuse.
The Drugs Prevention Initiative provides
funding for local drug prevention teams in 20
areas in England, Scotland and Wales. Their
task is to strengthen community resistance to
drug misuse. The total budget for the
initiative is £5.8 million in 1993-94. Separate
measures have been introduced in Scotland to
discourage drug misuse through publicity
campaigns and action in the education service
and the community. A recent initiative has
been the establishment of Drugline Scotland,
a free government-funded telephone line,
giving confidential advice.
The Government continues to make funds
available for local education authorities in
England and Wales to appoint staff to
promote and co-ordinate preventive work in
their areas, especially for anti-drug misuse
work in schools. As part of the National
Curriculum (see p. 408), children in primary
and secondary schools receive education on
the dangers of drug misuse.
Treatment and Rehabilitation
Funds have been made available to health
authorities since 1986-87 for developing and
expanding services for drug misusers. Further
funding has also been allocated to help
prevent the spread of HIV among and from
injecting drug misusers. This includes
schemes providing counselling and the
exchange of clean for used injecting
equipment—£2.7 million is being allocated in
1993-94 to expand the provision of needle
exchange schemes within pharmacies.
The total amount available to health
authorities in 1993-94 is over £24 million. In
addition, a grant was introduced in 1991-92
to help local authorities develop voluntary
sector services for alcohol and drug misusers.
The grant (£3.3 million in 1993-94) has been
successful in encouraging the involvement of
local authorities in the provision of social care
for drug users and increased local
collaboration between agencies. Similar
projects are in progress in Wales and in
Scotland, where over £3 million and £2.4
million respectively is made available each
year for the support of drug misuse services.
The Health of the Nation White Paper (see
p. 365) set out targets for reducing by at least
75 per cent by the year 2000 the percentage
of injecting drug misusers who report having
shared needles in the previous four weeks.
Treatment for drug dependence is
provided mainly on an out-patient basis.
376
HEALTH AND SOCIAL SERVICES
Many hospitals provide specialist treatment
for drug misusers, mainly in psychiatric units,
or have special drug treatment units. An
increasing number of GPs also treat drug
misusers, but only certain specialist doctors
are licensed to prescribe heroin, cocaine and
dipipanone (Diconal). All doctors must notify
the authorities of any patient they consider to
be addicted to certain controlled drugs, and
guidelines on good medical practice in the
treatment of drug misuse are issued to
doctors.
Other Sources of Provision
A number of non-statutory agencies work
with and complement the health service
provision. Advice and rehabilitation services
including residential facilities, for example,
are provided mainly by voluntary
organisations. Support in the community is
provided by the probation service and local
social services departments (and in Scotland
by social work departments).
Solvent Misuse
Action is also being taken by the Government
to curb solvent misuse (the breathing in of
vapour from glue, lighter fuel and other
substances to achieve a change in mental
state) by young people. There were 122
deaths as a result of solvent abuse in Britain
in 1991. In England and Wales it is an
offence to supply such substances to children
under 18 if the supplier knows or has reason
to believe they are to be used to cause
intoxication. In Scotland proceedings can be
taken under the common law. Government
policy is directed towards preventing solvent
misuse through the education of young
people, parents and professionals and, where
practicable, restricting the sales of solvent-
based liquefied gas and aerosol products to
young people. In 1992 the Government
launched a national publicity campaign on
solvent misuse intended to raise parental
awareness of the problem.
Smoking
Cigarette smoking is the greatest preventable
cause of illness and death in Britain. It
accounts for around 110,000 premature
deaths and an estimated 50 million lost
working days each year, and costs the NHS
an estimated £500 million a year for the
treatment of diseases caused by smoking (for
example, heart disease, lung cancer and
bronchitis). In addition, smoking by pregnant
women can cause low birth weight in infants.
The Government is following an active health
education policy supported by voluntary
agreements with the tobacco industry aimed
at reducing the level of smoking.
Health Education
The Government aims to reduce adult
smoking in England from the present 30 per
cent to 20 per cent by the year 2000. A
further aim is to reduce smoking by young
people by one-third between 1988 and 1994.
Smoking is also being tackled as a priority in
Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland and
similar targets have been set for the year
2000.
A five-year programme, costing £2.6
million a year, started in 1989; in late 1991
the Government launched a programme
costing £500,000 a year to alert women to the
dangers of smoking during pregnancy.
Education on the harmful effects of smoking
is included in the National Curriculum for all
pupils in publicly maintained schools in
England and Wales.
The Government also supports the work
of the voluntary organisation Action on
Smoking and Health (ASH), whose services
include a workplace services consultancy,
offering advice and help to employers in
formulating smoking policies. The
Government is committed to creating a
smoke-free environment, with facilities where
appropriate for those who wish to smoke. In
1991 it published a code of practice on
smoking in public places. Health authorities
have been asked to promote non-smoking as
the normal practice in health service
buildings and to give help and advice to
people who want to give up smoking. The
Independent Scientific Committee on
Smoking and Health estimated that ‘passive
smoking’, especially in the workplace and the
377
BRITAIN 1994: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
home, may cause several hundred deaths
through lung cancer every year.
Voluntary Agreements
Voluntary agreements between the
Government and the tobacco industry
regulate the advertising and promotion of
tobacco products, and sports sponsorship by
the industry. The agreement on tobacco
advertising provides for the use on posters of
six different health warnings about the
dangers of smoking and contains measures to
protect groups at particular risk, such as
children, young people and women in early
child-bearing years. Under the revised
agreement, which came into force in 1992,
new tougher health warnings now appear on
tobacco advertising, and shopfront advertising
is to be reduced by 50 per cent by 1996. The
voluntary agreement on sports sponsorship
covers levels of spending, restrictions on
sponsorship of events chiefly for spectators
under 18 years and controls over the siting of
advertising at televised events.
Legislative Measures
It is illegal to sell any type of tobacco
product to children; the maximum fine is
£2,500. All tobacco advertising is banned on
television and cigarette advertisements are
banned on radio. Oral snuff products have
been banned since January 1993.
Alcohol Misuse
Alcohol is consumed by over 90 per cent of
the population. About 28 per cent of men
and 11 per cent of women drink to an extent
that may put their health at risk. An
estimated 8 million working days each year
are lost through alcohol-related absenteeism.
The total cost to society of alcohol misuse
has been estimated at £2,500 million.
The Government’s view, as set out in
the Health of the Nation White Paper (see
p. 365), is that the consumption of alcohol
in sensible quantities and in appropriate
circumstances provides many people with
enjoyment. Drinking fewer than 21 units of
alcohol a week by men and 14 units a week
by women is unlikely to damage health. (A
unit is 8 grammes of pure alcohol, roughly
equivalent to half a pint of ordinary strength
beer or lager; or a glass of wine; or a pub
measure of spirits.) The British medical
profession advises that sustained drinking
above these levels progressively increases the
health risk, and that drinking over 50 units a
week by men and over 35 units by women is
definitely dangerous.
The White Paper includes targets for
reducing the proportion of people drinking
over sensible limits by the year 2005 and sets
out a programme of action by government
departments, health and local authorities, the
independent sector, employers and the
alcohol industry.
Part of the funds of the Health Education
Authority (see p. 380) are for promoting the
sensible drinking message in England, and
equivalent bodies are similarly funded in
other parts of Britain. At local level this
requires co-ordinated action by a wide range
of organisations with an interest in the use or
misuse of alcohol. In England regional health
authorities are funded to employ alcohol
misuse co-ordinators to develop this work.
Treatment and rehabilitation within the
NHS include in-patient and out-patient
services in general and psychiatric hospitals
and specialised alcoholism treatment units.
Primary care teams (GPs, nurses and social
workers) and voluntary organisations
providing treatment and rehabilitation in
hostels, day centres and advisory services,
also play an important role.
The development of services to help
problem drinkers and their families is being
taken forward within the framework of
community care. Local authorities are
required to identify the need for alcohol
misuse services in their area, and to list the
services provided in their community care
plans (see p. 384). They are then responsible
for arranging for the needs of individuals
with alcohol problems to be assessed, and for
buying an appropriate course of care.
There is close co-operation between
statutory and voluntary organisations. In
England the voluntary agency Alcohol
Concern, which is receiving a government
grant of £612,000 for 1993-94, plays a
378
HEALTH AND SOCIAL SERVICES
prominent role in training for professional
and voluntary workers, and improving the
network of voluntary agencies and their
collaboration with statutory bodies in the
prevention of misuse.
In 1990 Alcohol Concern launched a
workplace advisory service as part of a
campaign to persuade companies that alcohol
misuse is an industrial as well as a social
problem. Between 1991-92 and 1995-96 a
total government contribution of £6 million is
being allocated to Alcohol Concern for
improving and extending the network of care,
advisory and counselling services. In addition,
a grant of £2.3 million is being paid to local
authorities during 1993-94 to assist voluntary
agencies in improving and extending
provision for alcohol and drug misusers. The
Scottish Council on Alcohol undertakes
similar work in Scotland, with the help of a
government grant (£135,000 in 1993-94).
Research and surveys on various aspects of
alcohol misuse are funded by several
government departments.
AIDS
Up to the end of June 1993 a total of 7,699
cases of AIDS had been reported in Britain,
of whom 4,794 (62 per cent) had died; the
total number of recognised HIV infections
was 20,035. While this is recognised as a
considerable underestimate of the true
numbers of infections, attempts to contain the
spread of HIV infection have nevertheless
been successful and Britain now has one of
the lowest estimated rates of HIV prevalence
in Western Europe.
Government Strategy
The Government considers that the
momentum of HIV prevention work must be
sustained if this relatively favourable position
is to be maintained. The latest medium-term
predictions show that new cases of AIDS
among homosexual men are levelling out and
declining among injecting drug misusers, but
there is a steady increase in cases of HIV
infection through heterosexual contact.
Key elements of the Government’s
strategy for dealing with the disease include:
• encouraging appropriate behaviour
change by increased targeting of sections
of the population at particular risk,
including homosexual and bisexual men
and drug misusers;
• sustaining and improving general public
awareness;
• continuing to make HIV testing facilities
more widely known, and encouraging
health authorities to commission
additional accessible HIV testing sites;
and
• continued funding for the voluntary
sector.
The Government’s commitment to policies in
this area is demonstrated by its inclusion of
HIV/AIDS with sexual health as one of the
five key areas in the Health of the Nation
White Paper (see p. 365). A concerted
approach is being maintained, spanning
government, the NHS, local authorities and
the voluntary sector (including women’s
groups, Britain’s faith communities and
organisations working with ethnic minorities).
Details of Britain’s contribution to
international co-operation on AIDS are given
in Chapter 20.
Voluntary Organisations
Voluntary agencies concerned with
HIV/AIDS include the Terrence Higgins
Trust, London Lighthouse and Scottish
AIDS Monitor, which promote knowledge
about the disease and help people with AIDS
and HIV. Both London Lighthouse and the
Mildmay Mission Hospital, in London,
provide hospice care and community support.
The Government will continue distributing
grants on a yearly basis taking into account
developing health priorities and the ability of
voluntary bodies to raise funds from other
sources for HIV/AIDS work.
Infectious Diseases
District health authorities (health boards in
Scotland and Northern Ireland) carry out
programmes of immunisation against
diphtheria, measles, mumps, rubella,
poliomyelitis, tetanus, tuberculosis and
379
BRITAIN 1994: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
whooping cough. A new immunisation, ‘Rib’,
was introduced in 1992, offering protection
against invasive haemophilus disease, a major
cause of meningitis in children under five
years. More than 5 million doses are being
made available during the first year of the
campaign, sufficient to immunise every child
under four with the appropriate dose.
Immunisation is voluntary, but parents are
encouraged to protect their children. The
proportion of children being vaccinated has
been increasing since the end of 1978. In
1990 the Government introduced special
payments to GPs who achieve targets of 70
and 90 per cent uptake of child
immunisation. The response has been
encouraging in many areas and the
Government estimates that almost 90 per
cent of GPs now earn bonus payments for
meeting such targets.
The Public Health Laboratory Service
provides a network of bacteriological and
virological laboratories throughout England
and Wales which conduct research and assist
in the diagnosis, prevention and control of
communicable diseases. Similar facilities are
provided in Scotland by the Communicable
Diseases (Scotland) Unit and, as in Northern
Ireland, in some hospital laboratories.
Cancer Screening
Breast cancer is recognised as a major health
problem in Britain. Some 13,000 women die
from it each year and 1 in 14 women in
England will develop it. To help combat this,
the Government has set up a national
screening programme under which women
aged between 50 and 64 are invited for
mammography (breast X-ray) every three
years by computerised call and recall systems.
Nearly 1,900 women die each year in
Great Britain from cancer of the cervix, and
the Government has, similarly, set up a
nationwide cervical screening programme. All
district health authorities in England and
Wales have computerised call and recall
systems which enable all women aged
between 20 and 64 to be invited at least every
five years to have a smear test. Similar
arrangements apply in Scotland (where the
age range is 20 to 60) and in Northern
Ireland. Special payments are made to GPs
who achieve uptake targets for smear tests of
50 and 80 per cent.
The reduction of deaths and illness from
cancer is a key area in the Government’s
Health of the Nation White Paper (see
p. 365). The targets set are:
• to reduce breast cancer deaths among
women invited for screening by at least
25 per cent by the year 2000; and
• to reduce the incidence of invasive
cervical cancer by at least 20 per cent by
the year 2000.
Health Education
In England health education is promoted by
the Health Education Authority, a part of the
NHS. Its functions are to:
• advise the Government on health
education;
• plan and carry out health education
programmes in co-operation with health
authorities and other bodies; and
• sponsor research and evaluation.
In addition, the Authority has the major
executive responsibility for public education
in Britain about AIDS. It also assists in the
provision of training, and provides a national
centre of information and advice on health
education. Major campaigns carried out by
the Authority include those focusing on
coronary heart disease (represented by the
‘Look After Your Heart’ initiative), smoking
and alcohol misuse. The Government has
allocated some £36 million to the Authority
for health education in England for 1993-94.
In Wales health education is undertaken
by the Welsh Health Promotion Authority.
The Health Education Board for Scotland
and the Northern Ireland Health Promotion
Agency are responsible for health education
in their areas.
Almost all health authorities have their
own health education service, which works
closely with health professionals, health
visitors, community groups, local employers
and others to determine the most suitable
local programmes. Increased resources in the
health service are being directed towards
380
HEALTH AND SOCIAL SERVICES
health education and preventive measures.
Since July 1993 GPs have received special
annual payments for health promotion
programmes.
Healthier Eating
There has been growing public awareness in
recent years of the importance of a healthy
diet. The Health of the Nation White Paper
(see p. 365) followed the recommendations of
the Committee on Medical Aspects of Food
Policy (COMA) that people should reduce
their average intakes of total fat and saturated
fatty acids in order to reduce the burden of
cardiovascular disease. Dietary targets have
been set and a Nutrition Task Force has been
established to advise on the most effective
means of achieving them.
Nutritional labelling indicating the energy,
fat, protein and carbohydrate content of food
is being encouraged on a voluntary basis.
Some supermarket chains have already
introduced voluntary labelling schemes. To
help people reduce their fat intake, the
Government has issued guidelines on the
labelling of food to show nutrient content in a
standard format.
Current work by COMA includes a review
of the relationship between diet and
cardiovascular disease and between diet and
cancer; and matters relating to the nutrition
of infants and children. Its recent reports
have included comprehensive information on
dietary reference values for food energy and
nutrients (1991); and the nutritional needs of
elderly people (1992).
The Health Education Authority in
England and its counterparts in Scotland,
Wales and Northern Ireland, have all run
public information campaigns promoting
healthy eating.
ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH
Environmental health officers employed by
local authorities are responsible for a range of
functions, including the control of air
pollution and noise, and food hygiene and
safety. Their duties also cover the
occupational health and safety aspects of a
variety of premises, including offices and
shops; the investigation of unfit housing; and
in some instances refuse collection and home
safety.
Doctors who specialise in community
medicine and are employed by the health
authorities advise local authorities on the
medical aspects of environmental health,
infectious diseases and food poisoning. They
may also co-operate with the authorities
responsible for water supply and sewerage.
Environmental health officers at ports and
airports carry out duties concerned with
shipping, inspection of imported foods, and
disease control. In Northern Ireland district
councils are responsible for noise control;
collection and disposal of refuse; clean air;
and food composition, labelling and hygiene.
Safety of Food
It is illegal to supply food unfit for human
consumption or to apply any treatment or
process to food which makes it harmful to
health. Places where food or drink is
prepared, handled, stored or sold must
comply with certain hygiene provisions.
Environmental health officers may take away
for examination samples of any food intended
for sale or human consumption. Specific
regulations control the safety of particular
foods such as milk, meat, ice-cream and
shellfish. The Food Safety Directorate within
the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and
Food ensures the safety and quality of
Britain’s food. The Directorate works closely
with the health departments, which are
responsible for the public health aspects of
food safety. A consumer panel gives
consumers a direct means of conveying their
views on food safety and consumer protection
issues to the Government.
Expert committees advise the Government
on microbiological and chemical food safety,
novel foods and processes, and veterinary
products. The independent Advisory
Committee on the Microbiological Safety of
Food, for example, assesses the risks to
human health from micro-organisms in food
and drink and advises Ministers where
appropriate.
The Food Safety Act 1990 emphasises the
importance of food safety and consumer
381
BRITAIN 1994: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
protection throughout the food chain. The
Act applies to England, Wales and Scotland
and introduced wider powers and greatly
increased penalties for offenders. As a
defence, food companies may show that they
have taken all reasonable precautions to avoid
committing an offence. Specific regulations
govern the temperatures at which foods such
as cooked meats should be stored. Separate,
but similar, legislation exists in Northern
Ireland.
A new public body, the Institute for
Environment and Health, is to be established
by the Medical Research Council (see below).
This will be concerned mainly with chemical
hazards to which people may be exposed
through the environment.
SAFETY OF MEDICINES
The health and agriculture ministers are
responsible for the licensing of medicines for
human and veterinary use. The Medicines
Commission advises the ministers on policy.
The Committees on Safety of Medicines and
on Dental and Surgical Materials advise on
the safety and quality of medicinal products
for human use. Both committees also monitor
adverse reactions to drugs. Legislation also
controls the advertising, labelling, packaging,
distribution, sale and supply of medicinal
products.
RESEARCH
In 1992-93 the Department of Health in
England spent about £25 million on health
and personal social services research, in
addition to expenditure by the Medical
Research Council (the main government
agency for the support of biomedical and
clinical research—see Chapter 19). Priority
areas include research into health promotion
and the prevention of ill health,
environmental health, adult health and child
care.
In England the Director of Research and
Development at the Department of Health
advises ministers on all aspects of health
research; Wales also participates in the
Department of Health’s programme of
centrally commissioned research. In Scotland
the directly funded programme is
administered by the Chief Scientist of the
Scottish Office Home and Health
Department.
The strategy for the NHS research and
development programme aims to ensure that
health service care is based on high-quality
research relevant to improving the health of
the nation. The programme is managed by
the regional health authorities, which are
developing their own research plans. It is
intended that up to 1.5 per cent of NHS
expenditure will be used for research and
development by 1997.
The Department of Health is involved in
international research and development, and
takes part in the European Community’s
medical and public health research
programme.
THE HEALTH PROFESSIONS
Doctors and Dentists
Only people on the medical or dentists’
registers may practise as doctors or dentists
in the NHS. University medical and dental
schools are responsible for teaching; the NHS
provides hospital facilities for training. Full
registration as a doctor requires five or six
years’ training in a medical school and
hospital, with a further year’s experience in a
hospital. For a dentist, five years’ training at
a dental school is required.
An extensive review of postgraduate
medical education was carried out in 1992-93
and is expected to lead to considerable
improvements in junior doctors’ education
and training, including a significant reduction
in the time which individual doctors spend in
the training grades.
The regulating body for the medical
profession is the General Medical Council
and, for dentists, the General Dental Council.
The main professional associations are the
British Medical Association and the British
Dental Association.
Nurses
The minimum period of training required to
qualify for registration as a first level nurse in
382
HEALTH AND SOCIAL SERVICES
general, mental health, mental handicap, or
children’s nursing is normally three years.
Midwifery training for registered general
nurses takes 18 months, and for those
entering midwifery directly, three years.
Health visitors are registered general nurses
who have completed a one-year course in
health visiting. District nurses are registered
general nurses who practise within the
community. They must complete a six-month
course (nine months in Northern Ireland)
followed by a period of supervised practice in
district nursing.
Project 2000 is a new system for training
nurses, designed to make nursing education
more attractive and to give nurses a broader
based education, enabling them to work in
hospitals or the community without extensive
further training. In 1993-94 the Government
is allocating £114 million to fund the scheme
in England, where nearly all nursing schools
are now approved to offer Project 2000
courses; comparable arrangements are being
made in other parts of Britain.
I he United Kingdom Central Council for
Nursing, Midwifery and Health Visiting is
responsible for regulating and registering
these professions.
Pharmacists
Only people on the register of pharmaceutical
chemists may practise as pharmacists.
Registration requires three or four years’
training in a school of pharmacy, followed by
one year’s practical experience in a
community or hospital pharmacy approved
for training by the Royal Pharmaceutical
Society of Great Britain or the
Pharmaceutical Society of Northern Ireland
(regulatory bodies for the profession).
Opticians
The General Optical Council regulates the
professions of ophthalmic optician and
dispensing optician. Only registered
ophthalmic opticians (or registered
ophthalmic medical practitioners) may test
sight. Training of ophthalmic opticians takes
four years, including a year of practical
experience under supervision. Dispensing
opticians take a two-year full-time course
with a year’s practical experience or follow a
part-time day-release course while employed
with an optician.
Other Health Professions
State registration may also be obtained by
chiropodists, dietitians, medical laboratory
scientific officers, occupational therapists,
orthoptists, physiotherapists and
radiographers. The governing bodies are
seven boards, corresponding to the
professions, under the general supervision
of the Council for Professions
Supplementary to Medicine. Training lasts
one to four years and only those who are
state registered may be employed in the
NHS and some other public services.
Dental therapists (who have taken a two-
year training course) and dental hygienists
(with a training course of about a year) may
carry out some simple dental work under
the supervision of a registered dentist.
In 1990 a new group of NHS staff—
health care assistants—began work in
hospitals and the community. They are
intended to support the work of more
highly qualified staff.
National and Scottish Vocational
Qualifications (NVQs and SVQs—see
p. 415) have been developed for health care
support workers, ambulance personnel,
operating department practitioners,
physiological measurement technicians and
administrative and clerical staff. In addition,
a new NVQjn Care has been launched for
staff in social services and health care.
HEALTH ARRANGEMENTS WITH
OTHER COUNTRIES
The member states of the European
Community have special health
arrangements under which Community
nationals resident in a member state are
entitled to receive emergency treatment,
either free or at a reduced cost, during
visits to other Community countries. There
are also arrangements for referral for
specific treatment in certain circumstances
and to cover people who go to work or live
383
BRITAIN 1994: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
in other Community countries. In addition,
there are reciprocal arrangements with some
other countries under which medical
treatment is available to visitors to Britain if
required immediately. Visitors are generally
expected to pay if the purpose of their visit
is to seek medical treatment. Visitors who
are not covered by reciprocal arrangements
must pay for any medical treatment they
receive.
Personal Social Services
Personal social services assist elderly people,
disabled people and their carers, children
and young people, people with mental illness
or learning disabilities, and families. Major
services include skilled residential and day
care, help for people confined to their
homes, and the various forms of social work.
The statutory services are provided by local
government social services authorities in
England and Wales, social work departments
in Scotland, and health and social services
boards in Northern Ireland. Alongside these
providers are the many and varied
contributions made by independent private
and voluntary services. Much of the care
given to elderly and disabled people is
provided by families and self-help groups.
Demand for these services is rising
because of the increasing number of elderly
people, who, along with disabled and
mentally ill people, or those with learning
disabilities, can lead more normal lives in the
community, given suitable support and
facilities. The share of health authority
resources devoted to community care
services increased from 8.4 per cent in
1978-79 to just over 13 per cent in 1990-91.
The shift away from long-term hospital
care to care in the community is reflected in
recent hospital statistics. Average length of
stay in the geriatric hospital sector has
declined by around 9 per cent a year since
1978 and the numbers of occupied bed days
in the mental health and learning disabilities
sectors fell by 30 and 50 per cent
respectively between 1978 and 1990-91.
Personal social services staff increased by
some 25 per cent between 1978-79 and
1990-91, the most significant increases being
in social work staff, day care and home helps.
In the residential care group, increases in
staff in adult services have been offset by
reductions in the staff in children’s homes.
Management Reforms
New policies on community care in England,
Wales and Scotland have been implemented
in stages under the NHS and Community
Care Act 1990. In Northern Ireland similar
arrangements were introduced in April 1993
under equivalent legislation. Many of the
procedures which local authorities are
implementing correspond to similar
procedures being introduced in the NHS (see
p. 364). Local authorities increasingly act as
enablers and commissioners of services on an
assessment of their populations’ needs for
social care.
• Since April 1991 inspection units have
been responsible for inspecting local
authority as well as private and voluntary
sector residential care homes, and local
authorities have had to have procedures
for dealing with complaints about their
social services.
• Since April 1992 local authorities have
been obliged to produce community care
plans after wide consultation with the
NHS and other interests.
• Since April 1993 new procedures for
assessing individuals’ care needs and
commissioning services to meet them
have been introduced.
Local authorities are now responsible for
funding and arranging social care in the
community for people who require public
support. This includes the provision of home
helps or home care assistants to support
people in their own homes, and making
arrangements for residential and nursing
home care for those no longer able to remain
in their own homes. Previously, residents of
these homes who obtained public funding
received help principally through special
higher levels of income support (see p. 396).
To accompany their new responsibilities the
Government has transferred resources from
the Department of Social Security to local
authorities for three years (1993-94 to
384
HEALTH AND SOCIAL SERVICES
1995-96). In 1993-94 the transfer in England
amounts to £399 million; in Scotland it is
£41 million; in Wales £27.5 million; and in
Northern Ireland £24.6 million.
Elderly People
Between 1981 and 1991:
• the number of people over 60 in Great
Britain increased by about 500,000; little
change is expected over the period 1991
to 1996;
• the number of people aged over 75 grew
to nearly 4 million (an increase of about
one-fifth) and this will be reflected in
a future increase in the number aged
over 80.
Between 1978-79 and 1990-91 total
spending on health services for elderly people
increased by 41 per cent and net spending on
social services by 52 per cent in real terms.
About 5 per cent of those aged 65 or over
live in residential homes.
Services for elderly people are designed to
help them live at home whenever possible.
These services may include advice and help
given by social workers, domestic help, the
provision of meals in the home, sitters-in,
night attendants and laundry services as well
as day centres, lunch clubs and recreational
facilities. Adaptations to the home can
overcome a person’s difficulties in moving
about, and a wide range of equipment is
available for people with difficulties affecting
their hearing or eyesight. Alarm systems have
been developed to help elderly people obtain
assistance in an emergency. In some areas
‘good neighbour’ and visiting services are
arranged by the local authority or a voluntary
organisation.
Many local authorities provide free or
subsidised travel for elderly people within
their areas. Local authorities also provide
residential care for elderly people and those
in poor health.
As part of their responsibility for public
housing, local authorities provide homes
designed for elderly people; some of these
developments have resident wardens. Housing
associations and private builders also build
such accommodation.
Disabled People
Britain has an estimated 6 million adults with
one or more disabilities, of whom around
400,000 (7 per cent) live in communal
establishments. Over the past ten years there
has been increasing emphasis on rehabilitation
and on the provision of day, domiciliary and
respite support services to enable disabled
people to live independently in the
community wherever possible.
Local social services authorities help with
social rehabilitation and adjustment to
disability. They are required to identify the
number of disabled people in their area and
to publicise services, which may include
advice on personal and social problems
arising from disability, as well as
occupational, educational, social and
recreational facilities, either at day centres or
elsewhere. Other services provided may
include adaptations to homes (such as ramps
for wheelchairs, and ground-floor toilets); the
delivery of cooked meals; and help in the
home. In cases of special need, help may be
given with installing a telephone or a
television. Local authorities and voluntary
organisations may provide severely disabled
people with residential accommodation or
temporary facilities to allow their carers relief
from their duties. Specially designed housing
may be available for those able to look after
themselves.
Some authorities provide free or
subsidised travel for disabled people on
public transport, and they are encouraged to
provide special means of access to public
buildings. Special government regulations
cover the provision of access for disabled
people in the construction of new buildings.
The Independent Living Fund was set up
in 1988 to provide financial help to very
severely disabled people who need paid
domestic support to enable them to live in
their own homes. During 1992-93 an
estimated 22,000 people received help from
the Fund. The Fund, for which the
Government provided £77 million in
1992-93, ceased to operate in April 1993.
People needing such help are now catered for
under the mainstream arrangements for
community care.
385
BRITAIN 1994: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
The Government introduced two trusts
from April 1993:
• the first continues to support those
people receiving help from the Fund at
the time of its closure and ensures
continuity in the care arrangements of
all existing beneficiaries; and
• the second helps the most severely
disabled people of working age to live
independently in the community. It
works in partnership with local
authorities, which are expected to make
a contribution in the form of services
equivalent to what they would have
spent on residential or nursing care.
In 1991 the Government committed £3
million for a pilot scheme in England—the
National Disability Information Project—
designed to improve information services for
disabled people, their carers and service
providers. Twelve projects are being funded
until 1994 to explore ways in which the
voluntary and statutory agencies can work
together to provide information services
aimed at satisfying the needs of users.
Similar projects are being supported in
Wales.
People with Learning Disabilities
(Mental Handicap)
The Governpienf s policy is to encourage the
development of local services for people
with learning disabilities and their families
through co-operation between health and
local authorities, and voluntary and other
organisations.
Local authority social service departments
are the lead statutory agency for planning
and arranging services for people with
learning disabilities. They provide such
services as short-term care, support for
families in their own homes, residential
accommodation and support for various
types of activities outside the home. The
main aims are to ensure that as far as
possible people with learning disabilities can
lead full lives in their communities and that
no one is admitted to hospital unless it is
necessary on health grounds.
The NHS provides specialist services
where the general health needs of people with
learning disabilities cannot be met by
ordinary NHS services, and residential care
for those with severe disabilities or
whose needs can only effectively be met by
the NHS.
Mentally 111 People
Government policy aims to ensure that
people with mental illnesses should have
access to all the services they need as locally
as possible. These services should be based
on a comprehensive network of health and
social services facilities in each district. They
should be community based and easily
accessible.
In England between 1981 and 1991 the
number of community psychiatric nurses
more than trebled (to 3,600); places in day
hospitals increased by 75 per cent (to 22,700).
Between 1979 and 1991 places in local
authority residential homes grew by over 25
per cent (to 4,500); local authority day centre
places more than doubled to 15,100.
Arrangements made by social services
authorities for providing preventive care and
after care for mentally ill people in the
community include day centres, social centres
and residential care. Social workers help
patients and their families with problems
caused by mental illness. In some cases they
can apply for a mentally disordered person to
be compulsorily admitted to and detained in
hospital. The Mental Health Act Commission
aims to provide improved safeguards for such
patients. Similar arrangements apply in
Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland.
Since April 1991 district health authorities
(health boards in Scotland) have been
required to plan individual health and social
care programmes for all patients leaving
hospital and for all new patients accepted by
the specialist psychiatric services. Other
measures include a review of public funding
of voluntary organisations concerned with
mental health and a new grant (some £51
million for 1993-94) to local authorities to
encourage them to increase the level of social
care available to mentally ill patients,
including those with dementia who need
specialist psychiatric care in the community.
386
HEALTH AND SOCIAL SERVICES
The Government plans to introduce
legislation to provide a new power of
supervised discharge for mentally ill
patients who need special support after
they leave hospital.
The first government-backed national
survey of mental illness began in April
1993 and will be completed in 1995. The
survey, which covers adults aged 16 to 64
living in communal establishments as well
as those living in private households, will
estimate the prevalence of different types
of mental illness and will identify the
resulting social disabilities. It will also
examine the varying use of health, social
and voluntary care services, and the risk
factors associated with mental illness.A
review of mental health nursing was
announced in April 1992 and is expected to
report in late 1993.
There are many voluntary organisations
concerned with mental illness and learning
disabilities, and they play an important role
in providing services for both groups of
people.
Help to Families
Social services authorities, through their
own social workers and others, give help to
families facing special problems. This
includes services for children at risk of
injury or neglect who need care away from
their own families, and support for family
carers who look after elderly and other
family members in order to give them
relief from their duties. They also help
single parents. There are now many refuges
run by local authorities or voluntary
organisations for women, often with young
children, whose home conditions have
become intolerable. The refuges provide
short-term accommodation and support
while attempts are made to relieve the
women’s problems. Many authorities also
contribute to the cost of social work with
families (such as marriage guidance) carried
out by voluntary organisations.
The Self-help and Families Project
provides funding for nine voluntary
agencies to assist groups of families to help
themselves.
Child Care
Day care facilities for children under five are
provided by local authorities, voluntary
agencies and privately. In allocating places in
their day nurseries and other facilities, local
authorities give priority to children with
special social or health needs. Local
authorities also register childminders, private
day nurseries and playgroups in their areas
and provide support and advice services.
In April 1993 the Government
launched a £45 million scheme to help
create childcare facilities for children
over five after school hours and during
the holidays. The scheme, which will
be operated through Training and
Enterprise Councils and Local
Enterprise Companies (see p. 143), will
cover the whole of Great Britain from
April 1994. These organisations will
develop local partnerships in the
community with employers, schools,
parents, local authorities and
voluntary organisations.
The authorities can offer advice and help
to families in difficulties to promote the
welfare of children. The aim is to act at an
early stage to reduce the need to put
children into care or bring them before a
court.
Child Abuse
Cases of child abuse are the joint concern of
many authorities, agencies and professions.
Local review committees provide a forum
for discussion and co-ordination and draw
up policies and procedures for handling
these cases. The Government established a
central training initiative on child abuse in
1986. This consists of a variety of projects,
including training for health visitors, school
nurses, and local authority social services
staff. Training packs have been drawn up
for those concerned with implementing the
Children Act 1989 (see p. 388).
In England, Wales and Northern Ireland
children under the age of 14 in child abuse
cases are able to give evidence to courts
387
BRITAIN 1994: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
through television links, thus sparing them
from the need to give evidence in open court.
Children in Care
Local government authorities must provide
accommodation for children in need in their
area who require it because they have no
parent or guardian, have been abandoned, or
when parents are unable to provide for them.
The number of children in the care of local
authorities continues to decline. Provisional
statistics show that:
• the total number of children in care fell
from 92,300 in 1981 to 59,800 in 1991;
• the proportion in care placed with foster
parents increased from 39 per cent in
1981 to 57 per cent in 1991; and
• between 1990 and 1991 the number in
residential care fell from 12,670 to under
12,000.
The Children Act 1989, which came into
effect in England and Wales in 1991, recasts
the legislative framework for children’s
services, care and protection into a single
coherent structure. It lays new duties on local
authorities to safeguard and promote the
welfare of children. Under the Act parents of
children in care retain their parental
responsibilities but act as far as possible as
partners with the authority. There is a new
requirement to prepare a child for leaving the
local authority’s responsibility and to
continue to advise him or her up to the age
of 21. Local authorities are required to have a
complaints procedure with an independent
element to cover children in their care.
In England and Wales a child may be
brought before a family proceedings court if
he or she is neglected or ill-treated, exposed
to moral danger, beyond the control of
parents, or not attending school. The court
can commit the child to the care of a local
authority under a care order. Under the
Children Act 1989 certain preconditions have
to be satisfied to justify an order. These are
that the child is suffering or is likely to suffer
significant harm because of a lack of
reasonable parental care or is beyond parental
control. However, an order is made only if
the court is also satisfied that this will
positively contribute to the child’s well-being
and be in his or her best interests. In court
proceedings the child is entitled to separate
legal representation and the right to have a
guardian to protect his or her interests.
All courts have to treat the welfare of the
child as the paramount consideration when
reaching any decision about his or her
upbringing. The family proceedings court
consists of specially trained magistrates with
power to hear care cases as well as all other
family and children’s cases.
Recent concerns over standards of care in
certain local authority residential care and
children’s homes have prompted a number of
official inquiries whose recommendations are
now being implemented. They include:
• Sir William Utting’s inquiry into
training, service planning, inspection and
management (1990);
• Norman Warner’s inquiry into the
selection of staff in children’s homes and
the support and guidance available to
them after appointment (1992);
• the Howe inquiry into staff conditions,
management and training for all
residential care staff in adult and
children’s homes (1992);
• the Skinner review of residential child
care in Scotland (1992); and
• the Social Services Inspectorate review of
children’s homes in Wales (1991).
In Scotland children in trouble or in need
may be brought before a children’s hearing,
which can impose a supervision requirement
on a child if it thinks that compulsory
measures are appropriate. Under these
requirements most children are allowed to
remain at home under the supervision of a
social worker but some may live with foster
parents or in a residential establishment while
under supervision. Supervision requirements
are reviewed at least once a year until ended
by a children’s hearing. A review of child
care legislation in Scotland has been
conducted and its results are under
consideration.
In Northern Ireland the court may send
children in need or in trouble to a training
school, commit them to the care of a fit
388
HEALTH AND SOCIAL SERVICES
person (including a health and social services
board), or make a supervision order.
Children in trouble may be required to
attend an attendance centre or may be
detained in a remand home. New child care
legislation is being prepared in Northern
Ireland. Where appropriate it will reflect the
changes introduced in England and Wales
and will make a distinction between the
treatment of children in need of care and
young offenders.
Fostering and Community Homes
When appropriate, children in care are placed
with foster parents, who receive payments to
cover living costs. Alternatively, the child
may be placed in a children’s home,
voluntary home or other suitable residential
accommodation. In Scotland local authorities
are responsible for placing children in their
care in foster homes, in local authority or
voluntary homes, or in residential schools. In
Northern Ireland there are residential homes
for children in the care of the health and
social services boards; training schools and
remand homes are administered separately.
Regulations concerning residential care and
the foster placement of children in care are
made by central government.
Adoption
Local authorities are required by law to
provide an adoption service, either directly or
by arrangement with a voluntary organisation.
Agencies may offer adoptive parents an
allowance in certain circumstances if this
would help to find a family for a child.
Adoption is strictly regulated by law, and
voluntary adoption societies must be
approved by the appropriate social services
minister. The Registrars-General keep
confidential registers of adopted children.
Adopted people may be given details of their
original birth record on reaching the age of
18, and counselling is provided to help them
understand the circumstances of their
adoption. An Adoption Contact Register
enables adopted adults and their birth parents
to be given a safe and confidential way of
making contact if that is the wish of both
parties. A person’s details are entered only if
they wish to be contacted.
The report of a government review on
adoption, published in late 1992, makes
suggestions to improve present arrangements
and to emphasise the rights of the child. The
Government is to propose legislation to ensure
that children remain at the centre of decisions
affecting them.
Social Workers
The effective operation of the social services
depends largely on professionally qualified
social workers. Training programmes in social
work are provided by universities and colleges
of higher and further education. The Central
Council for Education and Training in Social
Work is the statutory body responsible for
promoting social work training and offers
advice to people considering entering the
profession. A programme to introduce two-
year courses leading to a new professional
qualification, the Diploma in Social Work
(DipSW), is being implemented. National
Vocational Qualifications are being developed
for other staff, including those in residential
day and domiciliary care services.
Professional social workers (including those
working in the NHS) are employed mainly by
the social services departments of local
authorities. Others work in the probation
service, the education welfare service, or in
voluntary organisations.
The Government is committed to
improving social work training. In England
alone it is providing £31-8 million in 1993-94
(£6 million in Scotland) through its training
support programme to assist local authorities
to train staff. Over 140,000 staff are expected
to benefit from training, of whom nearly half
work in residential care.

26 Social Security
Administration 390 Arrangements with Other
Contributions 391 Countries 398
Benefits 391
Spending on social security is rising because of increased numbers of
beneficiaries, especially retirement pensioners, and long-term sick and
disabled people. The value of retirement and most other long-term benefits
has also increased in real terms since 1980. Planned spending in 1993-94 is
£61,500 million—the Government’s largest expenditure programme.
The social security system is designed to
secure a basic standard of living for people in
financial need by providing income during
periods of inability to earn (including periods
of unemployment), help for families and
assistance with costs arising from
disablement. Nearly a third of government
expenditure is devoted to the social security
programme, which provides financial help for
people who are elderly, sick, disabled,
unemployed, widowed, bringing up children
or on very low incomes.
Some benefits depend on the payment of
contributions by employers, employees and
self-employed people to the National
Insurance Fund, from which benefits are
paid. The Government also contributes to the
Fund. The other social security benefits are
non-contributory and are financed from
general taxation; some of these are income-
related (see p. 396). Appeals about claims for
benefits are decided by independent
tribunals.
ADMINISTRATION
Administration in Great Britain is handled
by separate executive agencies of the
Department of Social Security:
• the Benefits Agency, responsible for
paying the majority of social security
benefits;
• the Contributions Agency, responsible for
handling National Insurance
contributions;
• the Information Technology Services
Agency, responsible for computerising
the administration of social security;
• the Child Support Agency, responsible
for collecting and enforcing maintenance
payments for children; it was set up in
April 1993 (see p. 394); and
• the War Pensions Unit, for delivering
services to war pensioners; it was also set
up in April 1993.
The housing and council tax benefit
schemes are administered mainly by local
government authorities, which recover most
of the cost from the Government.
In Northern Ireland contributions as well
as social security benefits are administered by
the Social Security Agency. The housing
benefit scheme is administered by the
Northern Ireland Housing Executive and the
Rate Collection Agency; council tax does not
apply in Northern Ireland.
390
SOCIAL SECURITY
Anti-fraud Measures
Further measures are being introduced to
improve the prevention and detection of
social security fraud. These include:
• greater incentives to local authorities to
prevent and detect fraud in the benefits
they administer;
• better use of information technology; and
• better targeting of resources, and
additional resources where necessary.
In 1993—94 the Benefits Agency is
expected to save over .£500 million through
anti-fraud work.
Advice about Benefits
The demand for advice about benefits is
partly met by the Freeline Social Security
Service, which handles over 1 million calls
each year. A complementary service, the
Social Security Advice Line for Employers,
handles some 3,500 calls a week. The Ethnic
Freeline Service provides information on
social security in Urdu, Punjabi and Chinese.
There is also a freeline service in Welsh.
CONTRIBUTIONS
Entitlement to National Insurance benefits
such as retirement pension, sickness and
invalidity benefit, unemployment benefit,
maternity allowance and widow’s benefit, is
dependent upon the payment of
contributions. There are four classes of
contributions; the rates given are effective
from April 1993 to April 1994:
• Class 1—paid by employees and their
employers. Employees with earnings below
£56 a week do not pay Class 1
contributions. Contributions on earnings
of £56 a week and over are at the rate of
2 per cent of the first £56 of total
earnings and 9 per cent of the balance,
up to the upper earnings limit of £420 a
week. Employers’ contributions are
subject to the same threshold. On
earnings above the threshold,
contributions rise in stages from 4.6 per
cent of total earnings up to a maximum
of 10.4 per cent when earnings are £195
or more a week; there is no upper
earnings limit. The contribution is lower
if the employer operates a ‘contracted-
out’ occupational pension scheme (see
below).
• Class 2—paid by self-employed people.
Class 2 contributions are at a flat rate of
£5.55 a week. The self-employed may
claim exemption from payment of Class 2
contributions if their profits are expected
to be below £3,140 for the tax year. Self-
employed people are not eligible for
unemployment and industrial injuries
benefits.
• Class 3—paid voluntarily to safeguard
rights to some benefits. Class 3
contributions are at a flat rate of £5.45 a
week.
• Class 4—paid by the self-employed on their
taxable profits over a set lower limit
(£6,340 a year), and up to a set upper
limit (£21,840 a year) in addition to their
Class 2 contribution. Class 4
contributions are payable at the rate of
6.3 per cent.
Employees who work after pensionable age
(60 for women and 65 for men) do not pay
contributions but the employer continues to
be liable. Self-employed people over
pensionable age do not pay contributions.
BENEFITS
For most benefits there are two contribution
conditions. First, before benefit can be paid
at all, a certain number of contributions have
to be paid. Secondly, the full rate of benefit
cannot be paid unless contributions have been
paid or credited to a specific level over a set
period. Benefits are increased annually in line
with percentage increases in retail prices. The
main benefits (payable weekly) are
summarised below. The rates given are
those effective from April 1993 until
April 1994.
Retirement Pension
A state retirement pension is payable, subject
to the satisfaction of contribution conditions,
to women at the age of 60 and men at the

age of 65. The Sex Discrimination Act 1986
protects employees of different sexes in a
particular occupation from being required to
retire at different ages. This, however, has
not affected the payment of the state
retirement pension at different ages for men
and women. The Government is committed
to the equalisation of the state pension age for
men and women and in 1991 published a
discussion document setting out some of the
issues involved. Comments and views on
various approaches to equalisation, including
differing common pension ages and models
for a flexible pension age, were invited and
responses are now being considered.
The state pension scheme consists of a
basic weekly pension of £56.10 for a single
person and £89.80 for a married couple,
together with an additional earnings-related
pension. Pensioners may have unlimited
earnings without affecting their pensions.
Those who have put off their retirement
during the five years after state pension age
may earn extra pension. A non-contributory
retirement pension of £33.70 a week is
payable to people over the age of 80 who
meet certain residence conditions, and who
have not qualified for a contributory
pension. People whose pensions do not give
them enough to live on may be entitled to
income support. Nearly 10 million people in
Great Britain received a basic state pension
in 1991.
Rights to basic pensions are safeguarded
for mothers who are away from paid
employment looking after children or for
people giving up paid employment to care for
severely disabled relatives. Men and women
may receive the same basic pension, provided
they have paid full-rate National Insurance
contributions when working. From April
1999 the earnings-related pension scheme will
be based on a lifetime’s revalued earnings
instead of on the best 20 years. It will be
calculated as 20 per cent rather than 25 per
cent of earnings, to be phased in over ten
years from 1999. The pensions of people
retiring this century will be unaffected.

Occupational and Personal Pensions
Employers may ‘contract out’ their employees
from the state scheme for the additional
earnings-related pension and provide their
own occupational pension instead. Their
pension must be at least as good as the state
additional pension. Joining an employer’s
contracted-out scheme is voluntary:
employers are not free to contract out
employees from the earnings-related pension
scheme without the employees’ consent. The
State remains responsible for the basic
pension.
Occupational pension schemes cover about
half the working population and have over 11
million members. The occupational pension
rights of those who change jobs before
pensionable age, who are unable or who do
not want to transfer their pension rights, are
now protected against inflation up to a
maximum of 5 per cent. Workers leaving a
scheme have the right to a fair transfer value.
The trustees or managers of pension schemes
have to provide full information about their
schemes. Some 67 per cent of recently retired
people now have an occupational pension of
over £58 a week, a sum greater than their
basic state pension.
As an alternative to their employers’
scheme or the state additional earnings-
related pension scheme, people are entitled to
choose a personal pension available from a
bank, building society, insurance company or
other financial institution. Some 5 million
people have contracted out of the state

earnings-related pension scheme and taken

occupational pension law was published in
September 1993. The Government is
considering its recommendations.
A Pensions Ombudsman deals with
complaints about maladministration of
pension schemes and adjudicates on disputes
of fact or law. A pensions registry helps
people trace lost benefits.
Parents and Children
Most pregnant working women receive their
statutory maternity pay directly from their
employer for a maximum of 18 weeks. There
are two rates:
• where a woman has been working for the
same employer for at least two years, she
is entitled to 90 per cent of her average
weekly earnings for the first six weeks
and to the lower rate of £47.95 a week
for the remaining 12 weeks;
• where a woman has been employed for
between 26 weeks and two years, she is
entitled to payments for up to 18 weeks
at the lower rate.
Women who are not eligible for statutory
maternity pay because, for example, they are
self-employed, have recently changed jobs or
given up their job, may qualify for a weekly
maternity allowance of £43.75, which is
payable for up to 18 weeks.
A payment of £100 from the social fund
(see p. 397) may be available if the mother or
her partner are receiving income support,
family credit or disability working allowance.
It is also available if a woman adopts a baby.
Non-contributory child benefit of £10 for
the eldest and £8.10 weekly for each other
child is the general social security benefit for
children. Tax-free and normally paid to the
mother, it is payable for children up to the
age of 16 and for those up to 19 if they
continue in full-time non-advanced education.
In addition, one-parent benefit of £6.05 a
week is payable to certain people bringing up
one child or more on their own, whether as
their parents or not. A non-contributory
guardian’s allowance of £10.95 a week for an
orphaned child is payable to a person who is
entitled to child benefit for that child. This is
reduced to £9.80 if the higher rate of child
benefit is payable for the child. In
exceptional circumstances a guardian’s
allowance may be paid on the death of only
one parent.
In 1992 the European Council of
Ministers adopted a directive aimed at
improving health and safety at work for
pregnant women and nursing mothers. The
directive provides maternity leave for 14
weeks with maternity pay equivalent to what
the woman would receive if she were unable
to work because of sickness. Legislation in
Britain will be brought into line with the
directive by October 1994.
Child Support Agency
An estimated 1.3 million lone parents bring
up over 2 million children in Britain. Fewer
than one in three receive regular maintenance
payments for their children. The
Government has set up the Child Support
Agency, which takes over from the courts the
main responsibility for obtaining maintenance
for children. The Agency, which started work
in April 1993, is responsible for tracing
absent parents and collecting, enforcing and
receiving child maintenance payments.
Assessments are made using a formula which
takes into account each parent’s income and
essential outgoings.
Widows
Widows under the age of 60, or those over 60
whose husbands were not entitled to a state
retirement pension when they died, receive a
tax-free single payment of £1,000 following
the death of their husbands, provided that
their husbands had paid a minimum number
of National Insurance contributions. Women
whose husbands have died of an industrial
injury or prescribed disease may also qualify,
regardless of whether their husbands had
paid National Insurance contributions. A
widowed mother with a young family receives
a widowed mother’s allowance of £56.10 a
week with a further £9.80 for a child for
whom the higher rate of child benefit is
payable and £10.95 for each subsequent
394
SOCIAL SECURITY
child. A widow’s basic pension of £56.10 a
week is payable to a widow who is 55 years
or over when her husband dies or when her
entitlement to widowed mother’s allowance
ends. A percentage of the full rate is payable
to widows who are aged between 45 and 54
when their husbands die or when their
entitlement to widowed mother’s allowance
ends. Special rules apply for widows whose
husbands died before 11 April 1988.
Entitlement continues until the widow
remarries or begins drawing retirement
pension. Payment ends if she lives with a
man as his wife. Widows also benefit under
the industrial injuries scheme.
A man whose wife dies when both are
over pension age inherits his wife’s pension
rights just as a widow inherits her husband’s
rights.
Sick and Disabled People
Statutory Sick Pay and Sickness Benefit
A large variety of benefits is available for
people unable to work because of sickness or
disablement. Employers are responsible for
paying statutory sick pay to employees for up
to a maximum of 28 weeks. There are two
weekly rates—£46.95 or £52.50—depending
on average weekly earnings. Employees who
are not entitled to statutory sick pay can
claim weekly state sickness benefit of
£42.70 instead, as can self-employed people.
Sickness benefit is payable for up to
28 weeks.
Invalidity Pension and Allowance
A weekly invalidity pension of £56.10—with
additions of £33.70 for an adult dependant,
£9.80 for the eldest child and £10.95 for
each other child—is payable when statutory
sick pay or sickness benefit ends. For the
period to count towards receiving invalidity
pension the contribution condition for
sickness benefit must be satisfied. An
invalidity allowance of up to £11.95 a week,
depending on the age when incapacity
began, may be paid, but this is offset by
any entitlement to an additional invalidity
pension.
Severe Disablement Allowance
A severe disablement allowance of £33.70
plus an age-related addition of up to £11.95 a
week may be payable to people under
pensionable age who are unable to work and
do not qualify for the National Insurance
invalidity pension because they have not paid
sufficient contributions. Additions for adult
dependants and for children may also be paid.
Industrial Injuries Disablement Benefits
Various benefits are payable for disablement
caused by an accident at work or a prescribed
disease. The main benefit is industrial
injuries disablement benefit; disablement
benefit of up to £91.60 a week is usually paid
after a qualifying period of 15 weeks if a
person is 14 per cent or more physically or
mentally disabled as a result of an industrial
accident or a prescribed disease. During the
qualifying period statutory sick pay or
sickness benefit may be payable if the person
is incapable of work. The degree of
disablement is assessed by an adjudicating
medical authority and the amount paid
depends on the extent of the disablement and
how long it is expected to last. Except for
certain progressive respiratory diseases,
disablement of less than 14 per cent does not
attract disablement benefit. In certain
circumstances disablement benefits may be
supplemented by a constant attendance
allowance. An additional allowance may be
payable in certain cases of exceptionally
severe disablement.
Other Benefits
Disability living allowance (which replaced
attendance allowance for people disabled
before the age of 65, and mobility
allowance) was introduced in 1992. It is a
tax-free benefit with two components for
people under the age of 65 who need help
with personal care or with mobility. The
care component has three weekly rates—
£44.90, £30 and £11.95. The mobility
component has two rates—£31.40 and
£11.95.
An independent organisation called
395
BRITAIN 1994: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Motability helps disabled drivers and
passengers wanting to use the higher mobility
component to obtain a vehicle or wheelchair.
A non-contributory, tax-free attendance
allowance of £30 or £44.90 a week may be
payable to people severely disabled at or after
age 65, depending upon the amount of
attention they require. The higher rate of
attendance allowance and/or disability living
allowance is paid to people who are
terminally ill.
A non-contributory invalid care allowance
of £33.70 weekly may be payable to people
between 16 and pensionable age who cannot
take up a paid job because they are caring for
a person receiving either the higher or middle
rate of disability living allowance care
component or attendance allowance; an
additional carer’s premium may be paid if the
recipient is also receiving income support,
housing benefit or council tax benefit. It is
estimated that some 1.4 million adults in
Great Britain care for a disabled person for at
least 20 hours a week.
Disability working allowance is a new
income-related tax-free benefit introduced in
1992. It provides help for some disabled
people aged 16 or over who are working at
least 16 hours a week but have a mental or
physical illness which puts them at a
disadvantage in getting work. Awards are for
fixed periods of six months. To qualify a
person must be receiving disability living
allowance or have recently received a long¬
term incapacity benefit or a disability
premium with an income-related benefit. The
rate payable depends on the person’s income
and size of family.
Unemployment Benefit
Unemployment benefit of £44.65 a week for a
single person or £72.20 for a couple is
payable for up to a year in any one period of
unemployment. Periods covered by
unemployment or sickness benefit, maternity
allowance or some training allowances which
are eight weeks or less apart, are linked to
form a single period of interruption of work.
Everyone claiming unemployment benefit has
to be available for work, but unemployed
people wishing to do voluntary work in the
community may do so in some cases without
losing entitlement to benefit. People seeking
unemployment benefit are expected to look
for work actively and must have good reasons
for rejecting any job that is offered.
Income Support
Although about half of fresh claims from
unemployed people result in payment of
unemployment benefit (see above), a large
proportion of those on the unemployment
register at any one time rely partly or wholly
on income support. This is either because
they have not paid sufficient contributions to
qualify for unemployment benefit, or because
their entitlement to it has run out, or because
they are entitled to income support as well as
unemployment benefit.
Income support is payable to people who
are not in work, or who work for less than 16
hours a week, and whose financial resources
are below certain set levels. It consists of a
personal allowance ranging from £26.45
weekly for a single person or lone parent
aged under 18 to £69 for a couple, at least
one of whom is aged over 18. Additional
sums, known as premiums, are available to
families, lone parents, pensioners, long-term
sick and disabled people, and those caring
for them who qualify for the invalid care
allowance.
The income support scheme sets a limit to
the amount of capital a person may have and
still remain entitled. People with savings or
capital worth more than £8,000 are ineligible;
savings between £3,000 and £8,000 will
reduce the amount received.
Housing Benefit
The housing benefit scheme assists people
who need help to pay their rent (rent and/or
domestic rates in Northern Ireland), using
general assessment rules and benefit levels
similar to those for the income support
scheme. People whose net income is below
certain specified levels may receive
housing benefit equivalent to 100 per cent
of their rent.
As with income support (see above), the
housing benefit scheme sets a limit of
396
SOCIAL SECURITY
£8,000 on the amount of capital a person
may have and still remain entitled.
Council Tax Benefit
Council tax benefit, which replaced
community charge benefit in Great Britain in
April 1993, helps people to meet their council
tax payments. The scheme offers help to
those claiming income support and others
with low incomes. Subject to rules broadly
similar to those governing the provision of
income support and housing benefit (see
p. 396), people may receive rebates of up to
100 per cent of their council tax. A person
who is liable for the council tax may also
claim benefit (called ‘second adult rebate’) for
a second adult who is not liable to pay the
council tax and who is living in the home on
a non-commercial basis.
Family Credit
Family credit is payable to employed and
self-employed working families with children
on modest incomes. It is payable to couples
or lone parents. At least one parent must
work for a minimum of 16 hours a week. The
amount payable depends on a family’s net
income (excluding child benefit) and the
number and ages of the children in the
family. A maximum award, consisting of an
adult rate of £42.50 weekly, plus a rate for
each child varying with age, is payable if the
family’s net income does not exceed £69 a
week. The award is reduced by 70 pence for
each pound by which net income exceeds this
amount. Family credit is not payable if a
family’s capital or savings exceed £8,000.
Social Fund
Discretionary payments, in the form of loans
or grants, may be available to people on low
incomes for expenses which are difficult to
meet from their regular income. There are
three types:
• budgeting loans to help meet important
occasional expenses;
• crisis loans for help in an emergency or a
disaster; and
• community care grants to help people re¬
establish themselves or remain in the
community and to ease exceptional
pressure on families.
The total discretionary budget of £340
million for 1993-94 is almost 12 per cent
higher than in the previous year.
Payments are also made from the social
fund to help with the costs of maternity or
funerals or with heating during very cold
weather. These payments are regulated and
are not subject to the same budgetary
considerations as other social fund payments.
War Pensions and Related Services
Pensions are payable for disablement or death
as a result of service in the armed forces or
for certain injuries received in the merchant
navy or civil defence during war, or to
civilians injured by enemy action. The
amount paid depends on the degree of
disablement: the maximum disablement
pension for a private soldier is £97.20 a
week.
There are a number of extra allowances.
The main ones are for unemployability,
restricted mobility, the need for constant
attendance, the provision of extra comforts,
and as maintenance for a lowered standard of
occupation. An age allowance of between
£6.50 and £20 is payable weekly to war
pensioners aged 65 or over whose
disablement is assessed at 40 per cent or
more. Pensions are also paid to war widows
and other dependants. (The standard rate of
pension for a private’s widow is £72.90 a
week.)
The Department of Social Security
maintains a welfare service for war
pensioners, war widows and other
dependants. It works closely with ex-Service
organisations and other voluntary bodies
which give financial aid and personal
support to those disabled or bereaved as a
result of war.

spectacles, free school meals and free legal aid.
Reduced charges are often made to
unemployed people, for example, for adult
education and exhibitions, and pensioners
usually enjoy reduced transport fares.
Taxation
The general rule is that benefits which
replace lost earnings are subject to tax, while
those intended to meet a specific need are not
(see Table 26.2). Various income tax reliefs
and exemptions are allowed on account of age
or a need to support dependants.
ARRANGEMENTS WITH OTHER
COUNTRIES
As part of the European Community’s efforts
to promote the free movement of labour,
regulations provide for equality of treatment
and the protection of benefit rights for
employed and self-employed people who
move between member states. The
regulations also cover retirement pensioners
and other beneficiaries who have been
employed, or self-employed, as well as
dependants. Benefits covered include child
benefit and those for sickness and
maternity, unemployment, retirement,
invalidity, accidents at work and
occupational diseases.
Britain also has reciprocal social security
agreements with a number of other
countries, which also provide cover for some
National Insurance benefits and family
benefits.
At the end of 1991 over 600,000 British
national insurance pensions were paid
overseas, at a cost of some ^675 million
during 1991-92.

Some 9 million pupils attend Britain’s 34,600 state1 and private schools and
are taught by just over half a million teachers. The average pupil—teacher
ratio is about 17:1, compared with 22:1 in 1970—71. The proportion of young
people entering higher education in universities and colleges rose from one in
eight in 1980 to one in five by 1990. It is now over one in four and is expected
to reach one in three by the year 2000 (over two in five in Scotland).
Continuing education for adults is provided by further education institutions,
adult colleges and centres, and by universities, which have seen an increase in
older students in recent years.
INTRODUCTION
History
Although government grants for education
were first made in 1833, it was the 1870
Education Act in England and Wales which
originally enshrined the idea of compulsory
elementary education with government aid.
There were two types of elementary school—
church voluntary schools and state schools
provided by school boards. Attendance at
school became compulsory in 1880 for
children aged between five and ten and the
school leaving age was progressively raised to
14 by 1918.
A co-ordinated national system of
education was introduced for the first time by
the 1902 Education Act, under which local
government became responsible for state
education and for helping to finance the
voluntary schools. The system was supervised
by the Board of Education.
' For ease of reference the term ‘state school’ is used to cover all
types of school maintained from public funds.
In 1944 a new Education Act raised the
school leaving age to 15 and schools were
divided into primary and secondary schools.
All children were given a secondary education
and the newly created Ministry of Education
was empowered to develop a national
education policy. Local government remained
responsible for administering the system.
Children were allocated to different
secondary schools on the basis of selection
tests taken at the age of 11. In the 1960s and
1970s this system was gradually replaced by
comprehensive schools taking pupils of all
abilities. The school leaving age was raised to
16 in 1972-73.
In Scotland an Act passed in 1872
transferred responsibility for education from
the churches to elected school boards which
provided education for children between the
ages of 5 and 13. In 1901 the school leaving
age was raised to 14. An Act passed in 1918
replaced the boards by local government
authorities and made the provision of
secondary education mandatory for all
children wanting it. Church schools were
399
BRITAIN 1994: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
transferred to education authorities, while
preserving their denominational character.
The school leaving age was raised to 15 in
1947 and to 16 in 1972-73.
Education in Northern Ireland was
brought into a single system by legislation
passed in 1923 under which local government
took over responsibility for its administration,
supervised by the Ministry of Education.
Secondary education remained largely in the
hands of voluntary bodies, with assistance
provided from public funds. Education was
made compulsory for pupils between the ages
of 5 and 14. The school leaving age was
raised to 15 in 1947 and to 16 in 1972-73. In
the 1970s responsibility for the education
system was transferred to five area education
and library boards.
During the 1970s concern arose about the
quality of education provided by Britain’s
schools and the lack of a formal national
school curriculum. As a result the three
education systems are undergoing the most
far-reaching reforms since 1945.
Administration
The Secretary of State for Education has
overall responsibility for school and post¬
school education in England. The Secretaries
of State for Scotland, Wales and Northern
Ireland exercise similar responsibilities in
their countries.
The government education departments
are the Department for Education in England,
the Welsh Office Education Department, The
Scottish Office Education Department and
the Department of Education for Northern
Ireland. They formulate education policies
and are also responsible for the supply and
training of teachers.
Most publicly financed school education is
the responsibility of local education
authorities (LEAs) which are part of the
elected local government system; the rest is
provided by self-governing grant-maintained
state schools (see p. 402). In Northern Ireland
the education service is administered locally
by five education and library boards.
LEAs pay teachers and other staff, provide
and maintain buildings and supply equipment
and materials. Governing bodies in self-
governing state schools are responsible for
these functions. In England and Wales LEAs
award grants to students progressing to
further and higher education.
Post-school education establishments—
universities, other higher education colleges
and further education institutions—are self-
governing.
Finance
Estimated spending on education in Britain
in 1991—92 was £29,300 million. There are
three separate elements of general
government expenditure on education:
• Central government in England and Wales
is responsible for direct funding of parts
of the education service; most of this is
devoted to further and higher education
and allocated by the various funding
councils (see p. 401). The Government
also funds directly the current and capital
costs of self-governing state schools and of
city technology colleges (see p. 404).
• The second element is central
government grants supporting
expenditure made by LEAs on projects
of particular importance to the
Government. Projects assisted include the
National Curriculum (see p. 408), local
management of schools, teacher
recruitment, support for information
technology and health education in
schools. Grants are made to self-
governing state schools to support similar
activities. Finance also goes to inner city
schools facing particularly severe
problems. In 1993-94 some £195 million
is being allocated towards expenditure of
£320 million in England.
• Additional direct grants are made for
capital expenditure at voluntary-aided
schools and in support of capital
expenditure on schools by LEAs. These
are also used to reimburse LEAs for
expenditure on mandatory student grants
(see p. 416).
LEAs in England and Wales are
responsible for the remaining educational
expenditure, most of which goes to schools; a
large amount of this is indirectly funded by
400
EDUCATION
the Government through the Revenue
Support Grant made to local government
councils by the Department of the
Environment. Councils are free to decide how
much of this grant should be distributed to
education and the other services for which
they have responsibility.
The rest of local authority expenditure on
education is met by local taxes and by the
non-domestic rates paid by business and
commerce. Local authorities are accountable
to their electorates for spending decisions.
Most schools are responsible for their budgets
under schemes of devolved local management
(see p. 402).
In Scotland education is financed on a
similar basis.
In Northern Ireland the costs of the
education and library boards are met in full
by the Department of Education.
The Departments of Employment and of
Trade and Industry also fund educational
programmes; the former, for example,
finances the Technical and Vocational
Education Initiative (see p. 412) and
Compacts (see p. 412).
Higher and Further Education
Higher education is largely financed by public
funds, tuition fees for students paid through
the awards system and income charged by
institutions for research and other purposes.
Government finance for universities and
other higher education institutions in
England, Scotland and Wales is distributed
by higher education funding councils in these
countries. In Northern Ireland grant is paid
directly to the universities by the Department
of Education, following advice from the
Northern Ireland Higher Education Funding
Council. The private University of
Buckingham receives no public grant.
In addition to teaching students,
universities and other higher education
institutions undertake training, research, or
consultancy for commercial firms. The
Government is encouraging them to secure a
larger flow of funds from these sources.
Many educational establishments have
endowments or receive grants from
foundations and benefactors.
The Government reimburses in full the
amount spent by local authorities on
mandatory student grants and fees (see
p. 416).
Further education colleges are self-
governing institutions, government funds
being distributed to them by further
education funding councils in England and
Wales. The Scottish Office Education
Department distributes funds to colleges in
Scotland. In Northern Ireland further
education colleges are financed by the
Department of Education.
SCHOOLS
Parents are required by law to see that their
children receive efficient full-time education,
at school or elsewhere, between the ages of 5
and 16 in Great Britain and 4 and 16 in
Northern Ireland. About 93 per cent of
pupils receive free education financed from
public funds, while the others attend
independent schools paid for by fees from
parents.
Boys and girls are taught together in most
primary schools. More than 80 per cent of
pupils in state secondary schools in England
and Wales and about 66 per cent in Northern
Ireland attend mixed schools. In Scotland
nearly all secondary schools are mixed. Most
independent schools (see p. 406) for younger
children are co-educational; the majority
providing secondary education are single-sex,
although the number of mixed schools is
growing.
School Management
England and Wales
There are three kinds of state school which are
wholly or mainly supported from public funds:
• county schools are owned and funded by
LEAs;
• voluntary schools, mostly established by
religious denominations, are also financed
by public funds, the governors of some
types of voluntary school contributing to
capital costs; and
• self-governing grant-maintained state
schools (see p. 402).
401
BRITAIN 1994: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Each LEA maintained county and
voluntary school has a governing body which
includes governors appointed by the LEA,
elected teacher and parent representatives and
people co-opted from the local community.
Voluntary schools also have governors from
the church associated with the school. The
Government provides information to
governors about education legislation. Many
large firms recognise that school governorship
is an important part of the links between
business/commerce and the education system;
they therefore give governors time off with
pay during working hours.
By April 1994 all county and voluntary
schools will be responsible for managing their
budgets. In April 1991, 40 per cent of these
schools in England had delegated budgets and
this had risen to almost 70 per cent by April
1992. Under these arrangements, LEAs
allocate funds—largely on the basis of pupil
numbers—to the schools. The school
governing body then becomes responsible for
managing the school budget and for most
aspects of staffing, including numbers,
appointments and dismissals. From April
1994 LEAs will be funding special schools
(see p. 405) by means of a formula designed to
give the schools full control over their budgets.
Self-governing (Grant-maintained) State
Schools
The Government expects that more of state
schools will become self-governing, following
an affirmative ballot by parents of the
children in the school. Some 15 per cent of
secondary schools in England are self-
governing state schools.
The governing body for these schools
consists of parents, teachers and people from
the community served by the school. The five
parent governors are elected by the parents of
pupils at the school and the one or two
teacher governors by the school’s teachers.
Governors take all decisions about school
management, employ and pay staff, are
responsible for school premises and may
acquire or dispose of land.
Under the 1993 Education Act, a new
statutory body, the Funding Agency for
Schools, is being set up to calculate and pay
grant to self-governing schools from public
funds and be responsible for financial
monitoring. LEAs will continue to be
responsible for funding those state schools
which do not become self-governing.
Once 10 per cent of pupils in either the
primary or secondary schools in an LEA are
being educated in self-governing schools, the
Funding Agency will take responsibility, in
tandem with the LEA, for provision of
enough primary or secondary places in that
sector. When 75 per cent of either primary or
secondary children are educated in self-
governing schools, the Agency will take full
responsibility for providing school places in
that sector.
Scotland
In Scotland most schools supported from
public funds are provided by education
authorities and are known as public schools.
School boards play a significant part in the
administration and management of these
schools. The boards consist of elected parent
and staff members as well as co-opted
members. The Government has issued
guidelines under which schemes of devolved
management will be in place in primary and
secondary schools by April 1996 and in
special schools by April 1997.
Parents of children at public schools can
opt for self-governing status following
approval by a ballot; such schools receive
funding directly from central government
instead of the local education authority.
Northern Ireland
The main categories of school supported by
public funds are:
• controlled schools, provided by the
education and library boards and
managed through boards of governors;
• maintained schools, managed by boards
of governors with overall general
management from the Council for
Catholic Maintained Schools;
• voluntary grammar schools, which may
be under Roman Catholic management or
non-denominational boards of governors;
and
402
EDUCATION
• grant-maintained integrated schools,
taking Protestant and Roman Catholic
pupils.
All publicly financed schools include
elected parents and teachers on their boards
of governors.
Although all schools must be open to
pupils of all religions, most Roman Catholic
pupils attend Catholic maintained schools or
Catholic voluntary grammar schools and
most Protestant children are enrolled at
controlled schools or non-denominational
voluntary grammar schools.
The Council for Catholic Maintained
Schools has responsibility for maintained
schools under Roman Catholic management.
Its main objective is to promote high
standards of education in these schools. The
Council’s membership consists of trustees
appointed by the Northern Irish bishops, of
people appointed by the Department of
Education in consultation with the bishops,
and of parents and teachers.
The Government has a statutory duty to
encourage integrated education as a way of
breaking down sectarian barriers. There are
21 integrated schools, with 3,500 pupils.
New integrated schools receive
immediate government funding. Existing
controlled, maintained and voluntary
grammar schools can also apply to become
integrated following a majority vote by
parents. There are two categories of
integrated schools. Grant-maintained
integrated status can be applied for by new
and independent schools as well as those
already receiving public funds. Once
approved by a ballot of parents, the school
is funded directly by the Department of
Education and run by a board of governors.
Controlled integrated status can be sought
by voluntary and controlled schools;
education and library boards can also apply
to set up such schools. The boards provide
funding for and supervise controlled
integrated schools.
Secondary school governors have
delegated responsibility for managing school
budgets and staff numbers. Primary and
nursery school governors have delegated
responsibility for managing non-staff costs
only.
Nursery and Primary Schools
Although there is no statutory requirement
to educate under-fives, successive
governments have enabled nursery education
to expand. One-half of three- and four-year-
olds receive education in nursery schools or
classes or in infants’ classes in primary
schools; part-time pupils make up nearly
half of under-fives in education. In addition,
many children attend pre-school playgroups,
most of which are organised by parents and
incorporated in the Pre-School Playgroups
Association.
Compulsory education begins at five in
Great Britain and four in Northern Ireland,
when children go to infant schools or
departments; at seven many go on to junior
schools or departments. The usual age for
transfer from primary to secondary schools
is 11 in England, Wales and Northern
Ireland, but some local authorities in
England have established first schools for
pupils aged 5 to 8, 9 or 10, and middle
schools for age-ranges between 8 and 14. In
Scotland primary schools take children from
5 to 12, when they transfer to secondary
schools.
Secondary Schools
Around nine-tenths of the state secondary
school population in Great Britain attend
comprehensive schools. These take pupils
without reference to ability or aptitude and
provide a wide range of secondary education
for all or most of the children in a district.
English and Welsh schools can be organised
in a number of ways. They include:
• those that take the full secondary school
age-range from 11 to 18;
• middle schools (see above); and
• schools with an age-range of 11 or 12 to
16, combined with a sixth-form or a
tertiary college for pupils over 16.
Sixth-form colleges are schools which
may provide non-academic in addition to
academic courses. Tertiary colleges offer a
range of full-time and part-time vocational
courses for students over 16, as well as
academic courses.
403
BRITAIN 1994: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Most other children attend grammar or
secondary modern schools, to which they are
allocated after selection procedures at the
age of 11.
There are 15 city technology colleges
in England and Wales. While fulfilling
the National Curriculum requirements
of breadth and balance, the colleges
emphasise science, technology and
business understanding. They are a
partnership between the Government
and private sponsors and are expected
to find a substantial proportion of the
initial capital costs.
The Government is supporting technology
specialisation in over 200 secondary schools in
England. These receive capital grants to help
develop technology teaching with a strong
vocational emphasis.
Scottish secondary education is almost
completely non-selective; the majority of
schools are six-year comprehensives
covering the age-range 12 to 18. The
Government is committed to the principle of
setting up technology academies in Scotland
with a role similar to that of city technology
colleges.
In Northern Ireland secondary education is
organised largely along selective lines, based
on a system of testing. However, there are
some secondary schools run on a non-
selective basis.
Rights of Parents
Under the various Parents’ Charters, parents
must be given general information about a
school through a prospectus and the school’s
annual report or, in Scotland, the school’s
handbook. They also have a statutory right to
express a preference for a particular school
for their child, and there is an appeal system
if their choice is not met. A school’s
admission limits must be designed to reflect
its physical capacity in order to maximise
parents’ chances of securing a place for their
child at their preferred school.
In England and Wales parents choosing
among local secondary schools have the right
to see:
• comparative tables showing the latest
public examination results, school by
school; and
• information in each school’s prospectus
on public examination results, vocational
qualification results, truancy rates and
the destinations of school leavers.
All local secondary schools, including
independent ones, in England and Wales
have to be included in national tables
providing information about public
examination results, vocational qualification
results and truancy rates. Similar
information is to be published about Scottish
secondary schools. Information is also given
to parents on the findings of school
inspection reports (see p. 411).
Under the Parents’ Charter, all state
schools in England and Wales have to give
parents a written annual report on their
child’s achievements, containing details
about:
• the child’s progress in all subjects and
activities;
• the child’s general progress and
attendance record;
• the results of National Curriculum
assessments and of public examinations
taken by the child;
• comparative results of pupils of the
same age in the school and nationally;
and
• information about the arrangements for
discussing the report with teachers at
the school.
When a pupil transfers to another school,
a record of his or her academic
achievements, other skills, abilities and
progress in school is sent to the new school
on request. Information about the pupil’s
latest assessments and examination results is
sent automatically.
The Government is also taking steps to
enable schools to inform parents in jargon-
free language about their policy regarding
classroom organisation, curriculum planning
and teaching methods.
In Scotland guidance has been issued to
education authorities and schools on reports
to parents. The new report provides
404
EDUCATION
information about attainment in the various
subjects studied. Included are teachers’
comments on pupils’ progress and details
about steps to build on success or overcome
difficulties. There is one main school report
each year and one brief update report. Parents
have the opportunity to respond to the report
and discuss the next steps at parent/teacher
meetings.
The Northern Ireland reporting system to
parents is broadly similar to that in England
and Wales.
Failing Schools
Proposals designed to deal with schools
performing badly in England and Wales are
contained in the 1993 Education Act. If
school inspectors identify a school failing to
give its pupils an acceptable standard of
education, the LEA will be able to appoint
new governors and withdraw delegated
management from the school. Should these
measures fail to work, central government is
empowered to bring in an Education
Association to put the school under new
management until its performance reaches a
satisfactory level. The new management will
be financed from central government. After
further advice from the schools inspectorate
(see p. 411), the Secretary of State for
Education or the Secretary of State for Wales
will decide whether to end the Association’s
period of care for the school and to consider
the school for self-governing status.
Ethnic Minority Children
Most school-aged children from ethnic
minorities were born in Britain and tend to
share the interests and aspirations of children
in the population at large. Nevertheless, a
substantial number still have particular needs
arising from cultural differences, including
those of language, religion and custom.
The education authorities have done much
to meet these needs. English language
teaching continues to receive priority, with a
growing awareness of the value of bilingual
support in the early primary years. Schools
may teach the main ethnic minority
community languages at secondary level in
England and Wales as part of the National
Curriculum. Emphasis has been placed on the
need for schools to take account of the ethnic
and cultural backgrounds of pupils, and
curricula should reflect ethnic and cultural
diversity. Measures have been taken to
improve the achievement of ethnic minority
pupils, and to prepare all children, not just
those of ethnic minority origin, for living in a
multi-ethnic society.
Special Educational Needs
Special educational needs comprise learning
difficulties of all kinds, including mental and
physical disabilities which hinder or prevent
learning. In the case of children whose
learning difficulties are severe or complex,
LEAs are required to:
• identify, assess and secure provision for
their needs; and
• give parents the right to be involved in
decisions about their child’s special
education.
If the education authority believes that it
should determine the education for the child,
it must draw up a formal statement of the
child’s special educational needs and the
action it intends to take to meet them.
Parents have a right of appeal if they disagree
with the contents of the statement.
Wherever possible, children with special
educational needs are educated in ordinary
schools, provided that the parents’ wishes are
taken into account. Placement in an ordinary
school must be compatible with the needs of
the child and with the provision of efficient
education for the other children in the
school.
Because of concern about the way these
arrangements are working in England and
Wales, the 1993 Education Act will:
• set statutory time limits within which the
education authority must carry out
procedures for making assessments and
statements;
• require the education authority to comply
with parents’ choice of school unless this
is inappropriate for the child or involves
an inefficient use of resources; and
405
BRITAIN 1994: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
• establish an independent tribunal to hear
appeals against education authority
decisions. The tribunal’s decisions will be
binding on all parties to the case.
The Government is also changing the law
in England and Wales to ensure that a state
school named in a statement of special
educational needs should be required to
admit the child. The education authority will
have to consult the governors before naming
the school.
The Act provides for a code of practice
offering practical guidance to all state schools
on early action to identify, assess and monitor
pupils in order to ensure that all children
requiring an assessment and, later, a
statement are properly safeguarded. LEAs
and schools will have to take account of the
code.
The 1993 Education Act also deals with
pupils with special educational needs who do
not have statements. All state schools will
have to provide details about their policy
regarding the needs of all these pupils,
including assessment.
In Scotland the choice of school is a
matter for agreement between education
authorities and parents.
There are 1,830 special schools (both day
and boarding) for pupils with special
educational needs who cannot be educated at
ordinary schools. Some of these are run by
voluntary organisations and some are
established in hospitals. They cater for about
110,800 pupils. Developments in information
technology (see p. 411) are increasingly
leading to better quality education for these
children.
Health and Welfare of Schoolchildren
Physical education, including organised
games, is part of the curriculum of all
maintained schools, and playing fields must
be available for pupils over the age of eight.
Most secondary schools have a gymnasium.
Government health departments are
responsible for the medical inspection of
schoolchildren and for advice on, and
treatment of, medical and dental problems
associated with children of school age. The
education service seeks to help prevent and
deal with juvenile drug misuse and to assist
prevention of the spread of AIDS. In
England and Wales government funds have
supported the appointment in most LEAs of
drugs and health education co-ordinators for
schools, colleges and the youth service. In
Scotland this is an education authority
responsibility.
LEAs and self-governing state schools are
responsible for providing school meals for
pupils. They are free to decide the nature of
the services, taking account of local
circumstances. They must provide meals free
of charge to pupils whose parents receive a
social security benefit called income support
(see p. 396). Although LEAs do not have to
provide milk to any pupil, they can decide to
give free milk to pupils of parents in receipt
of income support.
Under certain conditions LEAs must
supply free school transport and have
discretionary powers to help with the cost of
travel to school.
In Northern Ireland school meals must be
provided for primary, special and grant-aided
nursery school pupils.
Corporal punishment is prohibited by law
in state schools in Britain and for pupils in
independent schools whose fees are met
wholly or partly from public funds.
Independent Schools
Fee-paying independent schools must register
with the appropriate education department
and are open to inspection. They can be
required to remedy serious shortcomings in
their accommodation or instruction, and to
exclude anyone regarded as unsuitable to
teach in or own a school. About 7 per cent of
schoolchildren attend independent schools.
There are 2,447 independent schools
educating 603,000 pupils of all ages. They
charge fees varying from around £300 a term
for day pupils at nursery age to £4,000 a
term for senior boarding pupils. Many offer
bursaries to help pupils from less well-off
families. Such pupils may also be helped by
LEAs—particularly if the authorities’ own
schools cannot meet the needs of individual
children—or by the Government’s Assisted
Places Scheme, under which financial
406
EDUCATION
assistance is given according to parental
income. Over 37,000 places are offered in
England, Wales and Scotland under the
scheme. The Government also gives income-
related help with fees to 500 pupils at five
music schools and the Royal Ballet School; in
1991 this scheme was extended to provide a
limited number of scholarships at cathedral
choir schools.
Independent schools range from small
kindergartens to large day and boarding
schools and from new and, in some cases,
experimental schools to ancient foundations.
The 600 boys’, girls’ and mixed preparatory
schools prepare children for entry to senior
schools. The normal age-range for these
preparatory schools is from seven-plus to 11,
12 or 13, but many have pre-preparatory
departments for younger children. A number
of independent schools have been established
by religious orders and ethnic minorities.
Independent schools for older pupils—
from 11, 12 or 13 to 18 or 19—include about
550 which are often referred to as public
schools. These belong to the Headmasters’
Conference, the Governing Bodies
Association, the Society of Headmasters and
Headmistresses of Independent Schools, the
Girls’ Schools Association and the Governing
Bodies of Girls’ Schools Association.
Teachers
Teachers in state schools in England and
Wales are appointed by LEAs or school
governing bodies. They must hold
qualifications approved by the Department
for Education.
Formal teacher appraisal is being
introduced in English and Welsh schools. By
1995 all teachers will have completed the first
year of their two-year appraisal cycle, which
is intended to assist professional development,
strengthen the management of schools and
improve the quality of education provided to
pupils.
Consideration is being given to ways of
ensuring that teachers’ pay is more closely
related to performance.
Almost all entrants to teaching in state
schools in England and Wales complete an
approved course of teacher training. These
courses are offered by university departments
of education as well as other higher education
establishments (see p. 415).
Non-graduates usually qualify by taking a
four-year Bachelor of Education (BEd)
honours degree. There are also specially
designed two-year BEd courses—mostly in
subjects where there is a shortage of teachers
at the secondary level—for suitably qualified
people. Graduates normally take a one-year
Postgraduate Certificate in Education
(PGCE) course.
Reform of Initial Teacher Training
Under new government reforms in England
and Wales, schools will play a much larger
part in initial teacher training as full partners
of higher education institutions. Graduates on
a 36-week one-year PGCE course who wish
to become secondary school teachers, for
instance, will train in schools for at least 24
weeks.
The Government expects that schools will
take on more responsibility for planning and
managing courses and for the selection,
training and assessment of students, usually
in partnership with institutions. Schools will
train students to teach their specialist
subjects, assess pupils and manage classes;
they will also supervise students and assess
their competence.
Higher education institutions will be
responsible for ensuring that courses meet
requirements for academic validation,
presenting courses for accreditation and
awarding qualifications to successful students.
The schools will perform this role where
there is no institution partner.
Accreditation
A system of approving institutions, rather
than individual courses, is being introduced;
course approval will continue during the
transition to the new system. Higher
education institutions will have to submit a
five-year development plan to the Council for
the Accreditation of Teacher Education
(CATE) for approval. An inspection by the
schools inspectorates in England and Wales
will then take place, followed by a response
407
BRITAIN 1994: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
from the institution. CATE will consider the
inspectorate’s report and the response and
then make a recommendation to the Secretary
of State, who will take the final decision on
accreditation.
Other Training
Under the Licensed Teacher Scheme, a
trainee teacher is appointed to the school,
which provides training and pays a salary; on
completion of a two-year period of in-service
training, qualified teacher status is granted.
A recent report from OFSTED (see
p. 411) indicates that licensed teachers are
generally achieving satisfactory levels of
teaching competence.
Qualified teachers from other European
Community countries are usually granted
qualified teacher status.
Scotland
All teachers in education authority schools
must be registered with the General
Teaching Council (GTC) for Scotland. The
GTC is responsible for disciplinary
procedures under which teachers guilty of
professional misconduct may be removed
permanently or temporarily from the register.
Advice is given by the GTC to the Secretary
of State for Scotland on teacher supply and
the professional suitability of teacher-training
courses.
All entrants to the teaching profession are
graduates. New primary teachers qualify
either through a four-year BEd course or a
one-year postgraduate course at a higher
education teacher-training institution. In
addition, the University of Stirling offers
courses which combine academic and
professional training for intending primary
and secondary teachers. Teachers of academic
subjects at secondary schools must hold a
degree containing two passes in the subjects
which they wish to teach. Secondary teachers
must undertake a one-year postgraduate
training course. For music and technology,
four-year BEd courses are also available, and
for physical education all teachers take BEd
courses.
Under new guidelines on initial teacher¬
training courses, students on the one-year
postgraduate course for secondary teachers
spend 22 weeks in school during their
courses. In addition, the overall school
placement for the undergraduate BEd degree
for primary school teachers is 30 weeks over
the four-year period of the course. The one-
year postgraduate course for primary teachers
remains unchanged; students will continue to
spend 18 weeks in school and 18 weeks in
college-based study.
All new pre-service and major in-service
courses provided by teacher-training
institutions must be approved by The
Scottish Office Education Department and a
validating body.
Education authorities have developed
schemes to implement national guidelines for
staff development and appraisal. Schemes
must ensure that all teachers have been
appraised at least once by the end of the
1995-96 school session.
Northern Ireland
Teacher training is provided by Queen’s
University Belfast, the University of Ulster
and two colleges of education. The principal
courses are BEd Honours (four years) and the
one-year Postgraduate Certificate of
Education. Education and library boards have
a statutory duty to ensure that teachers are
equipped with the necessary skills to
implement education reforms and the
Northern Ireland Curriculum.
Curriculum
England and Wales
The Government is introducing a broad and
balanced curriculum designed to meet the
individual needs of pupils and to be relevant
to the responsibilities and experiences of
adult life.
The National Curriculum consists of the
core subjects of English, mathematics and
science, as well as the other foundation
subjects of history, geography, technology,
music, art, physical education and, for
secondary school pupils, a modern foreign
language. The scope of these subject areas is
408
EDUCATION
defined and amended through parliamentary
Orders. National Curriculum subjects are
being introduced progressively; by 1996-97
the entire National Curriculum will be taught
to all pupils.
The National Curriculum is being
reviewed to see whether it can be made more
manageable.
The Government has asked primary school
head teachers in England to consider possible
changes in teaching methods and organisation
which would allow the grouping of pupils by
ability and more use of specialist subject
teaching for older children.
In Wales the Welsh language constitutes a
core subject in Welsh-speaking schools and a
foundation subject elsewhere under the
National Curriculum. The National
Curriculum requirements for Welsh were
introduced in 1990. Some 80 per cent of
primary schools either use Welsh as a
teaching medium or teach it as a second
language, while nearly 90 per cent of
secondary schools teach Welsh as a first or
second language.
There are statutory attainment targets
specifying the knowledge, skills and
understanding expected of children at the
ages of 7, 11, 14 and 16. National statutory
assessments of pupils’ performance in
reaching these targets in English, mathematics
and science are gradually being implemented.
These are a combination of tests for pupils
and assessment by teachers of their classroom
work; equal status is being given to test
results and teacher assessment.
From 1994 the General Certificate of
Secondary Education (GCSE) will be the
main means for assessing attainment of
16-year-old pupils in National Curriculum
subjects. GCSE examinations are usually
taken after five years of secondary education
and can lead on to more advanced education
and training (see p. 413). The structure of the
exam is being adapted in accordance with
National Curriculum requirements. The
results of assessments are given to parents.
Consideration is being given to extending
the study of National Curriculum subjects,
particularly technology, into vocational and
practical areas for 14- to 16-year-old pupils
whose aptitudes lie in this direction.
Scotland
The content and management of the
curriculum are the responsibility of education
authorities and head teachers, though
guidance is provided by the Scottish
Secretary of State and the Scottish
Consultative Council on the Curriculum. The
Council has recommended that secondary
level pupils should follow a broad and
balanced curriculum consisting of English,
mathematics, science, a modern European
language, social studies, technological
activities, art, music or drama, religious and
moral education, and physical education.
A major programme of curricular review
and development is in progress for the 5 to
14 age-range. The Government has issued
new guidance on English language,
mathematics, expressive arts, Latin, modern
languages, environmental studies and
religious and moral education. This is
intended to help schools design, plan and
implement policies and programmes which
will give all pupils a balanced and worthwhile
experience in these subjects. Under new
arrangements, standardised tests in English
and mathematics are given to primary school
pupils whenever they complete one of five
levels. A major programme to extend modern
language teaching to primary schools is in
process, including pilot studies.
Provision is made for teaching in Gaelic in
Gaelic-speaking areas.
Pupils take the Scottish Certificate of
Education (SCE) at Standard grade at the
end of their fourth year of secondary
education at the age of 16. The Higher grade
is taken in the fifth and sixth year. Some
pupils also sit examinations for the Certificate
of Sixth Year Studies or take vocational
National Certificate units (see p. 414).
Northern Ireland
The common curriculum in all publicly
financed schools is based on six broad areas
of study: English, mathematics, science and
technology, the environment and society,
creative and expressive studies, and, for
secondary schools, language studies. Religious
education is obligatory at all stages. The
409
BRITAIN 1994: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
curriculum will be fully implemented by
September 1994.
Attainment targets, programmes of study
and methods of assessment—at ages 8, 11,
14 and 16—are specified for all compulsory
subjects. The first assessments were piloted
in the school year 1992-93 for pupils at the
ages of 11 and 14 who had followed
programmes of study in English,
mathematics and science for three years.
Eight-year-old pupils will be assessed on a
pilot basis in 1993-94 and the first
assessments for 16-year-olds will be in
1994-95. As in England and Wales, the
GCSE examination will be used to assess
16-year-old pupils.
The school curriculum includes six
compulsory cross-curricular themes: cultural
heritage, education for mutual
understanding, health education, information
technology, and, in secondary schools,
economic awareness and careers education.
The first theme is designed to help
overcome distrust between Protestants and
Roman Catholics by enabling them to
understand the common and distinctive
elements of their cultural heritage. The
second is meant to teach them how to
understand the other person’s point of view
and appreciate the benefits of resolving
conflicts by non-violent means. Pupils are
studying a common history curriculum in
the environment and society area of study.
Religious Education and Collective
Worship in Schools
In England and Wales maintained schools
must provide religious education and a daily
act of collective worship. Since the 1988
Education Reform Act, some local
authorities have reviewed their agreed
syllabuses for religious education to take
account of the fact that religious traditions in
Great Britain are in the main Christian.
Syllabuses, however, also cover the teachings
of the other main religions represented in
the country.
The Government is proposing that those
authorities which have not reviewed their
syllabuses should be required to do so in a
specified period. Each local education
authority area has a standing council which
gives advice on the development of religious
education.
All voluntary schools provide the
opportunity for denominational religious
education.
Parents have the right to withdraw their
children from religious education classes and
from collective worship.
Scottish education authorities are
required to see that schools practise religious
observance and give pupils religious
instruction; parents may withdraw their
children if they wish. Certain schools provide
for Roman Catholic children but in all
schools there are safeguards for individual
conscience.
In Northern Ireland, too, schools are
obliged to offer religious education and
collective worship, although parents have the
right to withdraw their children from both.
In controlled schools clergy have a right of
access which may be used for denominational
instruction. In voluntary schools collective
worship and religious education are
controlled by the management authorities. It
is intended that religious education will have
an agreed core syllabus which grant-aided
schools can expand according to their own
needs and wishes.
Curriculum Development and
Assessment
In England the School Curriculum and
Assessment Authority is responsible for:
• reviewing the school curriculum;
• advising the Government on content;
• carrying out programmes of research and
development; and
• publishing information about the
curriculum.
All GCSE and other qualifications offered
to pupils of compulsory school age in state
schools in England and Wales must be
approved by the Government. Associated
syllabuses and assessment procedures must
comply with national guidelines and be
approved by the Authority. The aim is to
secure a reasonably wide choice of
410
EDUCATION
qualifications and syllabuses which support
the National Curriculum.
The Authority will keep under review all
aspects of examinations and assessment and
will maintain links with the Curriculum and
Assessment Authority for Wales.
In Scotland curriculum development is
undertaken by the Scottish Consultative
Council on the Curriculum. The Scottish
Examination Board liaises with the Council
on links between the curriculum and
assessment.
Northern Ireland has two organisations,
one responsible for the curriculum and the
other for assessment. Both will be replaced
in April 1994 by the Northern Ireland
Council for Curriculum, Examinations and
Assessment.
Information Technology
The National Curriculum places a strong
emphasis on the use of information
technology (IT) to enhance teaching and
learning and ensure that all children are well
versed in the new technologies. In England
the average number of pupils per
microcomputer in primary schools is 25,
compared with 107 in 1984-85. The figure
for secondary schools is 13, compared with
60 in 1984—85. Two-thirds of secondary
schools use central computing facilities. In
Wales the average number of pupils per
microcomputer in primary schools went
down from 68 to 34 between 1988 and 1991;
in secondary schools over the same period
the average number decreased from 30 to 14.
Department for Education grants
are available to increase microcomputer
provision, help secondary schools buy
CD-ROM (compact disc—read only
memory) drives and discs, and continue
the programme of teacher training in the
effective use of IT.
The Government also helps finance the
National Council for Educational
Technology, which encourages the use of
microcomputers, electronic systems and
other aspects of IT in education and
training. The corresponding body in
Scotland is the Scottish Council for
Educational Technology.
Other government projects include
funding for:
• the development of CD-ROM discs to
support the National Curriculum;
• help for teacher-training institutions to
purchase CD-ROM drives and discs;
• investigating the potential of interactive
multimedia technology as a teaching aid
and assessing its full use for curriculum
development in schools; and
• assessing the value of portable
computers and calculators in schools and
the implication for teacher training.
In Wales the Welsh Office has financed
the provision of satellite receiving equipment
for secondary schools throughout the
country.
In Northern Ireland, IT is one of the six
compulsory educational themes forming part
of the curriculum for all pupils of statutory
school age in grant-aided schools.
Other Educational Aids
Teachers and pupils use a range of other
aids in the classroom. Most schools have
audio-visual equipment such as slide
projectors and overhead projectors. The
BBC (British Broadcasting Corporation) and
the independent broadcasting companies
transmit radio and television programmes
designed for schools. Teachers’ notes,
pupils’ pamphlets and computer software
accompany many broadcast series.
The government-funded National
Educational Resources Information Service
enables schools to find out about teaching
aids.
School Inspections
Various inspectorates report to the
Government on the quality of education
provided by schools.
In England the independent Office for
Standards in Education (OFSTED) advises
the Education Secretary on quality,
standards and efficiency in school education
and regulates a new system of school
inspections. The inspection cycle began in
411
BRITAIN 1994: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
September 1993 for secondary schools and
will start in September 1994 for primary and
other schools.
Every school has to be inspected by a
team of independent inspectors—headed by a
registered inspector—containing educationists
and lay people. Inspections take place
according to agreed national standards
monitored by OFSTED. Some 6,000 schools
in England will be examined annually over a
four-year period and this work will continue
in four-yearly cycles. Parents are sent a
summary of the full inspection report, which
is published. School governing bodies have to
prepare action plans to follow it up and then
report back to parents on their progress.
OFSTED is headed by Her Majesty’s
Chief Inspector of Schools.
In 1992 a new and independent office of
Her Majesty’s Chief Inspector of Schools for
Wales was established with similar functions
to those of OFSTED. All schools will be
inspected on a regular cycle, set at five years
in the first instance.
In Scotland HM Schools Inspectorate is
responsible for independent and objective
evaluation of education standards and for
advising the Scottish Secretary. During
inspections, the views and concerns of
parents are ascertained so that these can be
taken into account by the inspectors. Full
reports on inspections are published and a
short summary given to parents. From
1994-95, each inspection team will contain
lay people. The Inspectorate’s Audit Unit
collects, analyses and publishes evidence
about the performance of schools and
education authorities. Evidence is published
on a comparative basis and recommendations
are made for action and improvement.
School inspections in Northern Ireland are
carried out by the Education and Training
Inspectorate. The Government is planning to
introduce from September 1993 a cycle of
school inspections so that each school will be
inspected every five years.
Schools, Careers and Business
One of the Government’s key objectives is to
help young people achieve their full potential
and develop the skills the economy needs.
This requires close working relationships
between industry and education.
The Technical and Vocational Education
Initiative (TVEI), applicable in England,
Scotland and Wales, is designed to ensure
that the school curriculum for 14- to 18-year-
olds is made more relevant to adult and
working life in a modern technological
society. It is financed and administered by
central government, working in close co¬
operation with LEAs. Over 1 million students
are benefiting from TVEI in England.
Education Business Partnerships,
consisting of representatives from industry,
education and the wider community, aim to
bring about closer links between education
and industry and ensure that young people
develop the skills and attitudes to help them
succeed in the labour market. They are
supported by Training and Enterprise
Councils (see p. 143) and LEAs.
One of the main schemes managed by the
Partnerships is the Teacher Placement
Service (TPS), funded by the Department of
Employment. The objective of the TPS
is to organise placements in business for
teachers each year in order to extend their
professional and personal development,
improve learning opportunities for young
people, and provide better careers education
services. Since 1989 some 90,000 teachers
have been on placements.
Compacts bring together employers, young
people, schools, colleges and other bodies
involved in training in order to help young
people achieve more at school and continue
education and training after the age of 16.
Under Compact schemes young people agree
to work towards agreed goals; in return for
achieving them, employers provide a number
of incentives including, in inner city areas, a
job with training or training leading to a job.
Careers
Careers guidance helps individuals achieve
their potential and closer links are being
nurtured between schools and employers.
LEAs are currently responsible for the
Careers Service. This responsibility is being
passed to central government under the 1993
Education Act. Once the change takes effect,
412
EDUCATION
the Government will be able to contract a
range of organisations to provide a Careers
Service which will be more responsive to the
needs and demands of local communities.
Careers services in schools and colleges are
supported by materials produced by the
Careers and Occupational Information Centre.
In Northern Ireland careers education is
one of the six compulsory education themes
forming part of the school curriculum.
All state secondary schools in England and
Wales have to provide leavers with a National
Record of Achievement setting out their
school attainments, including public
examination and National Curriculum
assessment results. The Record is designed to
give people a simple record of achievement in
education and training throughout working
life. In Scotland the record is not compulsory
but it is available to all education authorities
for issue to school leavers.
In Northern Ireland all pupils are issued
with a record of achievement on leaving
primary and secondary education.
POST-COMPULSORY EDUCATION
Post-compulsory education takes place in
school sixth forms, sixth form colleges,
further education colleges, universities and
other higher education institutions.
Recent reforms in England, Wales and
Scotland have ended the distinction between
universities, polytechnics and other higher
education establishments. The present close
relationship with Northern Ireland’s existing
unitary structure will continue. Degree¬
awarding powers have been extended to major
institutions and there are new quality
assurance arrangements. All the former
polytechnics and one college have become
universities.
In 1991-92 there were some 5.3 million
people in Britain in post-compulsory
education—547,000 in schools, 3.6
million in further education and 1.2
million in higher education.
In the 1980s the number of part-time
students in universities, including the Open
University (see p. 417), rose by 47 per cent
and in the former polytechnics and colleges
by 50 per cent.
By the mid-1990s, every 16- and 17-year-
old leaving full-time education in Great
Britain will be encouraged to undertake
vocational education or training by the offer
of a Youth Credit (see p. 128), enabling them
to buy training from the establishment of
their choice.
Credit accumulation and transfer schemes
are in use in many English and Welsh post¬
school establishments. In Scotland a credit
accumulation scheme covers courses in all
further and higher education. Opportunities
for further and higher education and training
are publicised by national information
services, such as the Educational Counselling
and Credit Transfer Information Service,
which is funded by the Department for
Education.
In September 1993 the Government
published charters for the users of further
and higher education in England, chiefly
students, parents and employers. These set
out the standards of service which users
should expect, including information about
courses, financial support for students and
complaints procedures if things go wrong. A
similar charter has been published in
Scotland.
Schools and Sixth-form Colleges
Having taken the GCSE examination (see
p. 409) at the age of 16, students in England,
Wales and Northern Ireland can stay on at
school or, in the case of England and Wales,
be educated in a sixth-form college. They
study for examinations which are the main
standard for entry to higher education or
professional training. These include the
academic General Certificate of Education
(GCE) Advanced (A) level, an examination
which is taken at the age of 18 or 19 after
two years’ study; part of the qualification is
based on course work and the rest on written
test papers. Advanced Supplementary (AS)
levels enable sixth-form pupils to study a
wider range of subjects. Students specialising
in the arts and humanities, for example, can
continue to study mathematics and
technological subjects at the new level.
413
BRITAIN 1994: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Requiring the same standard of work as A
levels, an AS level occupies half the teaching
and study time of an A level.
The Government is promoting equality of
status for academic and vocational
qualifications in England, Wales and
Northern Ireland. For example, it is
developing a system of new General National
Vocational Qualifications (GNVQs) for young
people in full-time education between the
ages of 16 and 18. These provide a broad-
based preparation for a range of occupations
and higher education and are designed to
have parity of esteem with GCE A levels.
There are three GNVQJevels—Advanced,
Intermediate and Foundation. An Advanced
GNVQ, called the ‘vocational A level’,
requires a level of achievement equal to two
GCE A levels. Young people will be able to
choose a combination of GCE A levels and
GNVQ^ Advanced level.
Students wishing to continue in full-time
education for a year after the age of 16 can
study courses leading to the City and Guilds
Diploma of Vocational Education.
Scotland
Pupils staying on at school after the end of
compulsory education study for the Higher
Grade Scottish Certificate of Education exam
at the age of 16-18; passes at this grade are
the basis for entry to higher education or
professional training. However, entry is
becoming more flexible as wider access to
under-represented groups with non-standard
qualifications is encouraged. The Certificate
of Sixth Year Studies (CSYS) is for pupils
who have completed their Higher grade main
studies and who wish to continue studies in
particular subjects.
A flexible system of vocational courses for
16- to 18-year-olds has been introduced in
schools and colleges in disciplines such as
business and administration, engineering and
industrial production. These courses are also
intended to meet the needs of many adults
entering training or returning to education.
The courses lead to the award of the non-
advanced National Certificate, intended for
students over 16 who have successfully
completed a programme of vocational courses
based on short study units. Similar unit-based
courses are also available at advanced levels.
General Scottish Vocational Qualifications
(General SVQs) are designed to meet the
needs of 16- to 19-year-olds at school or in
further education colleges. Similar to the
GNVQs in the rest of Britain, General SVQs
are designed as a stepping-stone to higher
education or further training.
Further Education
People over the age of 16 can also take
courses in further education institutions.
These cover courses up to and including
GCE A level or GNVQ^ Advanced level.
Much further education is work-related and
vocational. The system is flexible and enables
the student to acquire qualifications according
to his or her abilities. Further education
institutions supply much of the education
element in government-sponsored training
programmes such as Youth Training and
Training for Work (see Chapter 11).
Many students on further education
courses attend part time, either by day release
or block release from employment or during
the evenings. The system has strong ties with
commerce and industry, and co-operation
with business is encouraged by the
Government and its agencies. Employers are
normally involved in designing courses.
Courses are run by over 500 institutions of
further education, many of which also offer
higher education courses (see p. 415). In
England, Wales and Scotland each is
controlled by an autonomous further
education corporation and governing body
with substantial representation from business.
Funds are allocated to institutions by further
education funding councils in England and
Wales; part of the funding is not cash limited
and is directly related to student numbers.
The councils have appointed quality
assurance committees to help them assess
the quality of education provided.
In Scotland funds are distributed to
colleges by The Scottish Office Education
Department.
Institutions are obliged to publish
information about the way they use their
financial and other resources. Expenditure
414
EDUCATION
plans provide for a record 25 per cent rise in
full-time equivalent student numbers in
England and a 28 per cent rise in Wales over
the three-year period from 1993-94.
Vocational Qualifications
In the past the nature and standing of the
many vocational qualifications were unclear
and uncertain. The system was also difficult
to understand for employers and those
seeking training.
The National Council for Vocational
Qualifications (NCVQ) is simplifying the
system by establishing a new framework of
National Vocational Qualifications (NVQs) in
England, Wales and Northern Ireland. These
are based on national standards defining the
competence, knowledge and understanding
that employers need. Awarding bodies have
been reforming their qualifications for
accreditation by the National Council.
The following five levels of NVQs have
been established:
Level 1—Foundation
Level 2—Basic craft
Level 3—Technician, advanced craft,
supervisor
Level 4—Higher technician, junior
management
Level 5—Professional, middle management.
NVQs are made up of units. Performance
of candidates is assessed in workplace
conditions and the NVQis a guarantee of
competence to do a particular job. NVQs are
designed mainly for people in work, although
they can also be studied in colleges and some
schools.
By the end of 1992, the NCVQ had
accredited NVQs covering 83 per cent of the
workforce at levels 1 to 4. The Government
wants 50 per cent of young people to have
reached NVQ level 3 by the year 2000.
In Scotland there is a similar system of
Scottish Vocational Qualifications (SVQs),
which are accredited and awarded by the
Scottish Vocational Education Council
(see below).
NVQs and SVQs have equal recognition
throughout Britain. The General NVQ and
General SVQ system for full-time students in
education is described on p. 414.
Examining Bodies
About 90 per cent of vocational qualifications
in England, Wales and Northern Ireland are
assessed by three examining bodies and
accredited by the NCVQ
The Business and Technology Education
Council (BTEC) plans and administers a
unified national system of courses at all
levels; the most popular subjects are business,
engineering and construction.
The City and Guilds of London Institute
provides mostly part-time qualifications in
areas such as engineering, construction,
catering, hairdressing and community care.
The RSA Examinations Board is the
largest provider of information technology
qualifications throughout Britain and
offers NVQs in areas ranging from
management/customer service to retailing
and wholesaling.
Other vocational qualifications are awarded
by a large number of professional bodies.
The Scottish Vocational Education
Council (SCOTVEC) is the main
accreditation and awarding body in Scotland.
Higher Education
Higher education consists of degree and other
courses of a standard higher than the GCE
A level or its equivalent. These include the
four-year BEd courses for trainee teachers
(see p. 407). The Government wishes to see
an increase in the proportion of students in
engineering and technology and on sub¬
degree courses such as two-year full-time
vocational diplomas.
Access and foundation courses provide a
preparation and an appropriate test before
enrolment on a course of higher education for
prospective students who do not possess the
standard entry qualifications (GCE ‘A’ levels
and equivalent qualifications). Many are from
the ethnic minority communities. The growth
of access courses has been very rapid in
recent years; about 600 are now available
nationwide.
The Scottish Wider Access Programme
(SWAP) is designed to promote greater
participation in higher education, especially
by mature students and those without the
415
BRITAIN 1994: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
normal entry requirements. Successful
completion of a SWAP course guarantees a
higher education place.
Some 30 per cent of first-year
undergraduate students in 1991 were
aged 21 or over.
In order to maintain British expertise in
technology, recent government schemes have
sought to expand higher education and
research in electronics, engineering and
computer science by making available extra
student places, and additional staff and
research fellowships. A Graduate Enterprise
Programme offers 450 places on management
training courses for recently qualified
graduates.
The Higher Education Quality Council,
financed by subscriptions from universities
and higher education colleges, is responsible
for ensuring that institutions provide high-
quality education.
The various higher education funding
councils have responsibility for financing
teaching, research and related activities in all
publicly funded universities and colleges of
higher education (see below).
Student Grants and Loans
Over 90 per cent of full-time students
resident in England and Wales on first degree
and other comparable higher education courses
are eligible for mandatory awards covering
tuition fees and maintenance. Contributions
from parents are assessed according to their
income. Awards are made by LEAs in England
and Wales. Grants for other courses are given
at the discretion of an LEA. Similar schemes
are administered by The Scottish Office
Education Department and the Northern
Ireland education and library boards.
Grants for postgraduate study are offered
by the government education departments
and by the research councils (see Chapter 19).
Some scholarships are available from
endowments and also from particular
industries or companies.
Most students on courses of full-time,
non-postgraduate higher education can get a
top-up student loan to help pay their
maintenance costs. Loans are not means
tested and repayments are indexed to
inflation. The scheme is designed to share
the cost of student maintenance more
equitably between students, parents and the
taxpayer. In 1991-92 loans worth £139
million were made to 261,000 students in
Britain, representing 36 per cent of those
eligible. Loans are administered by the
Student Loans Company in Glasgow.
Limited access funds administered by
universities and colleges are available to
people in cases where access to higher
education might be inhibited by financial
considerations or where students face real
financial difficulties. In 1993-94, for example,
there is provision of £23.8 million in England
for this purpose.
Universities
There are 83 universities (12 in Scotland),
including the Open University. They are
governed by royal charters or by Act of
Parliament and enjoy academic freedom.
They appoint their own staff, decide which
students to admit, provide their own
courses and award their own degrees. The
universities of Oxford and Cambridge date
from the 12th and 13 th centuries, and the
Scottish universities of St Andrews, Glasgow,
Aberdeen and Edinburgh from the 14th and
15th centuries. All the other universities in
Britain were founded in the 19th and 20th
centuries. The 1960s saw considerable
expansion in the number of new universities.
The number of universities also increased
considerably in 1992, when polytechnics and
some other higher education establishments
were given the freedom to become universities.
Applications for first degree courses are
usually made through the Universities and
Colleges Admission Service (UCAS) in
Cheltenham. Forms are completed and
received at UCAS by 15 December in the
year before courses begin. UCAS then sends
them to the institutions selected by the
applicant. People applying for places at
Oxford and Cambridge universities have to
submit an additional form to the university.
First degree courses are mainly full time
and usually last three years in England and
416
EDUCATION
Wales. However, there are some four-year
courses, and medical and veterinary courses
normally require five years. All first degree
courses in Scotland require four years of
study. The ratio of staff to full-time students
is about 1 to 12.5.
Universities offer courses in a wide range
of subjects, including traditional arts subjects
and science and technology. Some courses
lead to the examinations of the chief
professional bodies, and to qualifications such
as those of the BTEC.
Many universities have close links with
commerce and industry, with some students
having a job and attending on a part-time
basis.
Degree titles vary according to the practice
of each university. In England, Wales and
Northern Ireland the most common titles for
a first degree are Bachelor of Arts (BA) or
Bachelor of Science (BSc) and for a second
degree Master of Arts (MA), Master of
Science (MSc), and Doctor of Philosophy
(PhD). In the older Scottish universities
Master is used for a first degree in arts
subjects. Uniformity of standards between
universities is promoted by employing external
examiners for all university examinations.
The Open University and other
universities are responsible for validating
degrees at higher education institutions
without degree-awarding powers.
Most staff combine research with their
teaching duties and about half of postgraduate
students are engaged on research projects.
The Government is encouraging universities to
co-operate closely with industry on research.
Over 40 science parks have been set up by
higher education institutions in conjunction
with industrial scientists and technologists to
promote the development and commercial
application of advanced technology.
The Open University
The Open University is a non-residential
university offering degree and other courses
for adult students of all ages in Britain and
the other member countries of the European
Community. It uses a combination of
specially produced printed texts,
correspondence tuition, television and radio
broadcasts, audio and video cassettes, and
residential schools. There is also a network of
study centres for contact with part-time
tutors and counsellors, and with fellow
students. No formal academic qualifications
are required to register for most courses, but
the standards of the University’s degrees are
the same as those of other universities. Its
first degrees are the BA (Open) or the BSc
(Open), which are general degrees awarded
on a system of credits for each course
completed. In 1993 there were some 86,000
registered undergraduates, and in all some
122,000 first degrees have been awarded since
the University started its courses in 1970.
The University has a programme of higher
degrees. The Bachelor of Philosophy (BPhil),
Master of Philosophy (MPhil) and PhD are
research degrees and the MA, MSc and
Master of Business Administration (MBA)
are awarded after successful completion of
taught courses. About 9,000 students were
registered on higher degree courses in 1993.
There are also programmes for
professionals in education and the health and
social welfare services, and for updating
managers, scientists and technologists. Some
of these are multi-media courses taught in a
similar way to those in the undergraduate
programme, and others are in the form of
self-contained study packs. In 1992 about
39,000 students were following courses in
these areas and 82,000 study packs were sold.
The University has advised many other
countries on setting up similar institutions. It
has made a substantial contribution to the
new Commonwealth of Learning project,
which brings together distance-teaching
establishments and students throughout the
Commonwealth, and to the European
Distance Education Network. It is financed
by the higher education funding councils.
Continuing Education for Adults
Continuing education for adults is provided
by further education institutions, adult
colleges and centres, and by voluntary bodies
such as the Workers’ Educational Association.
The duty to provide it is shared by the new
further education funding councils and by
LEAs.
417
BRITAIN 1994: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
In addition to cultural and craft pursuits,
students follow courses leading to academic
and vocational qualifications, and courses
which provide access to higher education.
Adults’ special educational needs for literacy
and numeracy are also met, and there is
provision for those seeking proficiency in
English as a second language.
ALBSU
The Adult Literacy and Basic Skills Unit
(ALBSU) is concerned with adult literacy,
numeracy and related basic skills in England
and Wales. It provides consultancy and
advisory services, organises staff training and
produces materials for teachers and students.
Government funding was worth £3.2 million
in 1992-93. Another programme is Basic
Skills at Work, with government funding of
£3 million; it is targeted at unemployed
people and those in work who cannot
progress without better basic skills.
Open College
Open learning opportunities have been
extended with the formation in 1987 of the
Open College, an independent company set
up with government support. The College
brings together broadcasters, educationists
and sponsors, and provides vocational
education and training courses below degree
level. Programmes are broadcast by
independent television’s Channel 4. The
Open College of the Arts, also launched in
1987, offers an arts foundation course to
those wishing to study at home.
National Institute of Adult Continuing
Education
The National Institute of Adult Continuing
Education represents adult interests in
education and training in England and Wales.
It is a centre for information, research,
development work and publication.
Scottish Community Education Council
The Scottish Community Education Council
advises the Government and promotes all
community education matters, including
adult literacy and basic education, and youth
work.
EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH
Educational research is supported financially
by government departments, the Economic
and Social Research Council (see Chapter
19), philanthropic organisations, higher
education institutions, teachers’ associations
and other agencies.
The major research institutions outside
the universities are the autonomous National
Foundation for Educational Research in
England and Wales and the Scottish Council
for Research in Education.
EDUCATIONAL LINKS OVERSEAS
Large numbers of people come to Britain
from overseas to study, and British people
work and train overseas. The British aid
programme encourages links between
educational institutions in Britain and
developing countries.
There has been an expansion of interest
in European studies and languages, with
exchanges of teachers, schoolchildren and
students taking place. Exchange of students
is promoted by a European Community
scheme (ERASMUS), under which grants
are provided to enable Community students
and those from countries belonging to the
European Free Trade Association to study
in other states. Over 25,000 students from
Britain have benefited from the scheme.
The Community’s LINGUA programme
seeks to improve and widen competence in
the use of foreign languages. It gives grants
towards in-service training for teachers,
study abroad for language students, joint
educational projects and exchanges for
young people undergoing professional,
vocational and technical education; it also
covers measures to develop language
training materials for business.
The Action Programme for Education
and Training for Technology (COMETT)
aims to foster co-operation between higher
education establishments and industry in the
Community by training personnel, especially
418
EDUCATION
in small and medium-sized enterprises, in
the application of advanced technology.
The EC’s PETRA vocational training
programme for young people organises
training and work experience placements in
other member states.
Community member states have created
nine European schools, including one at
Culham, Oxfordshire, to provide a
multinational education for the children of
staff employed in Community institutions.
Overseas Students in Britain
British universities and other further and
higher education establishments have built
up their strong reputation overseas by
offering tuition of the highest standards,
maintaining low student-to-staff ratios, and
offering the most relevant courses and
qualifications.
In 1991 the number of overseas students
attending publicly funded universities and
other post-school institutions in Great
Britain was 92,100. Some 30,000 came from
other EC states. About 40 per cent of all
overseas students were from the
Commonwealth and Britain’s dependent
territories.
Some 36 per cent of students enrolled for
full-time postgraduate study or research
come from overseas.
In general, overseas students following
courses of higher or further education pay
fees covering the full cost of their courses.
Nationals of other member countries of the
European Community generally pay the
lower level of fees applicable to British
students; if their courses are designated for
mandatory awards, they may be eligible for
fees-only awards from LEAs.
Government Scholarship Schemes
The Government makes considerable
provision for foreign students and trainees
under its overseas aid programme and
through other award and scholarship
schemes. In 1991-92 some 22,000 overseas
students were supported at a cost of
£138 million.
The Foreign & Commonwealth Office
Scholarships and Awards Scheme, which
operates in some 140 countries, offers study
opportunities in Britain for present and
future leaders, decision-makers and opinion
formers. Some of the awards are jointly
financed by the Foreign & Commonwealth
Office, the private sector and academic
institutions. The Department of Trade and
Industry also finances a trade-related
scholarship scheme in partnership with
British industry.
Outside the aid programme, the Overseas
Research Students Awards Scheme, funded
by the Department for Education, provides
assistance for overseas full-time postgraduate
students with outstanding research potential;
these awards meet the difference between the
home/European Community and overseas
student fee levels.
Other Schemes
Many public and private scholarships and
fellowships are available to students from
overseas and to British students who want to
study overseas. Among the best known, and
open to men and women from all walks of
life, are the British Council Fellowships, the
Commonwealth Scholarship and Fellowship
Plan, the Fulbright Scholarship Scheme, the
Marshall Scholarships, the Rhodes
Scholarships, the Churchill Scholarships and
the Confederation of British Industry
Scholarships. Most British universities and
colleges offer scholarships for which
graduates of any nationality are eligible.
English as a Foreign Language
About 250 private English language schools
in Britain are recognised by the British
Council (see p. 420.). The Council has its
own English-language teaching centres in
other countries and runs a programme for
teaching English related to specific jobs and
skills. Other British language schools also
enable people to learn English in their own
countries.
The Government’s aid programme
supports the teaching of English in many
developing countries. Publications and other
material relating to English language teaching
419
BRITAIN 1994: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
are a large component in many publishers’
lists, constituting an important export.
BBC English offers a worldwide facility
for the individual learner at home using BBC
World Service radio and television
broadcasts.
Educational Exchanges
British Council
The British Council promotes cultural and
educational relations with other countries. It
plays an important part in the management of
the aid programme to education. The
Council:
• recruits teachers for work overseas;
• organises short overseas visits by British
experts;
• encourages cultural exchange visits; and
• fosters academic interchange between
British higher education institutions and
those in other countries.
Co-operation between higher education in
Britain and developing countries is promoted
with funding from the Overseas Development
Administration. It includes:
• recruiting staff for overseas universities;
• the secondment of staff from British
higher education establishments;
• interdepartmental faculty links; and
• short-term teaching and advisory visits,
and general consultancy services.
Central Bureau for Educational Visits and
Exchanges
The Central Bureau for Educational Visits
and Exchanges provides information and
advice on all forms of educational visits and
exchanges. In addition, it:
• administers and develops a wide range of
curriculum-related exchange schemes;
• links educational establishments and
LEAs with their counterparts in other
countries; and
• organises meetings, workshops and
conferences related to professional
international experience.
The Bureau administers teacher
exchanges in Europe and the United States,
short courses for language teachers, and
international study visits. Opportunities for
young people include school and class links
and English language summer camps. For
the post-16 age group, there are work
placements and English language assistants’
posts, as well as other exchange
programmes.
Association of Commonwealth Universities
The Association of Commonwealth
Universities promotes contact and co¬
operation between hundreds of member
universities in Commonwealth countries or
regions. It assists student and staff mobility
by administering award schemes, including,
for Britain, the Commonwealth Scholarship
and Fellowship Plan and the Overseas
Development Administration Shared
Scholarship Scheme. An academic
appointments service is also operated. The
Association publishes information about
Commonwealth universities, courses and
scholarships, and organises meetings in
different parts of the world.
THE YOUTH SERVICE
Britain’s youth service—a partnership
between local government and voluntary
organisations—is concerned with informal
social education of young people and with
promoting their personal development.
Many of the voluntary organisations were
established at the end of the 19th century
and in the first decade of the 20th. In 1939
the Government first recognised the need
for a youth service forming part of
education and supported through LEAs. In
1944 the Education Act provided for the
development of a service by LEAs, in
partnership with the voluntary organisations.
There are some 5,600 full-time staff,
about 31,500 full-time equivalent part-time
workers and around 500,000 volunteers.
Local authorities maintain their own youth
centres and clubs and provide most of the
public support for local and regional
voluntary organisations. The service is said
420
EDUCATION
to reach around 5 million young people, the
voluntary organisations contributing a
significant proportion of overall provision.
The Department for Education’s Youth
Service Unit gives grants to the national
voluntary youth organisations to meet 50 per
cent of the cost of programmes designed to
promote access to the youth service, support
training for voluntary youth workers and help
improve the efficiency and effectiveness of
the organisations.
Funded primarily by central government,
England’s National Youth Agency provides:
• support for those working with young
people;
• information and publishing services; and
• support for curriculum development.
It is also responsible for the accreditation of
training and staff development for youth
workers.
The Welsh Office provides grant aid to
national youth service bodies with
headquarters in Wales and has established a
Wales Youth Agency similar to the one in
England.
In Scotland the youth service forms part
of community education, which is promoted
by the Scottish Community Education
Council (see p. 418). The Scottish Office
gives grants to voluntary youth organisations
to assist them with their headquarters
expenditure and training of staff.
The Youth Council for Northern Ireland
advises the education system on the
development of the youth service, promotes
provision of facilities and encourages cross¬
community activity among young people. It
also helps eo-ordinate youth service resources
and provides funds for voluntary youth
organisations’ headquarters.
Voluntary Youth Organisations
National voluntary youth organisations
undertake a significant share of youth
activities through local groups, which raise
most of their day-to-day expenses by their
own efforts. Many receive financial and other
help from LEAs, which also make available
facilities in many areas. The voluntary
organisations vary greatly in character and
include the uniformed organisations such as
the Scouts and Girl Guides. Other
organisations are church-based. Some also
represent Jews and Muslims. Sport and the
arts are catered for by various bodies.
There are about 6,500 youth clubs which
encourage their members to participate in
sport, cultural and other creative activities.
Some youth clubs provide information,
counselling and advice.
Many local authorities and voluntary
youth organisations have responded to new
needs in society by making provision, for
example, for the young unemployed, young
people from the ethnic minorities, young
people in inner cities or rural areas and those
in trouble or especially vulnerable. Other
areas of concern are homelessness and
provision for handicapped young people.
Many authorities have youth committees
on which official and voluntary bodies are
represented. They employ youth officers to
co-ordinate youth work and to arrange in-
service training. There are also youth
councils, which are representative bodies
of young people from local youth
organisations.
Youth Workers
In England and Wales a two-year training
course at certain universities and higher
education colleges produces qualified youth
and community workers; several
undergraduate part-time and postgraduate
courses are also available. In Scotland one-,
two- and three-year courses are provided at
colleges of education. Students from
Northern Ireland attend courses run in
universities and colleges in Great Britain and
the Irish Republic.
Other Organisations Concerned with
Young People
Finance is provided by many grant-giving
foundations and trusts for activities involving
young people. The Prince’s Trust and the
Royal Jubilee Trust provide grants and
practical help to individuals and
organisations; areas of concern include urban
deprivation, unemployment, homelessness,
421
BRITAIN 1994: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
and young offenders. Efforts are also made to
assist ethnic minorities.
The Duke of Edinburgh’s Award Scheme
challenges young people from Britain and
other Commonwealth countries to gain
bronze, silver or gold medals by meeting
certain standards in activities such as
community service, expeditions, the
development of personal interests, social and
practical skills and physical recreation.
Voluntary Service by Young People
Thousands of young people voluntarily
undertake community service designed to
help those in need, including elderly and
disabled people. Organisations responsible for
community service, such as Community
Service Volunteers, International Voluntary
Service and the British Trust for
Conservation Volunteers, receive grants from
the Government. Many schools also organise
community service work as part of the
curriculum, and voluntary work in the
community is sponsored by a number of
churches.
Youth Exchanges
The Youth Exchange Centre, managed by the
British Council (see p. 420), gives advice,
information, training and grants to British
youth groups involved in international
exchanges. The Centre is the national agency
for the EC-sponsored exchange scheme
Youth for Europe.

Everyone in Britain has the right to religious freedom—in teaching, worship
and observance—without interference from the community or the State.
Religious organisations and groups may own property, run schools, and
promote their beliefs in speech and writing. There is no religious bar to the
holding of public office.
INTRODUCTION
Most of the world’s religions are represented
in Britain, including large Hindu, Jewish,
Muslim and Sikh communities, but Britain is
predominantly Christian. Non-religious
alternatives for humanists and atheists are
offered by organisations such as the British
Humanist Association and the National
Secular Society.
Religious Freedom
Britain has a long tradition of religious
tolerance. Freedom of conscience in religious
matters was achieved gradually from the 17th
century onwards. The laws discriminating
against minority religious groups were
gradually administered less harshly and then
finally repealed. Heresy ceased to be a legal
offence with the passage of the Ecclesiastical
Jurisdiction Act 1677, and the Toleration Act
1688 granted freedom of worship to
Protestant minority groups.
In 1828 the repeal of the Test and
Corporation Acts gave nonconformists full
political rights, making it possible for them to
be appointed to public office. Roman Catholics
gained political rights under the Roman
Catholic Relief Act 1829, and the Jewish Relief
Act 1858 enabled Jews to become Members of
Parliament. In addition, the religious tests
imposed on prospective students and academic
staff of the universities of Oxford, Cambridge
and Durham were successively abolished by
Acts of 1854, 1856 and 1871. Similar
restrictions on the staff of Scottish universities
were formally removed in 1932.
The past 30 years have seen the
acceptance of a wide variety of religious
beliefs and traditions of large numbers of
immigrants of different nationalities.
Arrangements are made at places of work to
allow the members of non-Christian religions
to follow their religious observances.
Relations with the State
There are two established churches in
Britain, that is, churches legally recognised as
official churches of the State: in England the
Church of England, and in Scotland the
(Presbyterian) Church of Scotland. Ministers
of the established churches, as well as clergy
belonging to other religious groups, work in
services run by the State, such as the armed
forces, national hospitals and prisons, and are
paid a salary for such services by the State.
423
BRITAIN 1994: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Voluntary schools provided by religious
denominations may be wholly or partly
maintained from public funds. Religious
education in publicly maintained schools is
required by law throughout Britain, as is a
daily act of collective worship (see p. 410).
Religious broadcasting is subject to some
legislative controls (see p. 424).
The Government contributes towards the
upkeep of about 270 redundant Church of
England churches for which no alternative
use can be found but which are of
architectural or historic importance. The
contribution for the period 1989 to 1994 will
be about £H.l million. In June 1993 the
Government launched the Historic Chapels
Trust, which aims to preserve the redundant
chapels and places of worship of other
denominations and faiths.
The State makes no direct contribution to
church expenses, although since 1977 limited
state aid has been given for the repair of
historic churches; in 1992-93 English
Heritage grants to churches totalled £9.2
million. In 1991 the Government announced
that new money would be made available to
assist with the cost of repairs to cathedrals
and comparable buildings; an additional £4
million will be made available each year in
1994—95 and 1995-96. Such funding is not
restricted to Church of England buildings.
Involvement in Social Issues
Religious involvement in broader social issues
was highlighted in the Church of England
report Faith in the City: A Call for Action by
Church and Nation, published in 1985. This
made recommendations for improving
conditions in the inner cities and other
socially deprived areas, and led to the
establishment in 1988 of the Church of
England’s Church Urban Fund, which aims
to raise money for the Church’s work in
inner city and other priority areas. By June
1993 it had raised over £24.5 million and
given grants to over 550 inner city projects.
Two further reports, Living Faith in the City
and Faith in the Countryside, were published
in 1990. Organisations belonging to other
churches and religious groups are also closely
involved with a wide range of social issues.
The Inner Cities Religious Council has
been meeting since 1992 under the
chairmanship of a government minister at the
Department of the Environment. Members
are drawn from the Christian, Hindu, Jewish,
Muslim and Sikh faiths. It aims to provide
faith communities with a new and effective
way of working together in the inner cities
and deprived urban areas in order to bring
about real and lasting change.
Statistics on Religious Affiliation
There is no standard information about the
number of members of religious groups since
questions are not normally asked about
religious beliefs in censuses or for other
official purposes, except in Northern Ireland.
Each group adopts its own way of counting
its members, and membership figures are
therefore approximate.
There has been a fall in recent years in
both the number of full-time ministers and
the number of adults recorded as members of
most of the larger Christian churches. At the
same time there has been significant growth
in a range of independent churches, and in
new religious movements. Surveys have also
revealed that many people who do not belong
to religious groups claim to be religious and
say they believe in God.
THE ESTABLISHED CHURCHES
The Church of England
The Church of England, founded by St
Augustine in AD 597, became the established
church of the land in the Reformation in the
16th century. Its form of worship was set out
in the Book of Common Prayer, dating from
1549. The Church of England’s relationship
with the State is one of mutual obligation—
the Church’s privileges are balanced by
certain duties it must fulfil. The Sovereign is
the ‘Supreme Governor’ of the Church of
England and must always be a member of the
Church, and promise to uphold it. Church of
England archbishops, bishops and deans are
appointed by the Sovereign on the advice of
the Prime Minister, although the Crown
Appointments Commission, which includes

Dunbar around 1890.

RELIGION
lay and clergy representatives, plays a decisive
part in the selection of archbishops and
diocesan bishops. All clergy swear their
allegiance to the Crown. The Church can
regulate its own worship. The two
archbishops (of Canterbury and York), the
bishops of London, Durham and Winchester,
and 21 other senior bishops sit in the House
of Lords. Clergy of the Church, together with
those of the Church of Scotland, the Church
of Ireland and the Roman Catholic Church,
may not sit in the House of Commons.
The Church has two provinces:
Canterbury, comprising 30 dioceses, including
the Diocese in Europe; and York, which has
14 dioceses. The dioceses are divided into
deaneries, which are in turn divided into
about 13,000 parishes. There are, altogether,
about 10,250 ordained stipendiary Church of
England clergymen, and about 700
stipendiary women deacons, working within
the diocesan structure, excluding Europe. It
was estimated that in 1990, in the two
provinces (excluding the Diocese in Europe),
some 229,000 people were baptised into the
Church; of these, 184,000 were under one
year old, representing nearly 29 per cent of
live births. In the same year there were
59,600 confirmations. Attendances at services
on a normal Sunday are around 1.1 million.
In 1990, 115,328 marriages were solemnised
in the Church of England and the Church in
Wales. These accounted for 66.2 per cent of
all marriages with religious ceremonies, and
34.8 per cent of all marriages in England and
Wales. Many people who rarely, if ever,
attend services still regard themselves as
belonging to the Church of England.
The central governing body is the General
Synod, which comprises separate houses of
bishops, clergy and lay members. Lay people
are also concerned with church government in
the parishes. The Synod is the centre of an
administrative system dealing with such
matters as missionary work, inter-church
relations, social questions, and recruitment
and training for the ministry. It also covers
other church work in Britain and overseas,
the care of church buildings and their
contents, church schools (which are
maintained largely from public funds),
colleges and institutes of higher education,
voluntary and parish education, and centres
for training women in pastoral work.
The Church’s investment income is
managed mainly by the Church
Commissioners. Most of the remainder of the
Church’s income is provided by local
voluntary donations.
The average annual stipend of a
Church of England clergyman is about
£12,800; the average value of
additional benefits, including free
accommodation and a non¬
contributory pension, is estimated to
be £7,100.
At present, only men may join the
priesthood of the Church of England, but in
November 1992 the General Synod voted to
approve legislation which would allow the
ordination of women to the priesthood. The
measure requires the approval of both Houses
of Parliament before receiving the Royal
Assent. It is expected that the first women
could be ordained to the priesthood in 1994.
The Deacons (Ordination of Women)
Measure 1986 made it possible for women to
become deacons.
The Church of Scotland
The Church of Scotland has a presbyterian
form of government, that is, government by
ministers and elders, all of whom are
ordained to office. It became the national
church following the Scottish Reformation
and legislation of the Scottish Parliament,
consolidated in the Treaty of Union 1707 and
the Church of Scotland Act 1921, the latter
confirming its complete freedom in all
spiritual matters. It appoints its own office
bearers, and its affairs are not subject to any
civil authority.
The adult communicant membership of
the Church of Scotland is about 790,000;
there are about 1,250 ministers. Both men
and women may join the ministry. About
1,500 churches are governed locally by Kirk
Sessions, consisting of ministers and elders.
Above the Kirk Session is the Presbytery,
then the Synod, and finally the General
Assembly, consisting of elected ministers and
425
BRITAIN 1994: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
elders. This meets annually under the
presidency of an elected moderator, who
serves for one year. The Sovereign is
normally represented at the General
Assembly by the Lord High Commissioner.
There are also a number of independent
Scottish Presbyterian churches, largely
descended from groups which broke away
from the Church of Scotland.
WALES
The Church in Wales became part of the
Anglican Church at the Reformation. The
Bible was translated into Welsh by Bishop
Morgan in 1588. During the 18th and 19th
centuries a powerful nonconformist (or Free
Church—see below) movement developed
throughout Wales: a census of religion in
1851 found that over 80 per cent of those at
worship attended a nonconformist chapel.
This strength was reflected in the
disestablishment of the Church in Wales in
1920. There are about 220,000 members of
the Free Churches in Wales, while the
Church in Wales has some 108,000 members.
The Church in Wales is responsible for the
care of the country’s medieval churches and
cathedrals.
THE ANGLICAN COMMUNION
The Anglican Communion comprises 31
autonomous Churches in Britain and abroad,
and three regional councils overseas with a
total membership of about 70 million. In the
British Isles there are four Anglican
Churches: the Church of England
(established), the Church in Wales, the
Scottish Episcopal Church, and the Church
of Ireland.
Every ten years the Lambeth Conference
meets for consultation between all Anglican
bishops. The last Conference was held in
Canterbury in 1988. Presided over by the
Archbishop of Canterbury, the Conference
has no executive authority, but enjoys
considerable influence. The Anglican
Consultative Council, an assembly of lay
people and clergy as well as of bishops, meets
every two or three years and is intended to
allow consultations within the Anglican
Communion. The Primates Meeting brings
together the senior bishops from each Church
at similar intervals.
THE FREE CHURCHES
The term ‘Free Churches’ is often used to
describe some of the Protestant churches in
Britain which, unlike the Church of England
and the Church of Scotland, are not
established churches. Free Churches have
existed in various forms since the
Reformation, developing their own traditions
over the years. Their members have also been
known as dissenters or nonconformists. All
the major Free Churches allow both men and
women to become ministers.
The Methodist Church, the largest of the
Free Churches, with over 430,000 adult full
members and a community of more than 1.3
million, originated in the 18th century
following the evangelical revival under John
Wesley (1703-91). The present church is
based on the 1932 union of most of the
separate Methodist Churches. It has 3,514
ministers and 7,207 places of worship.
The Baptists first achieved an organised
form in Britain in the 17th century. Today
they are mainly organised in groups of
churches, most of which belong to the
Baptist Union of Great Britain (re-formed in
1812), with about 165,000 members, 2,500
ministers and 2,300 places of worship. There
are also separate Baptist Unions for Scotland,
Wales and Ireland, and other independent
Baptist Churches.
The United Reformed Church, with some
117,000 members, 995 ministers and 1,808
places of worship, was formed in 1972
following the merger of the Congregational
Church in England and Wales (the oldest
Protestant minority in Britain, whose origins
can be traced back to the Puritans of the 16th
century) with the Presbyterian Church of
England, many of whose members are
descended from Scottish Presbyterians. This
was the first union of two different churches
in Britain since the Reformation in the 16th
century. In 1981 there was a further merger
with the Reformed Association of the
Churches of Christ.
The Salvation Army was founded in the
426
RELIGION
East End of London in 1865 by William
Booth (1829-1912). Within Britain there are
55,000 members, 1,800 active full-time
officers (who are ordained ministers) and
more than 900 centres of worship. The Army
is well known for its social work, which
ranges from 50 hostels for the homeless to
nearly 40 homes for the elderly, and for its
nationwide prison chaplaincy service.
The Salvation Army family tracing
service, which seeks to restore family
relationships, takes on 5,000 new cases
each year.
Among the other Free Churches are the
Presbyterian Church in Ireland, the
Presbyterian (or Calvinistic Methodist)
Church of Wales, the Union of Welsh
Independents and the Afro-Westindian
United Council of Churches.
THE ROMAN CATHOLIC CHURCH
The formal structure of the Roman Catholic
Church in England and Wales, which ceased
to exist after the Reformation in the 16th
century, was restored in 1850. The Scottish
Church’s formal structure went out of
existence in the early 17th century and was
restored in 1878. However, throughout this
period Catholicism never disappeared entirely.
There are now seven Roman Catholic
provinces in Great Britain, each under an
archbishop, and 29 dioceses, each under a
bishop (22 in England and Wales and seven
in Scotland, independently responsible to the
Pope). There are almost 3,300 parishes and
about 7,300 priests (only men may become
priests). Northern Ireland has six dioceses,
some with territory partly in the Irish
Republic. About one British citizen in ten
claims to be a Roman Catholic. The Pope is
represented diplomatically in Britain by an
Apostolic Pro-Nuncio.
The Roman Catholic Church attaches
great importance to the education of its
children and requires its members to try to
bring up their children in the Catholic faith.
Almost 5 per cent of the teachers in Britain’s
2,500 Catholic schools are members of
religious orders. These orders also undertake
other social work; about 250 Roman Catholic
religious orders, congregations and societies
are represented in Britain, as are congregations
representing about 25 different nationalities
who live in Britain. Most Catholic schools are
maintained out of public funds.
OTHER CHRISTIAN CHURCHES
Other Protestant Churches include the
Unitarians and Free Christians, whose origins
are traceable to the Reformation, and the
Pentecostalists, whose movement began in the
early 20th century. The two main
Pentecostalist organisations operating in
Britain are the Assemblies of God and the
Elim Pentecostal Church, many of whose
members are of West Indian origin.
The Religious Society of Friends
(Quakers), with about 18,000 adult members
in Britain and 450 places of worship, was
founded in the middle of the 17th century
under the leadership of George Fox
(1624—91). Silent worship is central to its life
as a religious organisation.
The Christian Brethren is a Protestant
body organised in its present form by J. N.
Darby (1800-82). There are two branches: the
Open Brethren (with an estimated 43,500
members) and the Closed or Exclusive
Brethren (with an estimated 7,600 members).
A recent development in Christian worship
has been the ‘house church movement’ (or
‘new churches’), which began in the early
1970s and now has an estimated membership
of almost 110,000. Services were originally
held in private houses but now groups use a
variety of hired buildings. These non-
denominational congregations may come
together as ‘streams’, of which some of the
better known are New Frontiers, Pioneer
and Ichthus.
Many Christian communities of foreign
origin, including the Orthodox, Lutheran and
Reformed Churches of various European
countries, and the Coptic Orthodox Church
and the Armenian Church, have established
their own centres of worship, particularly in
London. All these churches operate in a
variety of languages.
There are also several other religious
organisations in Britain which were founded in
427
BRITAIN 1994: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
the United States in the last century. These
include the Jehovah’s Witnesses, the Church
of Jesus Christ of the Latter-Day Saints (the
Mormon Church), the Christian Scientists
and the Spiritualists.
OTHER RELIGIONS
The Jewish Community
Jews first settled in England at the time of
the Norman Conquest and remained until
banished by royal decree in 1290. The
present community in Britain dates from
1656, having been founded by those of
Spanish and Portuguese origin, known as
Sephardim. Later more settlers came from
Germany and Eastern Europe; they are
known as Ashkenazim.
The present Jewish community in Britain,
numbering about 300,000, is the second
largest in Europe.
The Jewish community is divided into two
main groups. Some 77 per cent of the majority
Ashkenazi Jews are Orthodox and most
acknowledge the authority of the Chief Rabbi.
The Sephardi Orthodox element follow their
own spiritual head. The recently established
Masorti movement, the Reform movement,
founded in 1840, and the Liberal and
Progressive movement, established in 1901,
account for most of the remaining 23 per cent.
Jewish congregations in Britain number
about 350. About one in three Jewish children
attend Jewish schools, some of which are
supported by public funds. Several agencies
care for elderly and handicapped people.
The officially recognised representative
body is the Board of Deputies of British
Jews, which was established in 1760.
The Muslim Community
The most recent estimates suggest that
Britain’s Muslim population is around
1 million. The largest number originate from
Pakistan and Bangladesh, while sizeable groups
have come from India, Cyprus, the Arab
world, Malaysia and parts of Africa. A growing
community of British-born Muslims, mainly
the children of immigrant parents, includes an
increasing number of converts to Islam.
There are some 450 mosques and
numerous Muslim prayer centres
throughout Britain. Mosques are not only
places of worship; they also offer instruction
in the Muslim way of life and facilities for
educational and welfare activities.
The first mosque in Britain was
established at Woking, Surrey, in 1890.
Mosques now range from converted houses
in many towns to the Central Mosque in
London and its associated Islamic Cultural
Centre, one of the most important Muslim
institutions in the Western world. The
Central Mosque has the largest congregation
in Britain, and during festivals it may
number over 5,000. There are also
important mosques and cultural centres in
Liverpool, Manchester, Leicester, Bradford,
Edinburgh and Glasgow.
Many of the mosques belong to various
Muslim organisations, and both the Sunni
and the Shia traditions within Islam are
represented among the Muslim community
in Britain. Members of some of the major
Sufi traditions have also developed branches
in British cities.
The Sikh Community
A large British Sikh community, comprising
over 300,000, originates mainly from India.
The largest groups of Sikhs are in Greater
London, Manchester, Birmingham,
Nottingham and Wolverhampton. Sikh
temples or gurdwaras cater for the religious,
educational, social welfare and cultural
needs of their community. The oldest
gurdwara in London was established in
1908 and the largest is in Southall,
Middlesex. There are over 140 gurdwaras
in Britain.
The Hindu Community
The Hindu community in Britain comprises
around 320,000 members and also originates
largely from India. The largest groups of
Hindus are to be found in Leicester,
different areas of London, Birmingham and
Bradford. The first Hindu temple or
mandir was opened in London in 1962 and
there are now over 150 mandirs in Britain.
428
RELIGION
Buddhism
The Buddhist community in Britain consists
largely of adherents of British or Western
origin. There are about 150 Buddhist groups
in Britain and some 50 centres, with at least
20 monasteries and a number of temples. All
the main schools of Buddhism are
represented. The Buddhist Society promotes
the principles of Buddhism; it does not
belong to any particular school of Buddhism.
Other Religious Communities
Other religious communities include about
30,000 Jains, whose religion is of ancient
Indian origin. A deresar, or Jain temple,
opened in Leicester in 1988. The Zoroastrian
religion, or Mazdaism, originated in ancient
Iran. It is mainly represented in Britain by
the Parsi community, who are by origin from
the South Asian sub-continent. The Baha’i
movement, which originated in 19th-century
Iran, regards all the major religions as divine
in origin; there are an estimated 5,000 Baha’is
in Britain.
New Religious Movements
A large number of new religious movements
or cults, mainly established since the Second
World War and often with overseas origins,
are active in Britain. Examples include the
Church of Scientology, the Transcendental
Meditation movement and the Unification
Church (popularly known as the ‘Moonies’).
In response to public concern about the
activities of some of these cults the
Government provided funding in 1987 for the
Information Network Focus on Religious
Movements, which is a group supported by the
main churches. It seeks to provide objective
information about new religious movements.
CO-OPERATION BETWEEN FAITHS
A number of organisations exist which seek to
develop relations between different religions
Further Reading
Religion. Aspects of Britain series, HMSO, 1992.
in Britain. They include the Inter-Faith
Network for the United Kingdom, which
links a wide range of organisations with an
interest in inter-faith relations, including
representative bodies from the Baha’i,
Buddhist, Christian, Hindu, Jain, Jewish,
Muslim and Sikh faith communities. Other
organisations include the Council of
Christians and Jews, which works for better
understanding among members of the two
religions and deals with issues in the
educational and social fields. Religious leaders
belonging to different faiths hate also
officiated jointly at a number of important
public occasions. Christians, Muslims, Sikhs,
Hindus, Jews and Buddhists, for example,
have taken part together in the annual
religious observance to mark Commonwealth
Day, which has been attended by the Queen.
Co-operation among the Churches
The Council of Churches for Britain and
Ireland was established in 1990, replacing the
former British Council of Churches and
taking over its role as the main overall body
for the Christian churches in Britain. The
Council co-ordinates the work of its 30
member churches, which are also grouped in
separate ecumenical bodies for England,
Scotland, Wales and Ireland.
The Free Church Federal Council
includes most of the Free Churches of
England and Wales. It promotes co-operation
among the Free Churches and is a channel
for communication with government. Inter¬
church discussions about the search for unity
now take place through international as well
as national bodies. The Roman Catholic,
Orthodox and Lutheran Churches are
represented on some of these, as are the
Anglican and some of the Free Churches.
The Anglican Churches, the Church of
Scotland and the main Free Churches are
also members of the World Council of
Churches. This organisation links some 310
churches in over 100 countries around the
world.

Literature and Libraries 446
Artistic and cultural activity in Britain ranges from the highest professional
standards to a wide variety of amateur performances and events. The arts
also represent a major sector of economic activity. They contribute an
estimated £6,000 million a year to Britain’s balance of payments.
INTRODUCTION
Britain’s artistic and cultural heritage is one
of the richest in the world. The origins of
English literature can be traced back to
medieval times, while over the centuries
Britain has amassed some of the finest
collections of works of art of all kinds. The
performing arts also have a long and
distinguished history.
London is one of the leading world
centres for the arts. Other large cities,
including Birmingham, Sheffield,
Manchester, Edinburgh, Glasgow and
Cardiff, have also sustained and developed
their reputations as centres of artistic
excellence in recent years. Arts festivals
attract wide interest. Many British artists of
all kinds enjoy international reputations.
Television and radio bring a wide range of
arts events to a large audience. Arts activities
introduced and developed by the ethnic
minorities are also thriving. At an amateur
level, numerous groups and societies for the
arts make use of local talent and resources.
Department of National Heritage
The Secretary of State for National Heritage,
who is a member of the Cabinet, is
responsible for general arts policy. The office
was created in 1992 and its holder heads the
Department of National Heritage (see p. 499),
which replaced the Office of Arts and
Libraries as well as taking on a range of
responsibilities from other departments. The
Department determines government policy
and administers government expenditure on
national museums and art galleries in
England, the Arts Council of Great Britain,
the British Library and other national arts and
heritage bodies. This includes responsibilities
for listing and scheduling buildings and for
royal parks and palaces (which includes the
work of the Department’s executive agency,
Historic Royal Palaces). Other responsibilities
include the regulation of the film industry,
broadcasting, press regulation, the national
lottery and the export licensing of antiques.
The Secretaries of State for Wales, Scotland
and Northern Ireland are responsible for the
national museums, galleries and libraries in
their countries, and for other cultural matters.
Government Policies
The Government’s arts policies aim to:
• develop a high standard of artistic and
cultural activity throughout Britain;
• encourage innovation; and
• promote public access to, and
appreciation of, the arts, crafts and the
cultural heritage.
430
THE ARTS
The Department of National Heritage
provides funds and advice, and encourages
partnership with the private sector, including
business sponsorship. National museums and
galleries are given an incentive to increase
their resources, for example, through trading
and other activities. An important concept in
funding policy is the ‘arm’s length’ principle,
by which government funds are distributed
to arts organisations indirectly, through
bodies such as the Arts Council of Great
Britain and the British Film Institute. This
principle helps to avoid undue political
influence over funding decisions by ensuring
that funds are allocated by those best
qualified to do so.
Local Authorities
Local authorities maintain more than 1,000
local museums and art galleries and a
network of some 4,000 public libraries. They
also support many arts buildings, arts
organisations and artistic events in their
areas, providing grant aid for professional
and voluntary organisations, including
orchestras and theatre, opera and dance
companies, although there is no statutory
obligation for them to do so. They undertake
direct promotions and contribute to the cost
of new or converted buildings for the arts. In
England this support is estimated to be
about £200 million a year. Arts education in
schools, colleges, evening institutes and
community centres is the responsibility of
central government education departments,
in partnership with local education
authorities and voluntary bodies.
Finance
Planned central government expenditure
through the Department of National
Heritage, excluding sport, amounts to £926
million in 1993-94, of which £226 million is
channelled through the Arts Council to
support the performing and visual arts
throughout England, Scotland and Wales;
over £72 million goes to the British Library.
Grants are also made to the British Film
Institute, the Crafts Council, certain other
museums and arts bodies, and to the
National Heritage Memorial Fund. The
Fund helps organisations wishing to acquire,
for the public benefit, land, buildings, works
of art and other objects associated with the
national heritage. In Scotland The Scottish
Office provides £28 million to the National
Galleries and Museums and £21 million to
the National Library.
Business Sponsorship
Industrial and commercial concerns offer
vital sponsorship to a wide range of arts.
The Business Sponsorship Incentive Scheme
was introduced in Great Britain in 1984 in
co-operation with the Association for
Business Sponsorship of the Arts (ABSA),
with the aim of raising the overall level of
business sponsorship. (A similar scheme was
set up in Northern Ireland in 1987.) Since
its inception the scheme has brought over
£60 million into the arts (including a
government contribution of over £19
million) and has attracted over 2,780 first¬
time sponsors. An estimated 80 per cent of
the awards have been made to arts
organisations outside London. In 1993-94
the Government is making available £4.5
million to match new sponsorships.
Further support is encouraged by tax
concessions which allow companies and
individuals to obtain tax relief on donations
to arts charities. For example, under the
Gift Aid scheme, announced in 1990, single
gifts of £250 and over in any one year
qualify for tax relief.
Foundation for Sport and the Arts
The Foundation for Sport and the Arts was
set up in 1991 by the Pool Promoters
Association, with grants expected to total
£60 million a year. About two-thirds of the
revenue is used to benefit sport and the
remainder to benefit the arts.
National Lottery
The new National Lottery (see p. 482) is
expected to generate substantial funds for
the arts, heritage, sports, charities and for a
millennium fund to celebrate the year 2000.

BRITAIN 1994: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Arts Councils
The independent Arts Council of Great
Britain, established in 1946 by Royal Charter,
is the main channel for government aid to the
performing arts. Its chief aims are to:
• develop and improve the knowledge,
understanding and practice of the
performing and visual arts;
• increase their accessibility to the public;
and
• advise and co-operate with government
departments, local authorities and other
organisations.
The Council gives financial help and advice
to organisations ranging from the major opera,
dance and drama companies; orchestras and
festivals; to small touring theatres and
experimental groups.
The Council also provides funds for the
training of arts administrators and helps arts
organisations to develop other sources of
income, including box-office, trading profits,
sponsorship and local authority support. It
encourages contemporary dance, mime, jazz,
literature, photography and art films, and helps
professional creative writers, choreographers,
composers, artists and photographers. The
Council also promotes art exhibitions and tours
and makes funds available for some specialist
training courses in the arts. Emphasis is being
placed on obtaining funds through partnership
arrangements with local authorities and other
agencies, and from commercial sources. As an
extension of its responsibilities for funding the
arts and arts organisations, the Arts Council
promotes the arts through broadcasting, film
and video (see p. 441).
Organisations in Scotland and Wales receive
their subsidies through the Scottish and Welsh
Arts Councils, which are committees of the
Arts Council of Great Britain. The
Government has announced plans for
responsibility for the Scottish and Welsh Arts
Councils to be transferred from the
Department of National Heritage to the
Scottish and Welsh Offices respectively from
April 1994. Northern Ireland has an
independent Arts Council with aims and
functions similar to those of the Arts Council
of Great Britain.
A review of the structure, organisation and
staffing of the Arts Council was published in
June 1993 (see p. 433). Following this, the
Government has reaffirmed its commitment
to the ‘arm’s length’ principle for arts
funding but will be exploring ways in which
the Council’s accountability can be improved.
It has also stated that the different roles of
the Government and the Arts Council should
not obscure the fact that there are objectives
which they share, for example, encouraging
the widest possible access to the arts.
Developments in Arts Funding
In 1991 ten Regional Arts Boards were
created to replace the 12 Regional Arts
Associations in England. They are financed
mainly by the Arts Council, with smaller
sums from the British Film Institute and
Crafts Council. Through forward planning
and budgeting, the Boards are subject to a
more clearly focused system of financial
accountability to their national funders. One-
third of the members of each Board are
nominated by local authorities. Boards also
include representatives of the regional
business community as well as others with
expertise and interest in the arts. The Boards
offer financial assistance to artists and arts
organisations and advise on, and sometimes
help to promote, arts activities.
In 1992 the Arts Council delegated
responsibility for funding 22 of its clients to
the new Boards. In April 1994, a further 42
clients will be delegated. However, the Arts
Council will retain funding responsibility for
the four national companies—the Royal
Opera House, the English National Opera,
the Royal Shakespeare Company and the
Royal National Theatre—as well as for the
South Bank Centre. It will also remain
responsible for publishing, touring
companies without a regional base and all
other arts organisations best assessed on a
national level.
The National Arts and Media Strategy
To make the best use of the restructured
system, the Government asked the Arts
Council, with assistance from the British
432
THE ARTS
Film Industry and the Crafts Council, to
develop a medium-term strategy for the arts
and associated activities. After a wide
consultation process, the final strategy,
entitled A Creative Future, was published in
January 1993. This suggests new emphases in
arts funding and outlines new priorities and
activities. The Arts Council will be
responsible for overseeing the strategy’s
implementation within the limits of the funds
available. Similar strategies have been
published in Scotland and Wales.
The Arts and Minority Communities
The arts activities undertaken by Britain’s
diverse communities embrace both traditional
and new forms of artistic expression. In
seeking to reflect and encourage this the Arts
Council has, over the last five years, devoted
particular attention to black and Asian dance
and drama. In 1990 ADiTi, a development
organisation for South Asian dance, was
launched in Bradford. The Council has
expanded its training to include arts
administration and technical skills. The
Commonwealth Institute arranges a varied
programme of artistic events, and the
Minorities Arts Advisory Service is an
independent organisation which provides
information on, and training in, the arts of
these communities.
Arts and People with Disabilities
In A Creative Future (see above), the Arts
Council expressed concern that the buildings
where arts activities take place often fail to
meet the needs of people with various types
of disability, despite sensitive planning of
new buildings and a considerable amount of
work undertaken by local authorities and arts
venues.
ADAPT, a voluntary organisation set up
in 1989, contributes towards the cost of
making new facilities accessible to disabled
people. Its funds are raised from government
and private sector sponsorship, administered
by the Carnegie Trust, which has made the
biggest contribution to the organisation.
ADAPT has so far raised over £1 million.
In 1991 the Arts Council launched an Arts
and Disability Directory, which provides
information on all aspects of arts and
disability. In March 1993 it published the
Report on the Initiative to Increase the
Employment of Disabled People in the Arts,
which outlines an action plan.
Arts Centres
More than 200 arts centres in Britain provide
opportunities for enjoying and taking part in
a range of activities, with educational projects
becoming increasingly important. Nearly all
arts centres are professionally managed and
most are supported by volunteer groups.
Most arts centres are converted buildings,
including former churches, warehouses,
schools, town halls and private houses. The
centres are assisted mainly by Regional Arts
Boards and local authorities, while the Arts
Council funds two large centres in London—
the South Bank Centre and the Institute of
Contemporary Arts. Many theatres and art
galleries also provide a focal point for the
community by making available facilities for
other arts.
British Council
The British Council (see p. 290) promotes a
knowledge of British culture overseas and
maintains libraries (including film libraries) in
many of the 100 countries in which it is
represented. The Council initiates or
supports overseas tours by British theatre
companies, orchestras, choirs, opera and
dance companies, and jazz, rock and folk
groups, as well as by individual actors,
musicians and artists. It also arranges for
directors, designers, choreographers and
conductors to work with overseas companies,
orchestras and choirs. The Council organises
and supports fine arts and other exhibitions
overseas as well as British participation in
international exhibitions and film festivals,
and encourages professional interchange
between Britain and other countries.
Visiting Arts Office
The Visiting Arts Office, an autonomous
body administered by the British Council,
433
BRITAIN 1994: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
promotes foreign arts in Britain. It provides a
clearing house for British and overseas arts
organisations, advises on touring matters and
makes awards for projects.
Broadcasting
Both BBC radio and television and the
independent companies (see Chapter 30)
broadcast a wide variety of drama (including
adaptations of novels and stage plays), opera,
ballet, and music; and general arts magazine
programmes and documentaries. These have
won many international awards at festivals
such as the Prix Italia and Montreux
International Television Festivals.
Independent television companies also make
grants for arts promotion in their regions.
Broadcasting is thus a major medium for
making the arts available to the general
public and is a crucial source of work for
actors, musicians, writers, composers,
technicians and others in the arts world. It
has created its own forms—nothing like arts
documentaries or drama series, for instance,
exists in any other medium. Broadcasters
commission and produce a vast quantity of
new work. Television and radio provide
critical debate, information and education
about the arts.
The BBC also has six orchestras, which
employ many of Britain’s full-time
professional musicians. Each week it
broadcasts about 100 hours of classical and
other music (both live and recorded) on its
Radio 3 FM channel. BBC Radio 1
broadcasts rock and pop music 24 hours a
day and a large part of the output of BBC
Radio 2 is popular and light music. There
are at present two national commercial radio
stations: Classic FM, which broadcasts
mainly popular classical music; and Virgin,
which plays broad-based rock music. Much
of the output of Britain’s local radio stations
consists of popular and light music.
The BBC regularly commissions new
music, particularly by British composers, and
sponsors concerts, competitions and festivals.
Each summer it presents and broadcasts the
BBC Promenade Concerts (the ‘Proms’), the
world’s largest music festival, at the Royal
Albert Hall.
The Press
Many national and local newspapers devote
considerable space to coverage of the arts,
and developments in the arts are also covered
in the ethnic minority press and in
periodicals such as the Spectator and New
Statesman and Society (see Chapter 30).
Weekly ‘listings’ magazines, including Time
Out, provide details of cultural and other
events in London and other large cities.
There are also a large number of specialist
publications which cover specific aspects of
the arts, including the Times Literary
Supplement, Film Monthly, Antique and
Opera Now. A number of publications
publish original literature, including the
London Magazine, and Granta, which
publishes fiction as well as cultural
journalism. New Musical Express (NME) and
Melody Maker cover rock and pop music.
The newspaper Stage and Television Today is
directed at professional actors and others in
the industry.
Festivals
Some 650 professional arts festivals take place
in Britain each year. The Edinburgh
International Festival, featuring a wide range
of arts, is the largest of its kind in the world.
Other annual festivals held in the Scottish
capital include International Folk and Jazz
Festivals and the Film and Television
Festival. The Mayfest, the second largest
festival in Britain, takes place in Glasgow.
Some well-known festivals concentrating on
music are the Three Choirs Festival, which
has taken place annually for 260 years in
Gloucester, Worcester or Hereford; the
Cheltenham Festival, largely devoted to
contemporary British music; and the
Aldeburgh festival. Among others catering for
a number of art forms are the Royal National
Eisteddfod of Wales, the National Gaelic
Mod in Scotland, and the festivals in Belfast,
Brighton, Buxton, Chichester, Harrogate,
Malvern, Pitlochry, Salisbury, and York.
Many much smaller towns also hold arts
festivals. Other events include the Netting
Hill Carnival in London, in which the Afro-
Caribbean community plays a prominent part.
434
THE ARTS
Arts 2000
Arts 2000 is an Arts Council initiative which
celebrates the approach of the millennium.
During each year between 1992 and 2000, a
city, town or region in Britain will be
nominated to celebrate a particular art form,
concluding with the Year of the Artist in
2000. The East Midlands was the Region of
Dance in 1993, Manchester is the City of
Drama in 1994, and Swansea the City of
Literature in 1995. The years 1997-99 have
been nominated, respectively, as the year of
opera and musical theatre; the year of
photography and the electronic image; and
the year of architecture and design.
Arts 2000 is a competitive process judged
by an expert Arts Council panel. Winners are
offered ^250,000 from Arts Council funds,
and are expected to make substantial
contributions of their own to create a wide-
ranging and imaginative programme with a
strong European context.
DRAMA
Professional Theatre
Britain is one of the world’s major centres for
theatre, and has a long and rich dramatic
tradition. There are many companies based in
London and other cities and towns, as well as
numerous touring companies which visit
theatres, festivals and other venues, including
arts and sports centres and social clubs.
There are 66 companies in receipt of
subsidies from the Arts Council.
Contemporary British playwrights
who have received international
recognition include:
• Harold Pinter—The Caretaker, The
Homecoming',
• Tom Stoppard—Rosencrantz and
Guildenstern are Dead, Jumpers',
• Caryl Churchill—Serious Money,
Top Girls', and
• Peter Shaffer—Equus, Amadeus.
The musicals of Sir Andrew Lloyd
Webber have been highly successful both in
Britain and overseas; well known examples
include Jesus Christ Superstar, Evita and Cats.
Among the best-known directors are Sir
Peter Hall, Trevor Nunn, Adrian Noble,
Jonathan Miller, Terry Hands and Deborah
Warner, while the many British performers
who enjoy international reputations include
Sir John Gielgud, Sir Alec Guinness, Vanessa
Redgrave, Sir Ian McKellen, Derek Jacobi,
Albert Finney, Dame Judi Dench, Jonathan
Pryce, Brian Cox, Juliet Stevenson and Dame
Maggie Smith. British stage designers such as
John Bury, Ralph Koltai and Carl Toms are
internationally recognised.
Britain has about 300 theatres intended for
professional use which can seat between 200
and 2,300 people. Some are privately owned,
but most are owned either municipally or by
non-profit-distributing organisations. Over 40
of these house resident theatre companies
receiving subsidies from the Arts Council and
Regional Arts Boards. In summer there are
also open air theatres, including one in
London’s Regent’s Park and the Minack
Theatre, which is on an open cliffside near
Land’s End in Cornwall.
London has about 100 theatres, 15 of
them permanently occupied by subsidised
companies. These include:
• the Royal National Theatre, which stages
a wide range of modern and classical
plays in its three auditoriums on the
South Bank;
• the Royal Shakespeare Company, which
presents plays mainly by Shakespeare and
his contemporaries, as well as some
modern work, both in Stratford-upon-
Avon and in its two auditoriums in the
City’s Barbican Centre; and
• the English Stage Company at the Royal
Court Theatre in Sloane Square,
London, which stages the work of many
talented new playwrights.
The largest concentration of London’s
commercial theatres is around Shaftesbury
Avenue. West End theatre attendances
reached almost 11 million in 1992.
Most theatres are commercially run and
self-financing, relying on popular shows and
musicals to be profitable. By contrast,
435
BRITAIN 1994: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
companies funded by the Arts Council tend
to offer a variety of traditional and
experimental or innovative productions.
Experimental or innovative work is often
staged in ‘fringe’ theatres in London and
other cities; these are smaller theatres
which use a variety of buildings, such as
rooms in pubs.
The Theatres Restoration Fund is
providing £4 million in 1992-94 for
renovating and repairing theatres. It focuses
on backstage projects for which no other
funds are likely to be available. The Fund is
financed jointly by the Government and
the Wolfson Foundation and Family
Charitable Trust.
In 1989 the partial remains of the Globe
Theatre, where Shakespeare acted, and the
Rose Theatre, where his plays were
performed during his lifetime, were excavated
on the south bank of the Thames; both have
since been listed as ancient monuments. A
modern reconstruction of the Globe Theatre,
near its original site, is in progress.
Regional Theatres
Outside London most cities and many large
towns have at least one theatre. Older
theatres which have been restored include the
Theatre Royal, Newcastle upon Tyne, which
dates from the 18th century, and the
Alhambra, Bradford, the Lyceum, Sheffield,
and the Haymarket Theatre, Basingstoke, all
dating from the 19th century. Others, such as
the West Yorkshire Playhouse, Leeds, and
the Theatre Royal, Plymouth, have been built
to the latest designs. Major rebuilding
schemes in progress include the restoration of
Edinburgh’s old Empire Theatre (to be
renamed the Edinburgh Festival Theatre),
with j£1.7 million of public funds, to provide
an international venue for large-scale
productions. Several universities have theatres
which house professional companies playing
to the general public.
Most regional repertory companies mount
about eight to ten productions a year; several
have studio theatres in addition to the main
auditorium, where they present new or
experimental drama and plays of specialist
interest. Repertory theatres also often
function as social centres by offering
concerts, poetry readings and exhibitions, and
by providing restaurants, bars and shops.
Regional theatre companies with major
reputations include the Citizens’ Theatre,
Glasgow; the Royal Exchange, Manchester;
Bristol Old Vic; the Liverpool Playhouse (the
oldest surviving repertory theatre in Britain);
and Nottingham Playhouse, one of the first
modern regional theatres. Successful
productions from regional theatre companies
often transfer to London’s West End, while
the largest regional theatres receive visits
from the Royal National Theatre or the Royal
Shakespeare Company. The English
Shakespeare Company tours the English
regions and worldwide.
Theatre for Young People
Unicorn Theatre for Children and Polka
Children’s Theatre, both in London, present
plays specially written for children; and the
Whirligig Theatre tours throughout Britain.
The Young Vic Company in London and
Contact Theatre Company in Manchester
stage plays for young people. Numerous
Theatre-in-Education companies perform in
schools. Some of these companies operate
independently—Theatre Centre, for example,
plays in London and tours further afield.
Others are attached to regional repertory
theatres such as the Belgrade in Coventry and
the West Yorkshire Playhouse in Leeds. Most
regional repertory theatres also mount
productions for younger audiences, and
concessionary ticket prices are generally
available for those at school, college or
university. There are also a number of
puppet companies.
There has been a marked growth in youth
theatres, which number more than 500 in
England alone; both the National Youth
Theatre in London and the Scottish Youth
Theatre in Glasgow offer early acting
opportunities to young people.
Dramatic Training
Training for actors, directors, lighting and
sound technicians and stage managers is
provided mainly in drama schools, among
436
THE ARTS
them the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art
(RADA), the Central School of Speech and
Drama, the London Academy of Music and
Dramatic Art, and the Drama Centre (all in
London); the Bristol Old Vic School, the
Royal Scottish Academy of Music and Drama
(Glasgow) and the Welsh College of Music
and Drama (Cardiff). Theatre design courses,
often based in art schools, are available for
people wanting to train as stage designers. A
number of universities and colleges offer
degree courses in drama.
Amateur Theatre
There are several thousand amateur dramatic
societies throughout Britain. They use a
variety of buildings, including schools and
public halls. Their work is encouraged by a
number of organisations, such as the Central
Council for Amateur Theatre, the National
Drama Conference, the Scottish Community
Drama Association and the Association of
Ulster Drama Festivals. A nationwide
umbrella body, the Voluntary Arts Network,
has recently been established. Amateur
companies sometimes receive financial
support from local government, Regional Arts
Boards and other bodies.
MUSIC
People in Britain are interested in a wide
range of music, from classical to different
forms of rock and pop music. Jazz, folk,
world and light music, and brass bands also
have substantial followings.
The first National Music Day was held in
June 1992. Over 1,500 separate events were
organised, ranging from large open-air
concerts in Birmingham, Bath and London to
many small events given by church choirs,
school bands and folk groups. This is
intended to become an annual event; a second
National Music Day was held on 26-27 Tune
1993.
Orchestral and Choral Music
Seasons of orchestral and choral concerts are
promoted every year in many large towns and
cities. The principal concert halls in central
London are the Royal Festival Hall in the
South Bank Centre, next to which are the
Queen Elizabeth Hall and the Purcell Room,
which accommodate smaller-scale
performances; the Barbican Hall (part of the
Barbican Centre for Arts and Conferences in
the City of London); the Royal Albert Hall in
Kensington; the recently-refurbished
Wigmore Hall, a recital centre; and St John’s,
Smith Square. A major new concert hall, the
Symphony Hall, opened in Birmingham in
1991, and a new 2,400-seat international
concert hall is to be built for Manchester’s
Halle Orchestra; the Government is to
contribute £22 million, about half the
expected cost.
The leading symphony orchestras are the
London Philharmonic, the London
Symphony, the Philharmonia, the Royal
Philharmonic, the BBC Symphony, the Royal
Liverpool Philharmonic, the Halle
(Manchester), the City of Birmingham
Symphony, the Bournemouth Symphony, the
Ulster and the Royal Scottish Orchestras and
the BBC Welsh Symphony Orchestra. The
BBC’s six orchestras provide broadcast
concerts which are often open to the public.
There are also chamber orchestras such as
the English Chamber Orchestra, the Academy
of St Martin-in-the-Fields, the Bournemouth
Sinfonietta, City of London Sinfonia, and the
Scottish Chamber Orchestra. Specialised
ensembles include the Orchestra of the Age
of Enlightenment, the English Baroque
Soloists and the English Concert. The
London Sinfonietta and the Birmingham
Contemporary Music Group specialise in
contemporary music.
British conductors such as Sir Colin
Davis, Sir Neville Marriner, Simon Rattle,
Andrew Davis, Jane Glover, Sian Edwards
and Jeffrey Tate reach a wide audience
through their recordings as well as by their
performances. The works of living composers
such as Sir Michael Tippett, Sir Peter
Maxwell Davies and Sir Harrison Birtwistle
enjoy international acclaim. Other well-
established composers include George
Benjamin, John Tavener, Oliver Knussen,
Colin Matthews, Nigel Osborne, Robert
Saxton, Mark-Antony Turnage and Judith
Weir. The Master of the Queen’s Music,
437
BRITAIN 1994: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Malcolm Williamson, holds an office within
the Royal Household with responsibility for
organising and writing music for state
occasions.
The principal choral societies include the
Bach Choir, the Royal Choral Society, the
Huddersfield Choral Society, the Cardiff
Polyphonic Choir, the Edinburgh
International Festival Chorus and the Belfast
Philharmonic Society. Almost all the leading
orchestras maintain their own choral societies.
The English tradition of church singing is
represented by choirs such as those of King’s
College Chapel, Cambridge, and Christ
Church Cathedral, Oxford, while other choirs
such as the Roman Catholic Westminster
Cathedral choir are also well known. There
are many male-voice choirs in Wales and in
certain parts of England.
Pop and Rock Music
Hundreds of hours of pop and rock music are
broadcast through BBC and independent
radio stations every week, while pop and rock
magazine programmes and occasional live or
recorded concerts on television further
promote pop and rock, which is by far the
most popular form of musical expression in
Britain.
In the 1960s and 1970s groups such as the
Beatles, the Rolling Stones, Led Zeppelin and
Pink Floyd achieved international success.
British groups continue to be popular
throughout the world and are often at the
forefront of new developments in music.
Some of the more recent groups, with
examples of their recordings, include the
Cure (PVish), Def Leppard (Adrenalize), the
Pet Shop Boys (Discography), Right Said Fred
(Up), Simply Red (Stars) and Wet Wet Wet
(High on the Happy Side).
Well-known performers, with examples of
recent recordings, include Phil Collins
(Serious Hits Live!), Peter Gabriel (Us), Elton
John (The One), Annie Lennox (Diva), Mike
Oldfield (Tubular Bells II), Sting (The Soul
Cages) and Lisa Stansfield (Real Love).
In recent years young black artists,
including Seal, and Roland Gift of the group
Fine Young Cannibals, have furthered the
development of popular music.
The pop and rock music industry
continues to contribute significantly to
Britain’s overseas earnings through the sale of
recordings, concert tours, and promotional
material including clothing and books. The
recording industry in Britain has an estimated
annual turnover of £1,000 million.
Jazz
Jazz has a large following in Britain and is
played in numerous clubs and pubs. British
musicians such as Barbara Thompson, Stan
Tracey, Andy Sheppard and Courtney Pine
have established strong reputations
throughout Europe. Festivals of jazz music
are held annually in Soho (London),
Glasgow, Crawley (West Sussex) and at a
number of other places. Jazz Services
provides a national touring network.
Jazz FM, Britain’s first radio station
dedicated to jazz, was launched in the
London area in 1990.
Training
Professional training in music is given mainly
at colleges of music. The leading London
colleges are the Royal Academy of Music, the
Royal College of Music, the Guildhall School
of Music and Drama, and Trinity College of
Music. The City University’s music industry
course provides training in business practice
aimed specifically at musicians and music
administrators. Outside London the main
centres are the Royal Scottish Academy of
Music and Drama in Glasgow, the Royal
Northern College of Music in Manchester,
the Welsh College of Music and Drama,
Cardiff, and the Birmingham Conservatoire.
Other Educational Schemes
Many children learn to play musical
instruments at school, and some take the
examinations of the Associated Board of the
Royal Schools of Music. Music is one of the
foundation subjects in the National
Curriculum (see p. 408). The National Youth
Orchestras of Great Britain, of Scotland and
of Wales and other youth orchestras have
established high standards. Nearly a third of
438
THE ARTS
the players in the European Community
Youth Orchestra come from Britain. There is
also a National Youth Jazz Orchestra.
OPERA AND DANCE
Interest in opera has increased greatly in the
last ten years, while an estimated 6 million
people take part in dance, making it one of
Britain’s leading participatory activities, and
audiences are attracted to a widening range of
professional dance.
Regular seasons of opera and ballet are
held at the Royal Opera House, Covent
Garden, London. The Royal Opera, Royal
Ballet and the Birmingham Royal Ballet,
which rank among the world’s leading
companies, are supported by professional
orchestras, as are English National Ballet and
Northern Ballet Theatre. Seasons of opera in
English are given by the English National
Opera at the London Coliseum. Scottish
Opera has regular seasons at the Theatre
Royal in Glasgow, and tours mainly in
Scotland and northern England. Welsh
National Opera presents seasons in Cardiff
and other cities. Opera North, based in
Leeds, tours primarily in the north of
England and Opera Factory stages
experimental work in opera and music
theatre. English Touring Opera takes opera to
towns throughout England. Opera Northern
Ireland presents seasons at the Opera House,
Belfast, and tours in Northern Ireland.
An opera season for which international
casts are specially assembled is held every
summer at Glyndebourne in East Sussex.
1 his is followed by an autumn tour by
Glyndebourne Touring Opera, often using
casts drawn from the chorus of the festival
season. Work on a new opera house to be
built on the same site at Glyndebourne,
costing £33 million, is due to be completed in
May 1994. All the funding will come from
private sources.
Subsidised Dance Companies
Subsidised dance companies include the
Birmingham (formerly Sadler’s Wells) Royal
Ballet, which tours widely in Britain and
overseas; English National Ballet, which
divides its performances between London and
the regions; Northern Ballet Theatre, which
is based in Halifax and also tours; and
Scottish Ballet, based in Glasgow. Other
companies are Rambert Dance Company
(Britain’s oldest ballet company, which re¬
formed in 1966 as a leading contemporary
dance company); London Contemporary
Dance Theatre, which provides regular
seasons in London besides touring
extensively; Adzido Pan African Dance
Ensemble; Shobana Jeyasingh; and the Green
Candle and Phoenix Dance Company. The
Arts Council also supports Dance Umbrella,
an organisation which promotes an annual
festival of contemporary dance. In addition,
the three Arts Councils and the Regional Arts
Boards support individual artists and offer
project grants to several small groups.
Lloyd Newson, Christopher Bruce,
Richard Alston and Siobhan Davies are
among the foremost British choreographers,
and Michael Clark and Darcey Bussell among
the leading dancers.
Training
Professional training for dancers and
choreographers is provided mainly by
specialist schools, which include the Royal
Ballet School, the Rambert Dance School
and the London Contemporary Dance
School. These, together with many private
schools, have helped to raise British dance to
its present standard. Dance is a subject for
degree studies at a number of institutions,
including the Laban Centre, the University of
Surrey, Dartington College of the Arts in
Devon and Middlesex University.
Courses for students intending to work
with community groups are available at three
institutions. In 1991 the Royal Ballet
announced a scheme to widen access to ballet
training for children from a broader range of
backgrounds, including ethnic minorities.
The National Opera Studio in London
provides advanced training.
National Dance Agencies
Six national dance agencies have been set up
in Birmingham, Leeds, the East Midlands,
439
BRITAIN 1994: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
London, Newcastle upon Tyne and Swindon.
The agencies, which receive Arts Council
support, offer classes, provide information
and advice, help to co-ordinate activities, and
commission dance artists to create work.
Other Educational Schemes
The Arts Council runs Taped, a scheme to
finance dance videos for use in education,
while the Video Place provides a library of
videotape documentation of dance
performances for viewing by promoters,
choreographers, dancers, teachers and students.
The Performing Arts and Technology
School, which opened in Croydon, Surrey, in
1991, offers studies in drama, music and
dance to pupils aged from 14 to 18, with the
emphasis on the application of technology to
the performing arts. The capital cost of £5.9
million is being shared between the
Government (60 per cent) and the British
phonographic industry (40 per cent).
Youth and Music, an organisation affiliated
to the international Jeunesses Musicales,
encourages attendance by young people at
opera, dance and concert performances. All
dance companies in receipt of funding from
the Arts Council provide dance workshops
and education activities. English National
Ballet has created ballets designed for 4- to 8-
and 10- to 14-year-olds; Ludus Dance
Company, based in Lancaster, works mainly
with young people; and Scottish Ballet Steps
Out works in schools throughout Scotland.
The National Youth Music Theatre, which
is based in London, gives young people
between 11 and 18 the opportunity to
perform music theatre under the guidance of
professional directors and choreographers. All
the work takes place in the school holidays.
The National Youth Dance Company and
Yuva, the National South Asian Dance Youth
Company, provide opportunities for young
dancers to work with professionals and to
create and perform dance.
FILMS
British films, actors, and the creative and
technical services supporting them are widely
acclaimed. In March 1993 Emma Thompson
won an Oscar as the best film actress for her
role in Howard's End. Other British
performers who enjoy international
reputations include Sir Dirk Bogarde,
Michael Caine, Sir Anthony Hopkins,
Kenneth Branagh, Jeremy Irons, Dudley
Moore, Michael York, Gary Oldman, Bob
Hoskins, Alan Rickman, and Greta Scacchi.
There are approximately 1,800 cinema
screens in Britain and estimated attendances
are currently running at about 1.9 million a
week. Seating capacity in cinemas increased
during the late 1980s, due almost entirely to
the rise in the number of multi-screen cinema
complexes to 60 from just one in 1985.
Cinemas with five or more screens accounted
for 29 per cent of all screens in Britain in
1992, compared with 12 per cent in 1988.
Cinema admissions in 1992 totalled an
estimated 102.5 million—compared with 58.4
million in 1984. In London and other large
cities there are a number of art or repertory
cinemas showing films which have not been
more widely distributed. These include low
budget films from Britain and abroad; other
foreign films, often with English subtitles;
and older films which are being shown again,
sometimes in a newly edited form. Arts
centres often include cinemas, and film
societies use a range of buildings including,
for example, public libraries.
Animation
The recent resurgence of interest in the
cartoon film in Britain is due in part to the
pioneering work of British animators, who
have created 3D animation and computer
animation. Television has proved an
important source of production finance and
has fostered the work of Nick Park, Peter
Lord, David Sproxton, Tim Burton and
David Anderson. Two British films, Creature
Comforts by Aardman Animation, and
Manipulation, directed by Daniel Greaves,
won Oscars in 1991 and 1992 respectively.
Government Support for the Film
Industry
An annual government grant (almost £15
million for 1993-94) is made to the British
440
THE ARTS
Film Institute and one of £1.3 million to the
Scottish Film Council and the Scottish Film
Production Fund. Since April 1993 Britain
has been a member of Eurimages, the Council
of Europe’s film co-production support
scheme, contributing approximately £5.5
million over the first three years of
membership. Eurimages aims to develop the
European cinema and audio-visual industry
by providing financial support for feature
length fiction films, creative documentaries
and distribution.
In 1991 the British Film Commission
was launched, with government funding
of £3.5 million over four years. The
Commission aims to attract film productions
from overseas by offering a service to assist
film-makers.
British Screen Finance, a private sector
company, provides a source of finance for
new film-makers with commercially viable
productions who have difficulty in attracting
funding. The company, investing its own
money together with contributions from the
Government, part-finances the production of
low- and medium-budget films involving
largely British talent. It encourages the early
stages of film project development and the
production of short films. In 1992 the
Government agreed to provide funding of
£6 million over three years from 1994.
British Film Institute
The development of film, video and television
as art forms is promoted by the British Film
Institute (BFI), founded in 1933, and in
Scotland by the Scottish Film Council. The
Institute offers some direct financial and
technical help through its Production Board.
It runs the National Film Theatre in
London and the National Film Archive, and
has the world’s largest library of information
on film and television. The Institute holds
extensive international collections of books,
periodicals, scripts, stills and posters. Its
Education Department aims to enable as
many people as possible to discover new ways
of appreciating film, video and television.
The National Film Archive contains over
200,000 films and television programmes,
including newsreels, dating from 1895. BFI
South Bank comprises the Museum of the
Moving Image, which traces the history of
film and television, and the National Film
Theatre. The latter has three cinemas
showing films of historical, artistic or
technical interest, and is unique in offering
regular programmes unrestricted by
commercial considerations. In November each
year it hosts the London Film Festival, at
which some 250 new films from all over the
world are screened.
The BFI promotes, and helps to fund, a
network of some 40 regional film theatres;
and is involved in establishing film and
television centres with a range of activities
and facilities. It also co-operates with the
Regional Arts Boards and grant-aids their
film activities. In 1992 the Institute raised
almost £13 million—nearly half its income—
from its operations.
The Welsh Arts Council acts as the
Institute’s agent in Wales. In Scotland the
Scottish Film Council supports regional film
theatres, administers the Scottish Film
Archive, and promotes and provides material
for media education. Together with the
Scottish Arts Council, it has set up the
Scottish Film Production Fund. The BFFs
charter was recently extended to Northern
Ireland, where the BFI works with the
Northern Ireland Film Council (NIFC). The
NIFC receives funds from the Arts Council
of Northern Ireland.
Children’s Film
The Children’s Film and Television
Foundation produces and distributes
entertainment films for children, shown
largely through video and television.
The Children’s Film Unit, which has
received funding from the Children’s Film
and Television Foundation, was founded in
1981. The Unit makes feature films for
children and runs weekly workshops for
children on all aspects of film-making. The
unit caters for about 50 children at any time
and has produced 14 feature films.
Training in Film Production
The National Film and Television School is
441
BRITAIN 1994: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
financed jointly by the Government and by
the film, video and television industries. It
offers postgraduate and short course training
for directors, editors, camera operators,
animators and other specialists. The School
enrols about 30 full-time students a year and
about 500 on short course programmes. In
1993-94 it is receiving a government grant of
£1.9 million.
The London International Film School,
the Royal College of Art, and some
universities and other institutions of higher
education also offer training in film production.
Cinema Licensing and Film
Classification
Cinemas showing films to the public must be
licensed by local authorities, which have a
legal duty to prohibit the admission of
children under 16 to unsuitable films, and
may prevent the showing of any film. In
assessing films the authorities normally rely
on the judgment of an independent non-
statutory body, the British Board of Film
Classification (BBFC), to which films must be
submitted. The Board was set up on the
initiative of the cinema industry to ensure a
proper standard in films shown to the public.
It does not use any written code of
censorship, but can require cuts to be made
before granting a certificate; on rare
occasions, it refuses a certificate.
Films passed by the Board are put into
one of the following categories:
• U, meaning universal—suitable for all;
• PG, meaning parental guidance, in which
some scenes may be unsuitable for young
children;
• 12, 15 and 18, for people of not less than
12, 15 and 18 years of age respectively;
and
• Restricted 18, for restricted showing only
at segregated premises to which no one
under 18 is admitted—for example,
licensed cinema clubs.
Videos
The BBFC is also legally responsible for
classifying videos under a system similar to
that for films. It is an offence to supply
commercially a video which has not been
classified or to supply it in contravention of
its classification—for example, to sell or hire
a video classified 18 to a person under the
age of 18.
VISUAL ARTS
State support for the visual arts consists
largely of funding for the national museums
and galleries, purchase grants for municipal
museums and galleries, and funding through
local authorities, the Museums and Galleries
Commission and the area museum councils .
It also includes funding for living artists
channelled through the Arts Councils, the
Crafts Council and the Regional Arts Boards,
and grants towards the cost of art education.
The Government encourages high standards
of industrial design and craftsmanship
through grants to the Design Council
(see p. 155). All national museums and
galleries are financed chiefly from
government funds. They may charge for
entry to their permanent collections and
special exhibitions. All the national collections
are managed by independent trustees.
Museums and art galleries maintained by
local authorities, universities, independent
museums and private funds may receive help
in building up their collections through
grants administered by the Museums and
Galleries Commission (for England and
Wales) and the Scottish Museums Council.
Financial and practical assistance to both
national and local museums and galleries is
also given by the Arts Council and by trusts
and voluntary bodies, including the Calouste
Gulbenkian Foundation and the National Art
Collections Fund.
Pre-eminent works of art accepted by the
Government in place of inheritance tax are
allocated to public galleries. Financial help
may be available from the National Heritage
Memorial Fund (see p. 431), which is being
allocated £12 million by the Department of
National Heritage in 1993-94. In recent years
the Fund has made important contributions
towards pictures bought by the Birmingham,
Leeds and Manchester City Art Galleries,
and by the national galleries and museums.
442
THE ARTS
In co-operation with the Regional Arts
Boards, the Arts Council makes grants
towards the public display of the visual arts,
especially contemporary and experimental
works, and the publication of books and
magazines. It also encourages the
commissioning of works of art in public
places. The South Bank Board maintains the
Arts Council’s collection of contemporary
British art and organises touring exhibitions
on behalf of the Council. The Council
supports a number of galleries in London,
including the Hayward Gallery,
Photographers’ Gallery and Whitechapel Art
Gallery; and in the regions, the Arnolfini in
Bristol and the Ikon Gallery in Birmingham.
It also provides support for artists and
photographers through purchasing and
commissioning fellowships and residencies.
Similar support is given by the Scottish Arts
Council to galleries in Scotland. The Welsh
and Northern Ireland Arts Councils have
galleries in Cardiff and Belfast respectively.
A number of modern British sculptors
and painters have international reputations,
and have received international prizes and
commissions for major works in foreign
cities. Among the best known are David
Hockney, Lucian Freud and Sir Eduardo
Paolozzi. Younger artists who have achieved
international reputations include Richard
Deacon, Tony Cragg and Anish Kapoor.
Museums and Art Galleries
About 100 million people a year, across all
social groups, attend some 2,000 museums
and galleries open to the public, which
include the major national collections and a
wide variety of municipally and
independently or privately owned
institutions.
Government provision for the national
museums and galleries is £220 million in
1993-94. The Museums and Galleries
Improvement Fund, which is jointly financed
by the Government and the Wolfson
Charities, is providing an annual budget of
£4 million over five years from 1991-92 for
refurbishment. The Fund is already
supporting over 100 projects at national and
other museums and galleries, including work
in Glasgow, Merthyr Tydfil, Newcastle upon
Tyne and Liverpool.
The Government takes advice on policy
matters from the Museums and Galleries
Commission. The Commission also promotes
co-operation between national and provincial
institutions. Ten area museum councils
supply technical services and advice on
conservation, display, documentation and
publicity.
The Government encourages the loan of
objects from national and provincial
collections so that works of art can be seen
by as wide a public as possible. It provides
funds for promoting the touring of
exhibitions and for facilitating the loan of
items between institutions.
The Museum Training Institute is
responsible for developing training standards
and programmes.
Museums Association
The independent Museums Association, to
which many museums and art galleries and
their staffs belong, and which has many
overseas members, facilitates exchange of
information and discussion of matters relating
to museums and galleries. It provides training,
seminars and research; its publications
include the monthly Museums Journal.
National Collections
The national museums and art galleries,
many of them located in London, contain
some of the world’s most comprehensive
collections of objects of artistic,
archaeological, scientific, historical and
general interest. They are:
• the British Museum (including the
ethnographic collections of the Museum
of Mankind);
• the Natural History Museum;
• the Victoria and Albert Museum (the
V&A, which displays fine and decorative
arts);
• the Science Museum;
• the National Gallery (which houses
western painting from around 1260 to
1920);
443
BRITAIN 1994: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
• the Tate Gallery (British painting and
modern art);
• the National Portrait Gallery;
• the Imperial War Museum;
• the National Army Museum;
• the Royal Air Force Museum;
• the National Maritime Museum;
• the Wallace Collection (which includes
paintings, furniture, arms and armour;
and objets d’art); and
• the National Museums and Galleries on
Merseyside.
An extension to the National Gallery, the
Sainsbury Wing, opened in 1991. It provides
a venue for major international touring
exhibitions and other events.
Some of the museums in London have
branches in the regions. Examples are the
National Railway Museum (York) and the
National Museum of Photography, Film and
Television (Bradford), which are part of the
Science Museum. The Tate Gallery opened a
branch in Liverpool in 1988, and another in
St Ives, Cornwall, in June 1993, while the
V&A plans to open a branch in Bradford.
In Scotland the national collections are
held by the National Museums of Scotland
and the National Galleries of Scotland. The
former include the Royal Museum of
Scotland and the Scottish United Services
Museum, both in Edinburgh; the Museum of
Flight, near North Berwick; and the Scottish
Agricultural Museum. A new Museum of
Scotland is to be built next to the Royal
Museum to house the National Museums’
Scottish collection. The National Galleries
of Scotland comprise the National Gallery of
Scotland, the Scottish National Portrait
Gallery and the Scottish National Gallery of
Modern Art.
The National Museum of Wales (where a
major expansion scheme is in progress), in
Cardiff, has a number of branches, including
the Welsh Folk Museum at St Fagans and
the Industrial and Maritime Museum in
Cardiffs dockland.
Northern Ireland has two national
museums: the Ulster Museum in Belfast and
the Ulster Folk and Transport Museum in
County Down.
Other Collections
Other important collections in London
include the Royal Armouries, Britain’s oldest
museum, which has been housed in the
Tower of London for 900 years; the Museum
of London; Sir John Soane’s Museum; the
Courtauld collection; and the London
Transport Museum. The Queen’s Gallery in
Buckingham Palace has exhibitions of
pictures from the extensive royal collections.
Most cities and towns have museums
devoted to art, archaeology and natural
history, usually administered by the local
authorities but sometimes by local learned
societies or by individuals or trustees. Both
Oxford and Cambridge are rich in museums.
Many are associated with their universities,
such as the Ashmolean Museum in Oxford,
and the Fitzwilliam Museum in Cambridge.

THE ARTS
Many private collections of art and
antiques in historic family mansions,
including those owned by the National Trusts
and English Heritage (see p. 341), are open to
the public.
An increasing number of open air
museums depict the regional life of an area or
preserve early industrial remains. These
include the Weald and Downland Museum in
West Sussex, and the Ironbridge Gorge
Museum in Shropshire. Skills of the past are
revived in a number of ‘living’ museums,
such as the Gladstone Pottery Museum near
Stoke-on-Trent and the Quarry Bank Mill at
Styal in Cheshire.
Among the more recent museums are the
Museum of Science and Industry in
Manchester; the Jorvik Viking Centre, a
reconstruction of the Viking settlement in
York; the Mary Rose Museum in
Portsmouth, housing the restored wreck of
the flagship of Henry VIII, which sank in
1545; and Eureka!, the first museum designed
specifically for children, which opened in
Halifax, West Yorkshire, in 1992. The Burrell
Collection in Glasgow houses world-famous
tapestries, paintings and objets d’art. The
Design Museum, which opened in London’s
Docklands in 1990, houses exhibits charting
changes in design and technology.
There are also a number of national art
exhibiting societies, the most famous being
the Royal Academy of Arts at Burlington
House. The Academy holds an annual
Summer Exhibition, where the works of
hundreds of professional and amateur artists
can be seen, and important exhibitions during
the rest of the year. The Royal Scottish
Academy holds annual exhibitions in
Edinburgh. There are also children’s
exhibitions, including the National Exhibition
of Children’s Art.
Crafts
Government aid for the crafts, amounting to
£3.1 million in 1993-94, is administered in
England, Wales and Scotland by the Crafts
Council. The Council supports craftsmen and
women by promoting public interest in their
work, and encouraging the creation and
conservation of works of contemporary
craftsmanship. Grants are available to help
with setting up workshops and acquiring
equipment. The Crafts Council runs the
national centre for crafts in London, which
houses a gallery, a reference library, a
picture library, and a gallery shop. It
organises the annual Chelsea Crafts Fair,
and co-ordinates British groups at
international trade fairs. Crafts Council
exhibitions tour nationally and
internationally, and grants are made to
encourage exhibitions, projects and
organisations. It also runs a craft shop at the
Victoria and Albert Museum. Funding is
given to the English Regional Arts Boards
and the Scottish and Welsh Arts Councils
for the support of crafts, and to
Contemporary Applied Art, a membership
organisation that holds exhibitions and sells
work through its London gallery.
Funding is passed to the English
Regional Arts Boards and to the Scottish
and Welsh Arts Councils for the
development of craft.
In 1992 Britain’s crafts economy had an
estimated annual turnover of £250 million.
Training in Art and Design
Most practical education in art and design is
provided in colleges of art (among the best
known of which are the Slade School,
Goldsmith’s College and the Royal College
of Art, all in London), further education
colleges and private art schools, many of
which award degrees at postgraduate level.
Art is also taught at an advanced level at the
four Scottish Central (Art) Institutions.
Courses at universities concentrate largely
on academic disciplines such as the history
of art. The leading institutions include the
Courtauld and Warburg Institutes of the
University of London and the Department
of Classical Art and Archaeology at
University College, London. Art is one of
the foundation subjects in the National
Curriculum; and the Society for Education
through Art encourages, among other
activities, the purchase by schools of original
works of art by organising an annual
Pictures for Schools exhibition.
The Open College of the Arts offers
445
BRITAIN 1994: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
correspondence courses in art and design,
painting, sculpture, textiles, photography and
creative writing to people wishing to study at
home.
Export Control of Works of Art
London is a major centre for the international
art market, and sales of works of art take
place in the main auction houses (two of the
longest-established being Sotheby’s and
Christie’s), and through private dealers.
Certain items are covered by export control.
These are:
• works of art and collectors’ items over 50
years old and worth £20,000 or more
(£5,000 or more in the case of British
historical portraits);
• photographic material over 50 years old
and valued at £500 or more an item; and
• documents, manuscripts and archives
over 50 years old, irrespective of value.
A licence from the Department of National
Heritage is required before such items can be
exported. If the Department’s advisers
recommend withholding a licence, the matter
is referred to the Reviewing Committee on
the Export of Works of Art. If the Committee
considers a work to be of national importance
it can advise the Government to withhold the
export licence for a specified time to give a
public museum, art gallery, or private
collector an opportunity to buy at a fair price.
In 1991 the Committee published a review of
the present system of export control,
following which the Government decided
against listing important paintings and other
heritage objects to prevent them from being
exported.
With the completion of the single
European market in January 1993, there is
concern that the removal of customs barriers
for intra-community trade may facilitate the
illicit export of national treasures. Discussions
on methods of preventing this are in progress.
LITERATURE AND LIBRARIES
A number of literary activities receive public
subsidy through the Arts Council. In 1990,
for example, the Council sponsored its first
international writers’ tour, and contributed to
an innovative television series on modern
poetry. It continues to foster an interest in
writing from diverse cultures through its
support for translations and black publishing.
There are free public libraries throughout
Britain (see p. 449), private libraries and
several private literary societies. Book reviews
are featured in the press and on television
and radio, and numerous periodicals
concerned with literature are published
(see p. 455). Recognition of outstanding
literary merit is provided by a number of
awards, some of the most valuable being the
Booker, National Cash Register and
Whitbread prizes. In March 1993 V. S.
Naipaul was awarded the first David Cohen
British Literature Prize for a lifetime’s
achievement by a living British writer. The
prize will be awarded every two years.
Awards to encourage young writers include
those of the Somerset Maugham Trust Fund
and the E. C. Gregory Trust Fund. Many
British writers are internationally recognised.
Well-known living novelists, with
examples of their works, include
• Sir Kingsley Amis—Lucky Jim,
Stanley and the Women;
• Anthony Burgess—A Clockwork
Orange, The End of the World News;
• A. S. Byatt—Possession: A Romance;
and
• Fay Weldon—Praxis, The Cloning
of Joanna May.
Many writers from overseas, often from
Commonwealth countries, also live and work
in Britain, writing books in English which
have a wide circulation in Britain and
overseas.
Distinguished British poets include Ted
Hughes, the Poet Laureate (the Poet
Laureate is a member of the Royal
Household who receives an annual stipend
from the Civil List—see p. 46; he may write
commemorative verse if he wishes); Geoffrey
Hill; Tony Harrison; James Berry; Gavin
Ewart; Wendy Cope; and Elizabeth Jennings.
English literature is taught extensively at
schools, colleges and universities throughout
446
THE ARTS
Britain. Creative writing is also taught at a
wide variety of institutions; one of the best
known centres is at the University of East
Anglia, in Norwich, which also houses the
British Centre for Literary Translation.
Authors’ Copyright and Performers’
Protection
Original literary, dramatic, musical or artistic
works, films, sound recordings and broadcasts
are automatically protected by copyright in
Britain. This protection is also given to works
from countries party to international
copyright conventions. The copyright owner
has rights against unauthorised reproduction,
public performance, broadcasting and issue to
the public of his or her work; and against
dealing in unauthorised copies. In most cases
the author is the first owner of the copyright,
and the term of copyright is the life of the
author and a period of 50 years after death
(50 years from the year of release for films
and sound recordings and 50 years from the
year of broadcast for broadcasts).
The Copyright, Designs and Patents Act
1988 reformed copyright law and introduced
the concept of moral rights, whereby authors
have the right to be identified on their works
and to object to derogatory treatment of
them. The Act also updated the rights which
protect performers against making and
trading in unauthorised recordings of live
performances, the term of protection for
these rights being 50 years from the year in
which the performance is given.
Literary and Philological Societies
Societies to promote literature include the
English Association and the Royal Society of
Literature. The leading society for studies in
the humanities is the British Academy for the
Promotion of Historical, Philosophical and
Philological Studies (the British Academy).
Other specialist societies are the Early
English Text Society, the Bibliographical
Society and several societies devoted to
particular authors, the largest of which is the
Dickens Fellowship. Various societies, such
as the Poetry Society, sponsor poetry
readings and recitals.
Libraries
The British Library
The British Library, the national library of
Britain, is one of the world’s greatest
libraries. Its collections comprise over 18
million items—monographs, manuscripts,
maps, newspapers, patents, stamps and
recorded sound. Publishers must deposit
there a copy of most items published or
available in Britain.
The National Bibliographic Service
processes material legally deposited at the
Library for inclusion in catalogues and
maintains a machine-readable database of
bibliographical records from which is derived
the British National Bibliography (a list of
new and forthcoming British books) and a
range of automated bibliographical services.
The Research and Development
Department is a major source of funding for
research and development in library and
information services.
The Library’s Document Supply Centre at
Boston Spa (West Yorkshire) is the national
centre for inter-library lending within Britain
and between Britain and countries overseas.
It supplies 3.5 million requests a year, mostly
from its own stock of 7 million documents.
In 1990 the Library set up the self-
supporting Centre for the Book, to promote
awareness of books and their role in British
life.
The British Library’s new London
headquarters at St Pancras is being built at a
cost of £450 million, and will be open to the
public by 1996. It will provide reading rooms
for most of the Library’s London-based
collections—humanities, science, technology
and industry—and also specialist reading
areas. Tl^ new Library aims to offer greatly
improved services, including exhibition
galleries, a bookshop, a lecture theatre and a
conference centre.
Other Libraries
The National Libraries of Scotland and
Wales, the Bodleian Library of Oxford
University and the Cambridge University
Library can also claim copies of all new
447
BRITAIN 1994: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
British publications under legal deposit. The
first phase of a new building for the National
Library of Scotland was opened in 1989,
providing 49 km (30 miles) of storage
shelving and accommodating a map library,
lending services and the Scottish Science
Library. The second stage is due to be
completed in 1994.
Some of the national museums and
government departments have important
libraries.
• The Public Record Office in London and
in Kew, Surrey, is an executive agency of
the Lord Chancellor’s Department. It
houses the records of the superior courts
of law of England and Wales and of most
government departments, as well as
famous historical documents. The Office
has many millions of documents, dating
from the time of the Norman Conquest
to the present day. Public records, with
few exceptions, are available for
inspection by members of the public 30
years after the end of the year in which
they were created.
• The Scottish Record Office in Edinburgh
and the Public Record Office of Northern
Ireland, Belfast, serve the same purpose.
Besides a number of great private
collections, such as that of the London
Library, there are the libraries of the learned
societies and institutions. Examples are the
Royal Institute of International Affairs, the
Royal Geographical Society and the Royal
Academy of Music. The Poetry Library in
the South Bank Centre in London, owned by
the Arts Council, is a national collection of
20th-century poetry written in or translated
into English.
University Libraries
The university libraries of Oxford and
Cambridge are unmatched by those of the
more recent foundations. However, the
combined library resources of the colleges and
institutions of the University of London total
9 million volumes, the John Rylands
University Library in Manchester contains
3.4 million volumes, Edinburgh 2 million,
Leeds 1.8 million, and Birmingham, Glasgow,
Liverpool and Aberdeen each have over
1 million volumes. Many universities have
important research collections in special
subjects; examples include the Barnes
Medical Library at Birmingham and the
British Library of Political and Economic
Science at the London School of Economics.
University libraries also have on-line access to
library information worldwide.
Special Libraries
Numerous associations and commercial and
industrial organisations run library and
information services. Although most are
intended primarily for use within the
organisation, many can be used, by
arrangement, by people interested in the area
covered, and the specialist publications held
are often available for inter-library lending.
Public Libraries
Local authorities in Great Britain and
education and library boards in Northern
Ireland have a duty to provide a free lending
and reference library service, and Britain’s
network of public libraries has a total stock of
about 130.2 million books. In 1991-92 public
libraries added nearly 13 million books to
their stock; actual expenditure on new stock
totalled £105.8 million. Public libraries issue
an average of ten books a year for every
person in Britain. Of these, 56 per cent are
works of fiction for adults. Over half of the
total population are members of public
libraries. Some areas are served by mobile
libraries, and domiciliary services cater for
people unable to visit a library.
Many libraries have collections of compact
discs, records, audio- and video-cassettes, and
musical scores for loan to the public, while a
number also lend from collections of works of
art, which may be originals or reproductions.
Most libraries hold documents on local
history, and nearly all provide children’s
departments, while reference and information
sections and art, music, commercial and
technical departments meet the growing
demands in these fields. The information role
is one of increasing importance for many
libraries, and greater use is being made of
448
THE ARTS
information technology, including
microcomputers and reference databases.
The Government remains committed to
providing a free basic library service—the
borrowing and consultation of printed
materials—but believes there is scope for
greater private sector involvement. It makes
available ^250,000 a year to encourage new
developments and increase efficiency. Priority
is given to projects involving collaboration
with other libraries and the private sector.
Public libraries charge for some services,
such as research services and the lending of
non-printed materials.
The Government is advised on library and
information matters by four library and
information services councils or committees,
representing England, Wales, Scotland and
Northern Ireland.
A government review of the scope and
value of services provided by public libraries
in England is in progress. The Government
has also announced plans to carry out an
investigation of the feasibility of contracting
out the delivery of some parts of the public
library service.
The Library Association
The Library Association is the principal
professional organisation for those engaged in
library and information services. Founded in
1877, the Association has 25,000 members. It
maintains a Register of Chartered Librarians
and publishes books, pamphlets and an
official journal.
'The Library Association is the designated
authority for the recognition of qualifications
gained in other EC member states.
Public Lending Right Scheme
The Public Lending Right Scheme,
introduced in 1979, gives registered authors
the right to receive payment from a central
fund (totalling £5 million in 1993-94) for the
loans made of their books from public
libraries in Britain. Payment is made in
proportion to the number of times the
authors’ books are lent out. In 1991-92, 97
authors received the maximum payment of
£6,000.
Books
In 1992 British publishers issued some 79,000
separate titles, of which just over 59,000 were
new titles and the remainder reprints and
new editions. The British publishing industry
devotes much effort to developing overseas
markets, and in 1992 the value of exports of
British books amounted to £773 million.
Among the leading organisations
representing publishing and distribution
interests are the Publishers Association,
which has 160 members, representing over
262 separate publishing companies; and the
Booksellers’ Association, with 3,300 members.
The Publishers Association, through its
International Division, promotes the export
of British books.
Historical Manuscripts
The Royal Commission on Historical
Manuscripts is the central investigatory and
advisory body on manuscripts, records and
archives other than the public records. It
maintains the National Register of Archives
and advises owners, custodians and
government; assists researchers; and co¬
ordinates the activities of bodies working in
the field. It also publishes a series of Guides
to Sources for British History.
The National Manuscripts Conservation
Trust provides grants to record offices,
libraries and other owners of manuscripts and
archives accessible to the public.

Technical Developments 472
More daily newspapers, national and regional, are sold for every person in
Britain than in most other developed countries. On an average day
62 per cent of people over the age of 15 read a national morning newspaper;
about 71 per cent read a Sunday newspaper. However, television viewing is by
far Britain’s most popular leisure pastime: 95 per cent of households have a
colour television set and over two-thirds a video recorder. People spend an
average of nearly four hours a day watching television, including video
playbacks.
The Press
There is no state control or censorship of the
press, but it is subject to the general laws on
publication (see p. 459). Following
publication of an independent review of the
effectiveness of press self-regulation in
January 1993, the Government has stated that
it considers that the present arrangements for
self-regulation are unsatisfactory, and has
announced a number of steps to tackle
intrusions into personal privacy (see p. 458).
The press has since announced changes in
response to the Government’s comments
(see p. 458).
Three out of four adults regularly read a
paid-for regional or local newspaper as well
as a free local paper. National papers have a
total circulation of 14 million on weekdays
and 16.1 million on Sundays, although the
total readership is considerably greater.
Men are more likely to read newspapers than
women (66 per cent against 57 per cent) and
more people in the 45-64 age group read a
daily newspaper than in any other age group.
There are about 125 daily (Monday to
Saturday) and Sunday newspapers, some
2,000 weekly paid-for and free newspapers
(including business, sporting and religious
newspapers), and 7,000 periodical
publications.
Several newspapers have had very long
and distinguished histories. The Observer, for
example, first published in 1791, is the oldest
national Sunday newspaper in the world, and
The Times, Britain’s oldest daily national
newspaper, began publication in 1785. The
weekly Berrow’s Worcester Journal claims to
be the world’s oldest newspaper in
continuous circulation, having been
established in 1690.
The press caters for a variety of political
450
THE MEDIA
views, interests and levels of education.
Newspapers are almost always financially
independent of any political party. Where
they express pronounced views and show
obvious political leanings in their editorial
comments, these derive from proprietorial
and other non-party influences. Nevertheless,
during general election campaigns many
newspapers recommend their readers to vote
for a particular political party. Even
newspapers which adopt strong political views
in their editorial columns include feature and
other types of articles by authors of a variety
of political persuasions. In order to preserve
their character and traditions, some
newspapers and periodicals are governed by
trustee-type arrangements. Others have
management arrangements to ensure their
editors’ authority and independence.
In recent years working practices
throughout the newspaper industry have
undergone major changes in response to the
challenges posed by computer-based
technology and the need to contain costs.
Newsprint, about three-quarters of which is
imported, forms about a quarter of average
national newspaper costs; labour represents
over half. In addition to sales, many
newspapers and periodicals earn considerable
amounts from their advertising. Total yearly
spending of around ^4,000 million on press
advertising makes the press by far the largest
advertising medium in Britain. Unlike most
of its European counterparts the British press
receives no subsidies and relatively few tax
and postal concessions.
In discussions on a ‘new world information
and communication order’ Britain has
opposed measures designed to increase
governmental regulation of the media or limit
the free flow of information. At the same
time, it has reaffirmed its willingness to
support efforts to improve communications
systems in the developing world.
Netp Printing Technology
Publishers have been able to reduce
production costs, often by using advanced
systems for editing and production processes.
The ‘single keying’ system, for example,
allows journalists or advertising staff to input
‘copy’ directly into a computer terminal, and
then to transfer it electronically into columns
of type. Although it is possible to arrange
page layouts on screen, and to have these
made into plates for the printing press, at
present very few such systems are in
operation. Most involve the production of
bromides from the computer setting; these
are then pasted up into columns before being
placed in a plate-making machine.
News International, publisher of three
daily and two Sunday papers, has at its
London Docklands headquarters more than
500 computer terminals, one of the largest
systems installed at one time anywhere in the
world. The Financial Times opened a new
printing plant in Docklands in 1988 with
about 200 production workers, compared with
the 650 formerly employed in the City of
London. The new Docklands plant of the
Associated Newspapers Group uses
flexography, an advanced printing process.
Other papers have also set up computerised
printing plants outside Fleet Street.
Newspaper Ownership
Ownership of the national, London and
regional daily newspapers lies in the hands of
a number of large press publishing groups
(see Table 30.1). There are also some 100
independent regional and local newspaper
publishers.
Although most enterprises are organised as
limited liability companies, individual and
partner proprietorship survives. The large
national newspaper and periodical publishers
are major corporations; many are involved in
the whole field of publishing and
communications. Some have shares in
independent television and radio companies,
while others have industrial and commercial
interests.
The law provides safeguards against the
risks inherent in undue concentration of
ownership. Government consent is needed to
transfer a newspaper or newspaper assets to a
proprietor whose newspapers have an average
daily circulation amounting, with that of the
newspaper to be taken over, to 500,000 or
more copies. Except in certain limited cases,
consent may be given only after the President

THE MEDIA
of the Board of Trade has referred the matter
to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission
and received its report.
Under the Broadcasting Act 1990
(see p. 462) no proprietor of a national
newspaper or local newspaper is allowed
more than a 20 per cent interest in direct
broadcasting by satellite channels,
independent television Channels 3 and 5, and
national and local radio within its circulation
area. (A local newspaper can own a local radio
station if the station does not serve an area
overlapping that served by the newspaper.)
The National Press
The national press consists of 12 daily
morning papers and nine Sunday papers
(see Table 30.1). Formerly they were
produced in or near Fleet Street in London
with, in some cases, northern editions being
printed in Manchester. All the national
papers have now moved their editorial and
printing facilities to other parts of London or
away from the capital altogether; some use
contract printing. The Independent, for
example, is printed in Bradford,
Northampton and Portsmouth. Scottish
editions of the Sun, The Times, the News of
the World and the Sunday Times are printed
in Glasgow.
In order to improve distribution and sales
overseas, editions of the Financial Times are
printed in Frankfurt, Roubaix (northern
France), New Jersey and Tokyo, while the
Guardian prints an international edition in
Frankfurt. The European, a weekly English-
language international newspaper, is printed
in Britain, France, Germany and Hungary.
National newspapers are often described as
either ‘quality’, ‘popular’ or ‘mid-market’
papers on the basis of differences in style and
content. Five dailies and four Sundays are
usually described as ‘quality’ newspapers,
which are directed at readers who want full
information on a wide range of public
matters. Popular newspapers appeal to people
wanting news of a more entertaining
character, presented more concisely. ‘Mid¬
market’ publications cover the intermediate
market. Quality papers are normally
broadsheet (large-sheet) in format and
mid-market and popular papers tabloid
(small-sheet).
Many newspapers are printed in colour
and most produce colour supplements as part
of the Saturday or Sunday paper, with
articles on travel, food and wine, and other
leisure topics.
The leading Scottish papers, the Scotsman
and the Herald, have considerable circulations
outside Scotland.
There is a growing market for news and
information in the electronic media, and
quality papers such as the Financial Times
provide material for use on databases and
videotext services. The Times supplies a news
service to British Sky Broadcasting (BSkyB),
a direct satellite broadcasting company under
the same ownership.
Regional Newspapers
There are about 100 morning, evening and
Sunday newspapers and some 2,000 weekly
paid-for and free distribution newspapers,
publishing mainly regional and local news.
England
Of the morning papers the Yorkshire Post
(Leeds), the Northern Echo (Darlington) and
the Eastern Daily Press (Norwich), each has a
circulation of over 82,000, and two provincial
Sunday papers—the Sunday Mercury
(Birmingham) and the Sunday Sun
(Newcastle upon Tyne)—sell 152,000 and
120,000 copies respectively. Circulation
figures of evening papers start at about
10,000 and most are in the 20,000 to 100,000
range. Those with much larger sales include
the Manchester Evening News (222,000),
Wolverhampton’s Express and Star (218,000)
and the Birmingham Evening Mail (206,000).
Paid weekly papers have a mainly local appeal
and most have circulations in the 5,000 to
60,000 range.
London has one evening paper, the
Evening Standard, with a circulation of
476,400. It covers national and international
news as well as local affairs. A number of
evening papers are published in the outer
metropolitan area. Local weeklies include
papers for every district in Greater London,
453
BRITAIN 1994: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
which are often local editions of individual
papers.
Wales
Wales has one daily morning newspaper, the
Western Mail, with a circulation of 71,800,
and Wales on Sunday, with a circulation of
54,000. Both are published in Cardiff.
Evening papers published in Wales are the
South Wales Echo, Cardiff; the South Wales
Argus, Newport; the South Wales Evening
Post, Swansea; and the Evening Leader,
Wrexham. Circulations range from 32,600 to
77,600. North Wales is served by the Daily
Post, published in Liverpool, and the
Liverpool Echo.
The weekly press (79 publications)
includes English-language papers, some of
which carry articles in Welsh; bilingual
papers; and Welsh-language papers. Welsh
community newspapers receive an annual
grant as part of the Government’s wider
financial support for the Welsh language.
Scotland
Scotland has six morning, five evening and
three Sunday newspapers. Local weekly
newspapers number 118. The daily morning
papers, with circulations of between 9,800
and 757,000, are The Scotsman (published in
Edinburgh); the Herald', the Daily Record
(sister paper of the Daily Mirror)', the Dundee
Courier and Advertiser, the Aberdeen Press and
Journal', and the Paisley Daily Express. The
daily evening papers have circulations in the
range of 21,000 to 150,400 and include the
Evening News of Edinburgh, Glasgow’s
Evening Times, Dundee’s Evening Telegraph
and Aberdeen’s Evening Express.
The Sunday papers are the Sunday Mail,
the Sunday Post and a quality broadsheet
paper, Scotland on Sunday. The national
Sunday Express has a Scottish edition (printed
in Manchester) and the Observer and the
Sunday Times carry Scottish supplements.
Northern Ireland
Northern Ireland has two morning
newspapers, one evening and two Sunday
papers, all published in Belfast, with
circulations ranging from 19,600 to 131,000.
They are the News Letter (unionist), the Irish
News (nationalist), the evening Belfast
Telegraph, Sunday Life and Sunday World
(Northern Ireland edition).
There are about 50 weeklies. Newspapers
from the Irish Republic, as well as the British
national press, are widely read in Northern
Ireland.
Free Distribution Newspapers
More than 1,000 free distribution
newspapers, mostly weekly and financed by
advertising, are published in Britain; over half
are produced by established newspaper
publishers. They have enjoyed rapid growth
in recent years and now have an estimated
total weekly circulation of about 35 million.
Ethnic Minority Publications
Over 70 newspapers and magazines in Britain
are produced by members of the ethnic
minorities. Most are published weekly,
fortnightly or monthly. Two Chinese
newspapers, Sing Tao and Wen Wei Po, the
Urdu Daily fang (see below) and the Arabic
Al-Arab, however, are dailies.
The Asian Times and Indiamail are English
language weeklies for people of Asian
descent; the Sikh Messenger and Sikh Courier
are produced quarterly. Afro-Caribbean
newspapers include the Weekly Gleaner, a
local edition of the long-established Jamaican
Gleaner, and West Indian Digest. The Voice
and Caribbean Times, both weeklies, are
aimed at the black population in general. The
Weekly Journal, the first ‘quality’ broadsheet
aimed at Britain’s black community, was
launched in 1992. Leading ethnic language
newspapers include the Urdu Daily Jang, an
offshoot of the largest circulation paper in
Pakistan, and the weekly Gujarat Samachar, a
Gujarati tabloid. Publications also appear in
Bengali (examples are the weeklies Jagoran
and Janomot)', in Hindi (the weeklies Amar
Deep, Hind Samachar and Navin Weekly)', and
in Punjabi (the weeklies Des Pardes and
Punjab Darpan and the monthlies Rachna and
Perdesan).
454
THE MEDIA
Many provincial papers print special
editions for their local populations. The
Leicester Mercury, for example, publishes a
daily Asian edition, incorporating news from
the South Asian sub-continent.
The Periodical Press
The 7,000 periodical publications are
classified as ‘consumer general interest’,
‘special interest’ and ‘business-to-business’.
There are also several hundred ‘house
magazines’ produced by businesses or public
services for their employees and/or clients.
Directories and similar publications number
more than 2,000. The ‘alternative’ press
comprises a large number of titles, many of
them devoted to radical politics, community
matters, religion, the occult, science or
ecology.
Consumer general and specialist periodicals
comprise magazines for a wide range of
interests. These include women’s magazines;
publications for children; religious periodicals;
fiction magazines; magazines dealing with
sport, motoring, gardening, youth interests
and music; humour; retirement; and
computer magazines. Learned societies, trade
unions, regiments, universities and other
organisations also produce publications.
Weekly periodicals with the highest sales
are those which carry full details of the
forthcoming week’s television and radio
programmes, including the satellite schedules.
What's on TFhas a circulation figure of
1.5 million, followed by the Radio Times with
1.4 million and TV Times with 1 million.
Woman's Weekly, Woman's Own, Woman,
Weekly News (which sells mainly in Scotland),
Woman's Realm, My Weekly and Me have
circulations in the 355,000 to 689,000 range.
In recent years several women’s magazines
from overseas have achieved large
circulations: Puma and Best, for instance,
each sell over 560,000 copies, while Bella and
Hello! are also widely read. Smash Hits, with
a circulation of 312,000, is a fortnightly
magazine dealing with pop music and teenage
lifestyles. Viz, a cartoon comic aimed at
young adults, sells 869,000 copies. Of
monthly magazines, Reader’s Digest has the
highest circulation (1.6 million).
The leading journals of opinion include
The Economist, an independent conservative
publication covering a wide range of topics.
The New Statesman and Society reviews social
issues, politics, literature and the arts from an
independent socialist point of view, and the
Spectator covers similar subjects from an
independent conservative standpoint.
New Scientist reports on science and
technology in terms that the non-specialist
reader can understand. Private Eye, a satirical
fortnightly, also covers public affairs. Weekly
‘listings’ magazines, such as Time Out,
provide details of cultural and other events in
London and other large cities.
Literary and political journals, and
those specialising in international and
Commonwealth affairs, appear monthly or
quarterly, and generally appeal to a more
academic readership. Many of the business,
scientific and professional journals, whose
publication ranges from twice weekly to
quarterly, have a considerable circulation
overseas. There are about 4,600 publications
covering business and industrial affairs.
News Agencies
The principal news agencies in Britain
are Reuters, based in London, the Press
Association and Extel Financial.
Reuters
Reuters is a publicly owned company,
employing over 10,000 staff in 79 countries.
It has more than 1,200 staff journalists and
photographers. The company serves
subscribers in over 140 countries, including
financial institutions; commodities houses;
traders in currencies, equities and bonds;
major corporations; government agencies;
news agencies; newspapers; and radio and
television stations.
Reuters has developed the world’s largest
private leased communications network to
transmit its services. It provides the media
with a wide range of news, news pictures and
graphics. Services for business clients
comprise constantly updated financial news,
historical information, facilities for
computerised trading, and the supply of
455
BRITAIN 1994: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
communications and other equipment for
financial dealing rooms. Information is
distributed through video terminals and
teleprinters. Reuters owns Reuters
Television, a television news agency
(see p. 471).
The Press Association
The Press Association—the British and Irish
national news agency—is co-operatively
owned by the principal daily newspapers of
Britain outside London, and of the Irish
Republic. It offers national and regional
newspapers and broadcasters a comprehensive
range of home news and provides regional
papers with the world news from Reuters and
Associated Press.
News is sent by satellite from London by
the Press Association, certain items being
available in Dataformat, as camera-ready
copy. Its ‘Newsfile’ operation provides
general news, sports and foreign news on
screen by means of telephone and viewdata
terminals. The photographic department
offers newspapers and broadcasters a daily
pictures service. The NewsFeatures service
supplies reports of local or special interest
and grants exclusive rights to syndicated
features. It also offers a dial-in graphics
facility, as well as extensive cuttings and
photograph libraries.
Extel Financial
Extel Financial supplies information and
services to financial and business
communities throughout the world. Based in
London, it has a network of offices in
Europe, the United States and in the Asia
Pacific region. Data is collected from all the
world’s major stock exchanges, companies
and the international press. The company is a
major source of reference material on
companies and securities, and supplies up-to-
the-minute business and company news.
Other Agencies
News services are also provided by Associated
Press and United Press International, which
are British subsidiaries of United States news
agencies. A number of other agencies and
news services have offices in London, and
there are minor agencies in other cities.
Syndication of features is not as common in
Britain as in some countries, but a few
agencies specialise in this type of work.
Training and Education
The National Council for the Training of
Journalists (NCTJ), which represents many
regional newspaper publishers, sets and
conducts examinations, and organises short
training courses for journalists.
The two main methods of entry into
newspaper journalism are selection for a one-
year NCTJ pre-entry course at a college of
further or higher education or direct
recruitment by a regional or local newspaper.
Both types of entrant take part in ‘on-the-job’
training. Block-release courses, preceded by a
period of distance learning, are provided for
those who have not attended a pre-entry
course. Similar courses exist for press
photographers.
The first undergraduate courses in
journalism in Britain started in 1991 at City
University, London, at the University of
Central Lancashire and at the London
College of Printing, which also provides GCE
(General Certificate of Education) Advanced
(‘A’) level courses in journalism. Postgraduate
courses in journalism are available at the
University of Wales College of Cardiff; City
University, London; the London College of
Printing; Strathclyde University/Glasgow
Caledonian University; and the Universities
of Central Lancashire and Bournemouth.
Courses for regional newspapers in such
subjects as newspaper sales, advertising, and
management are provided by the Newspaper
Society’s training service. Some newspaper
publishers carry out journalist training
independently of the NCTJ, awarding their
own certificates or diplomas. New National
Vocational Qualifications (see p. 415) are now
available in newspaper journalism.
Specialist training courses for journalists
and news media managers from developing
countries and from Eastern Europe are
offered by the Thomson Foundation in
Cardiff. The Foundation also runs training
456
THE MEDIA
courses overseas and provides consultants to
assist newspapers, news agencies and
magazines in editorial advertising,
management, circulation and the use of new
technology. It runs an international
journalism training centre in collaboration
with Xinhua News Agency in Peking.
Through its charitable trust, the Reuter
Foundation, Reuters offers assistance to
overseas journalists to study and train in
Britain and other parts of the world. The
Foundation awards fellowships to journalists
from developing nations to spend up to one
year at Oxford University. It also runs
shorter practical training programmes in
London for journalists from Eastern and
Central Europe.
The Periodicals Training Council is the
official training organisation in periodical
publishing. It offers a range of short courses
covering management, editorial work,
advertisement sales and circulation sales. It
has special responsibility for editorial training
and administers an editorial training scheme
for those already in employment.
Newspapers in Education
Newspapers in Education, a worldwide
scheme using newspapers to improve
standards of literacy among young people, is
run in Britain by the Newspaper Society.
The scheme involves using newspapers in
schools for teaching a wide range of subjects
at all levels of education. Launched in
Birmingham in 1984, the scheme has over
300 projects operated by regional newspapers
in partnership with local schools.
Press Institutions
Employers’ organisations include the
Newspaper Publishers Association, whose
members publish national newspapers, and
the Newspaper Society, which represents
regional and local newspapers in England,
Wales and Northern Ireland. The Scottish
Daily Newspaper Society represents the
interests of daily and Sunday newspapers in
Scotland; the Scottish Newspaper Publishers’
Association acts on behalf of the owners of
weekly newspapers in Scotland; and
Associated Northern Ireland Newspapers is
made up of proprietors of weekly newspapers
in Northern Ireland. The membership of the
Periodical Publishers Association includes
most independent publishers of business,
professional and consumer journals.
Organisations representing journalists are
the National Union of Journalists, with
around 25,000 members, and the Chartered
Institute of Journalists, with about 1,500
members. The main printing union is the
Graphical, Paper and Media Union, with a
membership of around 270,000.
The Foreign Press Association
was formed in 1888 to help the
correspondents of overseas newspapers
in their work by arranging press
conferences, tours, briefings, and other
services and facilities.
The Guild of British Newspaper Editors is
the officially recognised professional body for
newspaper editors. It has approximately 360
members and aims to maintain the
professional status and independence of
editors, defend the freedom of the press, and
improve the education and training of
journalists. The British Association of
Industrial Editors is the professional
organisation for editors of house journals.
The Association of British Editors represents
the whole range of media, including radio,
television, newspapers and magazines.
Press Conduct
Readers’ representatives have been appointed
by most national papers to handle complaints.
They also help to guarantee standards of
accuracy, fairness and good behaviour on the
part of journalists.
The Press Complaints Commission
The Press Complaints Commission, a non-
statutory body, was set up in 1991, following
recommendations in the report by the
independent Committee on Privacy and
Related Matters chaired by Mr (now Sir)
David Calcutt, QC. The Commission was set
up by the newspaper and periodical industry
457
BRITAIN 1994: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
in a final attempt to make self-regulation of
the press work properly. It is funded by
PRESSBOF (the Press Standards Board of
Finance), which was set up in 1990 to co¬
ordinate and promote self-regulation within
the industry. These measures were prompted
by growing criticism of press standards, with
allegations of unjustified invasion of privacy
and inaccurate and biased reporting, among
other abuses, resulting in calls for
government regulation of the press.
The Commission’s membership is drawn
from newspaper and magazine editors and
from people from outside the industry. It
deals with complaints by members of the
public about the contents and conduct of
newspapers and magazines, and advises
editors and journalists. It operates a code of
practice agreed by editors governing respect
for privacy, opportunity to reply, corrections,
journalists’ behaviour, references to race and
religion, payments to criminals for articles,
protection of confidential sources and other
matters. The Commission publishes regular
reports of its findings.
Proposed Changes
In 1990 the Government indicated that it
would review the effectiveness of press self¬
regulation once the Press Complaints
Commission had been in operation for 18
months, and in 1991 it asked Sir David
Calcutt to assess the effectiveness of the
present arrangements. Sir David’s report,
Review of Press Self-Regulation, was published
in January 1993 and recommended—among
other things—the introduction of a statutory
complaints tribunal.
In its initial response, the Government has
stated that it agrees that the Commission is
not an effective regulator of the press and
recognises the argument for a statutory
tribunal. However, the Government considers
that introducing a statutory body would be a
significant departure from the traditional
approach to press regulation, and it would be
extremely reluctant to take such action.
The Government accepts the report’s
recommendations on protecting personal
privacy. It intends to bring forward proposals
to create new criminal offences in England
and Wales to deal with intrusion on private
property and the use of surveillance devices,
photographs and recordings to obtain
personal information for publication.
Similar changes for Scotland will be
considered.
In May 1993 the industry and the Press
Complaints Commission announced steps to
strengthen voluntary regulation. These
include measures to increase the number of
independent members of the Commission to
ensure a lay majority; a strengthening of the
code of practice; and the setting up of a
helpline service for members of the public
who fear the code of practice has been, or is
about to be, breached.
Advertising Practice
Advertising in all non-broadcast media, such
as newspapers, magazines, posters, cinema
and direct mail, is regulated by the
Advertising Standards Authority, an
independent body funded by a levy on
display advertising expenditure. The
Authority aims to promote and enforce the
highest standards of advertising in the
interests of the public through its supervision
of the British Code of Advertising Practice.
The Code’s basic principles are to ensure
that advertisements:
• are legal, decent, honest and truthful;
• are prepared with a sense of
responsibility to the consumer and
society; and
• conform to the principles of fair
competition as generally accepted in
business.
The Authority monitors advertisements to
ensure their compliance with the Code and
investigates any complaints received.
The advertising industry has agreed to
abide by the Code and to back it up with
effective sanctions. Free and confidential pre¬
publication advice is offered to assist
publishers, agencies and advertisers. The
Authority’s main sanction is the
recommendation that advertisements
considered to be in breach of the Code
should not be published. This is normally
sufficient to ensure that an advertisement is
458
THE MEDIA
withdrawn or amended. The Authority also
publishes monthly reports on the results of
its investigations.
The Authority is recognised by the Office
of Fair Trading as the established means of
controlling non-broadcast advertising. The
Authority can refer misleading advertisements
to the Director General of Fair Trading, who
has the power to seek an injunction to
prevent their publication.
The Press and the Law
The press generally has the same freedom as
the individual to comment on matters of
public interest. No laws governing the
content of the press are in operation, but
certain statutes include sections which apply
to the press.
There are laws governing:
• the extent of newspaper ownership in
television and radio companies
(see p. 462);
• the transfer of newspaper assets
(see p. 451); and
• the right of press representatives to be
supplied with agenda and reports for
meetings of local authorities and
reasonable facilities for taking notes and
telephoning reports.
There is a legal requirement to reproduce
‘the printer’s imprint’ (the printer’s name
and address) on all publications, including
newspapers. Publishers are legally obliged to
deposit copies of newspapers and other
publications at the British Library (see
p. 447).
Publication of advertisements is governed
by wide-ranging legislation, including public
health, financial services and fraud legislation.
Legal restrictions are imposed on certain
types of prize competition; copyrights come
under various copyright laws.
Laws on contempt of court, official secrets
and defamation are also relevant to the press.
A newspaper may not publish comments on
the conduct of judicial proceedings which are
likely to prejudice the reputation of the courts
for fairness before or during the actual
proceedings, nor may it publish before or
during a trial anything which might influence
the result. The unauthorised acquisition and
publication of official information in such
areas as defence and international relations
are offences under the Official Secrets Acts
1911 to 1989, where unauthorised disclosure
would be harmful. However, these are
restrictions on publication, that is, on
dissemination to the public by any means,
not just through the printed press.
Most legal proceedings against the press
are libel actions brought by private
individuals. In such cases, the editor,
proprietor, publishers, printer and
distributor of the newspaper, as well as the
author, may all be held responsible.
Defence Advisory Notices
Government officials and representatives of
the media form the Defence, Press and
Broadcasting Advisory Committee, which
has agreed that in some circumstances the
publication of certain categories of
information might endanger national
security. Details of these categories are
contained in Defence Advisory Notices (D
Notices) circulated to the media, whose
members are asked to seek advice from the
Secretary of the Committee, a retired senior
military officer, before publishing
information in these areas. Compliance with
any advice offered by the Secretary is
expected but there is no legal force behind it
and the final decision on whether to publish
rests with the editor, producer or publisher
concerned.
The Notices were published for the first
time in July 1993 to promote a better
understanding of the system and to
contribute to greater openness in
government.
Television and Radio
Broadcasting in Britain has traditionally been
based on the principle that it is a public
service accountable to the people through
Parliament. While retaining the essential
public service element, it now embraces the
principles of competition and choice.
Three public bodies have the main
459
BRITAIN 1994: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
responsibility for television and radio services
to which nearly everyone has access
throughout Britain:
• the BBC (British Broadcasting
Corporation) broadcasts television and
radio programmes;
• the ITC (Independent Television
Commission) licenses and regulates non-
BBC television services, including cable
and satellite services; and
• the Radio Authority licenses and
regulates all non-BBC radio services,
including cable and satellite.
These authorities work to broad
requirements and objectives defined by
Parliament, but are otherwise independent in
their day-to-day conduct of business.
The government department responsible
for overseeing the broadcasting system is the
Department of National Heritage. The
Secretary of State for National Heritage is
answerable to Parliament on broad policy
questions.
Television
There are four terrestrial television channels,
offering a mixture of drama, light
entertainment, films, sport, educational,
children’s and religious programmes, news
and current affairs, and documentaries.
The BBC provides two complementary
national networks—BBC 1 and BBC 2—which
are financed almost exclusively by licence fees.
The ITC regulates two television services:
ITV (Channel 3) and Channel 4, which are
expected to complement each other and are
largely funded by advertising. In Wales S4C
(Sianel Pedwar Cymru) broadcasts programmes
on the Welsh fourth channel. All four
channels broadcast on 625 lines UHF (ultra-
high frequency) and over 99 per cent of the
population live within range of transmission.
British television productions continue to
win many international awards, and in 1991
television companies received £132 million in
export earnings.
Radio
Practically every home has a radio, and the
widespread ownership of portable sets
(including personal stereos) and car radios
means that people can listen to radio
throughout the day. Almost half the
population listen to the radio on a normal day
and 76 per cent do so over the week.
Average listening time is around an hour and
a half a day.
The BBC has five national networks,
which transmit all types of music, news,
current affairs, drama, education, sport and
a range of features programmes. The
Radio Authority regulates two national
commercial radio stations; a third station is
planned.
There are 39 BBC local radio stations
serving England and the Channel Islands, and
regional and community radio services in
Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. Some
150 independent local radio (ILR) services
are also in operation. More local stations are
planned. Stations supply a comprehensive
service of local news and information, sport,
music and other entertainment, education and
consumer advice. ‘Phone-in’ programmes
allowing listeners to express their views on
air are popular. About 90 per cent of the
population can receive BBC or ILR stations.
Government Approach to Broadcasting
During the last few years broadcasting in
Britain has seen radical changes. The
availability of more radio frequencies,
together with satellite, cable and microwave
transmissions, has made a greater number of
local, national and international services
possible. Moreover, the technical quality
of sound and pictures is improving. In
response to rapidly developing technology
and rising public demand for a wide choice of
programmes and services, the Government
introduced the Broadcasting Act 1990 with
the aim of making the regulatory framework
for broadcasting more flexible and efficient
and giving viewers and listeners access to a
wider range of services. At the same time the
Act aimed to promote competition and to
maintain high standards of taste and decency.
The 1990 Act takes full account of the
need for programme quality and diversity,
regional links, widespread ownership of
460
THE MEDIA
broadcasting companies and proper
geographical coverage, and makes provision
for ‘sharply focused statutory safeguards’
backed by enforcement sanctions, including
financial penalties.
Changes Introduced by the Broadcasting Act
The Broadcasting Act 1990 overhauled the
regulation of independent television and radio
and opened the way for many more services.
In 1991 the IBA (Independent
Broadcasting Authority) was replaced by the
IFC (Independent Television Commission),
the Radio Authority and a new transmission
and engineering company, National
Transcommunications Limited (see below). At
the same time the Cable Authority was made
part of the ITC and the Radio Authority.
The ITC and the Radio Authority issue
licences to commercial broadcasters and
enforce rules to ensure diversity of
ownership:
• I he ITC awards major broadcasting
licences by competitive tender to the
highest bidders satisfying stipulated
quality tests.
• The Radio Authority awards national
radio licences by competitive tender to
the highest cash bidders. Local radio
licences are not allocated by competitive
tender; the success of licence applications
is in part determined by audience demand,
and the extent to which prospective
stations would increase variety.
The ITC does not have the former IBA’s
detailed involvement in scheduling but has
wider powers than the IBA to enforce licence
conditions and ownership rules. Both
organisations were initially able to take out
government loans, but are obliged to repay
these and to support themselves from licence
fees at the earliest possible date.
The 1990 Act made provision for setting
up a new national independent television
station, Channel 5, and three national
commercial radio stations (see p. 466).
Opportunities now also exist for launching
hundreds of independent local radio and
television channels.
The Broadcasting Act also provided for
the former IBA’s television and radio
transmission networks to be privatised. In
1991 the IBA networks and other facilities
were transferred to a new public company—
National Transcommunications Limited
(NTL). NTL was then sold for £70 million
to a company formed for the purpose by
Mercury Asset Management. NTL transmits
television services for the independent
television companies, Channel 4, S4C, and
radio services for about 50 independent local
radio stations.
Programming Obligations
The Government recognises the importance
of public service broadcasting. Hence:
• the 1990 Act made no change to the
BBC’s ‘cornerstone’ public service role of
. providing high-quality programming
throughout the full range of public tastes
and interests; the essential programming
remits of all BBC domestic services
remain unchanged.
• Channel 4—in addition to retaining
public service obligations—is, as before,
required to be innovative and distinctive,
and to cater for tastes and interests not
adequately met by ITV and its successor
Channel 3 (see p. 464). Three of the four
current terrestrial television channels
have, therefore, the same basic
programming obligations as before the
passage of the Act.
• Licence-holders of the independent
television Channel 3 (and the proposed
Channel 5) need to pass demanding
quality tests (see p. 465). ITC regulations
place a limit on the proportion of non-
European material broadcast.
• Since January 1993 both the BBC and
commercial television licensees have been
required to ensure that at least 25 per
cent of their original programming comes
from independent producers. The system
whereby major sporting occasions (‘listed
events’), such as the Grand National
steeplechase and the Olympic Games, are
made generally available to television
audiences on the main terrestrial channels
has been retained.
461
BRITAIN 1994: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Ownership Rules
The Broadcasting Act 1990 established
clearer and more extensive ownership rules.
These are designed to enable the ITC and
the Radio Authority to keep ownership of the
broadcasting media widely spread and to
prevent unhealthy concentrations and cross¬
media ownership. Controlling ownership
from outside the European Community is
largely prohibited, and national newspapers
are allowed relatively small stakes in direct
broadcasting by satellite (DBS) channels (see
p. 468), Channels 3 and 5, and national and
local radio. Public telecommunications
operators are not allowed to have controlling
interests in any Channel 3, Channel 5,
national radio or domestic satellite licence;
and political bodies and local authorities are
barred from holding licences.
Programme Standards
Recognising that broadcasting is an extremely
powerful medium with the potential to
offend, exploit and cause harm, the Act
contains guarantees on programme standards
which are extended to all British-based
broadcasters. These guarantees cover taste,
decency, accuracy and balance. Under the
1990 Act the Government can proscribe
unacceptable foreign satellite services
receivable in Britain. Anyone in Britain
supporting such a service can now be
prosecuted for a criminal offence. The Act
also gives the Broadcasting Standards Council
a key role (see p. 469).
The BBC
The constitution, finances and obligations of
the BBC are governed by a Royal Charter,
which expires in December 1996, and by a
Licence and Agreement. The Corporation’s
board of 12 governors, including the
chairman, vice-chairman and a national
governor each for Scotland, Wales and
Northern Ireland, is appointed by the Queen
on the advice of the Government. The board
of governors is ultimately responsible for all
aspects of broadcasting on the BBC. The
governors appoint the Director-General, the
Corporation’s chief executive officer, who
heads the board of management -the body
in charge of the daily running of the
services.
The BBC has a strong regional structure.
The three English regions—BBC North,
BBC Midlands & East and BBC South—and
the Scottish, Welsh and Northern Ireland
national regions, make programmes for their
local audiences as well as contributing to the
national network.
The National Broadcasting Councils for
Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland advise
on the policy and content of television and
radio programmes intended mainly for
reception in their areas. Local radio councils
representative of the local community advise
on the development and operation of the
BBC’s local radio stations.
Finance
The domestic services of the BBC are
financed almost wholly from the sale of
television licences. Households with a
television must buy an annual licence costing
£83 for colour and £27.50 for black and
white. Over 20.1 million licences were
current in June 1993; of these some 19.1
million were for colour. More than two-
thirds of expenditure on domestic services
relates to television.
Licence income is supplemented by
profits from trading activities, such as
television programme exports, sale of
recordings and publications connected with
BBC programmes, hire and sale of
educational films, film library sales, and
exhibitions based on programmes. BBC
World Service Radio is financed by a grant-
in-aid from the Foreign & Commonwealth
Office (£176 million in 1993-94), while BBC
World Service Television is self-funding.
In 1991 the BBC took over from the
Home Office responsibility for administering
the licence fee system. TVL, a subsidiary
company of the Post Office, undertakes the
licence administration on behalf of the BBC.
Since 1988 annual rises in the licence fee
have been linked to the rate of inflation; this
is intended further to improve the BBC’s
efficiency and encourage it to continue to
462
THE MEDIA
develop alternative sources of revenue. An
independent review to assess progress began
in June 1993. The longer-term future of the
TV licence fee will be considered as part of
the review of the BBC’s Royal Charter.
The Future of the BBC
A government discussion paper, The Future of
the BBC, was published in November 1992.
This sets out the framework for a debate on
the future of the BBC, covering all aspects of
its work and structure. At the same time the
BBC published a discussion document,
Extending Choice, on the future of the
organisation. This details areas in which the
BBC can make a special contribution in
extending choice for viewers and listeners.
BBC Television
The two channels, BBC1 and BBC 2, are
scheduled in a complementary way to cater
simultaneously for people of different
interests. Although both services cover the
whole range of television output:
• BBC 1 presents a wide range of
programmes, including news and current
affairs, major documentaries, sport,
popular drama and light entertainment,
and children’s programmes.
• BBC 2 presents music and the arts, new
talent, innovative documentaries, sport,
international films and serious drama, and
is a forum for debate.
Apart from a break during the Second
World War, the BBC has been
providing regular television broadcasts
since 1936. Together, BBC 1 and
BBC 2 transmit over 17,000 hours of
programmes a year for national and
regional audiences.
Programmes for both networks are
produced mainly in London; a third of all
programmes shown nationally are made in the
regions. Both the BBC and the commercial
television companies enter into agreements
with overseas television corporations in order
to make new programmes economically.
BBC Subscription Television Ltd
In 1990 the BBC set up a subsidiary to run
subscription-financed television services in
the night hours under the name BBC
SELECT. Broadcasting is between 2.00 and
6.00 hours on BBC1, when the BBC is off
the air. Programmes, transmitted in
scrambled form, are designed to be video-
recorded and watched at a time to suit the
individual viewer. Initially BBC SELECT
has been broadcasting professional, training
and educational services but consumer
interest services are also planned.
BBC Network Radio
BBC Network Radio serves an audience of
27 million in Britain, broadcasting around
35,000 hours of programmes each year on its
five networks:
• BBC Radio 1 broadcasts rock and pop
music 24 hours a day;.
• BBC Radio 2 (on FM only) transmits
popular music and light entertainment,
also for 24 hours a day;.
• BBC Radio 3 (also on FM only)
broadcasts mainly classical music, but
presents jazz, drama, poetry, short stories
and talks as well;.
• BBC Radio 4 is the main speech
network, providing the principal news
and current affairs service, together with
drama, comedy, documentaries and panel
games; it also carries parliamentary
coverage; and
• BBC Radio 5 (on medium wave only) is
dedicated chiefly to sport, education and
speech programmes for young people,
and a selection of programmes from the
World Service (see p. 470).
The BBC has announced plans for a
24-hour news and sport network from April
1994 to replace the existing Radio 5.
Independent Broadcasting
Independent Television Commission
Like the Radio Authority and S4C, the ITC’s
constitution and finances are governed by the
463
BRITAIN 1994: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Broadcasting Act 1990. The ITC is
responsible for licensing and regulating non-
BBC television services operating in or from
Britain. These include:
• ITV (Channel 3);
• Channel 4;
• the proposed Channel 5;
• cable and other local delivery
services;
• independent teletext services; and
• domestic and non-domestic satellite
services available to viewers in Britain.
Since January 1993, when the new
Channel 3 licences came into effect, the ITC
has ceased to broadcast programmes. These
responsibilities have now passed to the new
licensees (see p. 465). The ITC monitors the
licences and licence conditions but is not
involved in detailed scheduling of
programmes.
The ITC is advised by committees on
educational broadcasting, religious
broadcasting, charitable appeals and
advertising. Ten viewer consultative councils
also comment on the commercial services’
programmes.
ITV Programmes
The first regular ITV (independent
television) programmes began in London in
1955. ITV programmes are broadcast
24 hours a day throughout the country.
About one-third of the output comprises
informative programmes—news,
documentaries and coverage of current affairs,
education and religion. The remainder covers
sport, comedy, drama, games shows, films,
and a range of other programmes with
popular appeal. Over half the programmes
are produced by the programme companies
and ITN (Independent Television News—
see below).
ITV (Channel 3) Programme Companies
ITV is made up of 15 regionally based
television companies which are licensed to
supply programmes in the 14 independent
television geographical regions. Two
companies share the contract for London, one
providing programmes during weekdays and
the other at the weekend. An additional ITC
licensee provides a national breakfast-time
service, transmitted on the ITV network.
The licensees operate on a commercial
basis, deriving most of their revenue from
selling advertising time. The financial
resources, advertising revenue and
programme production of the companies vary
considerably, depending largely on the
population of the areas in which they operate.
Although newspapers may acquire an interest
in programme companies, safeguards exist to
ensure against concentration of media
ownership, thereby protecting the public
interest.
Each programme company plans the
content of the programmes to be broadcast in
its area. These are produced by the company
itself, or by other programme companies or
bought from elsewhere.
A common news service is provided 24
hours a day by ITN. ITN has been
appointed to supply a service of national and
international news to the ITV network for a
ten-year period from January 1993.
ITV Network Centre
The ITV Network Centre, which is wholly
owned by the ITV companies, independently
commissions and schedules those television
programmes which are shown across the ITV
network. Programmes are commissioned from
the ITV companies as well as from
independent producers. The Centre also
promotes the ITV network and co-ordinates
developments in technology and training.
Licences
The ITV licences for Channel 3, which came
up for renewal at the end of 1992, were
awarded by the ITC in October 1991.
Twelve existing franchise holders and four
new companies were awarded licences.
Channel 3 licences are awarded for a ten-
year period by competitive tender to the
highest bidder who has passed a quality
threshold. In exceptional cases a lower bid
464
THE MEDIA
can be selected, for instance, where an
applicant is able to offer a significantly better
quality of service than that offered by the
highest bidder.
There are safeguards for quality
programming. Licensees are required to
offer a diverse programme service, a
proportion of good-quality programmes, as
well as high-quality regional and national
news and current affairs programmes, and
children’s and religious programmes. There
is for the first time a statutory duty to
present programmes made in and about the
region. There is also a requirement for
district and regional programming to be
aimed at different areas within regions.
Channel 3 licensees are obliged to operate a
national programme network. Networking
arrangements are subject to government
approval so that anti-competitive practices
are avoided.
Channel 4 and S4C
Channel 4, which began broadcasting in
1982, provides a national television
service throughout Britain, except in
Wales, which has a corresponding service—
S4C (Sianel Pedwar Cymru). In January
1993 Channel 4 became a public
corporation, licensed and regulated by the
ITC, selling its own advertising time and
retaining the proceeds. It was previously a
public limited company owned by the ITC.
The service, including that in Wales, was
financed by annual subscriptions from the
former ITV programme companies in return
for advertising time in fourth channel
programmes shown in their own regions.
Channel 4’s remit is to provide
programmes with a distinctive character and
to appeal to tastes and interests not generally
catered for by Channel 3. It must present
a suitable proportion of educational
programmes and encourage innovation and
experiment. Channel 4 commissions
programmes from the ITV companies and
independent producers and buys
programmes from overseas. It broadcasts
for around 139 hours a week, about half of
which are devoted to informative
programmes.
In Wales programmes on the fourth
channel are run and controlled by S4C. Its
members are appointed by the Government.
S4C is required to see that a significant
proportion of programming, in practice 23
hours a week, is in the Welsh language and
that programmes broadcast between 18.30
and 22.00 hours are mainly in Welsh. At
other times S4C transmits national Channel 4
programmes.
Like Channel 4, S4C has sold its own
advertising since January 1993. S4C is
expected to cover only 10 per cent of its costs
from advertising, with the remainder financed
by the Government.
Gaelic TV Fund
The Gaelic Television Committee, appointed
by the ITC, was set up under the
Broadcasting Act 1990 to administer
government finance for making television
programmes in Gaelic. A fund of £9.5
million has been created and programmes
thus financed came on screen from January
1993. The Fund aims to increase the output
of Gaelic television programmes from 100 to
about 300 hours each year.
Channel 5
A new national terrestrial television channel—
Channel 5—was advertised in April 1992 and
was intended to come into operation in late
1994. The new channel was to be financed
through advertising, subscription or
sponsorship, or a combination of all three.
The ten-year licence was to be awarded by
competitive tender, with applicants having to
pass a quality threshold similar in scope to
that for Channel 3. The licensee would be
required to retune domestic electronic
equipment (for example, video recorders)
which might suffer interference from
Channel 5 transmission.
In December 1992 the ITC announced its
decision not to award a licence. It had
received only one bid and was not satisfied
that the applicant would be able to maintain
its proposed service throughout the period of
the licence. The ITC is reviewing the future
options for the Channel 5 licence.

BRITAIN 1994: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Local Television
The Broadcasting Act 1990 makes provision
for the further development of local television
services. Local delivery licences are awarded
by competitive tender and there is no quality
threshold. ITC licence-holders can supply
national and local television channels using
both cable and microwave transmission
systems. Services delivered could be aimed at
communities such as ethnic minorities.
The Radio Authority
Independent local radio (ILR) is based on
principles similar to those of ITV (see
p. 464). The programme companies operate
under licence to the Radio Authority and are
financed mainly by advertising revenue.
Licences for existing operators will expire
between 1994 and 1996.
The Radio Authority, which took over
responsibility for independent radio from the
IB A in 1991, is required to ensure that
licensed services, taken as a whole, are of a
high quality and offer a range of programmes
calculated to appeal to a variety of tastes and
interests. Powers to deter ‘pirate’ or illegal
broadcasters have been strengthened.
The Authority awards national radio
licences by competitive tender to the highest
cash bidder. The licence for the first
independent national radio service (INR1)
was awarded to Classic FM in 1991. The new
station, which broadcasts mainly popular
classical music, together with news and
information, began operating in September
1992. The licence for the second independent
national service (INR2) was awarded in 1992
to Virgin 1215. This station began
broadcasting in April 1993, playing broad-
based rock music. The third national service
(INR3), which must be speech-based, is to be
advertised in late 1993.
In the course of the 1990s more local radio
stations will come on the air, some of which
could be neighbourhood and ‘community of
interest’ stations. Areas to be covered will
initially be those not at present adequately
served by independent local radio. Local radio
licences are not allocated by competitive
tender; the success of licence applications is
in part determined by the extent to which
applicants meet the needs and interests of
the people living in the area and whether
they have the necessary financial resources
to sustain programme plans for the eight-
year licence period.
Some of the locations have been selected
with small-scale ‘community radio’ in mind.
As part of its brief to develop a wide range
of radio services, the Authority aims to
establish a number of more specialist
stations.
The Radio Authority also issues restricted
service licences. These are issued on demand
(subject to certain conditions and frequency
availability), usually for a maximum of 28
days. They enable local events—such as
sports events, arts festivals and
conferences—to be covered by a temporary
radio service in a limited area, for example,
part of a city or town or an arena.
Teletext
The BBC and independent television each
operate a teletext service, offering constantly
updated information on a variety of subjects,
including news, sport, travel, weather
conditions and entertainment. The teletext
system allows the television signal to carry
additional information which can be selected
and displayed as ‘pages’ of text and graphics
on receivers equipped with the necessary
decoders. Both the BBC and Channels 3
and 4 have a subtitling facility for certain
programmes for people with hearing
difficulties. These services are available
whenever the transmitters are on the air.
Nearly 40 per cent of households in Britain
have teletext sets and over 7 million people
turn to the service daily—more than the
circulation figures for daily newspapers.
Licences
The Broadcasting Act 1990 introduced a
new regulatory system for licensing spare
capacity within the television signal. This
allows more varied use of spare capacity—
data transfer, for instance—but the position
of teletext and subtitling on commercial
television is safeguarded.
466
THE MEDIA
At the end of 1991 the ITC advertised
three teletext licences—a single public service
licence for teletext on Channels 3 and 4 (and
S4C) and two separate licences for
commercial additional services to subscription
or closed user groups, using three lines of
spare capacity on each channel. These ten-
year licences are awarded by competitive
tender, with applicants having to satisfy
certain statutory requirements before their
cash bid can be considered. The ITC
awarded the main teletext licence to UK
Teletext Ltd, which replaced Oracle in
January 1993, and awarded one of the
commercial additional service licences on
Channel 3 to the only bidder, Data
Broadcasting International. The other
commercial additional service licence on
Channel 4 remains unallocated.
Channel 3 is obliged to offer a
subtitling service for at least 50 per
cent of its programmes by 1998, with
further increases after that.
Cable Services
Cable services are delivered to consumers
through underground cables and are paid for
by subscription. These responsibilities are
now carried out by the Cable and Satellite
Division of the ITC and by the Radio
Authority, which issues cable radio licences.
‘Broadband cable’, the cable systems
currently being designed and built, can carry
between 30 and 45 television channels,
including terrestrial broadcasts, satellite
television, and channels delivered by
videotape. Cable systems usually carry a local
channel. Interactive services such as home
shopping, home banking, security and alarm
services, electronic mail and remote meter
readings are also possible. Franchises have
already been granted covering areas which
include two-thirds of all homes and nearly all
urban areas in Britain—around 14.5 million
households in total. In April 1993, 58
broadband cable franchises were in operation
in Britain, seven of which had been set up
within the past year. Regulation is as light as
possible to encourage the development of a
wide range of services, and flexible enough
to adapt to new technology. The ITC is
continuing the Cable Authority’s practice of
awarding only one broadband cable
franchise in each area so that the new
franchisee is protected from direct
competition in the early stages. At present
over 2 million homes are able to receive
broadband cable services and there are
almost 500,000 subscribers.
Licences are granted on a non¬
competitive basis to programme services
which are likely to meet consumer
protection standards and are run by suitably
qualified people. ITC licences are required
for systems capable of serving more than
1,000 homes. Systems extending beyond a
single building and up to 1,000 homes
require only an individual licence from
OFTEL (see p. 264). Cable investment
must be privately financed.
Direct Broadcasting by Satellite
Direct broadcasting by satellite (DBS), by
which television is transmitted directly by
satellite into people’s homes, has been
available throughout Britain since 1989. The
signals from satellite broadcasting are
received through specially designed aerials
or ‘dishes’.
Several British-based satellite television
channels have been set up to supply
programmes to cable operators and viewers
with dishes in Britain and, in some cases,
throughout Europe. While some offer
general entertainment, others concentrate on
specific areas of interest, such as sport,
music and children’s programmes.
The largest satellite programmer is
BSkyB (British Sky Broadcasting), which
provides 15 channels devoted to light
entertainment, news, feature films, sport
and home shopping transmitted from the
Astra satellite.
Other satellite channels available to
British viewers include Eurosport (sport),
CNN (news), MTV (pop videos), and TV
Asia (for Asian viewers). The choice
available to viewers is expanding steadily.
In November 1992 BBC Enterprises and
Thames TV (one of the former ITV
467
BRITAIN 1994: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
franchisees) launched a joint entertainment
satellite channel—UK Gold—on the Astra
satellite. Programmes include drama, soaps,
comedy, children’s television and quizzes.
Educational Broadcasting
Both the BBC and Channel 4 broadcast
educational programmes for schools and
continuing education programmes for
adults. Broadcasts to schools deal with most
subjects of the National Curriculum (see
p. 408), while programmes for adults cover
many areas of learning and vocational
training. Books, pamphlets, filmstrips,
computer software, and audio and video
cassettes, are produced to supplement the
programmes. Around 90 per cent of primary
schools and 93 per cent of secondary
schools in Britain use schools television.
The ITC has a duty to ensure that schools
programmes are presented on independent
television.
The BBC broadcasts around three hours
of radio and 22 hours of television each week
on behalf of the Open University (see
p. 417).
Advertising and Sponsorship
The BBC must have the consent of the
Secretary of State for National Heritage
before broadcasting any commercial
advertisement. It may not broadcast any
sponsored programme. The policy of the
BBC is to avoid giving publicity to any firm
or organised interest except when this is
necessary in providing effective and
informative programmes. It does, however,
cover sponsored sporting and artistic events.
Advertising and sponsorship are allowed
on independent television and radio subject
to controls. The ITC and the Radio
Authority operate codes of advertising
standards and programme sponsorship.
Advertisements on independent television
and radio are broadcast between programmes
as well as in breaks during programmes.
Advertisers are not allowed directly to
influence the content of programmes.
Advertisements must be distinct and separate
from programmes. The time given to them
must not be so great as to detract from the
value of the programmes as a medium of
information, education or entertainment.
Television advertising is limited to an average
of seven minutes an hour during the day and
seven and a half minutes in the peak evening
viewing period. Advertising is prohibited in
religious services and in broadcasts to
schools. Teletext UK Ltd (see p. 467)
carries advertisements.
The ITC and the Radio Authority’s codes
governing standards and practice in
advertising give guidance on the forms of
advertisement which are prohibited.
Prohibited advertising includes
political advertising, advertisements
for betting and for cigarettes and
cigarette tobacco, and—on television
only—for cigars and pipe tobacco.
(Advertisements for the last two are
permitted on radio.)
The Radio Authority and, since January
1993, ITV and Channel 4 are permitted to
screen religious advertisements, provided they
comply with the guidelines issued by the ITC
and the Radio Authority.
Both the ITC and the Radio Authority
can impose severe penalties on any television
or radio company failing to comply with
their codes. The Broadcasting Standards
Council’s code of practice (see p. 469)
covers advertisements.
Sponsorship in Independent Broadcasting
In Britain sponsorship is a relatively new way
of helping to finance commercial
broadcasting, although the practice has long
been established in other countries. In return
for their financial contribution, sponsors
receive a credit associating them with a
particular programme.
The ITC’s Code of Programme
Sponsorship and the Radio Authority’s
Advertising and Sponsorship Code aim to
ensure that sponsors do not exert undue
influence on the editorial content of
programmes and that sponsorships are made
clear to viewers. News and current affairs
programmes may not be sponsored. Potential
468
THE MEDIA
sponsors for other categories of programme
may be debarred if their involvement could
constrain in any way the editorial
independence of the programme maker.
References to sponsors or their products must
be confined to the beginning and end of a
programme and around commercial breaks;
they must not appear in the programme itself.
All commercial radio programmes other than
news bulletins may be sponsored.
Government Publicity
Government publicity material to support
non-political campaigns may be broadcast on
independent television and radio. This is paid
for on a normal commercial basis. Short
public service items, concerning health, safety
and welfare, are produced by the Central
Office of Information for free transmission by
the BBC and independent television and
radio.
British Satellite News is an international
satellite news service produced for the
Foreign & Commonwealth Office by a private
sector company, WTN (see p. 471). The
service, under the editorial control of the
Foreign & Commonwealth Office, transmits
programmes five days a week. These are
distributed, mainly by satellite, free to
television stations throughout Eastern Europe,
the Middle East and Southern Africa for use
in news bulletins.
Broadcasting Standards
The independence enjoyed by the
broadcasting authorities carries with it certain
obligations over programme content.
Programmes must display, as far as possible,
a proper balance and wide range of subject
matter, impartiality in matters of controversy
and accuracy in news coverage, and must not
offend against good taste. Broadcasters
must also comply with legislation relating
to obscenity and incitement to racial hatred.
The BBC, the ITC and the Radio
Authority apply codes providing guidance
on violence and standards of taste and
decency in television programmes,
particularly during hours when children are
likely to be viewing.
Broadcasting Standards Council
The Broadcasting Standards Council (BSC)
was set up by the Government in 1988 to act
as a focus for public concern about the
portrayal of violence and sex, and about
standards of taste and decency. Its remit
covers television and radio programmes and
broadcast advertisements and includes
monitoring programmes broadcast into
Britain from abroad.
Under the Broadcasting Act 1990 the
Council was granted statutory powers
requiring the codes of practice of the BBC
and other broadcasting regulatory bodies to
reflect the BSC’s own code. The BSC
monitors programmes, examines complaints
from the public and undertakes research. In
1992-93 the Council received 2,023
complaints, of which 1,355 fell within its
remit. It has already published the results of
several public attitude surveys.
Broadcasting Complaints Commission
The Broadcasting Complaints Commission,
an independent statutory body, deals with
complaints of unfair treatment in broadcast
programmes and of unwarranted infringement
of privacy in programmes or in their
preparation. In 1992-93 it received 928
complaints, 115 of which fell within its
jurisdiction. Details of complaints made and
decisions reached are published annually.
Parliamentary and Political
Broadcasting
The proceedings of both Houses of
Parliament may be broadcast on television
and radio, either live, or more usually in
recorded and edited form on news and
current affairs programmes.
The BBC and the commercial services
provide time on radio and television for an
annual series of party political broadcasts.
Party election broadcasts are arranged
following the announcement of a general
election. In addition, the Government may
make ministerial broadcasts on radio and
television, with opposition parties also being
allotted broadcast time.
469
BRITAIN 1994: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Audience Research
Both the BBC and the independent sector are
required to keep themselves informed on the
state of public opinion about the programmes
and advertising that they broadcast. This is
done through the continuous measurement of
the size and composition of audiences and
their opinions of programmes. For television,
this work is undertaken through BARB (the
Broadcasters’ Audience Research Board),
owned jointly by the BBC and the ITV
Network Centre. For radio, joint research is
undertaken for BBC radio and for commercial
radio by RAJAR (Radio Joint Audience
Research).
Both the BBC and the independent sector
conduct regular surveys of audience opinion
on television and radio services. Public
opinion is further assessed by the BBC and
ITC through the work of their advisory
committees, councils and panels. Regular
public meetings are also held to debate
services, and consideration is given to letters
and telephone calls from listeners and
viewers.
Training
The BBC provides some non-fmancial
technical assistance, particularly in training
the staff of overseas broadcasting
organisations. The Government finances
overseas students on broadcasting training
courses at the BBC, the British Council and
the Thomson Foundation; the Foundation
also conducts courses overseas in broadcast
journalism, media management, radio and
television production, and technology.
INTERNATIONAL SERVICES
BBC World Service Radio
The BBC World Service broadcasts by radio
worldwide, using English and 39 other
languages. Output amounts to 873 hours
weekly of direct language transmissions. The
main objectives are to give unbiased news,
reflect British opinion and project British life,
culture and developments in science and
industry. News bulletins, current affairs
programmes, political commentaries and
topical magazine programmes form the
main part of the output. These are
supplemented by a sports service, music,
drama and general entertainment. Regular
listeners are estimated to number 124
million.
The languages in which the World
Service broadcasts and the number of hours
devoted to each are prescribed by the
Government. Otherwise the BBC has full
responsibility and is completely independent
in determining the content of news and
other programmes.
The BBC World Service broadcasts
by radio for 24 hours a day in
English, supplemented at peak
listening times by programmes of
special interest to Africa, East Asia,
South Asia, Europe, the Caribbean
and the Falkland Islands.
BBC World Service news bulletins and
other programmes are re-broadcast by some
630 radio and cable stations in over 90
countries, which receive the programmes by
satellite. Two World Service departments
also specialise in supplying radio material
for re-broadcast. BBC Transcription sells
BBC radio programmes to overseas
broadcasters in over 100 countries, while
BBC Topical Tapes airmails some 250 tapes
of original programmes to subscribers in
over 50 countries each week.
BBC English is the largest language¬
teaching venture in the world. Lessons are
broadcast daily by radio with explanations
in some 30 languages, including English,
and re-broadcast by many radio stations.
BBC English television programmes are also
shown in more than 90 countries. A range
of printed, audio and video material
accompanies these programmes.
Another part of the World Service,
BBC Monitoring, listens to and reports on
foreign broadcasts, providing a daily flow
of significant news and comment from
overseas to the BBC and the Government.
This information is also sold to the press,
businesses, academic staff and public
bodies.
470
THE MEDIA
BBC World Service Television
BBC World Service Television was set up in
1991 to establish a worldwide television
service. The company is a wholly self-funding
subsidiary of the BBC and receives no
revenue from either the TV licence fees or
from the Government. The company at
present provides services to three continents:
• a subscription channel in Europe, based
on a mixture of BBC 1 and BBC 2
programmes, news bulletins, and weather
and business reports. Viewers receive the
service by cable or direct to their homes,
using special decoders.
• a 24-hour news and information channel
available throughout Asia. Funded by
advertising, the service is one of the
channels offered throughout Asia by the
commercial company STAR TV. The
channel is compiled by the BBC and
transmitted by satellite to Hong Kong,
where advertising is added by STAR TV
before distribution.
• a news and information channel shown
throughout Africa, launched in April
1992. The service is available to viewers
who have the appropriate satellite
reception equipment and in countries
where national broadcasters make the
service part of their regular output.
COI Overseas Radio and Television
Services
The Central Office of Information (COI),
which provides publicity material and other
information services on behalf of government
departments and other public agencies,
produces radio programmes for overseas.
Recorded material is sent to radio stations all
over the world. COI television services also
make available material such as documentary
and magazine programmes.
News Agencies
Reuters Television, the largest international
television news agency in the world, supplies
news pictures to over 200 broadcasters and
their networks in 84 countries. Reuters
Television is a wholly-owned subsidiary of
Reuters (see p. 455) and uses 120 Reuters
bureaux and a global satellite network to
gather and distribute its material.
WTN (Worldwide Television News),
owned by ITN, ABC (the American
Broadcasting Corporation), and Channel 9 in
Australia, supplies news and a wide range of
television services to some 1,000 broadcasters
in 93 countries, as well as to governments
and international corporations.
Both agencies provide services through
the Eurovision network (see below) and by
satellite.
International Relations
European Agreements
In 1991 Britain implemented two important
European agreements on cross-border
broadcasting: the European Community
Directive on Broadcasting and the Council of
Europe Convention on Transfrontier
Television. Under these, countries have to
remove restrictions on the retransmission of
programmes originating from other
participating countries. They must also
ensure that their own broadcasters observe
certain minimum standards on advertising,
sponsorship, taste and decency, and the
portrayal of sex and violence on television.
European Broadcasting Union
The BBC and the Radio Authority are
members of the European Broadcasting
Union, which manages Eurovision, the
international network of television news and
programme exchange. The Union is
responsible for co-ordinating the exchange of
programmes and news over the Eurovision
network and intercontinental satellite links.
It also maintains a technical monitoring
station where frequency measurements and
other observations on broadcasting stations
are carried out. The Union provides a forum
linking the major public services and
national broadcasters of Western Europe
and other parts of the world, and
co-ordinates joint operations in radio and
television.
471
BRITAIN 1994: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
International Telecommunications Union
The BBC takes part in the work of the
International Telecommunications Union, the
United Nations agency responsible for
regulating and controlling all international
telecommunications services, including radio
and television. The Union also allocates and
registers all radio frequencies, and promotes
and co-ordinates the international study of
technical problems in broadcasting.
Other International Bodies
The BBC is an associate member of the Asia-
Pacific Broadcasting Union and also belongs
to the Commonwealth Broadcasting
Association, which meets every two years to
discuss public service broadcasting issues.
TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS
One of the most important recent
developments in television has been in news
coverage, where compact electronic cameras
have replaced film cameras, eliminating the
need for film processing and enabling pictures
to be transmitted directly to a studio.
Other recent advances in television
broadcasting include:
• adoption of digital video tape recorders;
• increasing use of computer-aided digital
equipment for picture generation and
manipulation;
• use of portable satellite links to transmit
pictures from remote locations to studios;
and
• the introduction of stereo sound on the
NICAM 728 digital system, developed by
the BBC.
Both the BBC and the independent sector
are developing further digital techniques for
studio applications and inter-studio links; in
early 1993 such digital links began operating
in the independent sector.
The BBC and the IBA co-operated in the
development of teletext, and teletext sets in
some 30 countries are based on the British
system.
In satellite broadcasting, the MAC
transmission format was developed by IBA
engineers, who went on to devise
refinements for the MAC system compatible
with widescreen television.
Both the BBC and the ITC are
undertaking projects in a number of
important areas of long-term research. These
include:
• the development of a 1,250-line
wide-screen high definition television
(HDTV);
• enhancements to the PAL colour
television system;
• digital terrestrial television
broadcasting;
• data transmission studies; and
• digital audio broadcasting.

A to Z of Popular Sports 484
There is widespread participation in sport in Britain, with the most popular
activities ranging from swimming to snooker. Internationally British
sportsmen and women compete in some 70 different sports, many of which
were invented by the British, and Britain currently has more than 80 world
champions in over 30 sports.
INTRODUCTION
Many sports attract large crowds for the
major sporting events throughout the year,
including the FA (Football Association)
Challenge Cup Final, the Wimbledon lawn
tennis championships and the Open Golf
Championship. An even greater number of
people watch these events on television, with
many sports receiving extensive television
coverage. The sports attracting the largest
television audiences include football, athletics,
snooker and boxing. Following the
introduction of direct broadcasting by satellite
(DBS) and the greater availability of cable,
the amount of televised coverage has
increased substantially. Important sporting
occasions (‘listed events’), such as the
Olympic Games, may not be shown
exclusively by DBS or cable and must be
made generally available to television viewers.
As well as being a popular pastime, sport
is a major industry in Britain. In addition to
the professional sportsmen and women, over
450,000 are employed in the provision of
sports clothing, publicity, ground and club
maintenance and other activities connected
with sport. In total an estimated £9,750
million is spent on sport annually in
Britain.
PARTICIPATION
Participation in sport continues to rise, due
mainly to an increase in leisure time and an
improvement in facilities. A growing
awareness of the importance of regular
exercise for good health has contributed to
an upsurge of interest in keep fit and other
forms of aerobic exercise.
It has been estimated that 29 million
people over the age of 16 regularly take part
in sport or exercise. The 1990 General
Household Survey found that almost two-
thirds of those interviewed had taken part
in at least one sporting activity during the
four weeks before interview and that men
were more likely than women to have
participated in sport. The most popular
participation sports are walking (including
rambling and hiking), swimming,
snooker/pool, keep fit/yoga and cycling.
473
BRITAIN 1994: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Women and Sport
A major effort was made in the 1980s to
narrow the gap between men’s and women’s
participation in sport and active recreation.
This effort resulted in an increase of about 1
million in the number of women taking part
in sport between 1987 and 1990. The
numbers participating in ‘physical contact’
sports, such as football and rugby, are also
increasing, and more women now play
traditionally male-dominated sports, such as
snooker and billiards. Sports and physical
activities particularly favoured by women
include swimming, keep fit and aerobics.
During the 1990s emphasis has switched to
encouraging women to adopt leadership roles,
such as coaches, officials and administrators.
Projects to promote coaching opportunities
have been established by the Sports Councils
(see p. 475) in partnership with the National
Coaching Foundation (see p. 477) and the
Women’s Sports Foundation (WSF).
Women's Sports Foundation
The WSF is a voluntary organisation, which
aims to represent the views of the many
women involved in sport. With Sports
Council funding, the WSF promotes the
establishment of women and sports groups
throughout Britain and co-operates with
sports and education organisations. In 1986 it
initiated the Sportswomen of the Year
Awards and in 1992 it launched a new
nationwide awards scheme for girls and young
women between the ages of 11 and 19.
Ethnic Minorities
The Sports Council is encouraging local
authorities to become more sensitive to the
needs of minority groups in their
communities. For example, in Yorkshire a
network of contacts has been created within
the black communities to involve ethnic
minorities in cricket. This has increased the
number of black cricket coaches and the
numbers of young black people taking part in
the game. The project is now being extended
to other sports.
Many sports, such as athletics, boxing,
football, rugby union and rugby league, have
already been successful in attracting large
numbers of participants from the ethnic
minorities.
Young People
Special programmes of activity for young
people are run by the governing bodies of
individual sports, and the four Sports
Councils organise local and national initiatives
to encourage more young people to take part
in sport. In March 1993 the Sports Council
launched a new policy document—Young
People and Sport—which sets out a number of
objectives to ensure a co-ordinated
development of sport for young people.
Government’s Objectives
The Government’s priorities for sport were
outlined in December 1991 in a policy
statement—Sport and Active Recreation. The
Government’s primary objectives are to:
• promote physical exercise and
participation in sport and active
recreation;
• help participants in sport achieve higher
standards of performance;
• promote partnerships with the private
sector in the provision and management
of sports facilities (see p. 475); and
• promote sport for people with disabilities
(see p. 480).
ORGANISATION AND
ADMINISTRATION
Responsibility for government policy on sport
and active recreation in England has rested
with the Secretary of State for National
Heritage since the creation of the Department
of National Heritage in April 1992. The
Secretaries of State for Wales, Scotland and
Northern Ireland are responsible for sport in
their countries. In Northern Ireland the
Department of Education makes direct grants
towards the capital cost of facilities to local
authorities and voluntary sports bodies.
Responsibility for the organisation and
promotion of sport is largely decentralised,
and many sport and recreation facilities are
474
SPORT AND ACTIVE RECREATION
provided by local authorities. The main
mechanism by which the Government
directly channels financial assistance to sport
is through the Sports Councils. This ‘arm’s
length’ principle of funding safeguards the
long-established independence of sports
organisations in Britain.
Sports Councils
The Sports Councils, appointed and directly
funded by the Government, are the
Government’s principal advisers on sporting
matters. The Government works closely with
them in implementing its sports policies.
There are four Councils:
• the Sports Council—for general matters
affecting Great Britain and specifically
English matters;
• the Sports Council for Wales;
• the Scottish Sports Council; and
• the Sports Council for Northern Ireland.
The Councils make grants for sports
development, coaching and administration to
the governing bodies of sports and other
national organisations, and administer the
National Sports Centres (see p. 478). Grants
and loans are also made to voluntary
organisations, local authorities and
commercial organisations to help them
provide sports facilities. In 1993-94 the
Councils are allocating government funds
amounting to approximately £67 million.
Support for Facilities
Facilities receiving support from the Sports
Councils include sports halls, indoor
swimming pools, intensive-use pitches, indoor
tennis halls and school facilities.
One of the Sports Council’s most
significant schemes is the Indoor Tennis
Initiative, which aims to establish a network
of 50 local indoor tennis centres, through
grant-aid of up to one-third of capital costs.
Twenty-one centres have already been
developed in England.
A Sports Council grant of £3 million
contributed towards the costs of building the
National Indoor Arena in Birmingham, which
was formally opened in autumn 1991. In 1993
the arena staged the World Badminton
Championships and in 1995 the World
Netball Championships will be held there.
The Council has agreed to provide
£1.5 million towards the development of a
National Hockey Stadium at Milton Keynes.
The Scottish Sports Council contributed
£150,000 towards Scotland’s first specialist
equestrian centre, which was established in
1992 at Devon Park, Central Region.
Development of Sport
Strategies for the development of sport have
been drawn up by the four Sports Councils.
The aims are broadly to ensure that:
• all young people have the opportunity to
acquire basic sports skills;
• everyone has the opportunity to take part
in sport and active recreation of their
choice;
• everyone with the interest and ability has
the opportunity to improve their
standard of performance in sport and
fulfil their potential; and
• everyone with the interest and ability has
the opportunity to reach the highest
standards of sporting excellence.
Much of the Sports Councils’ budget is
directed at increasing participation by the
general public. The Councils are
concentrating in particular on raising
participation rates among the young, inner city
dwellers and people with disabilities (see p. 480).
In May 1993 the Sports Council launched
a new document—Sports in the Nineties: New
Horizons—which sets out its vision for sport
for the next five years.
A national strategic approach for Scottish
sport was recently set out by the Scottish
Sports Council. Sport 2000 aims to introduce
250,000 people to sport by the end of the
decade.
Local Authorities
Local authorities are the main providers of
basic sport and recreation facilities for the
local community. In England local authorities
manage over 1,500 indoor centres, largely
built in the last 20 years, as well as numerous
475
BRITAIN 1994: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
outdoor amenities. The facilities provided
include parks, lakes, playing fields, sports
halls, tennis courts, golf courses, swimming
pools, gymnasiums and sports centres
catering for a wide range of activities.
There has been a rapid growth in the
provision of artificial pitches—largely for
hockey—and a similar increase in the number
of leisure pools, which offer wave machines,
waterfalls, jacuzzis and other leisure
equipment. Gross annual expenditure by local
authorities on sport and recreation amounts
to over £1,000 million in England alone.
National Sports Associations
The Central Council of Physical Recreation
(CCPR) is a non-governmental voluntary
association in England whose membership
consists of governing bodies of sport and
other organisations with an interest in sport
and physical recreation. Similar bodies in
Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland are the
Scottish Sports Association, the Welsh Sports
Association and the Northern Ireland Council
of Physical Recreation (NICPR). The
primary aim of these bodies is to represent
the interests of their members to the
appropriate national and local authorities,
including the Sports Councils, from which
they receive funding. Award schemes run by
the associations include the CCPR’s
Community Sports Leaders Award Scheme
and the NICPR’s Service to Sport Awards.
The largest of the four associations is the
CCPR, which comprises 200 British bodies
and over 60 English associations. In recent
years the CCPR has set up a number of
sports bodies, including the Institute of
Sports Sponsorship (ISS), which comprises
some 80 major British companies that
sponsor sport. The ISS aims to develop
sponsorship at local, national and
international level.
British Sports Forum
The sports associations of Wales, Scotland
and Northern Ireland, the CCPR and the
British Olympic Association have recently
come together in the British Sports Forum.
The purpose of this body is to present the
united voice of the non-governmental sports
sector, both domestically and internationally.
Sports Governing Bodies
Individual sports are run by over 400
independent governing bodies, whose
functions usually include drawing up rules,
holding events, regulating membership,
selecting and training national teams and
promoting international links. There are also
organisations representing people who take
part in more informal physical recreation,
such as walking and cycling. The majority of
the sports clubs in Britain belong to the
appropriate governing body.
Sports Clubs
A wide variety of recreational facilities are
provided by local sports clubs. Some cater for
indoor recreation, but more common are
those providing sports grounds, particularly
for cricket, football, rugby, hockey, tennis
and golf. There are approximately 150,000
sports clubs in Britain, with about 6.5 million
members. Many clubs linked to business
firms cater for sporting activities. Commercial
facilities include tenpin bowling centres, ice
and roller-skating rinks, squash courts, golf
courses and driving ranges, riding stables,
marinas and, increasingly, fitness centres. In
all, the private sector owns and runs some
500 major sports facilities.
Countryside Bodies
The Countryside Commission (for England),
the Countryside Council for Wales and
Scottish Natural Heritage are responsible for
conserving and improving the natural beauty
and amenity of the countryside, and for
encouraging the provision of facilities for open-
air recreation. The three bodies assist in the
provision or improvement of recreational parks,
country parks and picnic sites and the opening
up of rights of way and National Trails.
In Northern Ireland the Ulster
Countryside Committee advises the
Department of the Environment on the
preservation of amenities and the designation
of ‘areas of outstanding natural beauty’.
476
SPORT AND ACTIVE RECREATION
British Waterways Board
The British Waterways Board is a publicly
owned body responsible for managing and
developing much of Great Britain’s inland
waterways. Many leisure and recreational
pursuits, such as angling and various types of
sailing and boating, are enjoyed on waterways
and reservoirs. The Board, which is
responsible for approximately 2,000 miles
(3,220 km) of canals and water navigations,
actively promotes water safety and organises
community activities.
National Coaching Foundation
The National Coaching Foundation (NCF)
aims to provide educational and advisory
services for coaches in all sports. The
Foundation works in partnership with the
Sports Councils, and its work complements
and supports the coaching development
carried out by sports governing bodies.
Sixteen national coaching centres provide
locally accessible services in coach education,
information and advice as well as research
and consultancy.
In 1991-92 the Sports Council provided a
grant of £700,000 to the NCF to enable it to
set up Champion Coaching, a pilot after¬
school coaching scheme for those aged 11 to
14. Following a £1.3 million grant from the
Foundation for Sport and the Arts, the pilot
scheme has been developed into a three-year
programme which will involve about 40,000
children and some 4,000 coaches.
British Olympic Association
The British Olympic Association (BOA) is
the National Olympic Committee for Britain
and comprises representatives of the 31
governing bodies of those sports in the
programme of the Olympic Games (summer
and winter). Its primary function is to
organise the participation of British teams in
the Olympic Games, but it is also
responsible for nominating British cities for
staging the Olympics.
The BOA determines the size of British
Olympic teams and sets standards for
selection, raises funds and makes all necessary
arrangements. It also makes important
contributions in the fields of coaching, drug
testing and control, and sports medicine. The
Association’s British Olympic Medical Centre
at Northwick Park Hospital in north London
supplies a medical back-up service for
competitors before and during the Olympic
Games.
The BOA is supported by sponsorship and
by donations from commerce and industry
and from the public.
National Playing Fields Association
The National Playing Fields Association is a
charity whose purpose is to promote the
provision of recreation and play facilities for
all age groups. It aims to ensure that there
are adequate playing fields and playspace
available for use by the community. There
are affiliated associations in the English and
Welsh counties and independent organisations
in Scotland and Northern Ireland.
The Government has awarded a grant of
£500,000 to the Sports Council, in
conjunction with the National Playing Fields
Association and the CCPR, to compile a
register of recreational land in England as
part of a strategy to safeguard playing fields.
Sports Medicine and Sports Science
Sports medicine and sports science are
increasingly being acknowledged as important
areas for assisting the improvement of
performance and the achievement of
excellence. In order to provide a more co¬
ordinated service to sportsmen and women,
the Sports Council has established a National
Sports Medicine Institute, based at St
Bartholomew’s Hospital, London.
The Institute’s main function is to provide
clinical services aimed at assessing and
improving fitness, and treating and
preventing medical disorders related to sport.
Work is in progress to develop a network of
regional centres to provide both clinical and
educational services, which will be linked
with new support services at the National
Sports Centres. The Sports Council is
allocating £500,000 towards sports medicine
in 1993-94. In Scotland a network of some
477
BRITAIN 1994: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
30 sports medicine centres has been created.
The development of sports science support
services for the national governing bodies of
sport is currently being promoted by the
Sports Council, in collaboration with the
BOA and the NCF, in order to raise the
standards of performance of national squads.
In 1993-94 the Sports Council is contributing
j£550,000 in support of science studies. The
Sports Council for Wales received £250,000
from the Welsh Office in 1992-93 to establish
a sports science unit in Wales.
Olympic Bid by Manchester
Manchester’s bid to stage the 2000 Olympic
Games failed to win sufficient support from
the International Olympic Committee (IOC),
which announced in September 1993 that the
Games would be held in Sydney.
However, the construction in east
Manchester of two major new facilities which
would have been used for the Games will still
be completed. These comprise an indoor
arena, which will be used for a wide range of
sports, including boxing, football, ice skating
and ice hockey, and Britain’s first indoor
velodrome. When completed in 1994, the
velodrome will become Britain’s National
Cycling Centre. Construction of these
facilities has been assisted by government
grants of £35 million towards the arena and
£8 million towards the velodrome.
NATIONAL SPORTS CENTRES
The four Sports Councils operate a total of
12 National Sports Centres, which provide
world-class facilities for training and
competition at the highest level. First priority
at the Centres is given to the governing
bodies of sport for national squad training
and for the training of coaches. However, the
Centres also make their facilities available to
top sportsmen and women for individual
training and to the local community. All of
the Centres provide residential facilities.
England
In England the Sports Council operates four
major National Centres and a minor
National Centre for climbers at Harrison’s
Rocks in Kent.
Crystal Palace
Crystal Palace in London is a leading
competition venue for a wide range of sports
and a major training centre for national
squads, clubs, schools and serious enthusiasts.
Its facilities are used by some 22 separate
governing bodies of sport, and the Centre is a
regional centre of excellence for athletics,
netball, weightlifting and swimming. Crystal
Palace stadium is Britain’s major international
athletics venue, with a capacity for 17,000
spectators. Other facilities include an
Olympic-size swimming pool and a Sports
Injury Centre.
Bisham Abbey
Bisham Abbey in Berkshire caters for a
number of sports, including tennis, football,
hockey, weightlifting, squash, rugby and golf.
The England football, rugby and hockey
squads undergo regular preparation work at
the Centre. Bisham Abbey has long-standing
partnerships with the British Amateur
Weightlifters Association and the Lawn
Tennis Association, which has helped to
develop the Abbey as the National Tennis
Training Centre.
Lilleshall
Lilleshall National Sports Centre in
Shropshire offers extensive sports facilities,
which are used by a variety of national teams.
Facilities include a world-class gymnastic
training centre, regularly used by the British
gymnastic squads, and extensive playing
fields for football and hockey. The Football
Association uses Lilleshall as its base for
major coaching activities and has established
a training school there.
Holme Pierrepont
The National Watersports Centre at Holme
Pierrepont in Nottinghamshire is one of the
most comprehensive water sports centres in
the world, with facilities for rowing,
478
SPORT AND ACTIVE RECREATION
canoeing, water skiing, powerboating, ski¬
racing, angling and sailing. It’s main feature
is a 2,000 metres regatta course.
Wales
The Sports Council for Wales runs two
National Sports Centres: the Welsh Institute
of Sport and the National Watersports
Centre. A further Centre—Plas y Brenin—is
run by the Sports Council.
The Welsh Institute of Sport in Cardiff
is the country’s premier venue for top-level
training and for competition in a large
number of sports. Facilities include a world-
standard gymnastics hall, a sports science
unit and a sports injury clinic. In 1991-92
a jfl.25 million refurbishment was started.
The National Watersports Centre at
Plas Menai in north Wales is primarily a
centre of excellence for sailing and
canoeing but also stages mountain activities
in nearby Snowdonia. Its extensive range of
activities include dinghy and catamaran
sailing, offshore cruising and powerboat
training.
Plas y Brenin National Mountain Centre,
situated in Snowdonia National Park in
north Wales, offers a variety of courses in
rock climbing, mountaineering, sea and river
canoeing, orienteering, skiing and most
other mountain-based activities.
Scotland
Scotland has three National Sports Centres,
which are operated by the Scottish Sports
Council.
The National Outdoor Training Centre
at Glenmore Lodge near Aviemore caters
for a wide range of activities, including hill
walking, rock climbing, mountaineering,
kayaking, skiing and canoeing. The Centre
is undergoing a £1.6 million redevelopment
programme with the help of an £800,000
government grant.
The Inverclyde National Sports Training
Centre at Largs has a large number of
facilities, including a gymnastics hall, a
purpose-built golf training facility and a
laboratory for fitness assessment. The
Centre also acts as an important competition
venue for major national and international
championships.
The Cumbrae National Water Sports
Training Centre on the island of Great
Cumbrae in the Firth of Clyde offers an
extensive range of courses catering for all
levels of ability. The Centre has a
comprehensive range of modern craft for a
wide variety of sailing activities, as well as
sub-aqua diving equipment.
Northern Ireland
The Northern Ireland Centre for Outdoor
Activities in County Down, run by the
Sports Council for Northern Ireland, offers
courses in mountaineering, rock climbing,
canoeing and outdoor adventure. Also
available are leadership and instructor
courses leading to nationally recognised
qualifications.
SPORT FOR PEOPLE WITH
DISABILITIES
Associations for People with Disabilities
The key organisations for people with
disabilities are the British Sports Association
for the Disabled (BSAD), the United
Kingdom Sports Association for People with
Mental Handicap, the British Paralympic
Association (BPA) and a range of bodies
concerned with individual disabilities and
single sports. These include the Riding for
the Disabled Association, which caters for
some 25,000 riders.
British Sports Association for the Disabled
The BSAD is a national body working
across all the disabilities. It promotes the
development of sport for people with
disabilities at local level, and organises
regional and national championships in a
range of sports.
The Scottish Sports Association for the
Disabled, the Federation of Sports
Associations for the Disabled (Wales) and
the Northern Ireland Committee on Sport
for Disabled People have similar co¬
ordinating roles.
479
BRITAIN 1994: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
United Kingdom Sports Association for
People with Mental Handicap
The United Kingdom Sports Association for
People with Mental Handicap is a
co-ordinating body with a membership of
over 20 national organisations. The
Association promotes and supports the work
of its members and provides training. It also
works closely with the BPA in co-ordinating
the participation of people with learning
difficulties in the Paralympics. The first-ever
Paralympic Games for people with learning
difficulties were held in Madrid in September
1992.
National Disability Sports Organisations
There are six national disability sports
organisations concerned with individual
disabilities. These organisations provide
coaching and help to organise national
competitions in conjunction with the national
governing bodies of sport and the BSAD.
They comprise:
• the British Amputee Sports Association;
• British Blind Sport;
• the British Deaf Sports Council;
• the British Wheelchair Sports
Foundation;
• Cerebral Palsy Sport; and
• the British Les Autres Sports
Association, which caters for those whose
disabilities are not covered by other
organisations.
British Paralympic Association
Britain’s participation in the Paralympics is
organised by the BPA, which liaises closely
with the BOA. The BPA assists in the
preparation and training of Paralympic and
other international teams, and advises the
Sports Council on the distribution of grants
for all international disabled sports events.
Government Report
In 1989 the Government published a report
on sport for people with disabilities—Building
on Ability. Its main recommendation was that
sport for disabled and able-bodied people
should be increasingly integrated, with
athletes with disabilities being encouraged to
participate in sporting events either in direct
competition with able-bodied athletes or in
parallel events.
Following publication of the report, the
Government provided the BPA with
£500,000 for the establishment of a trust
fund to support a variety of disabled sport
initiatives. Additional funds were also given
in 1991 to the Sports Council and to the
Scottish Sports Council to help implement
the report’s recommendations.
The governing bodies of sport are
increasingly taking responsibility for both
able-bodied participants and those with
disabilities. Close liaison takes place between
individual sports and the Sports Council,
which provides advice to governing bodies on
encouraging the integration of people with
disabilities.
SPONSORSHIP AND OTHER
FUNDING
The private sector makes a substantial
investment in sports sponsorship,
contributing some £230 million a year. This
involves more than 2,000 British companies.
Sponsorship may take the form of
financing specific events, or of grants to
individual sports organisations or sportsmen
and women. Investment includes sponsorship
of cricket and football leagues, sporting
events such as horse races, and of individual
performers. Motor sport and football receive
the largest amounts of private sponsorship.
Sponsorship of sport is encouraged by a
number of bodies, including the Institute of
Sports Sponsorship (ISS—see p. 476), the
Scottish Sports Council’s Sponsorship
Advisory Service, which has raised almost
£3 million directly for Scottish sport over the
last ten years, and the Sports Council for
Wales’ Sponsorship Advisory Service, which
in its first two years of operation has helped
generate £140,000 for Welsh sport.
Successive governments have negotiated
voluntary agreements with the tobacco
industry to regulate tobacco companies’
sponsorship of sport.
480
SPORT AND ACTIVE RECREATION
Business Sponsorship Scheme
In an effort to increase the current levels of
sports sponsorship, the Government has
established a business sponsorship incentive
scheme for sport targeted at the ‘grass roots’
level.
The ‘Sportsmatch’ scheme was
launched at the end of 1992 and assists
local sport by providing government
funds to match those from business
sponsors. Sportsmatch will provide
funding of over £3.7 million a year in
Great Britain.
In England the scheme is managed as a
joint venture between the Department of
National Heritage and the ISS. Under the
scheme, local sport can gain up to £75,000 a
project from the Government if the same
amount is secured in business sponsorship.
Sportsmatch intends to concentrate on local
amateur sport and to encourage firms which
have not used sponsorship before.
Similar arrangements have been announced
for the new scheme in Scotland and Wales,
where it is administered by the appropriate
Sports Councils in association with the ISS.
Northern Ireland has its own sports
sponsorship incentive scheme, which is
currently being reviewed.
Sports Aid Foundation
The Sports Aid Foundation raises and
distributes funds from industry, commerce
and private sponsors in order to assist the
training of talented individuals. Grants are
awarded on the recommendation of the
appropriate governing bodies of sport to
British competitors who need help preparing
for Olympic, World and European
championships. The Scottish and Welsh
Sports Aid Foundations and the Ulster
Sports and Recreation Trust have similar
functions.
Foundation for Sport and the Arts
The Foundation for Sport and the Arts was
set up by the pools promoters in 1991 to
channel funds into sport and the arts. The
pools promoters are providing the
Foundation with some £43.5 million a year.
A further £21.8 million a year is received as
a result of the 2.5 per cent reduction in pool
betting duty in the 1990 Budget. About
£43.5 million a year is available for sport.
The Foundation works closely with the
Sports Councils and other sports bodies, and
makes numerous grants to sports clubs and
sporting organisations.
Recent assistance includes:
• a contribution of £1 million towards the
proposed Northern Ireland Sports
Training Centre; and
• £200,000 to Yorkshire & Cleveland
Riding for the Disabled to assist with the
cost of providing a major centre for
disabled riders.
Horserace Betting Levy
Most betting in Britain takes place on horse
racing and greyhound racing. Bets may be
made at racecourses and greyhound tracks, or
through over 10,000 licensed off-course
betting offices, which take about 90 per cent
of the money staked. A form of pool betting
—totalisator betting—is organised on
racecourses by the Horserace Totalisator
Board (the Tote). Racecourse bets may also be
placed with independent on-course bookmakers.
Bookmakers and the Tote contribute a
levy—a fixed proportion of their profits—to
the Horserace Betting Levy Board. The
amount of levy payable is decided by the
racing and bookmaking industries. The Levy
Board promotes the improvement of horse
breeds, advancement of veterinary science
and better horse racing.
In 1991-92 the total money staked in all
forms of gambling, excluding gaming
machines, was estimated at £24,594 million.
National Lottery
In March 1992 the Government set out its
proposals for a new national lottery in a
White Paper—A National Lottery Raising
Money for Good Causes. This recommended
that sport should be one of the main
481
BRITAIN 1994: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
beneficiaries of such a lottery, which could be
in operation by late 1994. The main
provisions of the National Lottery etc. Act
1993, which paves the way for the
introduction of the Lottery, are that:
• the Lottery should be run by the private
sector; and
• a National Lottery Distribution Fund will
be established, with the proceeds being
divided equally between arts, sports, the
national heritage, charities and the
Millennium Fund.
The money for sport will be split between
the four Sports Councils. Once fully
operational, the National Lottery could raise
up to £1,500 million a year.
SPORT AND EDUCATION
All schools (except those solely for infants)
are expected to have a playing field or the use
of one, and most secondary schools have a
gymnasium. Some have other amenities such
as swimming pools, sports halls and halls
designed for dance and movement.
National Curriculum
The Government believes that all young
children should have the opportunity to learn
basic sports skills. It has therefore made
physical education (PE), which includes sport,
a compulsory subject in the National
Curriculum (see p. 408) for all pupils aged 5
to 16 in state-maintained schools in England
and Wales. Pupils will also be required from
autumn 1994 to have been taught to swim at
least 25 metres by the age of 11.
In Scotland the Secretary of State for
Scotland has issued National Guidelines
which contain programmes of study and
attainment targets for physical activity for
pupils aged 5 to 14.
Partnerships with the Local Community
The Government is encouraging stronger links
between schools and the wider community to
ensure that children have access to the sports
amenities which clubs and associations can
make available outside school hours.
In Scotland an initiative aimed at
strengthening the links between schools,
clubs and the community was launched by
the Scottish Sports Council in 1991. ‘Team
Sport Scotland’ seeks to promote the
development of school-aged team sport and
was made possible through a Scottish Office
grant of £400,000 in the first year, with a
commitment to further funding for the
following two years.
In 1991 the Government launched a new
guide—A Sporting Double: School and
Community—to encourage and assist the
sharing of school facilities between schools
and the local community. The Education Act
1993 includes provisions to allow school
governors to enter into agreements for the
joint management of school premises for
community purposes.
SPECTATOR SAFETY AT SPORTS
GROUNDS
Safety at sports grounds is governed by
legislation. The main instrument of control is
a safety certificate which is issued by the
relevant local authority. When determining
the conditions of a safety certificate, the local
authority is expected to comply with the
Guide to Safety at Sports Grounds. This was
revised in 1990 to include the relevant safety
recommendations of the Taylor Report on
the Hillsborough stadium disaster in Sheffield
in 1989, which resulted in the death of 96
spectators.
The Taylor Report
The Taylor Report, published in 1990,
contained a wide range of recommendations
for promoting better and safer conditions at
all sports grounds. The report’s major
recommendation was that sports grounds
designated under the Safety of Sports
Grounds Act 1975 should become all-seated
under a phased programme.
The Government accepted most of the
report’s recommendations for making sports
stadiums safer and agreed the timetables for
the introduction of all-seater stadiums for
football (see p. 483).
Under the Football Spectators Act 1989
the Government established a Football
482

Licensing Authority (FLA), which is
responsible for assisting in the
implementation of the all-seating policy in
England and Wales. The FLA operates a
licensing system for grounds on which
designated football matches are played.
Football Grounds
In 1992 the Government reviewed its policy
on requiring all League football grounds to
have seated accommodation only. Clubs in
the Premier League, First Division clubs in
the Football League and national stadiums are
still required to have all-seated accommodation
by August 1994. However, this requirement
has been relaxed for the Second and Third
Divisions of the Football League, providing
that the terracing is safe. In Scotland Premier
Division clubs and national stadiums must
meet the 1994 deadline, but First and Second
Division clubs may retain the use of standing
accommodation.
The Football Trust
The Football Trust 1990 was established by
the pools promoters. Its income is over
£32 million a year and it is funded partly by
the pools promoters from their spotting-the-
ball competition and partly from a 2.5 per
cent reduction in pool betting duty to run for
five years, announced in the 1990 Budget.
This concession will provide more than £100
million to football on the understanding that
the money made available must be used to
assist football clubs and the national stadiums
to fund capital works for the comfort and
safety of spectators and, in particular, all-
seater stadiums in line with the
recommendations of the Taylor Report.
In August 1993 the Government agreed to
extend the concession for a further five years
in order to help clubs in the lower divisions
of the Football League to ensure that any
terracing retained at their grounds meets the
required safety standards.
Crowd Control
The Government has worked closely with the
police, football authorities and the
governments of other European countries to
implement crowd control measures.
Legislation has made it an offence in
England and Wales to throw objects at
football matches, run onto the playing area
or chant indecent or racist abuse. There are
also controls on the sale and possession of
alcohol at football grounds and on transport
to and from grounds.
Courts in England and Wales have the
power to prohibit convicted football
hooligans from attending football matches.
They also have powers to impose restriction
orders on convicted football hooligans to
prevent them travelling abroad to attend
specified matches. Closed-circuit television
has greatly assisted the police in controlling
crowds. The National Criminal Intelligence
Service Football Unit co-ordinates police
intelligence about football hooligans and
liaises with overseas police forces.
DRUG ABUSE IN SPORT
National Action
The Sports Council introduced a new
independent drug testing regime in 1988.
This provides for random testing in and out
of competition by independent sampling
officers, and the publication of adverse
findings. The Council also funds the IOC-
accredited laboratory at King’s College,
London University, which carries out
analysis and research into methods of
detection for new drugs which unfairly aid
performance. The Government is currently
considering the possibility of strengthening
legal controls on anabolic steroids.
In 1992-93 the Sports Council
intensified its drugs-testing programme,
with greater emphasis being placed on out-
of-competition tests. There were 48 positive
reports in 1992-93, compared with 53 in
1991-92.
Sports Council funding in Britain for the
programme exceeded £820,000 in 1992-93.
International Action
In 1990 the Council of Europe developed
an Anti-Doping Convention to tackle the
483
BRITAIN 1994: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
problem of drug abuse in sport, the main
aim of which is to provide an international
framework within which national anti-doping
campaigns can work effectively. Britain has
already implemented the provisions of the
convention.
World Conference on Anti-doping in Sport
The Fourth Permanent World Conference
on Anti-doping in Sport took place in
London in September 1993. The Conference
was organised by the Sports Council in
association with the IOC Medical
Commission and brought together more than
200 experts on drugs in sport from 60
countries. The three-day conference
examined current anti-doping developments
throughout the world, why competitors take
drugs and how they obtain them, and the
views of the next generation of competitors
on drug abuse.
A TO Z OF POPULAR SPORTS
Some of the major sports in Britain are
described below. Additional information on
these and other sports not covered here
can be found in A Digest of Sports Statistics
for the UK, published by the Sports
Council.
Angling
One of the most popular countryside sports
is angling, of which there are three main
types: coarse, game and sea.
Angling is an overwhelmingly male sport,
with an estimated ten times as many male as
female participants among Britain’s 4 million
anglers. Many fish for salmon and trout,
particularly in the rivers and lochs of
Scotland and in Wales. In England and
Wales the most widely practised form of
angling is for coarse fish. Separate
organisations represent game, coarse and sea
fishing clubs in England, Wales, Scotland
and Northern Ireland.
The National Federation of Anglers in
England organises national championships
for coarse fishing and enters a team in the
world angling championships.
Association Football
Association football is controlled by separate
football associations in England, Wales,
Scotland and Northern Ireland. In England
340 clubs are affiliated to the English
Football Association (FA) and more than
42,000 clubs directly through regional or
district associations. The FA, founded in
1863, and the Football League, founded in
1888, were both the first of their kind in the
world.
In England and Wales a major change
occurred in August 1992 when a new FA
Premier League was started, comprising 22
clubs. The remaining 70 full-time
professional clubs play in three main
divisions run by the Football League. In
Scotland there are three divisions, with 38
clubs, which play in the Scottish Football
League. In Northern Ireland, 16 semi-
professional clubs play in the Irish Football
League. During the season, which lasts from
August until May, over 2,000 English League
matches are played; total attendances reached
over 20 million in 1991-92.
The major annual knock-out competitions
are the FA Challenge Cup and the Coca-Cola
Cup (the League Cup) in England, the
Tennents Scottish Cup, the Scottish League
Cup, the Irish Cup and the Welsh FA Cup.
England is to host the European
Championships finals in 1996.
Athletics
Amateur athletics is governed in Britain by
the British Athletic Federation (BAF), which
is affiliated to the International Amateur
Athletic Federation. The BAF is responsible
for the selection of British teams for
international events, and also administers
coaching schemes. For the Olympic Games
and the World and European championships
one team represents Britain.
Athletics is attracting increasing numbers
of participants. In recent years there has been
a significant growth in mass participation
events, such as marathons and half
marathons. The London Marathon, which
takes place every spring, attracted over 25,000
runners in 1993.
484
SPORT AND ACTIVE RECREATION
Recent successes at international level
include two gold medals at the 1993 World
Indoor Athletics Championships in Toronto,
Canada—Yvonne Murray in the 3,000 metres
and Tom McKean in the 800 metres—and
three gold medals at the 1993 World Athletics
Championships in Stuttgart. Britain’s gold
medallists were Linford Christie in the 100
metres, Colin Jackson in the 110 metres
hurdles (in a new world record) and Sally
Gunnell in the 400 metres hurdles, also in a
world record. Britain won a total of ten
medals in Stuttgart and finished fourth in the
overall medals table.
Badminton
Badminton is organised by the Badminton
Association of England and the Scottish,
Welsh and Irish (Ulster branch) Badminton
Unions. Around 5 million people play
badminton in Britain and there are over 5,000
clubs. Most clubs do not own their own
facilities but hire courts from local authority
sports centres, schools and churches.
In 1992 badminton was introduced into
the Olympics.
Basketball
In Britain over 750,000 people participate in
basketball. The English Basket Ball
Association is the governing body in England,
and there are similar associations in Wales,
Scotland and Northern Ireland. All of the
associations are represented on the British
and Irish Basketball Federation, which acts as
the co-ordinating body for Britain and the
Irish Republic.
The leading clubs play in the National
Basketball Leagues. Mini-basketball and
micro-basketball are versions of the game
which have been developed for players under
the age of 13.
Wheelchair basketball is played under the
same rules, with a few basic adaptations, and
in the same court as the running game. Over
30 teams play in the National League.
Bowls
The two main forms of bowls are lawn (flat
green and crown green) and indoor bowls.
The game is increasingly enjoyed by adults of
all ages. In recent years the most notable
increases have been in the number of women
taking part. Bowls is also popular among
people with disabilities.
About 4,000 lawn bowling clubs are
affiliated to the English, Scottish, Welsh and
Irish (Northern Ireland Region) Bowling
Associations, which, together with Women’s
Bowling Associations for the four countries,
play to the rules of the International Bowling
Board. The British Crown Green Bowling
Association is the governing body of crown
green bowls, and the indoor game in England
is administered by the English Indoor
Bowling Association. Similar associations
exist for Scotland, Wales and Northern
Ireland and there are separate women’s
associations in each country.
At the world outdoor championships in
1992 Tony Allcock won the singles gold and
Scotland won the Leonard Trophy (the team
title), together with gold medals in the pairs
and the fours. In 1993 Richard Corsie won
the world indoor singles championships for
the third time in five years.
Boxing
Boxing in Britain is both amateur and
professional, and in both strict medical
regulations are observed.
All amateur boxing in England is
controlled by the Amateur Boxing
Association. There are separate associations in
Scotland and Wales, and Northern Ireland
forms part of the Irish Boxing Association.
The associations organise amateur boxing
championships as well as training courses for
referees, coaches and others. The wearing of
headguards is now compulsory in all British
amateur competitions.
Professional boxing is controlled by the
British Boxing Board of Control. The Board
appoints inspectors, medical officers and
representatives to ensure that regulations are
observed and to guard against overmatching
and exploitation. Britain currently has
five world champions: Chris Eubank
(World Boxing Organisation—WBO—
super-middleweight champion), Nigel
485
BRITAIN 1994: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Benn (World Boxing Council—WBC—
super-middleweight), Steve Robinson
(WBO featherweight), Paul Weir (WBO
straw-weight) and Lennox Lewis (WBC
heavyweight).
Cricket
Both the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC),
which frames the laws of the game, and the
Test and County Cricket Board (TCCB—
representing first-class cricket) are based at
Lord’s cricket ground in north London, the
administrative centre of the world game.
Men’s cricket in Britain is governed by the
Cricket Council, consisting of
representatives of the TCCB, the National
Cricket Association (representing club and
junior cricket), the Minor Counties
Association, the Scottish Cricket Union, the
Irish Cricket Union and the MCC.
Cricket is played in schools, colleges and
universities, and amateur teams play weekly
games in cities, towns and villages from late
April to the end of September. Throughout
Britain there is a network of league cricket,
minor counties and club games.
The main competition in professional
cricket is the Britannic Assurance County
Championship, played by 18 first-class
county teams in four-day matches. There
are also three one-day competitions: the
Benson and Hedges Cup, the National
Westminster Trophy and the AXA Equity
& Law Sunday League.
Every year there is a series of five-day
Cornhill Insurance Test matches played
between England and a touring team from
Australia, India, New Zealand, Pakistan,
South Africa, Sri Lanka or the West Indies.
A team representing England usually tours
one or more of these countries in the
British winter. A World Cup competition
takes place every four years, and England
were runners-up to Pakistan in the 1992
final.
Cricket is also played by women and
girls, the governing body being the
Women’s Cricket Association. Women’s
cricket clubs have regular local fixtures and
there are regular county matches as well as
an area championship. Test match series
and a World Cup competition are also
played. In 1993 England won the Women’s
World Cup for the second time.
Cycling
Cycling is one of Britain’s fastest growing
sports. Cycling activities include road and
track racing, cycle speedway, time-trialling,
cyclo-cross (cross country racing), touring
and bicycle moto-cross (BMX). In recent
years there has been a significant growth in
the use of all-terrain or mountain bikes.
The British Cycling Federation is the
governing body for cycling as a sport, with
over 17,600 members. The Cyclists’ Touring
Club has 40,000 members and is the
governing body for recreational and urban
cycling and represents cyclists’ interests in
general. The Scottish Cyclists Union controls
the sport in Scotland. In Northern Ireland
the sport is controlled by the Ulster Cycling
Federation and the Northern Ireland Cycling
Federation.
In July 1993 Chris Boardman set a new
one-hour world record at the Bordeaux
velodrome, when he became the first
man to break through 52 km
(32 miles). Another world record was
broken by Graeme Obree, who lowered
the 4,000 metres record when winning
the world 4,000 metres pursuit title at
Hamar, Norway, in August 1993.
Major cycling events in Britain include
the Milk Race and the Kelloggs Tour of
Britain, which take place annually. In 1994
Britain is to host two stages of the Tour de
France.
Equestrianism
Equestrian activities include recreational
riding, endurance riding, carriage driving,
one- and three-day eventing and show
jumping. The arts of riding and driving are
promoted by the British Horse Society,
which is concerned with the welfare of
horses, road safety, riding rights of way and
training. It runs the British Equestrian
Centre at Stoneleigh in Warwickshire. With
486
SPORT AND ACTIVE RECREATION
some 60,000 members, the Society is the
parent body of the Pony Club and the
Riding Club movements, which hold rallies,
meetings and competitions culminating in
annual national championships.
Leading horse trials, comprising dressage,
cross-country and show jumping, are held
every year at a number of locations,
including Badminton (Avon) and Gatcombe
Park (Gloucestershire).
Show jumping is regulated and promoted
by the British Show Jumping Association.
The major show jumping events each year
include the Royal International Horse Show
at Hickstead (West Sussex) and the Horse of
the Year Show at Wembley in London.
The authority responsible for equestrian
competitions (other than racing) at
international and Olympic level is the British
Equestrian Federation, which co-ordinates
the activities of the British Horse Society
and the British Show Jumping Association.
Golf
The Royal and Ancient Golf Club (R & A),
situated at St Andrews in Scotland, is the
ruling authority of the sport for most of the
world. The Golfing Union of Ireland and
parallel unions in Wales, Scotland and
England are the national governing bodies
for men’s amateur golf. These bodies co¬
operate with the R & A and are represented
on the Council of National Golf Unions,
which is the British co-ordinating body
responsible for handicapping and organising
international matches. Women’s amateur golf
is governed by the Ladies’ Golf Union.
Club professional golf is governed by the
Professional Golfers’ Association (PGA) and
the Women’s PGA. For tournament
professionals the governing bodies are the
PGA European Tour and the Women
Professional Golfers’ European Tour Ltd.
There are about 1,900 golf courses in
Britain.
The main event of the British golfing year
is the Open Championship, one of the
world’s leading tournaments. Other
important events include the Walker Cup
and Curtis Cup matches for amateurs, played
between Great Britain and Ireland and the
United States, and the Ryder Cup match for
professionals, played between Europe and the
United States. Among the leading British
professional players are Nick Faldo and Ian
Woosnam. Nick Faldo won the Open in 1992
for the second time and is currently ranked
number one in the world.
Greyhound Racing
Greyhound racing is one of Britain’s most
popular spectator sports and takes place at 37
major tracks. Meetings are usually held three
times a week at each track, with at least ten
races a meeting. The rules for the sport are
drawn up by the National Greyhound Racing
Club, the sport’s judicial and administrative
body. The representative body is the British
Greyhound Racing Board.
There are about 50 mainly small tracks
which operate independently. Like the major
tracks, they are licensed by local authorities.
Gymnastics
Gymnastics is divided into four main
disciplines: artistic (or Olympic) gymnastics,
rhythmic gymnastics, sports acrobatics and
general gymnastics. Both men and women
compete in artistic gymnastics, although the
apparatus used differs. Rhythmic gymnastics
is for women only and consists of routines
performed to music with ribbon, balls, clubs,
hoop and rope. Sports acrobatics is
gymnastics with people rather than apparatus.
General gymnastics is non-competitive and is
available to all age groups and to people with
special needs.
The governing body for the sport is the
British Amateur Gymnastics Association
(BAGA). Over the past decade the number of
clubs affiliated to the BAGA has nearly
doubled. The sport is particularly popular
with schoolchildren and young adults, and it
has been estimated that between 3 and 4
million schoolchildren take part in some form
of gymnastics every day.
At the 1993 World Gymnastics
Championships in Birmingham Neil Thomas
became the first Briton to win a gymnastics
medal at world level when he won the silver
medal in the floor exercise.

Highland Games
Scottish Highland Games cover a wide range
of athletic competitions in addition to
activities such as dancing and piping
competitions. The main events include
running, cycling, throwing the hammer,
tossing the caber and putting the shot.
Over 70 gatherings of various kinds take
place throughout Scotland, the most famous
of which include the annual Braemar
Gathering and the Argyllshire and Cowal
Gatherings.
The Scottish Games Association is the
official governing body responsible for
athletic sports and games at Highland and
Border events in Scotland.
Hockey (Field and Indoor)
The modern game of hockey was started by
the Hockey Association (of England), which
acts as the governing body for men’s hockey.
Parallel associations serve in Scotland, Wales
and Ireland.
Levels of sponsorship and participation
have increased in recent years following
British success at the 1988 and 1992
Olympics. Cup competitions and leagues exist
at national, divisional or district, and club
levels, both indoors (six-a-side) and outdoors,
and there are regular international matches.
The controlling body of women’s hockey
in England is the All England Women’s
Hockey Association; separate associations
regulate the sport in Scotland, Wales and
Ireland. League, county, club and school
championships for both outdoor and indoor
hockey are played annually in England.
Regular international matches are played.
Traditionally hockey has been played on
grass pitches, but recently there has been an
increase in the use of artificial pitches, which
allow a faster, more free-flowing game. All
major competitions are now played on an
artificial surface.
Horse Racing
Horse racing takes two forms—flat racing,
and National Hunt (steeplechasing and hurdle
racing). The main flat race season runs from
late March to early November, but following
the introduction of all-weather racing in 1989
flat race meetings now take place throughout
the year. The Derby, run at Epsom, is the
outstanding event in the flat racing calendar.
Other classic races are: the Two Thousand
Guineas and the One Thousand Guineas,
both run at Newmarket; the Oaks (Epsom);
and the St Leger ^Doncaster).
The National Hunt season runs from late
July/early August to early June. The most
important meeting is the National Hunt
Festival held at Cheltenham in March, which
features the Gold Cup and the Champion
Hurdle. The Grand National, run at Aintree,
near Liverpool, is the world’s best-known
steeplechase and dates from 1837. In 1993 the
race was declared void for the first time in its
history following two false starts and the
failure to recall all the runners. The Jockey
Club subsequently set up a working group to
consider improvements to the starting
procedure, and has accepted the
recommendations made by the group.
In June 1993 overall responsibility for the
control of racing was passed from the Jockey
Club to a new body—the British Horseracing
Board, which consists of representatives of
the racing industry. The Jockey Club retains
an administrative role and is responsible for
licensing, discipline, security and anti-doping
measures.
Britain has 59 racecourses and about
12,000 horses currently in training.
Ice Skating
Ice skating takes three main forms: figure
skating (solo and pairs), ice dancing and
speed-skating (indoor and outdoor). The
governing body is the National Ice Skating
Association of Great Britain.
Participation in ice skating is concentrated
among the under-25s, and is one of the few
sports that attracts more female than male
participants. There are over 70 rinks in
Britain; almost half have opened since 1985.
British couples have won the world ice
dance championship 17 times. Britain’s most
recent success in this event was achieved by
Jayne Torvill and Christopher Dean, who
won four consecutive world championships
488
SPORT AND ACTIVE RECREATION
between 1981 and 1984. The couple intend to
return to international competition in 1994
following a rule change which permits
professional skaters to return to amateur
competition.
Judo
Judo, an individual combat sport derived
from the ancient Japanese art of ju-jitsu, is
popular not only as a competitive sport and
self-defence technique, but also as a means of
general fitness training. An internationally
recognised grading system is in operation
through the sport’s governing body, the
British Judo Association.
In the 1992 Olympics women’s judo was
included for the first time, and Britain won a
total of four medals in the women’s and
men’s events. Britain has won medals for
judo at every Olympic Games since 1972.
At the 1993 World Judo Championships
Nicola Fairbrother won a gold medal in the
under 56 kg category.
Keep Fit
Various forms of movement and fitness
activities are practised in Britain that include
elements of eurhythmies, dance and aerobic
exercise. The Keep Fit Association receives
funding from the Sports Council to promote
physical fitness and a positive attitude to
health in England. Its national certificated
training scheme for keep fit teachers is
recognised by local education authorities
throughout Britain. Autonomous associations
serve Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.
The Sports Council plans to launch a new
governing body for England—the National
Exercise and Fitness Association.
Martial Arts
A broad range of martial arts, mainly derived
from Japan, the People’s Republic of China,
Taiwan, Hong Kong and Korea, has been
introduced into Britain during the 20th
century. There are recognised governing
bodies responsible for their own activities in
karate, ju-jitsu, aikido, Chinese martial arts,
kendo, taekwondo and tang soo do. The most
popular martial art is karate, with over
100,000 participants.
A review of martial arts organisations was
undertaken in 1990 by the Sports Council.
The review recommended the establishment
of an Advisory Group on Martial Arts, which
has since been set up by the Sports Council,
to provide a forum for discussing martial arts
issues.
Motor-car Sports
The main four-wheeled motor sports include
motor racing, autocross, rallycross, rallying
and karting. In motor racing the Formula
One Grand Prix competition is the major
form of the sport.
The governing body for four-wheeled
motor sport is the RAC (Royal Automobile
Club) Motor Sports Association. The
Association issues licences for a variety of
motoring competitions and organises the
Network Q^RAC Rally, an event in the
contest for the World Rally Championship,
and the British Grand Prix, which is held at
Silverstone as part of the Formula One
World Motor Racing Championship. In 1993
Britain also staged the Formula One
European Grand Prix at Donington Park.
British car constructors, including Lotus,
McLaren and Williams, have enjoyed
outstanding successes in Grand Prix racing,
and Britain has had seven world champion
motor racing drivers.
In 1993 Nigel Mansell won the IndyCar
World Series Championship, which
takes place in the United States and
Australia. In so doing he became the
first man to win the IndyCar title in
his debut year and the only driver to
win the Formula One world
championship and IndyCar titles in
successive years.
In 1993 Damon Hill recorded three
consecutive Grand Prix victories in his first
full season of Formula One racing.
Motor-cycle Sports
Motor-cycle sports include road racing,
489
BRITAIN 1994: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
moto-cross, grass track, speedway, trials, drag
racing and sprint. It is estimated that there
are between 40,000 and 50,000 competitive
motor cyclists in Britain.
The governing bodies of the sport are the
Auto-Cycle Union in England and Wales, the
Scottish Auto-Cycle Union and the Motor
Cycle Union of Ireland (in Northern Ireland).
The major events of the year include the Isle
of Man TT races and the British Road Race
Grand Prix. The Auto-Cycle Union provides
off-road training by approved instructors for
riders of all ages.
Mountaineering
All forms of mountaineering, which includes
hill-walking and rock-climbing, are growing
in popularity. There are around 100,000
rock-climbers and 700,000 hill-walkers, whose
representative body is the British
Mountaineering Council; separate bodies
serve Scotland and Ireland.
British mountaineers have played a leading
role in the exploration of the world’s great
mountain ranges. The best-known is Chris
Bonington, who has climbed Everest and led
many other successful expeditions. In May
1993 Rebecca Stephens became the first
British woman to climb Everest.
Netball
More than 60,000 adults play netball
regularly in England and a further 1 million
participants play in schools. The sport is
played almost exclusively by women and girls
both indoors and outdoors.
The All England Netball Association is the
governing body in England. Scotland, Wales
and Northern Ireland have their own
governing bodies. The number of clubs
affiliated to the All England Association has
more than doubled in recent years.
Rowing
Rowing is taught in many schools, colleges
and rowing clubs throughout Britain. The
main types of boats are single, pairs and
double sculls, fours and eights. The
governing body in England is the Amateur
Rowing Association; similar bodies regulate
the sport in Scotland, Wales and Northern
Ireland.
The University Boat Race, between eight-
oared crews from Oxford and Cambridge, has
been rowed on the Thames almost every
spring since 1836. The Head of the River
Race, also on the Thames, is the largest
assembly of racing craft in the world, with
more than 420 eights racing in procession. At
the Henley Regatta in Oxfordshire crews
from all over the world compete each July in
various kinds of race over a straight course of
1 mile 550 yards (about 2.1 km).
At the World Rowing Championships in
September 1993 Britain won four gold
medals: Gregory Searle, Jonathan Searle and
Garry Herbert (coxed pairs); Steven
Redgrave and Matthew Pinsent (coxless
pairs); Peter Haining (lightweight single
sculls); and the women’s lightweight fours
(Alison Brownless, Jane Hall, Annemarie
Dryden and Tonya Williams).
Rugby Football
Since the end of the 19th century rugby
football has been played according to two
different codes: rugby union (a 15-a-side
game) is played by amateurs and rugby
league (a 13-a-side game) by professionals as
well as amateurs.
Rugby union is played under the auspices
of the Rugby Football Union in England and
parallel bodies in Wales, Scotland and
Ireland. Important domestic competitions
include the divisional and county
championships in England; the league and
national club knock-out competitions in
England and Wales; and the National League
and Inter-District Championships in
Scotland.
The Five Nations Tournament between
England, Scotland, Wales, Ireland and France
is contested each year. Overseas tours are
undertaken by the national sides and by the
British Lions, a team representing Great
Britain and Ireland.
Seven-a-side rugby union has a strong
following. Tournaments include the
Middlesex Sevens, which is held every year
at Twickenham, and every four years there is
490
SPORT AND ACTIVE RECREATION
a World Cup. The inaugural World Cup was
held in Edinburgh in April 1993 and was won
by England.
Rugby league has its own distinct set of
rules, but it has kept many of the features of
the union game. However, unlike rugby
union, which is played nationally, it is
concentrated in the north of England.
The governing body of the professional
game is the Rugby Football League, which
sends touring teams representing Great
Britain to Australia, New Zealand and Papua
New Guinea; annual matches are also played
against France. The Challenge Cup Final, the
major club match of the season, is played at
Wembley Stadium in London.
The amateur game is governed by the
British Amateur Rugby League Association.
Matches between England and France are
held each year and tours are arranged to
Australia and New Zealand. A national league
consisting of ten leading clubs was formed in
1986, and a second division in 1989.
Skiing
Skiing takes place in Scotland from
December to May and also at several English
locations when there is sufficient snow. The
five established winter sports areas in
Scotland are Cairngorm, Glencoe, Glenshee,
the Lecht and Aonach Mor, all of which have
a full range of ski-lifts, prepared ski runs and
professional instructors.
There are over 150 artificial or dry ski-
slopes located throughout Britain, and it is
estimated that 1.5 million people in Britain
take part in the sport. The governing body of
the sport is the British Ski Federation.
Snooker and Billiards
Snooker has greatly increased in popularity in
recent years and become a major spectator
sport as a result of heavy television coverage
of the professional tournaments. It is
estimated that between 7 and 8 million people
now play the game.
British players have an outstanding record
in snooker and have dominated the major
professional championships. The main
tournament is the annual Embassy World
Professional Championship, held in Sheffield.
In the 1980s Steve Davis won the world title
six times and in 1993 Stephen Hendry
became world champion for the third time.
The controlling body for the non¬
professional game in England is the English
Association for Snooker and Billiards.
Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have
separate associations. The World Professional
Billiards and Snooker Association is
responsible for professional players, organises
all world-ranking professional events and
holds the copyright for the rules.
A growing number of women play snooker
and billiards. Their representative body is the
World Ladies Billiards and Snooker
Association, with around 250 members. A
women’s world snooker championship is
played every year in London. The Embassy
World Professional Championship was
opened to women in 1992.
Squash
The governing body for squash in England is
the Squash Rackets Association; there are
separate governing bodies in Wales, Scotland
and Northern Ireland. The main tournament
is the British Open Championship.
There are nearly 9,000 squash courts in
England, and the estimated number of
players in Britain is almost 1 million. The
main providers of facilities are member clubs,
commercial organisations and local
authorities.
Swimming
Swimming is considered to be one of the
most beneficial forms of exercise and attracts
people with a wide range of abilities from all
age groups. It is enjoyed by millions of
people both as a popular recreational activity
and as a competitive sport.
All forms of competitive swimming are
governed by the Amateur Swimming
Association (ASA) in England and by similar
associations in Scotland and Wales. These
three associations combine to form the
Amateur Swimming Federation of Great
Britain, which acts as the co-ordinating body
for the selection of Great Britain teams and
491
BRITAIN 1994: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
the organisation of international competitions.
Northern Ireland forms part of the Irish
Amateur Swimming Association.
Instruction and coaching are provided by
qualified teachers and coaches who hold
certificates awarded mainly by the ASA.
The most advanced aquatic facility in the
world was opened in 1991 at Ponds Forge,
Sheffield. The pool hosted the 1993 European
Championships, at which Britain won a total
of 12 medals including a gold medal for Nick
Gillingham in the 200 metres breaststroke.
Table Tennis
Table tennis is played by a broad range of
adults, with men far outnumbering women.
The sport is particularly popular in schools
and youth clubs, and is also a major
recreational and competitive sport for people
with disabilities.
The governing body in England is the
English Table Tennis Association. There are
separate governing bodies in Scotland, Wales
and Northern Ireland. Table tennis became
an Olympic sport in 1988.
Tennis
The controlling body for tennis in Great
Britain is the Lawn Tennis Association
(LTA), to which the Welsh and Scottish
LTAs are affiliated. Northern Ireland forms
part of Tennis Ireland. Tennis was
incorporated into the Olympics in 1988.
The main tournament is the annual
Wimbledon fortnight, one of the four tennis
‘Grand Slam’ tournaments. This draws large
crowds to the All England Club, and the
tournament is covered extensively on
television. Prize money has increased
dramatically over the last decade and totalled
£5 million in 1993. Since 1980 the All
England Club has donated £81.5 million to
the LTA.
There are national and county
championships and national competitions for
boys’ and girls’ schools. Short tennis to
encourages children aged five and over to take
part in the sport. The game uses a court of
similar size to a badminton court and is
played in over 3,000 schools and in leisure
centres. In all, some 3 million people play
tennis in Britain. The last decade has seen a
big increase in the number of indoor courts.
British tennis recently showed signs of a
revival when James Baily won the 1993 junior
singles championship at the Australian Open,
becoming the first British male to win a
singles Grand Slam title for 28 years.
Tenpin Bowling
The first tenpin bowling centre in Britain
opened in 1960. It is estimated that there are
now some 4.8 million people who take part in
tenpin bowling every year in Britain. There
are over 200 national tournaments and an
annual National Championship.
Britain has 200 indoor bowling centres and
more than 30,000 people belong to the sport’s
governing body, the British Tenpin Bowling
Association.
Volleyball
Volleyball is played both indoors and
outdoors, and is particularly popular among
schoolchildren and university and college
students. Mini-volley is a version of the game
adapted for children under 13.
The English Volleyball Association and
parallel associations in Scotland, Wales and
Northern Ireland act as the sport’s governing
bodies. The British Volleyball Federation
meets regularly to discuss interests of
common concern and to draw up policies.
Yachting
Yachting comprises sailing, powerboating and
windsurfing on both inland and offshore
waters. Offshore racing takes place between
one-design classes or under handicap, which
provides level racing for boats of different
size and shape. The most well-known ocean
races include the Whitbread Round The
World Yacht Race and the Fastnet Race.
Powerboating has two main forms: inland
circuit racing and offshore racing.
The Royal Yachting Association is the
governing body for all yachting in Britain. It
is estimated that about 3 million people
participate in the sport.
