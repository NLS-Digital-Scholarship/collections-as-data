Over the centuries the Tower of
London has served many purposes
- as a citadel, a royal palace, a
prison, the royal mint, an armoury,
the treasury of the regalia and
crown jewels, the record office of
the King’s Court of Justice, a royal
menagerie, and the first royal
observatory. Throughout the
Tower’s 900 years’ existence it has
stood as a symbol of strength at
the centre of the nation’s history.

Introduction
Britain 1978 is the twenty-ninth official handbook in the
series prepared and revised each year by Reference Division
of the Central Office of Information. The contents are based on
information available up to September 1977. The handbook
is widely known as an established work of reference and is
the mainstay of the reference facilities provided by the British
Information Services in many countries. It is available overseas
in a limited free edition and is on sale by Her Majesty's
Stationery Office throughout the world.
Britain 1978 is primarily concerned to describe the machi¬
nery of government and other institutions, together with the
necessary physical and social background, and to show the
part played by government in the life of the country. It does
not attempt an analytical approach to current events.
The factual and statistical information it contains is com¬
piled with the co-operation of other government departments
and agencies, and of many other organisations. While most
sections relate to Britain, facts and figures for England,
Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland are given separately
when relevant.
Sources of more detailed and more topical information
(including statistics) are mentioned in the text and in the
Bibliography towards the end of the book.

Addendum
THE OCTOBER ECONOMIC MEASURES
Britain's improved financial position (see p.188) enabled the
Chancellor of the Exchequer to present to Parliament on
26th October a programme designed to reinforce the attack
on inflation (see p.186), assist the industrial strategy and
reduce unemployment, within Britain's financial commitments
for 1977-78 (see p.187). The measures announced are
expected to cost over £1,000 million in 1977-78 and £2,000
million in 1 978-79.
Income Tax
The main personal income tax allowances (see p.337) are to
be increased by 1 2 per cent with effect from 6th April 1 977.
Public Expenditure
Public expenditure in 1978-79 is to be increased by £1,000
million.
Small Firms
A number of taxation and other measures were announced to
assist small firms. These will include an increase in the
threshold liability for Capital Transfer Tax (see p.338) from
£15,000 to £25,000.
International Monetary Fund Standby
With the improved financial position the Government has
decided not to take up any further drawings on the International
Monetary Fund standby (see p.187). However, full drawing
rights remain, and the standby will be kept until its expiry date
at the end of 1 978.
Exchange Controls
Some adjustments in exchange control (see pp.358-60) were
made. These included raising the limit on foreign currency
purchases from £300 to £500 for residents travelling abroad
on holiday and increasing from £25 to £100 the amount of
sterling that can be taken out of Britain.
STERLING
On 31st October 1977, in the light of market pressures, the
Government changed the Bank of England's intervention
policy designed to maintain stability, allowing the pound to
move freely on the foreign exchange markets (see p.194).

1 The Land and thePeoplt
THE PHYSICAL BACKGROUND
Britain, formally known as the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern
Ireland, constitutes the greater part of the British Isles, a group of islands
lying off the north-west coast of mainland Europe. The largest islands are
Great Britain (comprising the mainlands of England, Wales and Scotland)
and Ireland (comprising Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic). Off the
southern coast of England is the Isle of \\ ight and off the extreme south-west
are the Isles of Scilly; off north Wales is Anglesey. Western Scotland is
fringed by numerous islands and to the far north are the Orkneys and Shet-
lands. All these have administrative ties with the mainland, but the Isle of Man
in the Irish Sea and the Channel Islands between Great Britain and France
have a large measure of administrative autonomy and are not part of England,
Wales, Scotland or Northern Ireland.

When studying British statistics it should be noted whether they refer to
England, to England and Wales (considered together for many administrative
and other purposes), to Great Britain, which comprises England, Wales and
Scotland, or to the United Kingdom (Great Britain and Northern Ireland) as
a whole. United Kingdom statistics and other data occasionally include the
Isle of Man, 588 square km (227 sq miles), and the Channel Islands, 194
square km (75 sq miles).
The latitude of 50° North cuts across the southernmost part of the British
mainland (the Lizard Peninsula) and latitude 6o° North passes through the
Shetland Islands. The northernmost point of the Scottish mainland, Dunnet
Head, near John o’ Groats, is in latitude 58° 40'. The prime meridian of oc
passes through the old observatory at Greenwich (London), while the
easternmost point of England is nearly i° 45 East and the westernmost point
of Northern Ireland is 8° 10' West. It is just under 1,000 km (some 600 miles)
in a straight line from the south coast to the extreme north of mainland Britain
and just under 500 km (some 300 miles) across in the widest part. There are
numerous bays and inlets and no place is as much as 120 km (75 miles) from
tidal water.
The seas surrounding the British Isles are shallow usually less than 90
metres (50 fathoms or 300 feet)—because the islands lie on the continental

shelf. To the north-west along the edge of the shelf the sea floor plunges
abruptly from 180 metres (some 600 feet) to 900 metres (about 3,000 feet).
These shallow waters are important because they provide excellent fishing
grounds as well as breeding grounds for fish. The North Atlantic current, the
drift of warm water which reaches the islands from across the Atlantic, spreads
out over the shelf and its ameliorating effect on the air is thus magnified. The
effect of tidal movement is also increased by the shallowness of the water.
Despite their small area, the British Isles contain rocks of all the main
geological periods. In Great Britain the newer rocks, which are less resistant
to erosion and have thus been worn down to form low land, lie to the south
and east, and the island can therefore be divided roughly into two main
regions, lowlands and highlands.
In the lowlands the newer and softer rocks of southern and eastern England
have been eroded into a rich plain, more often rolling than flat and rising to
chalk and limestone hills, but hardly ever reaching 300 metres (1,000 feet or
so) above sea level. Boundaries run roughly from the mouth of the Tyne in the
north-east to the mouth of the Exe in the south-west.
The highland area comprises the whole of Scotland (including the hills and
moors of southern Scotland as well as the mountains of the Scottish Highlands,
which extehd from the Forth-Clyde valley to the extreme north-west), the
Lake District in north-west England, the broad central upland known as the
Pennines, almost the whole of Wales, and the south-western peninsula of
England coinciding approximately with the counties of Devon and Cornwall.
The area contains all the mountainous parts1 of Great Britain and extensive
uplands lying above 300 metres (about 1,000 feet). This high ground, however,
is not continuous but is interspersed with valleys and plains. Geologically
the mountains and hills consist mainly of outcrops of very old rocks (archaean
and palaeozoic), while the upper strata in the valleys and plains are mainly
more recent (carboniferous age) and similar to those in the northern and
western parts of the lowland area.
These carboniferous strata contain minerals including the coal measures
which were the foundation of British industrial expansion. The outcrops
and shallow seams of coal which have now largely been exhausted were found
on the edge of the plains and up the valleys leading to the high land. Most of
the present deep coal workings underlie the fertile lowlands. The continental
shelf under the North Sea contains large, exploitable quantities of oil and
natural gas.
Towards the end of the country’s long geological history, when the
ancestors of present-day man had already settled, came the great Ice Age
during which, at one period or another, ice caps and ice sheets extended
approximately as far south as the Bristol Channel and the Thames valley. The
ice naturally accumulated on the higher ground and swept from the mountains
of Scotland, northern England and Wales any loose rock or soil which had
previously been formed, so that, when the ice eventually disappeared, the hills
stood out as barren rocky areas, while a thick mantle of glacial debris-
boulders, boulder-clay, sands and gravels—lay distributed widely over the
ower ground. The ice had blocked up previous drainage channels and left
arge lakes, which have since gradually dried up, leaving deposits of sand, silt
and mud, often affording soils of great fertility.
1 The highest peak8 are: in Scotland, Ben Nevis, 1,342 metres (4,406 feet); in Wales
Snowdon, 1,085 metres (3,560 feet); and in England, Scafell Pike (in the Lake District’
Cumbria), 978 metres (3,210 feet).
THE LAND AND THE PEOPLE
3
Climate
Winds
In Ireland, where the solid rocks are covered deeply by the debris left by
the ice sheets, the great central plain has large boggy areas, due to interruption
of the previous natural drainage. The mountains and hill masses1 are irregu¬
larly placed around central lowlands; the rocks of Ireland are of the same
types as the highland zone of Great Britain, and in the higher parts the moor¬
land vegetation resembles that of the higher parts of the highlands.
Britain’s complex geology is one of the main reasons for its rich variety
of scenery and the stimulating contrasts found within short distances, parti¬
cularly on the coasts. The ancient rocks of the highland area often reach the
coast in towering cliffs; elsewhere the sea may penetrate in deep lochs, as
along much of the west coast of Scotland. Bold outstanding headlands are
notable features in other parts of the varied coastline: the granite cliffs of
Land’s End; the limestone masses and slates of the coast of south-west Wales;
the red sandstone of St. Bees Head on the coast of Cumbria; and the vertically
jointed lavas of Skye and the island of Staffa in the Inner Hebrides. Even
around the lowlands there are striking contrasts. In some parts the soft,
white limestone—the chalk—forms white cliffs as at Dover and in the Needles
off the Isle of Wight; while other parts of the south and south-east coastline
have beaches of sand or shingle. The eastern coast of England between the
Humber and the Thames estuary is low-lying mostly, and for centuries some
stretches of it have been protected against the sea by embankments.
The marked tidal movement around the shores of Britain sweeps away much
of the sand and mud brought down by the rivers and makes the estuaries of
the short British rivers2 valuable as natural harbours.
Britain has a generally mild and temperate climate. The prevailing winds are
south-westerly and the weather from day to day is controlled mainly by a
succession of depressions from the Atlantic. The weather is subject to frequent
changes but to few extremes of temperature. Although the winds are largely
determined by those of the eastern Atlantic, occasionally during the winter
months easterly winds may bring cold, dry, weather which, once established,
may persist for many days or even weeks. During the summer months the
Azores high pressure system usually extends its influence north-eastwards
towards north-west Europe, and the depressions take a more northerly course,
often passing entirely to the north of the country.
South-westerly winds are the most frequent, and those from an easterly
direction the least; such winds occur about one-third as often as south-
westerlies although easterly winds are appreciably more frequent in the
spring than at any other time of the year. In hilly country, wind direction may
differ markedly from the general direction owing to local topography. Winds
are generally stronger in the north than in the south, stronger on the coasts
than inland, and stronger in the west than in the east. The strongest winds
usually occur in the winter; the average speed at Lerwick, Shetland Islands,
varies from about 31 km/h (19 mph) in January to about 19 km/h (12 mph)
in August, while at Kew Observatory, on the western outskirts of London,
the average speed varies from about 15 km/h (9 mph) in January to about
12 km/h (7 mph) in August. The stormiest region is along the north-west
coast with over 40 gales a year; south-east England and the east Midlands
1 The highest peak in Northern Ireland is Slieve Donard, 852 metres (2,796 feet).
2 The longest rivers in England—the Severn and the Thames—are only about 354 and
338 km (220 and 210 miles) long respectively.

are the least stormy, with gales occurring on about 2 days a year inland and
on some 10 to 15 days on the Channel coast.
Near sea level in the west the mean annual temperature ranges from 8°C
(46°?) in the Hebrides to ii°C (52°F) in the extreme south-west of England;
latitude for latitude it is slightly lower in the east. The mean monthly tempera¬
ture in the extreme north, at Lerwick (Shetland), ranges from 3°C (°37F)
during the winter (December, January and February) to i2°C (54°F) during
the summer (June, July and August): the corresponding figures for the
Isle of Wight, in the extreme south, are 5°C (4i°F) and i6°C (6i°F). The
average range of temperature between winter and summer varies from 9°C to
I3°C (48°-55of)> being greatest inland in the eastern part of the country.
During a normal summer, the temperature occasionally rises above 3o°C
(86°F) in the south, but temperatures of 32°C (90°F) and above are infrequent.
Extreme minimum temperatures depend largely on local conditions, but
— io°C (i4°F) may occur on a still, clear winter’s night in inland areas. Lower
temperatures are rare.
Britain has an annual rainfall of about 1,100 mm (over 40 inches), while Eng¬
land alone has some 830 mm (about 33 inches). The geographical distribution
of annual rainfall is largely governed by topography and exposure to the
Atlantic, the mountainous areas of the west and north having far more rain
than the lowlands of the south and east. Between 3,800 and 5,000 mm (roughly
150-200 inches) of rain fall on the summits of Snowdon, the Lake District
and north-west Scotland during the average year, whereas some places in the
south-east of England record less than 500 mm (about 20 inches). Rain is fairly
well distributed throughout the year, but, on the average, March to June are
the driest months and October to January the wettest. A period of as long as
three weeks without rain is exceptional, and is usually confined to limited areas.
The distribution of sunshine shows a general decrease from south to north,
a decrease from the coast inland, and a decrease with altitude. During May,
June and July (the months of longest daylight) the mean daily duration
of sunshine varies from five hours in northern Scotland to eight hours in the
Isle of Wight; during the months of shortest daylight—November, December
and January—sunshine is at a minimum, with an average of half an hour a
day in some parts of the Highlands of Scotland and two hours a day on the
south coast of England.
In fine, still weather there is occasionally haze in summer and mist and fog
in winter. Fogs have become less frequent and less severe as a result of changes
in fuel usage and the operation of clean air legislation. In London, for example,
the frequency of dense fogs in winter is about half what it was 20 years ago.
Many parts of the surface of highland Britain have only thin, poor soils, with
the result that large stretches of moorland are found over the Highlands of
Scotland, the Pennines, the Lake District, the mountains of Wales and in
parts of north-east and south-west England. In most areas the farmer has
cultivated only the valleys and the plains where soils are deeper and richer-
villages and towns are often separated by uplands with few if any habitations.
With the exception of a few patches of heath and forest, almost the whole
°1 lowland Britain has been cultivated, and farmland covers the area except
where there are urban and industrial settlements. Elaborate land drainage
THE LAND AND THE PEOPLE

Fauna
systems have been developed through the centuries to bring under cultivation
the fertile soil of the low-lying fenland of Lincolnshire and part of East
Anglia.
With its mild climate and varied soils, Britain has a diverse pattern of
vegetation. When the islands were first settled, oak forest probably covered
the greater part of the lowland, giving place to extensive marshlands, forests
of Scots pine on higher or sandy ground and perhaps some open moorland.
In the course of the centuries the forest area was progressively diminished
and, in spite of planting by estate owners in the eighteenth and nineteenth
centuries and the establishment of large forests by the Forestry Commission
in the past 50 years, woodlands now occupy only about 8 per cent of the land
area. The greatest density of woodland occurs in the north and east of Scotland,
in some parts of south-east England and on the Welsh border. Yet much of
Britain appears to be wooded because of the numerous hedgerows and isolated
trees. The most common trees are oak, beech, ash and elm and, in Scotland,
pine and birch. The number of elms, especially in southern England, has
been severely reduced since the late 1960s by ‘Dutch’ elm disease.
There are various types of wild vegetation, including the natural flora of
woods, fens and marshes, foreshores and cliffs, chalk downs and the higher
slopes of mountains; the most widespread is that of the hilly moorland country,
which consists mainly of heather, grasses, gorse and bracken, with cotton
grass in the wetter parts. Most of Britain, however, is agricultural land, of
which over a third is arable and the rest pasture and meadow, a varied semi¬
natural vegetation composed of indigenous grasses and flowering plants.
Farming land is divided into fields by hedges, stone walls or fences and,
especially in the mixed farms which cover most of the country, presents a
pattern of contrasting colour. The removal of hedges to facilitate mechanical
farming has resulted in a more open landscape in certain parts of the country.
The cool temperate climate and the even distribution of rainfall ensure a
long growing season; streams rarely dry up, grassland is green throughout
the year with many wild flowers from spring to autumn; in most years there
is scarcely a month without some flowers in hedgerows and woodlands.
The fauna of the British Isles is, in general, similar to that of the rest of north¬
western Europe, though there are fewer species. Some of the larger mammals,
including the wolf, the bear, the boar and the reindeer, have become extinct;
but red deer, protected for sporting reasons, flourish in the Scottish Highlands
and on Exmoor in the counties of Devon and Somerset, roe deer are found in
Scotland and in the wooded areas of southern England, and fallow deer (which
are probably not indigenous) have been introduced into parks and are wild
in some districts. The badger, a nocturnal animal, is rarely seen; there are
foxes in most rural (and many semi-urban) areas, and otters are found along
many rivers and streams. Common and grey seals may be seen on parts of the
coast, though not usually in the same localities. Smaller mammals include mice,
rats, voles, shrews, hedgehogs, moles, squirrels (the imported grey much more
numerous than the native red), hares, rabbits, weasels and stoats.
About 460 species of birds have been recorded in the British Isles. Some 200
species breed; the rest are regular migrants to, or pass through, the country, or
are casual stragglers. Visitors to Britain are often struck by the abundance,
variety and tameness of song birds in towns and villages. The pigeon, blackbird
and chaffinch are widely distributed but sparrows usually predominate near
houses. London and some other large towns have huge flocks of starlings which
congregate to roost on buildings, especially in winter. Most species of birds
6
BRITAIN 1978: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
have maintained their numbers over the last few decades, owing to their
success in adapting themselves to man-made surroundings, and in London
there has been an increase in the number of species breeding as a result of the
improvement in the environment brought about by anti-pollution measures.
Some large birds, on the other hand, have tended to decrease, but several
species, such as the osprey and the ruff, have re-established themselves after
disappearing from Britain in the nineteenth century.
Many species of gulls and other sea birds nest around the coast, and gulls
may regularly be seen feeding far inland; some nest in inland sites such as
gravel pits and sewage farms. The drainage and reclamation of marshlands
have diminished the natural habitat of ducks, geese and other aquatic birds,
but the survival of such species is largely assured on the nature reserves and
bird sanctuaries which have recently been established on an increasing scale.
Nearly all British wild birds are protected; the principal exceptions are those
considered injurious to agriculture and birds shot for sport in the open season.
About 30 kinds of freshwater fish are found, salmon, trout, pike, roach,
dace and perch being widely distributed. Stocks of trout, rainbow trout (an
introduced species), carp, tench and roach are frequently supplemented by
introductions for angling purposes. In a number of rivers measures to control
pollution have resulted in fish becoming more numerous. In the Thames in
London, for example, where pollution levels have been reduced to a quarter
of those in the 1950s, over 90 kinds of fish have been found, compared with
only one in 1964.
Reptiles and amphibians are few. The former are represented by three
species of snakes, of which only the adder is venomous, and three species of
lizards, including the snake-like slow-worm. The amphibians are represented
by three species of newts and five species of frogs and toads. Most British
reptiles and amphibians are indigenous but at least one, the marsh frog, has
been recently introduced from continental Europe. Ireland has no snakes.
There are more than 21,000 different kinds of insects. Among the largest
are the rare swallowtail butterfly (8-10 cm, 3-4 inches) and the stag beetle
(6 cm, 2| inches). The insect fauna is less varied than that of continental
Europe and lacks a number of common European species. With modern
methods of pest control, extensive insect damage to crops or timber and
serious outbreaks of diseases spread by insects are not common but there is
some anxiety that chemical protection against insects may be reducing the
population of creatures which feed on them, and of their predators in turn.
These and other effects of agricultural chemicals on wildlife are the subject
of special safeguards.
THE DEMOGRAPHIC BACKGROUND
The people who now inhabit Britain are descended mainly from the people
who inhabited the area nine centuries ago. The last of a long succession of
invaders and colonisers from Scandinavia and the continent of Europe were
the Normans, a branch of the Norsemen or Scandinavian Vikings who, after
settling in northern France, intermarrying with the French, and assimilating
their language and customs, crossed to England and conquered it in 1066.
Obviously it is not possible to estimate the relative importance of various
early peoples—pre-Celts, Celts, Romans, Anglo-Saxons and the Norsemen,
including the Danes—in the ancestry of the present English, Scots, Welsh and
Irish. Over most of England and the lowlands of Scotland the language which
soon came to predominate was English, mainly a marriage of Anglo-Saxon and

Norman-French, while the use of Celtic languages persisted in Wales, Corn¬
wall, the Isle of Man, the highlands of Scotland and in Ireland.
The available records do not enable any precise estimates to be made of the
size of population or of the extent or direction of population movement until
the beginning of the nineteenth century. It is believed, however, that at the
end of the eleventh century the population of Great Britain was about 2 million,
while at the end of the seventeenth century reasonable contemporary estimates
put the population at about 6| million. The main factor in this gradual
growth of population was a slow natural increase, with high death rates and,
in particular, very high infant and maternal mortality. Immigration from
the continent of Europe has been an influence at certain times and immigra¬
tion from Commonwealth countries more recently.
From the beginning of the nineteenth century there is relatively plentiful
and reliable information about the British people their number, sex,
age, geographical distribution, births, marriages, deaths, occupations,
language, and family structure. Most of it comes from two main sources: the
regular flow of statistical information based on compulsory registration of
births, marriages and deaths, and the periodic censuses taken regularly every
ten years since 1801 (because of war there was no census in The last
census was in 1971 > the next will be held in 1981.
Britain’s estimated mid-1976 home population was 55,928,000 (see Table 2,
below). The populations of the Isle of Man, Jersey, and Guernsey and associ¬
ated islands are about 56,000, 72,000 and 53,000 respectively. Between mid-
1970 and mid-1976 the population grew by just over half a million, but almost
all of this growth took place before 1974- In t975 an<^ t97^ f°r the first years
since records began (other than in war) the population fell slightly. This
trend, common to several countries in western Europe, is mainly the result

Causes
of a sharp fall in the birth rate (see below). Births in 197^ were just out¬
numbered by deaths. The direction of net migration, as in other recent
years, was outward.
The country as a whole has a population density of about 229 people to the
square kilometre (593 Per square mile), but in England the figures are 356
people to the square kilometre (922 per square mile), and in London 4,448
people per square kilometre (11,527 per square mile).
In the late 1960s and early 1970s considerable public attention focused on
the issue of population growth, and the Government set up a population
panel to examine the implications of continued growth. The Lord Privy Seal,
a Cabinet minister, was given responsibility for the monitoring and co¬
ordination of development in population policy. One of the conclusions of the
panel s report in 1973 was that in the long term Britain would do better with
a stationary rather than an increasing population.
Now that growth has, for the time being at least, stopped, the public
debate has turned more towards the implications, for the short term, of a
static or declining population. Many official policies, such as those on the
planning of new towns and the supply of school teachers, are being re-examined
in this light. The Government is giving higher priority to survey and research
work to study fertility, mortality and migration in an attempt to discover more
about the factors involved in population change.
... Projfcti°ns f°r the future suggest that the traditional increase in population
will continue, though at a much slower rate than was expected a few years
ago. Britain’s population is expected, on 1976 estimates, to be about 56
million in 1986, 57-3 million in 1996, 57-5 million in 2006 and 58-2 million
in 2016.
After several years of low birth rates in the 1930s (around 15 per 1,000
population) the annual rate rose, with some fluctuations in the early 1950s,
to a peak of 18-8 per 1,000 people in 1964. It has since fallen sharply, reaching
12 per 1,000 population in 1976. This rate and that for 197c (12-5) are
unprecedentedly low. Of the 676,000 live births in 1976, about 9 per cent
were illegitimate.
While the expectation of life has increased (it is about 69 years at birth for a
oy an 75 or a girl, compared with around 48 and 52 years respectively at the
turn of the century) the general death rate has remained nearly stationary
since 1918 at about 12 per 1,000 population. Rates for every age group, how-
ever, have continued to fall heavily, particularly among pre-school children,
school children and adults in their 30s and 40s.
The causes of the decline in mortality include better nutrition, rising standards
of living the advance of medical science, the growth of medical facilities,
improved health measures, better working conditions, education in personal
ygiene, and the smaller size of the family, which has reduced the strain on
mothers and enabled them to take greater care of their children.
Mortality from acute infectious diseases and from tuberculosis, and infant
and maternal mortality have declined very sharply. Mortality from the main
acute infectious diseases of childhood is less than a two-hundredth and mortality
from tuberculosis is about one-fifty-fifth of the rate prevailing in the mid¬
nineteenth century. The infant mortality rate (deaths of infants under one year
b.irth5) has faJlen from 22-1 in 1961 to 16 in 1975; neonatal
nortahty (deaths of infants under four weeks old per 1,000 live births) from
THE LAND AND THE PEOPLE
9
Migration
15-8 to 10-9; and maternal mortality from 0-35 per 1,000 live births to 0-09.
First estimates for 1976 suggest a further marked decrease in these rates.
The reported mortality from some of the illnesses of middle and old age,
such as cancer of the lung and heart diseases, has risen during the twentieth
century, and this rise, though exaggerated by the improvement in diagnosis, is
at least partly real. Medicine has not yet discovered effective measures to
combat some of these illnesses and improvement in positive health does not
always bring increased immunity or resistance to them. In 1975 for the first
time in over 50 years there was a fall in the lung cancer death rate for men,
which may have been at least partly due to changing smoking habits, in turn
influenced by Government measures to discourage cigarette smoking.

Death rates from suicide which were 108 per million in England and Wales
in 1965 were 75 per million in 1975.
Traditionally Britain has a net outflow of people to the rest of the world
(net loss by migration between 1871 and 1931 for instance was about 4
million) though there have been exceptional periods—in the 1930s when there
was a considerable flow of refugees from continental Europe, and in the late
1950s and early 1960s, mainly the result of a large influx of people from
Commonwealth countries, particularly the West Indies, India and Pakistan
(including what is now Bangladesh).
Each of the past few years has been in line with the traditional pattern (even
in 1972 when some 26,000 Asians expelled from Uganda were admitted). In
the period 1966 to 1976 some 2-9 million people left Britain to live abroad,
and nearly 2-3 million came from overseas to live in the country, so that the
net emigration reduced the population by more than 600,000.
Of the 210,000 emigrants in 1976, 30 per cent left for Austalia, Canada and
New Zealand and 15 per cent for European Community countries. Of the
10

Age Structure
180,000 immigrants, nearly a quarter came from Australia, Canada or New
Zealand; over a quarter from other Commonwealth countries; and 14 per
cent from countries of the European Community. Some 35 per cent of'all
immigrants over the age of 15 years, and 42 per cent of emigrants, were
administrators, managers, professional and technical workers or artists. A
significant number of people leaving and entering Britain each year are
returning migrants. (The 1976 figures are provisional.)
Total births of boys naturally exceed those of girls by about 6 per cent, but
stillbirth rates and mortality rates at almost all ages are higher for males, so
that in nearly all countries—and in Britain since records began—women pre¬
ponderate among the elderly and outnumber men in the total population.
There are more than 105 females to every 100 males. Women used to out¬
number men in every age group from adolescence onwards. Recently, how¬
ever, the fall in stillbirths and infant mortality has reduced the influence of
these factors on the sex ratio so that the age at which women begin to out¬
number men has advanced and is now about 45. On the other hand, the
lengthening of the expectation of life, which has been rather more marked for
women than for men, has increased the preponderance of women among the
elderly there are more than 18 women over 70 years old to every 10 men—
and made it a weightier factor in the sex ratio of the whole population.
Marriage trends since the i930s have been towards a higher proportion of
people marrying and an earlier age pattern. The proportion of the population
of Great Britain who are or have been married has risen from about 52 per
cent in 1939 to 59-3 per cent in I975> while the proportion of single persons
in the population aged 15 years or over has fallen from 33'3 per cent to 22'8
per cent. This change has been due mainly to an increase in marriage rates
among men and women in their late teens and early twenties. The average
ages of people marrying for the first time (roughly 25 for men and 23 for
women) have been lower in the 1970s than at any time since the beginning of
civil registration, 140 years ago.
There were about ten decrees of divorce made absolute in 1976 for every
1,000 married people in England and Wales; a substantial proportion of
divorced people marry again.
The estimated age distribution of the British population in mid-1976 was as
follows, under 15 years, about 23 per cent; 15-64, 63 per cent; and 65 and
over 14 per cent. Some 17 per cent of the population were over the normal
retirement ages (65 for men and 60 for women).
The changing age structure has for the time being produced a balance
between those wTo are primarily producers of resources and those who are
primarily consumers that is more unfavourable than at any time since the
early 1930s. Although the balance is expected to improve in the future, the
continuing high proportion of young and old people and the growing numbers
of )oung people remaining in full-time education after leaving school means
that there is a special need to make the best use of national human resources,
both by ensuring that people available for work can find suitable employment
and by increasing the rates of technological improvement and of training and
retraining in order to raise productivity.
Perhaps the main feature of the changing age structure is the increasing
number of elderly people, reflecting birth patterns in the early years of the
century and the final decades of the nineteenth. Between mid-1970 and mid-
THE LAND AND THE PEOPLE

Distribution of
Population
1976 the number of people over the normal retirement ages rose by 7-5 per cent.
Proportionately there was a particularly large increase in the number of
people aged 85 and over, 19-4 per cent over the same period.
The population of England is, and has been for centuries, greater than that of all
other parts of Britain. The distribution of the British population by country,
is shown in Table 2.
The standard regions of England, sub-divisions of the country used for
most statistical and economic planning purposes, have the following popula¬
tions (provisional mid-1976 estimates): East Anglia 1,803,100; East Midlands
3,733,4o°; Northern 3,122,100; North-West 6,554,000; South-East
16,893,600; South-West 4,253,900; West Midlands 5,165,100; and Yorkshire
and Humberside 4,892,400.
Table 3 gives figures of some of Britain’s largest urban areas. About half
the population lives in a belt across England with south Lancashire and
West Yorkshire at one end, and the London area at the other, having the
industrialised Midlands at its centre. Other areas with large populations are:
the central lowlands of Scotland; north-east England from north of the
river Tyne down to the river Tees; south-east Wales; the Bristol area; and the

of expanding employment and housing opportunities and towards certain
retirement areas.
Throughout Britain the population is predominantly urban and suburban,
although there may be access to large parks, commons and other expanses of
open country within the urban area.
During the nineteenth century the labour demands of newly developing
industry drew great numbers from the countryside; by the end of the century
three-quarters of the population was living in towns and the large conurbation
was already the dominant type of community. During the twentieth century
the suburbs of the towns in these population centres have continued to
spread and merge. Over one-third of the population lives in Greater London,
the metropolitan counties, and the Scottish conurbation of Central Clydeside
(centred on the city of Glasgow). The centres of the metropolitan counties are
the cities of Manchester (Greater Manchester), Liverpool (Merseyside),
Sheffield (South Yorkshire), Newcastle upon Tyne (Tyne and Wear),
Birmingham and Wolverhampton (West Midlands), and Leeds and Bradford
(West Yorkshire).
There has been a recent decline in the numbers of people living in inner urban
areas, balanced or surpassed by the increase of population in and beyond the
outer suburban fringes (limited in certain areas by the ‘green belt’ policy where
little development is permitted). This applies most strikingly to London, also
to the outer areas of the West Midlands and Merseyside counties and to
such towns and cities as Bristol, Derby, Liverpool, Norwich, Oxford, Ports¬
mouth and Sheffield.
Factors in the further dispersal of the last few years have been the spread of
car ownership and the growth of motorway and trunk road networks, expansion
in public transport serving journeys to work, private property developments
to meet the demand for housing, and planned transfers of population to the
new and expanding towns.
The extent to which people in Britain move about the country for work, housing
or study purposes is shown by the finding that n-6 per cent of residents in
Great Britain in 1971 had changed their address in the preceding year and 34'2
per cent in the previous five years; 6-4 per cent had moved between England and
Scotland or Wales, or from one region to another, during 1966-71.
In England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland, English is the language
predominantly spoken. In Wales, however, Welsh, a form of British Celtic,
was spoken by 21 per cent of the population (some 542,000 people) aged three
years and over at the time of the 1971 census. The Welsh Language Council, an
official body, promotes the use of the language. The Welsh Language Act 1967
affirms the equal validity of Welsh with English in the administration of justice
and conduct of government business throughout Wales. The number of
bilingual schools is increasing. In Scotland some 88,000 persons in 1971,
mainly in the Highlands and western coastal regions, were able to speak the
Scottish form of Gaelic. A few families in Northern Ireland still speak the
Irish form of Gaelic. The Cornish variety of Celtic is no longer effectively
a living language, although there is a revival of cultural interest.
Some of the country’s ethnic minorities have their own languages, normally
as well as English. Among the Asian community, for example, in which many
adults speak English only slightly or not at all, the most usual languages are
Punjabi, Gujerati, Bengali or Urdu.

Immigration
Control and
Nationality
Immigration into Britain is controlled by the Immigration Act I971* The Act
confers a right of abode—and exemption from control—on citizens of the
United Kingdom and Colonies who are connected with Britain by birth,
adoption, naturalisation or registration or are children or grandchildren of such
persons, on citizens of the United Kingdom and Colonies from overseas who
have been resident in Britain for a continuous period of five years, and on
Commonwealth citizens with a parent born in the United Kingdom. Those
having this right of abode are known as ‘patrials’. In general, others wishing
to enter Britain for employment must hold work permits. Exceptions are
Commonwealth citizens with a grandparent born in Britain, certain permit-
free categories, and nationals of European Community countries. The
dependants of work permit holders and of those who may enter without work
permits may also be admitted.
Under the British Nationality Act 1948, people born in the United King¬
dom, the Channel Islands, the Isle of Man, a ship or aircraft registered in the
United Kingdom, or a territory which is still a colony, are, with insignificant
exceptions, citizens of the United Kingdom and Colonies by birth. Citizenship
may also be acquired: by descent from a father who is himself a citizen
otherwise than by descent and, in certain specified circumstances, from a
father who is a citizen by descent only; by registration, for citizens of
Commonwealth member countries or of the Irish Republic, for minor children
and for women married to citizens of the United Kingdom and Colonies; in
consequence of a United Kingdom adoption order; and, for aliens, by naturali¬
sation. The requirements for naturalisation include five years’ residence in the
United Kingdom or Colonies, good character, a sufficient knowledge of English
and the intention to reside in the United Kingdom or a colony. The require¬
ments for registration are similar except that most Commonwealth and Irish
citizens settled in Britain by 1973 have the right to be registered after complet¬
ing five years’ ordinary residence without satisfying any other requirement.
Over 31,000 people acquired citizenship by naturalisation and registration
in 1976.
A citizen of the United Kingdom and Colonies does not forfeit his citizenship
by acquiring or possessing the nationality or citizenship of another country
(although he can lose it automatically if the territory from which he derives it
becomes independent); nor does a woman who is a citizen of the United King¬
dom and Colonies lose her citizenship by marriage to a foreign national.
Indeed, a citizen cannot be deprived of his citizenship against his will except
in very exceptional circumstances (for example, if he has obtained naturalisation
or registration as a citizen by fraud). Any man or woman who is a citizen is,
however, at liberty to renounce citizenship if he or she possesses or acquires the
nationality or citizenship of another country.
Citizens of the other independent Commonwealth countries are, in United
Kingdom law, British subjects or Commonwealth citizens and, as such, enjoy
full political and civic rights if resident in Britain.
The Government has suggested for public discussion various ways in which
the law on nationality might be changed.
THE SOCIAL FRAMEWORK
This section gives some points of general interest about household structure and
social characteristics in Britain as a background to the information given in later
chapters. It deals with topics in very broad and informal terms and many
exceptions apply to the generalisations.
BRITAIN 1978: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
The way of life of the people of Britain has been changing rapidly throughout
the twentieth century. As in many other countries underlying causes include
two major wars, a lower birth rate, longer expectation of life, earlier marriage
and a higher divorce rate, widening educational opportunities and technical
progress, particularly in communications and transport. One of the features of
the change in social attitudes has been the development of a more informed
tolerance of others’ behaviour and an unwillingness to penalise individuals
with particular problems. Relationships between the generations, too, are
changing, and young people are more ready to criticise traditional values and
institutions and to seek greater influence in shaping society.
The following account applies primarily to Great Britain. Many of the
same factors are at work in Northern Ireland but their effect is modified by
both the Province’s history and the emergency of recent years.
Homes and the The majority of people (some 97 per cent) live in private households (in families
Environment or on their own). The remainder include residents in hotels, and people in the
armed services and in educational or other institutions. Of approximately
27"5 miHion married people at the time of the 1971 population census about
25 million were estimated to be married couples living together in some
12-5 million separate families containing some 46 million people, the remainder
living either on their own or with other persons or families, except for a small
number living in institutions. Nearly 8 million of the families, comprising
32 million people, contained a married couple and their children or grand¬
children. There were, in addition, 1*2 million families consisting of one parent
living with children or grandchildren. About half, mostly women, were
bringing up between them about 1 million dependent children; the rest were
living with adult children or grandchildren.
The average size of households has continued to fall progressively, from over
four persons in 1911 to 3,i in 1961 and 2,8 in 1973- It is estimated that in 1973
19 per cent of households consisted of one person only, 32 per cent of two,
18 per cent of three, 18 per cent of four and 13 per cent of five or more. However,
about half of the small households (one or two persons) contained a person over
60 years old while the other half consisted largely of young, often recently
married, couples without children and of young people who had left home to
live on their own during the first years of their employment and increasingly
during the last stages of their education. Relatively few people in their middle
years lived in small families without children.
Four British households out of five live in houses rather than flats. In the
centres of large towns and the inner streets of small towrns and villages,
terraced houses, most of them built in the early years of the present century,
still provide accommodation for a third of all households. In inner urban
areas, which have increasing priority in the Government’s housing and
planning policies, slum clearance and redevelopment have been major
features of post-1945 public housing programmes, but, with help from public
funds, the modernisation and conversion of sub-standard housing has
increasingly been encouraged as an alternative to clearing and rebuilding.
Emphasis in new building is on low-rise, high density layouts, often incorporat¬
ing gardens or patios.
The main housing development of the past 50 to 60 years, however, has been
suburban. More than half Britain s families now live in houses grouped in small
terraces, or semi-detached or detached, usually of two storeys with gardens,
and providing two main ground-floor living rooms, a kitchen, from two to four
bedrooms, a bathroom, and one or two lavatories. Many such houses, built
THE LAND AND THE PEOPLE
15
in the 1920s and 1930s, are located in ‘ribbon development’ along main roads,
but recent patterns have involved housing estates set back from the main
thoroughfares with amenities such as health and community centres which
provide for various activities, often run by associations of the residents.
Housing standards are continually improving; some 89 per cent of house¬
holds in Great Britain have exclusive use of a bath or shower, and 95 per cent
sole use of a lavatory—high percentages by international standards. Most
housing built nowadays is centrally heated. At the same time improved
housing design and greater use of labour-saving equipment and materials
have combined to lighten the burden of housework. Some 90 per cent of house¬
holds have a vacuum cleaner, almost as many have a refrigerator, over 70 per
cent a washing machine, over 40 per cent an electric food mixer, more than
30 per cent a clothes drier, and 20 per cent a deep freeze. Virtually every house
has an electric iron. Very few households employ any regular paid help and
hardly any have a resident servant. Some households get help through the
local authority home help service because of particular need, for example, if
there is an invalid or elderly person in the house or because a mother is
having her baby at home.
Over half of all families now own their own homes, though half of these home
owners still have further repayments of mortgages to make. Most of the other
households rent an unfurnished house or flat either from a local authority
(an increasing trend) or from a private landlord (a falling trend). People in
unskilled manual jobs are more likely to live in rented accommodation,
particularly local authority housing, than people in non-manual occupations.
An important influence on the planning of housing and services has been the
growth of car ownership. New housing estates are often some distance from
public transport and from work places, schools and the main shops.
Some 56 per cent of households now own cars (70 per cent in country areas).
Private motoring, measured in terms of distance travelled by passengers, is
nearly four times as important as public transport. Outside rural areas, where
services have been reduced, the volume of public transport services has not
fallen as much as the use of them.
Very great benefits are conferred by the growth of car ownership, but the
trend has serious implications for the public transport system. The problems
of those without access to a car, many of whom are among the poorer sections
of the community or are elderly or infirm, are being given particular attention
in the development of transport policies.
Car ownership has also influenced large-scale urban reconstruction and
road development programmes. Some towns and cities have been altered to
accommodate more traffic and house more people; many town centres have
pedestrian precincts; by-passes help to reduce traffic in city centres.
In a densely populated modern industrial society there is much scope
for conflict between the need for communal facilities and the desire to
preserve existing beauty or places of historic interest, and between potential
users of a new service and people whose way of life is threatened by the need to
accommodate it. As a result the activities of the established amenity societies,
such as the National Trust and the Council for the Protection of Rural England,
are supplemented to a growing extent by those of groups formed expressly to
safeguard the amenities of a particular area and to publicise the views of the
people they represent.
Growing public concern about the dangers both to health and to the natural
environment which can be caused by the disposal of industrial and human
waste, by exhaust fumes and by the rising volume of noise is reflected in the

appointment by the Government of a standing Royal Commission on Environ¬
mental Pollution, a Clean Air Council and an Advisory Council on Noise.
Voluntary societies include the National Society for Clean Air, the Noise
Abatement Society and the Council for Nature.
Many of the differences between socio-economic groupings have been reduced
during the twentieth century, but persist in such matters as educational
attainment, standards of health and even mortality rates. Differences between
the counties and regions of Britain have also been identified, notably the con¬
centration of higher employment incomes in London and south-east England.
The proportion of the working population in non-manual occupations is
growing and an increasing number of people in professional or managerial
occupations are the children of manual workers.
The working population comprises nearly half the total population. For a
long period an increase in real earnings was a principal factor in British
working and social life. Between 1950 and 1974 real personal disposable
income1 more than doubled to ^41,465 million, an average annual rise of 4^7
per cent. It fell by about 0-3 per cent in 1975, the first year to show a fall since
the official series was started in 1948 and again, by just over 0-4 per cent, in
1976.
Although the progressive effect of direct taxation on the degree of inequality
of income distribution is largely offset by the regressive effect of indirect
taxation, the combined effect of the tax system, the receipt of transfer pay¬
ments and direct and indirect benefits in kind is a major redistributive one.
Changes in the distribution of income between the late 1930s and i973~74
were not very pronounced, but there had been a continuing decline in the
share of the top 5 per cent of income recipients from about 20 per cent of
income before tax in 1959 to 17 per cent in 1973-74, accounted for largely by
the drop in the share of the top 1 per cent from about 8 per cent to 6 per cent
over the same period. (The fall in the share of the top 1 per cent since 1938—39
had been about two-thirds.) The share of the bottom 20 per cent had increased
between 1959 and i973-74 from 5’3 to 6'2 per cent. Howrever, more recently
during a period of inflation and wages restraint when the standards of living
of all income groups have been falling, those of higher income groups have
tended to fall more, and customary differentials between higher and lower
employment incomes have been reduced.
There is very little knowledge about long-term trends in the distribution
of wealth, but such estimates as there are show a substantial fall in the
share owned by the richest people in the community. In 1974 about 25 per
cent of personal wrealth was owned by the top 1 per cent of the adult popula¬
tion, and over 78 per cent by the top 20 per cent. The value of state pension
rights has a marked effect on these figures; in particular the share of the top
1 per cent falls by over 40 per cent while the share of the bottom 80 per cent of
the adult population is nearly doubled. The proportion of personal wealth
held in the form of physical assets rose from less than a third in i960 to
almost 60 per cent in 1974, reflecting especially the increasing importance of
dwellings. There has been a marked decline in the relative importance of
company securities in the composition of personal wealth.
Until recently the pattern of expenditure has been changing. Expenditure
on food now accounts for a smaller share of total consumer expenditure than
Total personal income less taxes on income, national insurance contributions, transfers
abroad (net) and taxes paid abroad.

it did ten years ago, although it is still the main item. Increases have taken
place, however, in expenditure on motor vehicles, housing, alcoholic drink,
recreation and entertainment. The proportion of expenditure on clothing and
footwear has fallen.
The general level of nutrition is high. The movement towards a greater use of
convenience (including frozen) foods, and imported foods in the 1960s, has been
partly offset by a reversion to a slightly less expensive diet. The general picture
of British food consumption between 1972 and 1976 shows a drop in con¬
sumption of meat, eggs and sugar and syrups, and increases in diary products
and grain products. Tea and to a lesser extent coffee remain the most popular
drinks. A greater willingness to try unfamiliar foods has given rise to a wider
availability of imported products, as well as to restaurants serving the
national dishes of other countries.
Over the period 1965-75 total consumption of beer (Britain’s most popular
alcoholic drink) rose by 32 per cent; that of spirits by 81 per cent; and that of
wine 113 per cent.
The greatest social changes have been in the lives of women. During the
twentieth century there has been a notable shortening of the proportion of a
woman’s life devoted to the care of children. A woman marrying at the end of
the nineteenth century would probably have been in her middle twenties, and
would be likely to have seven or eight children of whom four or five survived
to the age of five. By the time the youngest was 15 she would have been in her
early fifties and would expect to live a further 20 years, during which custom,
opportunity and health made it unusual for her to do paid work. Today women
marry younger and have fewer children. Usually a woman’s youngest child will
be 15 when she is 45, and she can expect to live another 35 years and is likely to
take paid work until retirement at 60. Even while she has the care of children,
her work is lightened by household appliances and convenience foods. This
significant change in women’s life pattern has only recently begun to have its
full effect on their economic position. Up to about 20 years ago some 85 per
cent of girls left school at the minimum age of 15 and most of them took a
full-time job. However, when they married, they usually left work at once and
often never returned to it, Thus, single women, nearly half of them under 25,
formed some 56 per cent of the female labour force. Today the school-leaving
age is 16, many girls stay at school after that age, and, though women tend to
marry younger, more married women stay at work at least until shortly before
their first child is born. Very many more subsequently return to full- or part-
time work. Such changes have led to a new relationship in marriage, with the
husband accepting a greater share of the burdens and satisfactions of family life,
and with both partners sharing more equally in financing and running the home
according to their respective capacities and interests. However, in spite of these
major social changes and the removal of practically all sex discrimination in
political and legal rights, tradition and prejudice can still handicap women in
their working careers and personal lives. Accordingly, major legislation
promoting equal opportunities for women and equal pay has recently been
brought into force.
Britain has a long history of accommodating minority groups and in the
last hundred years or so a variety of people have settled in the country, some
to avoid political or religious persecution, others seeking a better way of life
and an escape from poverty.
Many Irishmen have made homes in Britain, and comprise the largest
i8

single minority group. Many Jewish refugees started a new life in the country
towards the end of the nineteenth century and in the 1930s, and after 1945
large numbers of other European refugees, Poles in particular, also came to
settle. The large communities from the Indian sub-continent and the West
Indies date from the 1950s and the early 1960s. There are also sizeable groups
of Americans, Australians, Chinese and various west European communities
such as Greek and Turkish Cypriots, Italians and Spaniards.
The minority communities tend to live mainly in the urban centres,
especially the largest towns, and in particular areas within these centres. The
most recent immigrants, such as the Asians and the West Indians, are usually
concentrated in inner city areas, whereas earlier arrivals have tended to move
out to the suburbs. Evidence of minority groups’ cultures can be seen in
many places, for instance in the national dress worn by many Asian women,
foodshops and restaurants of many nationalities, places of worship of different
religions, and market stalls with West Indian fruit and vegetables.
Most minorities share a way of life that is broadly similar to that of the
British community as a whole, though some of the newer arrivals, mainly
from Commonwealth countries and sometimes with a poor command of the
English language or none at all, may face problems of limited employment
opportunities and inadequate housing. In areas with large and fairly recently-
arrived immigrant populations arrangements are made in schools and else¬
where to enable host and minority communities to understand each other’s
traditions better and to help immigrants who need special language training.
Official policy, endorsed by the great majority of British people and
supported by voluntary action in many forms, is that minorities should enjoy
equality of opportunity with the rest of the community in every possible way.
Most people have considerably more free time, more ways in which to spend it
and higher real incomes than had previous generations. Agreed hours of full¬
time work are usually from 39 to 40 hours a week, although many people
actually work somewhat longer (about 45 on average for manual workers)
because of voluntary overtime work, while the hours worked by women and
girls average somewhat less. Most employees work a five-day week.
Almost all full-time employees are entitled to a paid holiday each year in
addition to public holidays and in practically every case the minimum period
is three weeks. Britain has fewer public holidays than nearly all other European
countries.
The number of holidays taken in Great Britain by British residents was 38
million in 1976 compared with 31 million in 1966. More than two holidays in
five in Great Britain are spent at the home of a friend or relative, and over a
quarter involve camping or caravanning. Holidays abroad in 1976 numbered
over 7 million, compared with 5-5 million in 1966, and well over half involved
package arrangements. Spain, by far the most popular destination, received
well over a quarter of all British holiday-makers abroad in 1976. A third of
the population each year, however, takes no holiday away from home.
Leisure patterns generally for the individual are determined very much by
age, sex, social class, income, access to a car and education. A survey quoted
in Social Trends igys found that the percentages of people interviewed who
had taken part in a variety of leisure activities at least once in the four weeks
before the survey were roughly as follows: watching television and listening
to the radio or records, 95 per cent; hobbies 49 per cent; going out for a drink
(the public house—known as the pub or the local—is a traditional social
centre for many people), 38 per cent; gardening (a majority of British families
THE LAND AND THE PEOPLE

have some garden or an allotment despite the high proportion of the popula¬
tion living in urban areas), 30 per cent; eating out, 29 per cent; open-air
outings, perhaps to parks, seaside or countryside, 21 per cent; cultural
outings, 18 per cent; outdoor sports and games, 18 per cent; going to social
clubs,1 12 per cent; film-going, n per cent; watching sports and games, 10
per cent; taking part in indoor sports and games, 10 per cent; visits to build¬
ings and museums, 9 per cent; social and voluntary work, 7 per cent; and
attending leisure classes, 2 per cent.
Television watching is easily the most popular leisure activity, and about
96 per cent of British households have a set. Average weekly viewing figures
for people aged 5 years and over are about 20 hours in February and some 14
or 15 hours in August.
1 These include clubs run by political groups; trade unions; church groups; social,
cultural and academic groups; youth clubs and organisations; and groups of local
business and professional people. The longer-established clubs organised on a national
basis include the Working Men’s Clubs and Institutes, the Townswomen’s Guilds and
the Women’s Institutes.

GENERAL SURVEY
The United Kingdom is a monarchical state. It is a member of the Common¬
wealth1 and of the European Community.
The origins and traditions of the United Kingdom are to be found in each
of its four component parts: England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland.
England was united as a kingdom a thousand years ago, and Wales became
part of the kingdom during the middle ages. The thrones of England and
Scotland were dynastically united in 1603, and in 1707 legislation passed in
the two countries provided for the establishment of a single Parliament of
Great Britain with supreme authority both in England and Wales and in
Scotland. Ireland had had links with the kingdom of England since the
thirteenth century, and in 1800 the creation of the United Kingdom was
completed by a union joining the Irish Parliament to that of Great Britain.
In 1922 Southern Ireland (now the Irish Republic) became a self-governing
country. The six counties of Northern Ireland had in 1920 been given their
own subordinate Parliament, and voted to remain within the United Kingdom.
Arrangements in Northern Ireland are described on p. 54.
The United Kingdom Parliament at Westminster in London—with an
elected chamber comprising members from English, Scottish, Welsh and
Northern Ireland constituencies—therefore represents people sharing very
varied backgrounds and traditions. It has ultimate authority for government
and law-making, but administrative arrangements have developed in such a
way as to take account of the particular needs of different areas.
England and Wales on the one hand and Scotland on the other have different
systems of law, a different judiciary, different education systems, different
systems of local government and, for most domestic matters, different govern¬
ment departments. In Scotland, departments are grouped under a Secretary of
State, and in the administration of Welsh affairs there is a considerable measure
of devolution under a Secretary of State.
Legislation was introduced in the 1976-77 parliamentary session which
would have extended this devolution of decision-making from London by
establishing elected assemblies in Scotland and Wales with responsibility for a
wide range of their domestic affairs. The Scotland and Wales Bill, however,
failed to complete all its parliamentary stages. Legislation is to be introduced
again in the 1977-78 parliamentary session.
The Channel Islands and the Isle of Man (which are Crown dependencies,
not part of the United Kingdom) have their own legislative assemblies and
systems of local administration and of law, and their own courts. At the same
The other members of the Commonwealth are: Australia, Bahamas, Bangladesh,
Barbados, Botswana, Canada, Cyprus, Fiji, The Gambia, Ghana, Grenada, Guyana,
India, Jamaica, Kenya, Lesotho, Malawi, Malaysia, Malta, Mauritius, Nauru, New
Zealand, Nigeria, Papua New Guinea, Seychelles, Sierra Leone, Singapore, Sri Lanka,
Swaziland, Tanzania, Tonga, Trinidad and Tobago, Uganda, Western Samoa and
Zambia. (Nauru is a special member, participating in functional activities but not in
meetings of Heads of Government.)

time, they have a special relationship with the United Kingdom because of
their proximity to it and the antiquity of their connection with the Crown.
The United Kingdom Government is responsible for their defence, their
international relations and, ultimately, their good government. They have
separate arrangements with the European Community which take into account
their special relationship with the United Kingdom.
The Constitution The United Kingdom constitution is formed partly by statute, partly by
common law and partly by conventions, which have never been codified and
are not directly enforceable in a court of law, but which, nevertheless, are
regarded as rules of the constitution. Because the constitution is not contained
in any single document, and because it can be altered by the passing of an Act
of Parliament or by general agreement to vary, abolish or create a convention,
it can the more readily be adapted to changing political conditions and ideas.
The organs of government are readily distinguishable although their
functions often intermingle and overlap. They are:
1. the legislature, the supreme authority in the realm (see p. 25);
2. the executive, which consists of: {a) the Government—that is the Cabinet
and other ministers of the Crown, who are responsible for initiating and
directing national policy (see p. 37); (b) government departments, most of
them under the control of ministers and all staffed by civil servants, which are
responsible for administration at the national level (see p. 40); (c) local
authorities, which administer and manage many services at the local level
(see p. 62); and (d) public corporations which may be responsible for the
operation of particular nationalised industries or of a social or cultural
service, for example, and which are subject to ministerial control in varying
degrees; and
3. the judiciary, which determines common law and interprets statutes, and
is independent of both the legislature and the executive.
THE MONARCHY
The monarchy is the most ancient secular institution in the United Kingdom.
Its continuity has been broken only once in over a thousand years; and, in
spite of interruptions in the direct line of succession, the hereditary principle
upon which it was founded has never been abandoned. The royal title in the
United Kingdom is: ‘Elizabeth the Second, by the Grace of God of the United
Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and of Her other Realms
and Territories Queen, Head of the Commonwealth, Defender of the Faith,
etc., etc., etc.,’. The form of the royal title is varied for the other member
nations of the Commonwealth of which the Queen is Sovereign, to suit the
particular circumstances of each.
The seat of the monarchy is in the United Kingdom. In the Channel
Islands and the Isle of Man the Queen is represented by a Lieutenant-
Governor. In the other member nations of the Commonwealth of which the
Queen is Sovereign, her representative is the Governor-General, who is
appointed by her on the advice of the ministers of the country concerned and
is wholly independent of the United Kingdom Government. In the United
Kingdom dependencies the Queen is usually represented by governors who
are appointed by the Crown, having various executive and legislative powers,
and are responsible to the United Kingdom Government for the good govern¬
ment of the countries concerned.

Succession,
Accession and
Coronation
Acts of
Government
The title to the Crown derives partly from statute and partly from common
law rules of descent. Lineal Protestant descendants of Princess Sophia (the
Electress of Hanover, grand-daughter of James I of England) are alone
eligible to succeed, and although succession is not bound to continue in its
present line, it cannot now be altered other than by common consent of the
member nations of the Commonwealth of which the Queen is Sovereign.
Rules of descent provide that the sons of the Sovereign are in order of succes¬
sion to the throne according to their seniority; if there are no sons, the daughters
succeed in order of their seniority. When a daughter succeeds, she becomes
Queen-Regnant and the powers of the Crown are vested in her as fully and
effectively as though she were a king. By convention, the consort of a king
takes the rank and style of her husband; the converse, however, does not apply
and the constitution has never attached any special rank or privileges to the
husband of the Queen-Regnant although in practice he fills an important
role in the life of the nation.
There is no interregnum between the death of one Sovereign and the
accession of another. Immediately on the death of his or her predecessor the
new Sovereign is proclaimed at an Accession Council to which all members of
the Privy Council are summoned. The Lords Spiritual and Temporal, the
Lord Mayor, aldermen and other leading citizens of the City of London, and
the High Commissioners in London of the member nations of the Common¬
wealth are also invited to attend.
The coronation of the Sovereign follows the accession after an interval of
possibly a year or more. The ceremony has remained much the same in
substance for over a thousand years although the details have frequently been
modified to bring it into conformity with the customs of the time. The corona¬
tion service is held at Westminster Abbey in the presence of representatives
of the Lords, the Commons and all the great public interests in the United
Kingdom, of the Prime Ministers and leading members of the other Common¬
wealth countries and of representatives of foreign States.
The Queen is the personification of the State. In law, she is the head of the
executive, an integral part of the legislature, the head of the judiciary, the
commander-in-chief of all the armed forces of the Crown and the temporal
governor’ of the established Church of England. In practice, as a result of a
long evolutionary process during which the absolute power of the monarchy
has been progressively reduced, the Queen acts on the advice of her ministers
which she cannot constitutionally ignore. She reigns, but she does not rule.
The United Kingdom is governed by Her Majesty’s Government in the
name of the Queen.
Within this framework, and in spite of a trend during the past hundred
years towards assigning powers directly to ministers without any necessity
for royal intervention, there are still important acts of government which
require the participation of the Queen. These include the summoning,
prorogation and dissolution of Parliament; giving Royal Assent to Bills
passed by both Houses of Parliament; making appointments to all important
State offices, including those of government ministers, judges, officers in the
armed forces, governors, diplomats and all the leading positions in the
established Church of England; conferring peerages, knighthoods and other
honours1; and remitting all or part of the penalty imposed on a person con-
1 Although most honours are conferred by the Queen on the advice of the Prime
Minister, a few are conferred on her personal selection—the Order of the Garter, the
Order of the Thistle, the Order of Merit and the Royal Victorian Order.

victed of a crime. An important function is the appointment of the Prime
Minister. This is normally automatic, and the Queen must invite the leader of
the political party commanding a majority in the House of Commons to form
a government. If, however, no party has a majority, or if the majority party
has no recognised leader, the Queen must select a Prime Minister, and can
consult anyone she wishes. In international affairs, the Queen as Head of
State has the power to declare war and make peace, to recognise foreign
States and governments, to conclude treaties and to annexe or cede territory.
With rare exceptions (such as in the appointment of the Prime Minister)
these and other acts involving the use of ‘royal prerogative’ powers are nowa*
days exercised by government ministers who are responsible to Parliament
and can be questioned about a particular policy. The law does not require
Parliament’s prior authority before such powers can be exercised, but Parlia¬
ment has the power to pass legislation to restrict or abolish a prerogative right.
Ministerial responsibility for the exercise of powers by the Crown does not,
however, detract from the importance of the Queen’s participation in the
smooth working of government. She holds meetings of the Privy Council,
gives audiences to her ministers and other holders of office at home and
overseas, receives accounts of Cabinet decisions, reads dispatches and signs
innumerable State papers; she must be informed and consulted on every
aspect of the national life; and she must show complete impartiality.
Such is the significance attached to these royal functions that provision has
been made for a regent to be appointed to fulfil them if the Sovereign is totally
incapacitated (or is under the age of 18 years on accession to the throne). The
regent would be the Prince of Wales, and thereafter those in succession to the
throne who are of age. In the event of the Sovereign’s partial incapacity or
absence abroad, provision is made for the appointment of Counsellors of State
(the Duke of Edinburgh, the four adult persons next in succession to the
Crown, and the Queen Mother) to whom the Sovereign may delegate certain
royal functions. Counsellors of State may not, however, dissolve Parliament
(except on the express instructions of the Sovereign), or create peers.
Ceremonial has always been associated with British kings and queens, and,
in spite of the changes that have taken place in the outlook of both the Sovereign
and the people, many traditional customs and usages remain. Royal marriages
and royal funerals are marked by public ceremony. The birthday of the
Sovereign is officially celebrated early in June by Trooping the Colour on
the Horse Guards Parade and is also celebrated as Commonwealth Day.
State banquets take place when a foreign monarch or head of State visits the
United Kingdom; investitures are held at Buckingham Palace; and royal
processions add significance to such occasions as the opening of Parliament,
when the Queen drives in state from Buckingham Palace. The Queen and
other members of the royal family visit many parts of the United Kingdom
every year, and their presence at the inauguration of scientific, artistic,
industrial and charitable works of national importance encourages nation¬
wide interest and publicity. The Queen pays State visits to foreign govern¬
ments, always accompanied by the Duke of Edinburgh, and undertakes
lengthy tours in other countries of the Commonwealth. Other members of
the royal family pay official and private visits overseas.
More than three-quarters of all expenditure arising from the official duties of
the royal family is borne on the votes of public departments—including, for
example, the costs of the royal yacht, the Queen’s Flight, travel by train and

the upkeep of the royal palaces. Apart from this the Queen’s public expenditure
on staff and expenses incurred in carrying out official duties as head of State
is financed from the Civil List, approved by Parliament. Her private expendi¬
ture as Sovereign is met from the Privy Purse, which is supplied mainly from
the revenues of the Duchy of Lancaster; and her personal expenditure as a
private individual from her own personal resources. Annual allowances
approved by Parliament are specifically made to certain other members of the
royal family. No allowances are made to the Queen’s eldest son, the Prince of
Wales, who as Duke of Cornwall is entitled to the net revenue of the estate
of the Duchy of Cornwall (he has voluntarily agreed to surrender half the
revenue to the nation). The Queen meets from her Privy Purse the official
expenses of members of the royal family for whom Parliament has not
specifically provided.
PARLIAMENT
The supreme legislative authority in the United Kingdom is the Queen in
Parliament, that is to say, the Queen and the two Houses of Parliament—the
House of Lords and the elected House of Commons.
The three elements of Parliament are outwardly separate; they are con¬
stituted on different principles; they work in different places; and they meet
together only on occasions of symbolic significance such as the State opening
of Parliament when the Commons are summoned by the Queen to the House
of Lords. As a law-making organ of State, however, Parliament is a corporate
body and cannot as a rule legislate without the concurrence of all its parts.
The Parliament at Westminster can legislate for the United Kingdom as a
whole, or any of the constituent countries separately, or for any combination
of them. Parliament can also legislate for the Channel Islands and the Isle of
Man, which are Crown dependencies and not part of the United Kingdom,
and have subordinate legislatures1 which legislate on island affairs.
Because it is not subject to the type of legal restraints imposed on the
legislatures of countries with formal written constitutions, Parliament is
virtually free to legislate as it pleases: generally to make or unmake any law; to
legalise past illegalities and make void and punishable what was lawful when
done and thus reverse the decisions of the ordinary courts; and to destroy
established conventions or turn a convention into binding law. It can prolong
its own life beyond the normal period without consulting the electorate.
In practice, however, Parliament is slow to exercise its supremacy in this
way. Its members bear in mind the common law which has grown up in Britain
throughout the centuries and act as far as possible in accordance with precedent
and tradition. Moreover, although the validity of an Act of Parliament that
has been duly passed, legally promulgated and published by the proper
authority cannot be disputed in the law courts, no Parliament would be likely
to pass an Act which it knew would receive no public support. The system of
party government in Britain ensures that Parliament legislates with its
responsibility to the electorate in mind.
As a member of the European Community, the United Kingdom recognises
various types of Community legislation, including regulations, which take
1 The legislatures of the Channel Islands (the States of Jersey and the States of
Guernsey) and the Isle of Man (the Tynwald Court) consist of the Queen, the Privy
Council and the local assemblies. It is the duty of the Home Secretary, as the member
of the Privy Council primarily concerned with island affairs, to scrutinise each legislative
measure before it is submitted to the Queen in Council.

direct effect in member countries, and directives, which are binding as to the
result achieved upon each member State to which they are addressed, but
allow the national parliaments to choose the form and method of implementa¬
tion. Britain has accepted the principle of holding direct elections to the
European Assembly. Its members are currently nominated by the national
parliament of the nine Community members. A more detailed account of
Britain’s membership of the European Community is given in Chapter 3.
The main functions of Parliament are (1) to pass laws regulating the life of
the community, (2) to scrutinise government policy and administration,
particularly proposals for expenditure. In discharging these two functions
Parliament helps to bring the relevant facts and issues before the electorate.
By custom, Parliament is also consulted before the ratification of all important
international treaties and agreements, the making of treaties being, in theory
at least, a royal prerogative exercised on the advice of the Government and not
subject to parliamentary approval.
A Parliament (in the sense of a parliamentary period) has a maximum duration
of fi\e years, but may be, and nearly always is, dissolved, and a general election
held, before the end of this term. The maximum life has been prolonged by
legislation passed in the usual way in such rare circumstances as during the
two world wars. Dissolution is ordered by the Queen on the advice of the
Prime Minister, by means of a royal proclamation which, besides dissolving
the existing Parliament, orders the issue of writs for an election, and announces
the date on which the new Parliament is to meet (not less than 20 days after
the dissolution). The proclamation is very soon followed by the issue of writs
in each constituency to cause an election to be held on the day named.
The life of a Parliament is divided into sessions. Each usually lasts for one
year beginning and ending most often in October or November and inter¬
spersed with ‘adjournments’ at night, at weekends, at Christmas, Easter and
the spring holiday and during a long summer recess starting late in July or
early in August. The average number of ‘sitting’ days in a session is about 175
in the House of Commons and about 140 in the House of Lords. At the start of
each session the Queen’s speech in the House of Lords outlines to the mem¬
bers of both Houses the Government’s broad policies and proposed legislative
programme. Each session is terminated by prorogation, a prerogative act
which appoints the day of meeting in a new session (on rare occasions
Parliament has been dissolved without prorogation), and a short speech is
made on behalf of the Queen summarising Parliament’s work during the past
session. Parliament then stands prorogued’ until the new session opens.
Whereas an adjournment does not affect uncompleted business, the effect of
a prorogation is at once to terminate nearly all parliamentary business, so that
all public Bills not completed in the session lapse, and must be reintroduced
in the next unless they are to be abandoned.
The House of Lords consists of the Lords Spiritual and the Lords Temporal.
The Lords Spiritual are the Archbishops of Canterbury and York, the Bishops
of London, Durham and Winchester, and 21 other bishops of the Church of
England, according to their seniority as diocesan bishops. The Lords Tem¬
poral may be sub-divided into (1) all hereditary peers and peeresses of England,
Scotland, Great Britain and the United Kingdom who have not disclaimed
their peerages under the Peerage Act 1963, (2) all life peers and peeresses
created by the Crown under the Life Peerages Act 1958, and (3) those Lords
GOVERNMENT
27
of Appeal in Ordinary who are appointed to assist the House in the perfor¬
mance of its judicial duties and who remain members of the House after their
retirement. Hereditary peerages carry with them a right to sit in the House of
Lords (subject to certain statutory disqualifications), provided the holder is
21 years of age or over, but anyone succeeding to a peerage may, within 12
months of succession, disclaim that peerage for his or her lifetime. Dis-
claimants lose their right to sit in the House of Lords but they gain the right
to vote at parliamentary elections and to offer themselves for election to the
House of Commons. No hereditary peerage has been conferred since 1965.
Not all peers with a right to sit in the House of Lords attend the sittings of
that House. Those who do not wish to attend may apply for leave of absence
for the duration of a Parliament.
Peers who frequently attend the House of Lords (the average daily attendance
is about 270) include elder statesmen and others who have spent their lives in
public service. They receive no salary for their parliamentary work, but they
are entitled to travelling expenses from their homes to the Houses of Parlia¬
ment and within specified limits they may claim payments for expenses
incurred in attending the House (except for judicial sittings).
The House of Lords is presided over by the Lord Chancellor, who takes his
place on the woolsack as ex officio Speaker of the House. In the absence of the
Lord Chancellor his place may be taken by a deputy speaker appointed by
the Crown or a deputy chairman appointed by the House or, if neither a
deputy speaker nor a deputy chairman is present, by a speaker chosen by the
Lords present. The first of the deputy speakers is the Lord Chairman of
Committees, who is appointed each session and takes the chair in all commit¬
tees, unless the House otherwise directs. The permanent officers include the
Clerk of the Parliaments, who is responsible for the records of proceedings
including judgments and for the promulgation of Acts of Parliament; the
other Clerks at the Table; the Gentleman Usher of the Black Rod, who is also
Serjeant-at-Arms in attendance upon the Lord Chancellor; and the Yeoman
Usher who is Deputy Serjeant-at-Arms.
The House of
Commons
The House of Commons is a representative assembly elected by almost
universal adult suffrage and consists of men and women from all sections of
the community. There are 635 seats in the House of Commons (516 for
England, 36 for Wales, 71 for Scotland, 12 for Northern Ireland).
General elections are held after a Parliament has been dissolved and a new
one summoned by the Sovereign. If a vacancy occurs in the House as a result
of the death or resignation1 of a member, or as a result of his elevation to the
House of Lords, a by-election takes place. Members are paid an annual salary
and an allowance for secretarial and research expenses. They also have a
number of other allowances, including travel allowances, a supplement for
London members and, for provincial members, subsistence allowances. The
basic salary for members is £6,270 a year. Some members receive less than
this, with a minimum of £5,958; a £312 a year increase permitted under the
Government’s pay policy for 1975-76 was not paid to members, or was reduced,
if it would have carried their earnings from parliamentary and other sources
over the £8,500 limit for pay rises. (For ministers’ salaries, see p. 39.)
The chief officer of the House of Commons is the Speaker, who is elected
1 If a member wishes to resign from the House, he may apply for what is techni¬
cally an office of profit under the Crown (Bailiff of the Chiltern Hundreds or Steward
of the Manor of Northstead) which automatically disqualifies him from membership
of the House but to which, in fact, no remuneration attaches.

by the members to preside over the House. Other parliamentary officers of the
House are the Chairman of Ways and Means, and two deputy chairmen who
act as Deputy Speakers; these officers are elected by the House on the nomina¬
tion of the Government and, like the Speaker, neither speak nor vote other
than in their official capacity.
Permanent officers of the House (that is, those who are not members of
Parliament) include the Clerk of the House of Commons, who conducts the
business of the House in the official departments under his control and is the
accounting officer for the House of Commons Estimates, and the Serjeant-at-
Arms, who attends upon the Speaker, executes the orders of the Plouse, is the
official housekeeper of the building, and is responsible for its security.
For electoral purposes the United Kingdom is divided into constituencies,
each of which returns one member to the House of Commons. To ensure
equitable representation, four permanent Boundary Commissions (for
England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland) make periodic reviews of
constituencies and recommend any redistribution of seats that may seem
necessary in the light of population movements or for some other reason.
Election to the House of Commons is decided by secret ballot. British
subjects (except Members of the House of Lords) and citizens of the Irish
Republic resident in the United Kingdom are entitled to vote provided they
are 18 years of age or over, not subject to any legal incapacity to vote, and
registered in the annual register of electors for the constituency. Service
voters, that is members of the armed forces, Crown servants and staff of the
British Council employed overseas, together with their wives and husbands
if accompanying them, may also be registered for an address in a constituency,
if they normally reside there. Each elector may cast one vote at a polling
station in person, but service voters, voters who are abroad on polling day
because of the nature of their occupation (and their wives or husbands who
accompany them) may vote by proxy. Absent voting facilities also exist for
merchant seamen. Voters entitled to vote by post include those who have a
service vote but happen to be in the United Kingdom at the time of an election,
persons employed on polling day as constables or by the returning officer,
candidates in another constituency and their wives and husbands, and electors
who are blind or physically incapacitated.
Voting is not compulsory but, of about 40 million people entitled to vote
in the most recent elections in February and October 1974, some 78-1 per cent
and 72-8 per cent respectively cast their votes. The candidate who polls the
most votes in any constituency is elected; an absolute majority (a greater
number of votes than those cast for all other candidates combined) is not
required.
Anyone, man or woman, who is entitled to vote and who has reached the
age of 21 can stand for election. Undischarged bankrupts, clergymen of the
Church of England, Church of Scotland, Church of Ireland and Roman
Catholic Church, and certain people holding offices of profit under the Crown
are, however, not eligible. The last category is defined in the House of Com¬
mons Disqualification Act 1975 an<^ includes holders of judicial office, civil
servants and some local government officers, members of the regular armed
forces, members of the police forces and members of public corporations and
government commissions. A candidate usually belongs to one of the main
national political parties, although smaller parties or groupings also nominate
candidates, and individuals may be nominated without party support.
The maximum sum of money that a candidate may spend on his election

campaign is £ 1,075, plus £0-06 for each eight electors in a borough constituency
and j£o*o6 for each six electors in a county constituency. A candidate may
send by post (free of postal charge) an election address to each elector in his
constituency. All other expenses, apart from the candidate’s personal expenses,
must not exceed the statutory limit.
The party system, existing in one form or another since the seventeenth
century, is an essential element in the working of the constitution.
The present system is based upon the existence of organised political parties,
each laying rival policies before the electorate. Whenever there is a general
election or a by-election, the parties may put up candidates for election; any
other citizen who wishes may also stand. The electorate then indicates, by its
choice of candidate at the poll on election day, which of the opposing policies
it would like to see put into effect. The percentages of votes cast for the main
political parties in the October 1974 general election and the resulting distribu¬
tion of seats in the House of Commons are given in Table 4.
The party which wins the majority of seats (although not necessarily the
majority of votes) at a general election, or which is able to command a majority
of supporters in the House of Commons, usually forms the Government. By
tradition, the leader of the majority party is appointed as Prime Minister by
the Sovereign; and its most outstanding members in the House of Commons
and the House of Lords receive ministerial appointments on the advice of the
Prime Minister. The largest minority party becomes the official Opposition
with its own leader1 and its own council of discussion or ‘shadow Cabinet’;
while the members of any other parties or any independents who have been
elected may support or oppose the Government according to their party’s or
their own view of the policy being debated at any given time.

BRITAIN 1978: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Parliamentary
Procedure
The effectiveness of the party system in Parliament largely rests on the
relationship between the Government and the Opposition. Depending on
the relative voting strengths of the parties in the House of Commons, the
Opposition might seek to overthrow the Government by securing a sufficiently
large adverse vote on a major policy issue. In general, however, its aims are
to contribute to the formulation of policy and its expression in legislation by
constructive criticism of the Government’s approach; to oppose specific
government proposals that it considers objectionable; to secure concessions on
government Bills; and to increase support outside Parliament and enhance
its chances of success in by-elections or at the next general election.
The detailed arrangements of government business are settled, under the
direction of the Prime Minister and the Leader of the House, by the Chief
Government Whip in consultation with the Chief Opposition Whip. The
Chief Whips together constitute the ‘usual channels’ often referred to in the
House of Commons when the question of the possibility of finding time for
debating some particular issue is discussed. The direction of the business of
the House is primarily the responsibility of the Leader of the House, and it is
his duty to provide all reasonable facilities for the House to debate matters
about which it is concerned.
Outside Parliament, party control is exercised by the national and local
organisations. Inside Parliament, it is exercised by the Chief Whips and their
assistants (chosen within the party) whose duties include keeping members
informed of forthcoming parliamentary business, maintaining the voting
strength of their parties by ensuring the attendance of members at important
debates, and conveying upwards to the party leadership the opinions of their
back-bench members. The Chief Government Whip in the House of Com¬
mons is Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasury; of the other Government
Whips, three (one of whom is deputy Chief Whip) are officers of the Royal
Household, five hold titular posts as Lords Commissioners of the Treasury
and seven are paid Assistant Whips. Salaries are likewise paid to the Chief
Opposition W hip and his counterpart in the House of Lords, and to two of
the Assistant Whips for the Opposition in the House of Commons. The
Government Wffiips in the House of Lords hold offices in the Royal Household
and sometimes act as spokesmen for the Government in debates.
Annual financial assistance from public funds helps opposition parties in
Parliament to carry out their business. It is limited to parties which had at
least two members elected at the last general election or one member elected
and a minimum of 150,000 votes cast. The formula is: ^500 for every seat
and £1 for every 200 votes, up to a maximum of £150,000. The Government is
considering whether public funds should be made available to political parties
for their work outside Parliament, and to candidates for election expenses.
Parliamentary procedure is largely based on custom and precedent, supple¬
mented by standing orders governing details of practice in each House. The
system of debate is much the same in the two Houses: for instance, every
matter is determined upon questions put from the chair or woolsack and
resolved in the affirmative or negative, as the case may be; and members speak
from wherever they have been sitting and not from a rostrum. The main
difference is that in the House of Lords the office of Speaker carries with it no
authority to check or curtail debate, such matters being decided by the general
sense of the House, whereas in the Commons the Speaker has full authority
to give effect, promptly and decisively, to the rules and orders of the House.
He must guard against abuse of procedure or any infringement of minority
GOVERNMENT
31
Legislative
Proceedings
rights, and he has a discretion whether to allow or disallow any closure motion
(that is, a motion to end discussion so that the matter may be put to the vote).
He has certain powers to check irrelevance and repetition in debate, and to
save the time of the House in various other respects. In case of grave disorder
he can adjourn the House or suspend the sitting on his own initiative.
Voting in the House of Commons is carried out under the direction of the
Speaker, and it is his duty to pronounce the final result. If an equal number
of votes is cast for and against the motion under debate, the Speaker must
give the casting vote, but he does so only in accordance with rules which pre¬
clude an expression of opinion on the merits of the question.
The procedure on voting in the House of Lords is similar to that in the
House of Commons, except that the Speaker or chairman has an original, but
no casting, vote—the House of Lords being generally governed by the principle
that unless there is a majority in favour the question is decided in the negative.
When the House is sitting judicially (see pp. 84 and 97) the question is put
in such a way that, if the votes are equal, there is no interference with the
judgment under appeal.
The House of Commons has a public register of members’ pecuniary
interests. Members with a direct pecuniary interest in a matter before the
House must abstain from voting in connection with it, though in order to
operate as a disqualification the interest must be immediate and personal, and
not merely of a general or remote character. In any proceedings of the House
or in transactions with other members or with ministers or civil servants,
members must disclose any relevant pecuniary interest or benefit.
All proceedings of either House are public, except on extremely rare occa¬
sions; the minutes (in the House of Commons called Votes and Proceedings
and in the House of Lords, Minutes of Proceedings) and the speeches (The
Official Report of Parliamentary Debates, Hansard) are published daily.
The records of the Lords from 1497 and of the Commons from 1547, together
with the parliamentary and political papers of certain past members of the
Houses, are available to the public in the House of Lords Record Office.
Parliamentary proceedings are not transmitted on television, but permanent
radio broadcasting of the proceedings of both Houses of Parliament is to
begin in the 1977-78 parliamentary session.
The law undergoes constant reform in the courts as established principles
are interpreted, clarified or refashioned to meet new circumstances, but
substantial changes are the responsibility of Parliament and the Government
through the normal legislative process.
Draft legislation takes the form of a parliamentary Bill. Most Bills are public
Bills involving measures relating to public policy, but there are also private
Bills which deal solely with matters of individual, corporate or local interest.
Public Bills can be introduced either by a Government minister or by a ‘private
member’ of either House of Parliament who does not hold office in the Govern¬
ment. Most public legislation is in fact drafted on behalf of ministers, and has
the support of the Cabinet before being presented to Parliament by the
appropriate minister.
In the modern legislative process, before a Government Bill is finally
drafted, there is normally considerable consultation with, for instance,
professional bodies, voluntary organisations and other agencies interested in
the subject matter of the proposals, such as major interest groups and ‘pressure’
groups which aim to promote a specific cause. Proposals for legislative
changes are sometimes set out by the Government in ‘White Papers’ which
32
BRITAIN 1978: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
may be debated in Parliament before the introduction of a Bill. From time to
time ‘Green Papers’ are published setting out for public discussion major
ministerial proposals which are still at the formative stage.
Public Bills can be introduced in either House. As a rule, however, Bills
likely to raise political controversy go through the Commons before the
Lords, while those of an intricate but uncontroversial nature often pass through
the Lords first. A Bill with a mainly financial purpose must be introduced in
the Commons, and a Bill involving taxation or the spending of public money
must be based on resolutions agreed to by that House, often after debate, before
it can be introduced. If the main object of a Bill is to create a public charge, it
can only be introduced by a minister, which gives the Government considerable
control over legislation.
At the beginning of each session private members of the Commons ballot
for the chance to introduce a Bill during time specially allocated for private
members’ Bills; the first 20 are successful. A private member may also present
a Bill after question time on notice given, or seek leave to introduce a Bill under
the ‘ten minute rule’ which allows two speeches, one in favour of and one
against the measure, after which the House decides whether to allow the Bill
to be brought in. Private members’ Bills do not often proceed very far, but a
few become law. If one secures a second reading, the Government usually
introduces any necessary money resolution. Private members’ Bills may be
introduced in the House of Lords at any time, without notice, but the time
that can be given to them in the Commons is strictly limited.
The process of passing a public Bill is similar in both Houses of Parliament.
The Bill receives a formal first reading on introduction, it is printed, and after
a while (between one day and several weeks depending on the nature of the
Bill) it is given a second reading after a debate on its general principles and
merits. In the Commons a non-controversial Bill may be referred to a second
reading committee to recommend whether it should be taken as read a second
time. After a second reading in the Commons, a Bill is usually referred for
detailed examination to a standing committee (see p. 33). If the House so
decides, the Bill may be referred to the whole House sitting in committee.
The House may vote to limit the time devoted to examining a Bill by passing a
timetable motion, commonly referred to as a ‘guillotine’. In the Lords a Bill
is considered by a committee of the whole House as a matter of course, unless
the House decides to refer it to a Public Bill Committee. The committee
stage is followed by the report stage, during which previous amendments
may be altered and new amendments incorporated. At the third reading a
Bill is reviewed in its final form. In the Commons this stage is taken without
a debate unless there is a motion in the name of six members that the question
be not put forthwith’—a procedure of which substantial use is made.
After the third reading the Bill is sent from the Commons to the Lords
where it goes through broadly the same stages. Similarly a Bill which starts in
the Lords and is passed by that House is then sent to the Commons for all the
stages there. Amendments made by the second House generally must be
agreed by the first, or a compromise reached, before a Bill can become law.
Most Government Bills introduced and passed in the Lords pass through
the Commons without difficulty because of their non-controversial nature.
However, should any Lords Bill be unacceptable to the Commons it would
not generally become law because no debating time would be allotted to it.
The Lords, on the other hand, cannot in general prevent a Bill insisted upon
by the Commons from finally becoming law. In the normal course of events
they either accept a Commons Bill without changes, or they amend and return
GOVERNMENT
33
it for consideration by the Commons, who frequently agree to the amendments
made. In practice, the Lords pass without amendment such financial Bills as
the Finance Bill, which authorises taxation, or the Consolidated Fund or
Appropriation Bill, which authorises national expenditure. A Bill that deals
only with taxation or expenditure must become law within one month of being
sent to the Lords, whether or not they have agreed to it, unless the Commons
directs to the contrary. If no agreement is reached between the two houses on
a non-financial Commons Bill (or an amendment to it) the Lords can in practice
delay the Bill (with certain exceptions) for about 13 months. At the end of this
time it becomes law in the form originally passed by the Commons. The limita¬
tions on the power of the Lords are based on the belief that the principal legisla¬
tive function of the non-elected House nowadays is to act as a chamber of
revision, complementing, not rivalling, the elected House.
When a Bill has passed through all its parliamentary stages, it is sent to the
Queen for royal assent, after which it is part of the law of the land and known
as an Act of Parliament. The royal assent has not been refused since 1707.
Private Bills, which can be promoted by people or organisations outside
Parliament, go through substantially the same procedure as public Bills, but
most of the work is done in committee, where proceedings follow a semi¬
judicial pattern: the promoter must prove the need for the powers or privileges
he seeks, and objections on the part of the opposing interests are heard. Both
parties may be legally represented.
Delegated The system of delegated legislation, which is used to relieve pressure on
Legislation parliamentary time, empowers ministers and other authorities to regulate
administrative details after a Bill has become an Act. In order to minimise the
risk that powers thus conferred on the executive might supersede or weaken
parliamentary government, they are normally delegated to the Queen in
Council or to authorities directly responsible to Parliament, that is, to govern¬
ment ministers, government departments for which ministers are responsible,
or to organisations whose regulations are subject to confirmation or approval
by ministers who thereby become responsible to Parliament for them. More¬
over, the Acts of Parliament by which particular powers are delegated normally
provide for some measure of parliamentary control over legislation made in
the exercise of these powers, for instance, by reserving to Parliament the right
to confirm or annul the orders themselves. Certain Acts also require direct
consultation with organisations which will be affected thereby before rules
and orders (in the form of statutory instruments) are made.
A joint committee of both Houses reports on the technical propriety of
statutory instruments. In the House of Commons, in order to save time, they
are frequently referred to standing committees although any decisions on them
are reserved to the House.
Parliamentary
Committees
Standing
Committees
Either House may resolve itself into a committee, known as a committee of
the whole house, to consider Bills in detail, clause by clause, after their second
reading. A committee of the whole house is presided over by the Chairman of
Ways and Means (the Chairman of Committees in the House of Lords) or a
deputy chairman.
House of Commons standing committees include those which examine public
Bills at the committee stage and, in certain cases, at the second reading and
report stages; two Scottish standing committees; the Scottish Grand Com¬
mittee; the Welsh Grand Committee; and the Northern Ireland standing

committee. Ordinary standing committees have no distinctive names, being
referred to simply as Standing Committee A, B, C, and so on. Each has between
16 and 50 members with the balance of the parties reflecting as far as possible
that in the House as a whole. The Scottish Grand Committee, which comprises
all 71 Scottish members and ten to 15 others, considers the principles of
Scottish Bills referred to it at second reading stage, the Scottish estimates and
other matters relating exclusively to Scotland. The Welsh Grand Committee,
with all 36 Welsh members and up to five others, considers Bills referred to it
at second reading stage, and matters relating exclusively to Wales. The
Northern Ireland committee considers matters relating specifically to the
province. A standing committee on regional affairs comprising the 516 members
from English constituencies considers matters relating to the English regions.
Select committees are generally set up, by either House, to help Parliament
with the control of the executive by examining some aspect of administration
and reporting to the House. They may be appointed as occasion demands, or
for a session, or for the rest of the life of a Parliament. On rare occasions a
parliamentary Bill is examined by a select committee (a procedure additional
to the usual legislative process). Select committees are constituted on a party
basis, in approximate proportion to party strength in the House.
Select committees in the Commons include committees on public accounts,
expenditure, privileges, House of Commons’ services, nationalised industries,
the Parliamentary Commissioner for Administration, science and technology,
race relations and immigration, overseas development, and European Com¬
munity secondary legislation. The Committee of Selection and the Standing
Orders Committee have duties relating to private Bills, and the Committee of
Selection also chooses members to serve on standing committees.
In their scrutiny of administrative activity and government policies, the
committees question ministers, senior civil servants and interested bodies and
individuals. They bring before Parliament and the public generally, through
their hearings and published reports, a body of fact and informed opinion on
many important issues and they build up considerable expertise in their
subjects of inquiry.
In the House of Lords there are sessional committees on the European
Community, standing orders (Private Bills), personal Bills, procedure,
offices, privileges, leave of absence, Lords’ expenses and selection, and the
Appeal and Appellate Committees.
The two Houses may agree to set up joint select committees, and joint com¬
mittees are also appointed in each session to deal with Consolidation Bills and
delegated legislation.
In addition to the official committees of the two Houses there are several
important party organisations or committees. The Conservative and Unionist
Members Committee, popularly known as the 1922 Committee, consists of
the back-bench membership of the party. The Parliamentary Labour Party,
is a corporate body comprising all members of the party in both Houses; when
the Labour Party is in office a liaison committee acts as a channel of communi¬
cation between the Government and its back-benchers in both Houses; when
the party is in opposition the Parliamentary Labour Party is organised under
the direction of a Parliamentary Committee.
Control of the Government in power is exercised in the final analysis by the
ability of the House of Commons to force the Government to resign either by
GOVERNMENT
35
passing a resolution of ‘no confidence’ or by rejecting a proposal which the
Government considers so vital to its policy that it has made it a ‘matter of
confidence’ or, ultimately, by refusing to vote the money required for the
public service. A number of opportunities for a searching examination of
government policy by both the Opposition and the Government’s own back¬
benchers are provided in parliamentary procedure. These include:
1. Question time, which is an hour of parliamentary time on Monday, Tuesday,
Wednesday and Thursday during which ministers, in rotation, answer
questions put to them on matters for which they are responsible. Parlia¬
mentary questions are one means of eliciting information about the
Government’s intentions, as well as a way of airing, and possibly securing
redress of, grievances brought to members’ notice by constituents.
2. The right of members to use motions for the adjournment of the House to
initiate discussions on constituency cases or matters of public concern.
There is a half-hour adjournment period at the end of public business; and
immediately before the adjournment for each recess (Christmas, Easter,
spring and the summer) a day is spent discussing matters raised by private
members. Moreover, if a member wishes to discuss a ‘specific and important
matter that should have urgent consideration’ he may, at the end of question
time, ask leave to move the adjournment of the House. If the Speaker
accepts the terms of the motion, he asks the House for leave for it to be put
forward. Leave can be given unanimously, or if 40 or more members
support the motion, or if fewer than 40 but more than ten support it and
the House (on a vote) is in favour. Once leave has been given, the matter
is debated for three hours, usually on the following day.
3. The 29 ‘supply’ days each session, which were formerly used to discuss
details of proposed government expenditure, and which are nowadays
time for the Opposition to choose subjects for debate. (Scrutiny by small
committees has been found more apt for detailed expenditure proposals.)
Procedural opportunities for criticism of the Government also arise during
the debate on the address in reply to the Queen’s speech at the beginning of
a session, during debates or motions of censure for which the Government
gives up part of its own time, and during debates on the Government’s legisla¬
tive proposals.
Certain opportunities for criticism of the Government are also provided in
the House of Lords at question time and during debates on specific motions.
The involvement of Parliament, and more particularly the House of Com¬
mons, in the management of the revenues of the State and payments for the
public service is described in Chapter 17, Finance.
Arrangements have been made in Parliament to keep members informed
about European Community developments, and to enable them to scrutinise
and debate matters which are to be decided in Community institutions.
Parliamentary The Parliamentary Commissioner for Administration is an independent
Commissioner statutory officer whose function is to investigate complaints of maladministra-
for Administration tion brought to his notice by members of the House of Commons on behalf of
members of the public. His powers of investigation extend to actions taken by
central government departments in the exercise of their administrative func¬
tions, but not to policy decisions (which are the concern of the Government
and can be questioned in Parliament). Certain administrative actions also
outside his jurisdiction include matters affecting relations with other countries
and the activities of British officials outside the United Kingdom.
36
BRITAIN 1978: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Parliamentary
Privilege
In the performance of his duties, the Parliamentary Commissioner has
access to all departmental papers, and reports his findings to the member of
Parliament who presented the case. The Parliamentary Commissioner reports
annually to Parliament and may submit such other reports as he thinks fit.
A select committee considers these reports.
Each House of Parliament enjoys certain rights and immunities designed to
protect it from unnecessary obstruction in carrying out its duties. These
rights apply collectively to each House and individually to each member.
For the Commons the Speaker formally claims from the Crown ‘their ancient
and undoubted rights and privileges’ at the beginning of each Parliament.
These include freedom of speech in debate; freedom from arrest in civil
process; and the right of access to the Crown, which is a collective privilege
of the House. Further privileges include the right of the House to control its
own proceedings (so that it is able, for instance, to exclude strangers if it so
wishes); the right to pronounce upon legal disqualifications for membership
and to declare a seat vacant on such grounds; and the right to penalise those
who commit a breach of its privileges.
The privileges of the House of Lords include: freedom of speech in debate;
freedom of access to the Sovereign for each peer individually; and the right to
commit for contempt. These privileges are not formally claimed by the Speaker
as in the House of Commons; they exist independently.
THE PRIVY COUNCIL
Until the eighteenth century, the Sovereign in Council, or Privy Council, was
the chief source of executive power in the State. As the system of Cabinet
government developed, however, the Privy Council became less prominent.
Many of its powers were transferred to the Cabinet as an inner Committee
of the Privy Council, and much of its work was handed over to newly created
government departments, some of which were originally committees of the
Privy Council. Nowadays the Privy Council is responsible for advising the
Sovereign to approve Orders in Council, of which there are two kinds, differing
fundamentally in constitutional principle: those made by virtue of the royal
prerogative, such as Orders approving the grant of royal charters of incorpora¬
tion; and those made under statutory powers, which are the highest form of
delegated legislation. It is an accepted principle that members of the Privy
Council attending meetings at which Orders in Council are made do not
thereby become personally responsible for the policy upon which the orders
are based; this rests with the minister responsible for the subject matter of
the order in question, whether or not he was present at the meeting.
The Privy Council also advises the Crown on the issue of royal proclamations,
some of the most important of which relate to prerogative acts (such as sum¬
moning or dissolving Parliament) of the same validity as Acts of Parliament.
The Privy Council’s own statutory responsibilities, which are independent
of the powers of the Sovereign in Council, include powers of supervision over
the registering bodies for the medical and allied professions.
Apart from Cabinet Ministers, who must be Privy Counsellors and are
sworn of the Council on first assuming office, membership of the Privy Council
(which is retained for life) is accorded by the Sovereign on the recommendation
of the Prime Minister to certain eminent persons in independent monarchical
countries of the Commonwealth. There are usually about 340 Privy Coun-

sellers. The whole Privy Council is called together only on the death of the
Sovereign or when the Sovereign announces his or her intention to marry.
There are a number of Privy Council committees whose meetings differ from
those of the Privy Council itself in that the Sovereign cannot constitutionally
be present. These advisory committees may be prerogative committees, such
as those which deal with legislative matters submitted by the legislatures of
the Channel Islands and Isle of Man and with applications for charters of
incorporation; or they may be provided for by statute as are those for the
universities of Oxford and Cambridge and the Scottish universities.
The Judicial Committee of the Privy Council is the final court of appeal
from the courts of the United Kingdom dependencies, courts of independent
members of the Commonwealth which have not elected to discontinue the
appeal, courts of the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man, and certain other
courts, some professional and disciplinary committees and church sources.
The administrative work of the Privy Council committees is carried out in
the Privy Council Office under the Lord President of the Council, a senior
Cabinet minister. He is assisted by a Minister of State and a Parliamentary
Secretary, and has special responsibility for devolution policy (see p. 20) and
other work relating to the development of political institutions.
HER MAJESTY’S GOVERNMENT
Her Majesty’s Government is the body of ministers responsible for the
administration of national affairs.
The Prime Minister is appointed by the Crown, and all other ministers are
appointed by the Crown on the recommendation of the Prime Minister.
The majority of ministers are members of the House of Commons. How¬
ever, the Government must be fully represented by ministers in the House of
Lords as it requires spokesmen of standing to expound its policy and justify
its actions to that House. The Lord Chancellor is always a member of the
House of Lords.
The composition of the Government is subject to variation from time to time,
both in the number of ministers and in the titles of some offices. The creation
of a paid ministerial office with entirely new functions requires legislation, but
the abolition of an office, the transfer of functions from one minister to another,
or a change in the designation of a minister may be effected by Order in
Council. Ministers may be classified as follows:
The Prime Minister is also First Lord of the Treasury and Minister for the
Civil Service. The head of the Government became known as the Prime
Minister during the eighteenth century. The unique position of authority
enjoyed by the holder of this office derives from his ability to command a
majority in Parliament and from his power to submit his own choice of ministers
to the Queen and to obtain their resignation or dismissal individually. By
convention, the Prime Minister always sits in the House of Commons.
It is the duty of the Prime Minister to inform the Sovereign of the general
business of the Government; to preside over the Cabinet; and to exercise a
general supervision over departments, settling departmental differences and
approving important departmental decisions where reference to the Cabinet
is not required.

The Prime Minister’s other responsibilities include making recommenda¬
tions to the Sovereign for the appointment of Church of England archbishops,
bishops and deans and the incumbents of some 200 Crown livings, as well as
for appointments to high judicial offices, such as the Lord Chief Justice, Lords
of Appeal in Ordinary, and Lord Justices of Appeal. He also advises the Crown
on appointments of Privy Counsellors, Lord-Lieutenants and certain civil
appointments, such as Lord High Commissioner of the General Assembly of
the Church of Scotland, Poet Laureate, Constable of the Tower, and some
university appointments which are in the gift of the Crown. The Prime
Minister makes similar recommendations for appointments to various public
boards and institutions, such as the British Broadcasting Corporation, as well
as to various royal and statutory commissions. He likewise makes recommenda¬
tions to the Sovereign for the award of many civil honours and distinctions
and of Civil List pensions (awarded to people who have achieved eminence in
science and the arts and who are in some financial need) and selects the
trustees of certain national museums and institutions.
Departmental ministers are in charge of government departments. The
holders of these offices, who are usually in the Cabinet, are known as ‘Secretary
of State’ or ‘Minister’, or they may have a special title, as in the case of the
Chancellor of the Exchequer (who is responsible for the Treasury and a
number of sub-departments).
Non-departmental ministers include the holders of various traditional offices—
the Lord President of the Council, the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster,1
the Lord Privy Seal, the Paymaster General—and from time to time Ministers
without Portfolio. Usually these ministers have few or no departmental
duties and are thus available to perform any special duties which the Prime
Minister may wish to entrust to them.
The Lord Chancellor holds a special position, being a Minister of the Crown
with departmental functions and also head of the judiciary in England and
Wales. The four Law Officers of the Crown are: for England and Wales, the
Attorney General and the Solicitor General; for Scotland, the Lord Advocate
and the Solicitor General for Scotland.
Ministers of State are usually appointed to assist ministers in charge of govern¬
ment departments in which the work is particularly heavy or complex or
where it involves frequent travelling abroad. It is possible for a Minister of
State to be given a place in the Cabinet and to be paid accordingly.
Junior ministers generally have the title of Parliamentary Secretary or, where
the senior minister is a Secretary of State, Parliamentary Under Secretary of
State. They share in parliamentary debates, answering parliamentary questions,
and assisting in departmental duties. In certain cases, however, they may be
given responsibility, directly under the departmental minister, for specific
aspects of the department’s work. The Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasury
and the other Lords Commissioners of the Treasury are in a different category
as Government Whips (see p. 30).
The Duchy of Lancaster is an inheritance which, since 1399, has always been enjoyed
by the reigning Sovereign; it is kept quite apart from his or her other possessions and
is separately administered by the Chancellor.

Responsibility
Ministerial salaries range from ^5,500 a year for junior ministers and £7,500
to £9,500 for more senior ministers to £13,000 for Cabinet ministers. The
Prime Minister receives £20,000 a year.
Ministers in the House of Commons, including the Prime Minister, also
have parliamentary salaries of £3,208 (£3,908 for non-Cabinet ministers) and
are entitled to claim the allowances paid to all members of the House. The
Lord Chancellor receives £20,208 a year, including £2,500 for his speakership
of the House of Lords.
The Cabinet is composed of about 20 ministers personally selected by the
Prime Minister and may include the holders of departmental and non-
departmental offices. Its origins can be traced back to the informal conferences
that the Sovereign held with his leading ministers, independently of the Privy
Council, during the seventeenth century. After the Sovereign’s withdrawal
from an’active role in politics in the eighteenth century, and the development
of organised political parties stimulated by successive extensions of the
franchise from 1832 onwards, the Cabinet assumed its modern form.
The functions of the Cabinet are: the final determination of the policy to
be submitted to Parliament; the supreme control of the national executive in
accordance with the policy agreed by Parliament; and the continuous co¬
ordination and delimitation of the authority of government departments. The
exercise of these functions is vitally affected by the fact that the Cabinet is a
group of party representatives, depending for its existence upon the support
of a majority in the House of Commons.
The Cabinet meets in private and its proceedings are strictly confidential.
Its members are bound by their oath as Privy Counsellors not to disclose
information about its proceedings. The Official Secrets Acts forbid the publica¬
tion of Cabinet as well as of other State papers (although after they have been
in existence for 30 years they may be made available for inspection in the
Public Record Office) and a resigning minister wishing to make a statement
involving disclosure of Cabinet discussions should first obtain the permission
of the Sovereign through the Prime Minister.
In normal times the Cabinet meets for a few hours once or twice a week
during parliamentary sittings, and rather less frequently when Parliament is
not sitting. Additional meetings may be called by the Prime Minister at any
time if a matter urgently requiring discussion should arise, lo keep the
amount of work coming before the Cabinet within manageable limits, a great
deal of the work of the Cabinet is carried on through the committee system,
which involves the reference of any issue either to a standing Cabinet committee
or to an ad hoc committee composed of the ministers primarily concerned.
The committee then considers the matter in detail and either disposes of it or
reports upon it to the Cabinet with recommendations for action. Ministers not
in the Cabinet may attend its meetings for discussion of matters affecting
their departments; they may also be members of Cabinet committees.
The Secretary of the Cabinet and senior officials of the Cabinet Office
attend meetings of the Cabinet and its committees as appropriate.
The term ‘ministerial responsibility’ refers both to the collective responsibility
which ministers share for government policy and actions and to ministers
individual responsibility to Parliament for their departments’ work.
The doctrine of collective responsibility, which was fully accepted by the
middle of the nineteenth century, means that the Cabinet is bound to offer
4o
BRITAIN 1978: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
unanimous advice to the Sovereign, even when its members do not hold
identical views on a given subject. Consequently it means that the policy of
departmental ministers must be consistent with the policy of the Government
as a whole. In principle, once the Government’s policy on a particular matter
has been decided, each minister is expected to support it, unless he chooses to
resign, as he is free to do if he cannot agree with his colleagues on a matter of
general policy or on a single major issue. On rare occasions, ministers have
been allowed free votes in the House of Commons on government policies
involving important issues of principle. In the exceptional circumstances
preceding the referendum in June 1975 on British membership of the European
Community, ministers were free to campaign in the country against the
Government s recommendation. This freedom did not, however, extend to
parliamentary proceedings and Government business.
The individual responsibility of a minister for the work of his department
means that, as political head of that department, he is answerable for all its
acts and omissions and must bear the consequences of any defect of administra¬
tion, any injustice to an individual or any aspect of policy which may be
criticised in Parliament, whether he is personally responsible or not. Since the
majority of ministers are members of the House of Commons, they are available
to answer questions and to defend themselves against criticism in person.
Departmental ministers who are in the House of Lords must be represented
in the Commons by someone qualified to speak on their behalf, usually a
Minister of State or a Parliamentary Secretary.
Departmental ministers normally decide all matters within their responsi¬
bility, although on important political matters they will usually wish to consult
their colleagues collectively, through the Cabinet or a Cabinet committee.
Any decision by a departmental minister binds the Government as a whole.
Phe responsibility of ministers for their departments is an effective way of
ringing government under public control, for the knowledge that any depart¬
mental action may be reported to and examined in Parliament discourages the
taking of arbitrary and ill-considered decisions.
On assuming office ministers must resign directorships in private and public
companies. In all other respects they must order their affairs in such a way that
there is no conflict between their public duties and their private interests.
GOVERNMENT DEPARTMENTS
Government departments are the main instruments for giving effect to govern¬
ment policy when Parliament has passed the necessary legislation. They may,
and frequently do, work with and through local authorities, statutory boards,
and government-sponsored organisations operating under various degrees of
government control.
A few departments have existed for over 200 years. Many more have come
into existence during the past half-century to match the widening scope of
government activity. The election of a party of a different political complexion
does not necessarily affect the number or general functions of government
epartments although a radical change in policy may be accompanied by some
organisational change.
The work of some departments (for instance, the Ministry of Defence)
covers the United Kingdom as a whole. Other departments (for example, the
Department of Employment) cover England, Wales, and Scotland, but not
Northern Leland. Others, such as the Department of Education and Science
and the Department of the Environment, are mainly concerned with affairs in
Internal
Organisation
Advisory Bodies
GOVERNMENT 41
England. There are separate departments for Scotland, Northern Ireland and
Wales.
A department is usually headed by a minister. Certain departments in
which questions of policy do not normally arise are headed by a permanent
official, and a minister with other duties is responsible for them to Parliament.
For instance, the minister in charge of the Civil Service Department is
responsible for the Central Office of Information, Her Majesty’s Stationery
Office, and the Department of the Government Actuary; and Treasury
ministers are responsible for the Board of Customs and Excise, the Inland
Revenue, the Department for National Savings and a number of small depart¬
ments including the Treasury Solicitor’s Department, the Royal Mint, and
the National Debt Office. Generally, departments receive their funds directly
out of money provided by Parliament and are staffed by the Civil Service.
Departments differ in size and in the volume, type and complexity of their
work. Since each department makes its own arrangements for discharging its
duties, there are variations in internal organisation. Most departments, how¬
ever, have certain features in common: for instance, the minister of a major
department is likely to have at the head of his officials a permanent secretary,
sometimes assisted by one or more second permanent secretaries, and also one
or more deputy secretaries, and a varying number of under-secretaries and
assistant secretaries. Usually major departments also have a principal finance
officer and a principal personnel and organisation officer. Many departments
also have their own legal advisers or solicitors, economists, statisticians and
their own information divisions. The Government Statistical Service, which
includes the Central Statistical Office (CSO), the Business Statistics Office
(BSO), the Office of Population Censuses and Surveys and the statistics divi¬
sions of the major departments, provides a service of statistical information
and advice. Each department compiles statistics relating to its own policy
area and publishes them, usually through its own publications. Information
about individual industries is published by the BSO in Business Monitors.
Some departments maintain a regional organisation, and some that have
direct contact with the public throughout the country also have local offices.
Many government departments are assisted by advisory councils or committees
(several hundred in all) which undertake research and collect information,
mainly to enable ministers to ascertain informed opinion before coming to a
decision involving a legislative or executive act. In some cases there is a
statutory obligation on a minister to consult a standing committee, but usually
advisory bodies are appointed at the discretion of the minister concerned
because he feels the need for their advice.
The membership of the advisory councils and committees varies according
to the nature of the work involved, and may include civil servants and repre¬
sentatives of varying interests and professions—for instance, industrialists,
trade unionists, university and industrial scientists, educationists, lawyers and
local government councillors and officers.
In addition to these standing advisory bodies, there are ad hoc committees
which the Government frequently sets up to examine and make recommenda¬
tions on specific matters. For certain important inquiries Royal Commissions,
whose members are selected on the grounds of their wide experience and
diverse knowledge, may be appointed (by royal warrant). Royal Commissions
examine written and oral evidence from government departments and

interested organisations and individuals, and on this evidence submit
recommendations. The Government may accept the recommendations in
whole or in part, or it may decide to take no further action or to delay action.
Inquiries may also be undertaken by departmental committees, appointed by
the head of the appropriate department.
of The following pages provide an outline of the principal functions of the main
government departments. They are arranged in alphabetical order, except for
the Cabinet Office, the Civil Service Department, and the Treasury (which,
in view of their central positions, are placed first) and the Scottish and Northern
Ireland departments (which are grouped at the end of the section). Further
information on the work of departments is given in later chapters under the
relevant subject headings.
The Cabinet Office, headed by the Secretary of the Cabinet, under the direction
of the Prime Minister, comprises the Cabinet Secretariat, the Central Policy
Review Staff, the Central Statistical Office and the Historical Section.
The Cabinet Secretariat serves ministers collectively in the conduct of
Cabinet business. It operates as an instrument in the co-ordination of policy
at the highest level. Functions of the office include circulating the memoranda
and other documents required for Cabinet or Cabinet committee business,
preparing agenda for meetings of the Cabinet and its committees, recording
their discussions and circulating the minutes, keeping in touch with the pro¬
gress of action on decisions, and safeguarding the security of documents.
The Central Policy Review Staff advises ministers collectively on major
issues of policy.
The Central Statistical Office is concerned with the preparation and inter¬
pretation of the statistics necessary to support economic and social policies
and management. It is directly responsible for the central economic aggregates
such as the national accounts, balance of payments, financial statistics and
measures of output; it co-ordinates the statistical work of other departments
and agencies; and it prepares a number of statistical publications.
The Historical Section of the Cabinet Office is in the process of completing
the official histories of the second world war, and is responsible for the
preparation of official histories of certain peace-time events.
The Civil Service Department is under the control of the Prime Minister as
Minister for the Civil Service, with responsibility for the day-to-day work of
the department delegated to a senior minister. The department’s Permanent
Secretary is also the official head of the Home Civil Service.
The department is responsible for personnel management in the Civil Ser¬
vice, which includes policy and central arrangements for recruitment, training
(including the Civil Service College), promotion, general career management,
catering, welfare and retirement. It is also responsible for the size and deploy¬
ment of manpower, for pay, pensions, and conditions of service in the Civil
Service, and for the co-ordination of pay and pension policies in the public
sector as a whole. The department’s further responsibilities include the
development and application of new systems and techniques in management
and administration; the provision of central management services covering
subjects and techniques such as organisation and methods, operational research
and management accounting; and central planning, procurement and co¬
ordination of data processing in government.

The Civil Service Commission, which is responsible for the recruitment of
all permanent civil servants, forms part of the Civil Service Department. In
matters concerned with recruitment policy, the commissioners are respon¬
sible to ministers in the normal way, but in the selection of individuals for
appointment, they act under Order in Council and are completely independent
of ministers.
The Office of the Parliamentary Counsel is responsible for the drafting of all
Government Bills, except Bills or provisions of Bills extending exclusively to
Scotland, which are handled by the Lord Advocate’s Department. The office
drafts all financial and other parliamentary motions and amendments moved
by the Government during the passage of Bills; advises departments on
questions of parliamentary procedure; and attends sittings (and committees)
of both Houses as required. In addition the Parliamentary Counsel draft
subordinate legislation when specially instructed, and advise the Government
on legal, parliamentary and constitutional questions falling within their
special experience.
Nominally the heads of the Treasury are the Lords Commissioners: the
First Lord of the Treasury (always the Prime Minister), the Chancellor of the

on the interpretation and application of the law. The department undertakes a
considerable amount of conveyancing connected with the transfer of property,
administers the estates of persons dying without known relatives and intestate,
and deals with the outstanding property and rights of dissolved companies.
The Statutory Publications Office is staffed and controlled by the Treasury
Solicitor, who reports annually on its work to the Statute Law Committee
(a body appointed by the Lord Chancellor from among the judiciary and legal
profession in Great Britain).
Some government departments are wholly dependent on the Treasury
Solicitor for their legal work; some have their own legal staffs for a proportion
of the work and draw on the Treasury Solicitor for special advice and, often,
for litigation and conveyancing; others, whose administrative work is based
on or deals with a code of specialised law or involves a great deal of legal work,
have their own independent legal sections.

for Scotland
The W elsh Office maintains close and continuous working relationships
with the government departments mainly concerned with economic and
industrial affairs through the W elsh Planning Board. Advice on the implica¬
tions for Whales of national policies, particularly in the economic field, is also
available to the Secretary of State through the WTelsh Council. The Welsh
Office is in Cardiff; there is also a small ministerial office in London.
Scotland has its own system of law and a wide measure of administrative
autonomy. The Secretary of State for Scotland, a United Kingdom Cabinet
minister, has responsibility in Scotland (with some exceptions) both for the
formulation of policy and for its execution in such matters as agriculture and
fisheries, education, local government and environmental services, social
work, health, housing, roads and certain aspects of shipping and road trans¬
port services. He is also responsible for a range of other functions from police
and fire services to sport and tourism. At ministerial level he is assisted by two
Ministers of State and three Parliamentary Under Secretaries of State.
The LTnited Kingdom Government’s administrative functions arising from
these responsibilities are carried out principally by five Scottish departments
based in Edinburgh and known as the Scottish Office. A management group
including five heads of departments under the chairmanship of the Permanent
Under Secretary of State advises the Secretary of State, particularly on
questions, such as the allocation of resources and forward planning, with
which more than one of the departments are concerned.
The Secretary of State also has a major and expanding role in the planning
and development of the Scottish economy. He has important additional
functions related to industrial development, with his assumption of respon¬
sibility for selective financial assistance to industry in Scotland and the
establishment of the Scottish Development Agency which is responsible to
him. He also has responsibilities for the activities in Scotland of the Manpower
Services Commission, the Training Services Agency and the Employment
Services Agency.
He plays a full part in the Government’s determination of energy policy
and exercises a co-ordinating function over activities in Scotland—such as
the location of industry, the creation of employment and the land-based
facilities needed for North Sea oil and gas—which are not his direct respon¬
sibility but have an important effect on the country’s economy. United King-
dom government departments with significant Scottish responsibilities have
offices in Scotland with delegated powers, and work closely with the Scottish
Office.
The Secretary of State is responsible for legal services in Scotland, and other
important functions are exercised by the two Scottish Law Officers: the Lord
Advocate and the Solicitor General for Scotland. On many domestic matters,
in order to reflect distinctive Scottish features and the different conditions
and needs of the country and its people, there is separate legislation relating
wholly to Scotland, or else clauses of special application to Scotland only are
inserted in Acts which otherwise apply to the United Kingdom generally.
The Department of Agriculture and Fisheries for Scotland has a general re¬
sponsibility for, and in most cases administers, government measures for the
promotion and development of farming in Scotland. It also has responsibilities
for the oversight and protection of the Scottish inshore, deep sea and fresh¬
water fisheries, and functions relating to certain harbours.

Scottish Sports Council, and with the development of the arts, and has
responsibility for the administration of the National Galleries of Scotland, the
Royal Scottish Museum (including the Scottish United Services Museum),
the National Museum of Antiquities of Scotland, and the National Library of
Scotland.
The Scottish Home and Health Department is responsible for the central
administration of functions relating to law and order, including the police
service, criminal justice (other than the conduct of prosecutions) and legal aid
and the administration of penal institutions. It also has responsibility for the
administration of the National Health Service in Scotland, legislation relating
to public service superannuation schemes in Scotland and the administration
of the teachers’ and National Health Service superannuation schemes. The
Home and Health Department is the central authority in Scotland for the
fire service, for certain home defence and emergency services, and for legisla¬
tion concerning shops, theatres, cinemas, licensed premises and land tenure
matters.
In addition to the main departments, there are a number of other Scottish
departments, all of which work in varying degrees under the direction of the
Secretary of State. Such departments include the Department of the Registrar-
General for Scotland (the General Register Office); the Scottish Record Office;
and the Department of the Registers of Scotland. There are also Scottish
branches of the Great Britain and United Kingdom departments under the
direction of controllers, who are responsible for ensuring that the execution in
Scotland of the policy and procedure of their departments is in accordance with
Scottish conditions and needs.

The Law Officers of the Crown for Scotland (the Lord Advocate and the
Solicitor General for Scotland) are the chief legal advisers to the Government
on Scottish questions and the principal representatives of the Crown for the
purposes of litigation in Scotland. The Lord Advocate is also closely concerned
with questions of legal policy and administration and is himself responsible
for the institution and direction of all prosecutions on indictment in Scotland,
and the control of summary prosecution in the Sheriff and District Courts,
which are conducted by officials of the Procurator Fiscal Service. In some of
this work the Lord Advocate is assisted by the Lord Advocate’s Department
and the Scottish Courts Administration. The members of the Lord Advocate’s
Department also act as legal advisers on Scottish questions to certain govern¬
ment departments who have no Scottish legal adviser of their own. The work
relevant to prosecutions is centred in the Crown Office in Edinburgh.
The Parliamentary Draftsmen for Scotland, incorporated in the Lord
Advocate’s Department, are responsible to the minister concerned and to the
Law Officers for the drafting of government Bills affecting the law of Scotland,
The Scottish Courts Administration has a general responsibility to the Secre¬
tary of State for the organisation, administration and staffing of the courts
and court offices, and is responsible to the Lord Advocate for certain functions
in the field of law, including the programme of the Scottish Law Commission,
proposals for law reform and questions involving private international law,
international conventions and associated problems, the jurisdiction and
procedure of the Scottish courts, and enforcement of judgments.
Northern Ireland has traditionally had its own subordinate legislature respon¬
sible for a broad range of domestic matters. The Government of Ireland Act
1920 enacted a constitution which, while preserving the supreme authority of
the United Kingdom Parliament and reserving certain matters to that Parlia¬
ment, provided Northern Ireland with its own legislature and executive to
deal with domestic ‘transferred’ matters. These arrangements remained in
force until 1972 when, following several years’ political instability and sectarian
violence in Northern Ireland, a period of direct rule was introduced, with
executive powers exercised by a Secretary of State for Northern Ireland and
laws made by Order in Council. In 1973 a new type of constitution for the
Province provided, among other things, for the devolution of powers to a
legislative assembly and a ‘power-sharing’ executive. These arrangements
came into force in January i974> following widespread opposition in
Northern Ireland the Assembly was prorogued in May 1974. In July 1974 the
Northern Ireland Act was passed, providing for the election of a Con¬
stitutional Convention to consider what arrangements for the government of
Northern Ireland would be likely to command most widespread acceptance
throughout the community. The Act provided that, in the interim period
(defined as one year from the passing of the Act), the United Kingdom Govern¬
ment and Parliament should continue to be responsible for law and order,
electoral matters and business of national importance, such as foreign policy,
defence and certain aspects of taxation, while the Secretary of State for
Northern Ireland should be responsible to the United Kingdom Parliament
for the devolved services (such as agriculture, commerce, education, health,
finance and the environment). It further provided that, during this period,
laws for Northern Ireland on matters formerly within the competence of the
Assembly should be made by Order in Council. The Northern Ireland
Assembly was dissolved at the end of March 1975, and elections to the Con-

stitutional Convention and its first meeting took place in May of that year.
In March 1976, the Convention was dissolved, having failed to reach agreement
on the central issue of a system of government which would provide for a form
of partnership and participation. Direct rule as provided for in the Northern
Ireland Act has since been extended for further periods of a year and Northern
Ireland departments continue to be under the direction and control of the
Secretary of State for Northern Ireland. The Government’s principal aim,
however, is to see stable and effective devolved government supported by both
Protestant and Roman Catholic communities.
The Northern Ireland Office is the department of the Secretary of State for
Northern Ireland who, assisted by two Ministers of State and two Parliamen¬
tary Under Secretaries of State, has overall responsibility, and is fully answer-
able to Parliament, for the government of Northern Ireland. In addition to
exercising personal responsibility for constitutional developments, law and
order and security in Northern Ireland, the Secretary of State is closely con¬
cerned with financial and economic matters in the Province. The four other
ministers are in charge of the various Northern Ireland departments, the activi¬
ties of which are co-ordinated as necessary.
The Northern Ireland departments’ functions are listed below.
The Department of Agriculture is responsible for the development of Northern
Ireland’s agricultural, forestry and fishing industries. Its functions also include
the collection of agricultural census data, the compilation of statistics, the pro¬
vision of extensive advisory services to farmers, and the promotion of agricul¬
tural research, education and training. The department acts as agent of the
Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food in agricultural support and the
implementation of the European Community’s common agricultural policy.
The Department of the Civil Service is responsible for the general management
and control of the Northern Ireland Civil Service.
The Department of Commerce is concerned with the development of Northern
Ireland’s industry and commerce, and with the administration of schemes of
assistance to industry. The department also has responsibilities in connection
with electricity and other fuel undertakings; harbours (other than fishery har¬
bours) ; the tourist trade; the regulation and inspection of mines and quarries;
mineral development; consumer protection; the registration of companies,
societies, credit unions and insurance and unit trusts; and the administration
of an industrial forensic science department.
The Department of Education’s functions include the development of primary,
secondary, further and higher education, the library service and the youth
service; oversight of the five education and library boards which are responsible
for the local administration of the education, library and youth services;
teacher training; and museums. The department gives financial assistance to
the universities and the Ulster College, the Arts Council, Armagh Observatory
and other educational services. It is further responsible for formulating and
sponsoring policies for the improvement of community relations and com¬
munity services and grant-aids district councils and voluntary organisations
in the provision of sporting and social facilities.

The Department of the Environment is responsible for housing, planning,
comprehensive development, the construction and maintenance of roads and
bridges, water supply and sewerage services, local government, the Develop¬
ment Officer service, transport and traffic matters (including road safety), pol¬
lution control, amenity lands (country parks, nature reserves and areas of
natural beauty), environmental public health, historic buildings and ancient
monuments, street lighting and the fire service.
The Department of Finance’s responsibilities include the control of the expen¬
diture of the Northern Ireland departments, liaison with the United Kingdom
Treasury and the Northern Ireland Office on financial matters, and the manage¬
ment of Northern Ireland’s Civil Service.
The department also has certain duties in relation to: constitutional and
legal policies and law reform; charities and charitable funds; provision and
maintenance of public buildings; building regulations, liaison with the con¬
struction industry; property valuation; ordnance survey; public records; the
registration of births, deaths and marriages; the registration of title of land;
miscellaneous licensing functions; and the registration of clubs.
The Department of Health and Social Services is responsible for all aspects of
health and personal social services and the administration of the social security
schemes.
The Department of Manpower Services is responsible for the administration of
the employment service in Northern Ireland; employment statistics; an advi¬
sory service to companies; sponsorship of Enterprise Ulster; and government
training centres and various industrial training schemes. The department also
has functions in connection with industrial relations, provides the factory in¬
spectorate and is concerned with disabled persons, contracts of employment,
redundancy pay and wages councils. The Labour Relations Agency is respon¬
sible for ensuring good industrial relations in Northern Ireland. The Equal
Opportunities Commission is concerned with the elimination of sex dis¬
crimination in employment, while the Fair Employment Agency is responsible
for promoting equal employment opportunities for persons of different
religious beliefs and political opinions.
THE CIVIL SERVICE
A civil servant in Britain is a servant of the Crown (not being the holder of a
political or judicial office), who usually is paid wholly and directly out of money
voted by Parliament and works in a civil capacity in a department of govern¬
ment. Some civil servants work for Crown bodies, which are not government
departments (the Manpower Services Commission and its agencies are
examples), and are paid out of government grants to these bodies. Including
part-time staff (two part-time officers being reckoned as equivalent to one
full-time), there are about 750,ooo1 civil servants (just over one-third of
them women), roughly 275,000 of whom are engaged in the provision of public
services paying sickness benefits and pensions, collecting taxes and contribu¬
tions, running employment services, staffing prisons, and providing services to
industry and agriculture. About 260,000 are employed in the Ministry of
As part of Government efforts to limit public expenditure, steps are being taken to
contain the increase in the size of the Civil Service.
GOVERNMENT
57
Structure
Defence, including the Royal Ordnance factories and Royal Dockyards. The
rest are about equally divided between: central administrative and policy
duties; service-wide support services, such as accommodation, printing and
information; and largely financially self-supporting services, for instance those
provided by the Department for National Savings and the Royal Mint.
Over 70 per cent of civil servants work outside the London area, and plans
have been made for further dispersal from the capital.
The total of civil servants includes about 175,000 industrial staff, mainly
manual workers in government industrial establishments, whose pay and condi¬
tions of service are largely separately administered, and differ quite substanti¬
ally, from those for non-industrial grades.
Stability of administration is ensured by the political neutrality of the service.
Although a civil servant works under the authority and direction of the minister
of the department to which he is appointed, legally he is a servant of the Crown.
A change of minister, whether due to ministerial changes within a government
or the advent of a government of a different political complexion, does not
involve a change of staff.
Ministers sometimes personally appoint special advisers, who are none the
less civil servants and are paid from public funds, to give them advice on policy
matters. Such appointments lapse when the Government’s term of office ends.
Following the report of the Fulton committee which in 1968 assessed the struc¬
ture, recruitment and management, including management training, of the
service, the Civil Service has been undergoing a programme of reshaping and
modernisation to make it more effective in carrying out its changing tasks.
The structure of the Home Civil Service, which before 1968 tended to reflect
the assumption that specific types of work should be allocated to particular
classes of civil servants on the basis of narrow or vocational qualifications, is
being redesigned to provide for a more flexible deployment of staff so that talent
can be used to the best advantage and the highest levels of the Civil Service seen
to be open to people of outstanding ability, whatever their specialist background
or original method of entry to the service. These structural changes involve the
abolition of classes, and are being allied with personnel management policies
designed to ensure that, although work requiring specialist skill is always done
by appropriately qualified individuals, people with the necessary aptitudes are
given opportunities to gain suitably wide experience to fit them for higher posts.
At the top levels of the Civil Service, where staff are predominantly con¬
cerned with higher management and policy, there is an open and unified struc¬
ture, with three grades—permanent secretary, deputy secretary and under
secretary—available for all types of posts. Posts at these levels are filled by the
people most suitable for them without regard to their academic background or
to whether they were previously in a specialist or administrative stream.
At other levels the structure is being based on a system of occupational
groups, which are the basic groupings of staff for the purposes of pay, recruit¬
ment and personnel management, and categories which consist of one or more
occupational groups having a common pay and grading pattern. Ten cate¬
gories have so far been created, and the groups of staff that are so far members
of them are shown below.
There are five groups within the General Category. The Administration Group
contains some 250,000 staff. Their functions range from the formulation of
policy advice to ministers and the implementation of government policies to
the performance of clerical duties. The Economist Group contains about 390
Categories

staff. They provide economic advice and undertake economic analysis. The
Statistician Group (some 510 staff) undertakes the collection and analysis of
statistics required for government purposes. The Information Officer Group
(some 1,450 staff) carries out a variety of specialised press, publicity, public
relations and information work. The Librarian Group (some 360 staff) carries
out the professional librarian duties in departmental libraries.
The Science Category contains the Science Group (17,250 staff), which is
responsible for conducting scientific research and testing in numerous govern¬
ment laboratories and testing establishments, and for providing advice on
scientific policy. Its members also participate in the planning and management
of advanced technology procurement projects.
There are three groups in the Professional and Technology Category. The
Professional and Technology Group contains some 40,500 staff and includes
a range of professionals—architects, surveyors, quantity surveyors, and
electrical and mechanical engineers—and appropriate supporting staff, whose
main function is to plan and oversee a wide range of government construction
and procurement activities, and to carry out certain inspection and regulatory
activities. The Graphics Officer Group contains about 500 staff responsible for
the preparation of all forms of artwork applied to the wide range of require¬
ments within the government service. The Marine Services Group contains
about 600 staff who operate the civilian-manned vessels of the Royal Maritime
Auxiliary Service.
\\ ithin the Training Category the Instructional Officer Group comprises
some 5,600 staff employed on instruction in a trade, craft or subject, or on ancil¬
lary or supervisory duties connected with instruction.
The Legal Category contains the Legal Group (England and Wales) and the
Legal Group (Scotland), a total of some 960 staff who carry out a wide range of
legal work for government departments.
The Police Category consists of a single Police Group of some 4,600 staff
who form an internal constabulary to carry out normal police functions in
Ministry of Defence establishments.
The Secretarial Group within the Secretarial Category comprises 23,000
typists, who work mainly in small groups, some 4,600 personal secretaries
who work mainly for senior civil servants, and 1,650 superintendents and
controllers.
The Data Processing Category contains a single group of 8,350 staff who
operate processing equipment in computer and other machine installations.
The Research Officer Category contains the Social Science Research Group,
and the Resource and Planning Research Group, a total of some 450 staff who
carry out a wide range of research work.
The 43,500 staff employed in the single group within the Social Security
Category work in local offices of the Department of Health and Social Security.
The ten categories already established account for over 70 per cent of the
non-industrial staff. The intention is that the remainder (including support
staff such as paperkeepers, messengers and office-keepers) will be absorbed into
existing categories or, where this is impossible, into additional categories
set up for the purpose.
The Diplomatic Service was established in 1965 as a separate service of the
Crown and provides the staff for service in the Foreign and Commonwealth
Office and at United Kingdom diplomatic missions and consular posts in
foreign and in independent Commonwealth countries. Its functions include
advising on policy, negotiating with overseas governments and conducting

business in international organisations; promoting British exports and the
advancement of British trade; administering British aid, presenting British
ideas, policies and objectives to the people of overseas countries; and protecting
British interests abroad.
The service has its own grade structure, linked for salary purposes with that
of the Home Civil Service. It also has secretarial, communications and security
officer branches. Various specialists and advisers from home departments or the
armed forces may serve at overseas posts on secondment or attachment to the
Diplomatic Service.
Northern Ireland has its own Civil Service which, subject to regional differ¬
ences, is modelled on its counterpart in Great Britain, recruitment being
effected through its own Civil Service Commission. Interchange of staff
between the two Civil Services occurs to a minor extent only, and is a matter for
departmental agreement in individual cases.
Britain’s dependent territories fill vacancies in their public services by the
appointment of suitably qualified local candidates wherever possible; but when
vacancies cannot be filled by this means generally the Foreign and Common¬
wealth Office, the Ministry of Overseas Development and the Crown Agents
for Oversea Governments and Administrations are asked to recruit other
candidates, principally from the United Kingdom. Hong Kong has its own
Government office in London with responsibility for recruiting to the Hong
Kong public service.
Recruitment to the Civil Service is the responsibility of the Civil Service Com¬
mission which, working in conjunction with departments, ensures that staff
are selected on the basis of fair and open competition. The selection of junior
staff such as those engaged in clerical and manual work, is undertaken almost
entirely by departments. The commission, however, always issues the ‘certifi¬
cate of qualification’ necessary for permanent appointment. The appointment
of a successful candidate is made by the department concerned.
For the Administration Group, which forms the central part of the Home
Civil Service, entry is at three levels relating broadly to the academic achieve¬
ments of university honours graduates; 18-year-old school-leavers; and 16-
year-old school-leavers. The selection procedure for the highest of these levels
(the Administration Trainee entry) comprises qualifying tests, followed by a
series of tests and interviews at the Civil Service Selection Board and an inter¬
view by the Final Selection Board. The next level (the Executive Officer Entry)
selection from among those possessing the necessary academic qualifications is
in two stages, a series of qualifying tests followed by an interview. For the
clerical entrants selection is normally by interview only.
Entry to the professional and technical grades usually requires appropriate
qualifications in the subject concerned, and selection is on the basis of past
record and by interview.
In all except the smallest government departments, there are full-time training
officers and instructors whose task it is to help identify the training needs of the
staff and to organise courses, both general and technical, to provide for their
varying requirements. A substantial number of management courses is run
within the Civil Service both by departments and by the Civil Service College.
Use is also made of external management courses in business schools, the
Administrative Staff College, Henley, and other centres.
6o
BRITAIN 1978: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Methods of training within the Civil Service combine lectures, discussion
groups, instructional visits and case-studies with the use of many audio-visual
aids such as closed-circuit television and video-tape recordings, instructional
films and programmed learning. There is also a considerable amount of ‘on-the-
job’ training. Civil servants are regularly moved between the different branches
of their department and sometimes between departments so that they can gain
as wide an experience as possible of Civil Service work.
In order that they may continue their education, arrangements are made for
the release of civil servants under the age of 18 to attend appropriate courses
usually on one day a week (‘day release’ schemes). Adult staff are assisted
financially to undertake, mainly in their own time, private studies leading to
recognised educational or professional qualifications in approved subjects.
There are also opportunities for civil servants in mid-career to obtain fellow¬
ships or otherwise to go on sabbatical leave to undertake research in areas of
interest to themselves or their departments.
Training is co-ordinated by the Training Division of the Civil Service
Department which is responsible, in conjunction with the Civil Service
College, for the analysis and determination of training needs to be met cen¬
trally, and which exercises advisory functions in regard to departmental
training. Central training is provided by the Civil Service College which
offers a wide range of courses and seminars (some of a broad developmental
nature and others more job-related) for civil servants, including those in specia¬
list groups, at various levels up to and including that of under secretary. Sub¬
jects covered include structure and machinery of government, personnel
management, economics, statistics, social administration, operational research,
computers and information systems. The college also provides courses on Euro¬
pean institutions and their working, and has developed an exchange scheme
with other European countries.
Promotion
Conditions of
Service
A period of probation (varying according to grade, with extensions in certain
instances) is the rule for all new entrants to the Civil Service.
Promotions are made partly through centrally conducted examinations and
partly by the departments themselves. Promotions or appointments to Deputy
Secretary-level posts and above and all transfers between departments at these
levels are approved by the Prime Minister, who is advised by the official head
of the Home Civil Service.
Normally promotion is from grade to grade, but arrangements exist for
accelerated promotion for staff who have shown exceptional promise.
Machinery for negotiation on conditions of service affecting the Civil Service as
a whole is provided by the National Whitley Council, which is composed jointly
of official and staff representatives. Negotiating machinery for separate sections
of the service is provided through the various staff associations which civil ser¬
vants are encouraged to join (for instance, the Civil and Public Services Associa¬
tion, the Society of Civil and Public Servants and the Institution of Pro¬
fessional Civil Servants), and through departmental Whitley Councils.
In general, the civil servant receives a salary which is based on a fair com¬
parison with that paid for similar work outside the service and usually he re¬
ceives annual increments up to the maximum of the scale of the grade to which
he belongs. The aim of the Civil Service is to ensure that every civil servant
who is capable and efficient realises his or her full potential. Provisions for
pay include an entitlement to pension benefits.
It is possible for staff to interrupt their careers, or to have special leave
Political and
Private Activities

granted, to look after domestic responsibilities, and staff who resign may apply
later to rejoin the service in the grade they held at the time of resignation.
Civil servants are required to work a specified number of hours each week.
Certain grades are eligible for overtime pay for any hours worked in excess of
the standard hours, but this does not apply to the higher grades whose salaries
are determined on the assumption that they will work as long as necessary with¬
out additional pay. The standard working week for office staff is 42 hours (41
in London). Annual leave varies according to grade and length of service up to a
maximum of 30 working days a year.
Sick leave on full pay, less any national insurance benefit received, may be
granted to civil servants for up to six months in any 12 months, and on reduced
pay up to a maximum of one year’s sick leave in any four years; any officer whose
health is permanently impaired may be retired.
The position and functions of a civil servant remain the same whichever
political party is in power; and it is his duty to serve the Government of the day
irrespective of his own political opinion. The extent to which he is free, as a
private individual, to participate in political activities varies according to grade.
For this purpose civil servants are divided into three groups: those who are
completely free to engage in all kinds of national and local political activities
(although if they intend standing for Parliament, they must resign their appoint¬
ment before nomination day on the understanding that if not elected they will
be reinstated in th^ir previous capacity within a week of the declaration of the
election result); those who are free, subject to the acceptance of the need for
discretion and with the permission of the department, to take part in most activi¬
ties except parliamentary candidature; and those who are debarred from
national political activities though they may seek permission to take part in local
government political activities. In the non-industrial Civil Service the com¬
pletely free groups are mostly ancillary staff such as cleaners and messengers.
The intermediate group includes mainly members of the clerical and typing
grades and the granting of permission by the department depends, broadly, on
the nature of the work done. The remainder are not allowed to take part in
national political activities. Permission is usually granted to members of all
groups to engage in local political activities to the maximum extent consistent
with the reputation of the Civil Service for political impartiality and the avoid¬
ance of any conflict with official duties. Where permission is granted, it is sub¬
ject to a code of discretion and to the obligation to notify the department of
election or co-option to a local council. A committee of inquiry was set up by
the Government in May 1976 to review the rules governing political participa¬
tion by civil servants.
All civil servants enjoy the right to register their private political opinions on
appropriate occasions, for instance, at general or local authority elections. They
may also engage in such private activities as they wish, provided that these do
not in any way conflict with their official duties, nor with the provisions of the
Official Secrets Acts 1911 and 1920,1 and the Prevention of Corruption Act
1926. However, since a civil servant must not use his official position to further
his private interests, he is subject to certain restrictions in commerce and
business: for instance, he may not hold private interests in public contracts and
he may not use official information in writing, broadcasting or lecturing without
the approval of his department.
1 The Government is preparing proposals to amend the Official Secrets Acts and to
liberalise the practice relating to official information.

Security
Principal Types
of Local
Authority
As a general rule the political views of civil servants are not a matter of official
concern, but there are some civil duties in which secrecy is so vitally important
to State security that the Government does not feel itself justified in employing
anyone to carry them out whose reliability is in doubt. For this reason no one
who is known to be a member of, or actively associated or in sympathy with, the
Communist Party or with Fascist organisations, or is liable to be a security risk
in any other respect, is employed on secret work.
Each government department is responsible for its own internal security,
and the Security Service, which operates independently under a Director-
General who is responsible for its efficiency to the Home Secretary, deals with
national security. In addition, there is a Security Commission which, if
requested by the Prime Minister in consultation with the Leader of the Opposi¬
tion, may investigate and report on breaches of security in the public service
and, in certain circumstances, advise whether any change in security arrange¬
ments is necessary or desirable.
LOCAL GOVERNMENT
The local government system comprises a pattern of elected councils for
defined areas. The councils represent their own localities, provide a local level
of democracy and make available a wide range of services.
The specific powers and duties of local authorities are conferred on them by
Act of Parliament (or by measures made under the authority of an Act). The
actual administration and the exercise of discretion within statutory limits are
the responsibility of the local authority, but, in respect of certain services, Acts
of Parliament dealing with local government give government ministers defined
powers, some of which are designed to secure a measure of national uniformity
in the standard of service provided or to safeguard public health, while others
are for the protection of the rights of individual citizens. For some services the
minister concerned has wide powers of supervision; for others there are strictly
limited powers. Government policy is to ensure that central government con¬
trols over local authorities are kept to a minimum.
In addition to their statutory powers, ministers concerned with local govern¬
ment give assistance to local authorities by the general issue of advisory circu¬
lars and by giving advice in individual cases.
The main links between local authorities and the central Government are:
in England, the Department of the Environment; in Scotland, the Scottish
Development Department; in Wales, the Welsh Office; and in Northern Ire¬
land, the Department of the Environment for Northern Ireland.
The main pattern of local government organisation in England1 and Wales
(outside Greater London) is a division of the country into 53 large county
authorities, within which there are 369 smaller district authorities. Both types
of authority have independent, locally elected councils, and have separate
functions to perform. County authorities normally provide the large-scale
local government services, while the districts are responsible for the more
local ones (see p. 64). However, in six of the English counties, which are in
heavily populated areas and known as ‘metropolitan’ counties, responsibility
for certain large-scale services rests with the district authorities. In England
populations in the non-metropolitan counties range from 286,000 to about
The possibility of changes in the structure of local government is being considered
by. the Government as one of a number of options for government reform in Great
Britain.

1-4 million (the Isle of Wight with a population of about 111,000 is an excep¬
tion), and in the metropolitan counties from 1-2 to 2-8 million. District authori¬
ties within metropolitan counties have populations of between 172,000 and
1-i million; other districts’ populations average between 75,000 and 100,000,
although many fall outside this range. The local government system in Wales
closely resembles that in non-metropolitan areas of England. Populations in the
counties range from 100,000 to 540,000, and the districts have populations of
between 19,500 and 280,000. English parish councils or meetings in villages
and small towns serve as focuses for local opinion as bodies with limited
powers of local interest. In Wales community councils have similar functions.
Greater London—an administrative area of about 610 square miles (1,580
sq km) and a population of some 7-1 million—is administered by the Greater
London Council, the councils of 32 London boroughs (with populations rang¬
ing from 136,000 to 329,000) and the Corporation of the City of London (the
historic centre which has a resident population of just over 5,000).
On the mainland of Scotland local government is on a two-tier basis: nine
regions are divided into 53 districts, each area having its own elected council.
There are three virtually all-purpose authorities for Orkney, Shetland and the
Western Isles. Provision is made for local community councils to be formed.
These councils have no statutory functions and are not local authorities.
The pattern of local authorities, and of their electoral arrangements, is kept
up to date by Boundary Commissions for England, Wales and Scotland.
In Northern Ireland local environmental and certain other services are the
responsibility of 26 district councils; area boards and local offices responsible
to the appropriate central departments administer other services at a local level.
Populations of the districts range from 13,000 to 363,000.
Local authority councils consist of a number of elected unpaid councillors
presided over by a chairman. They can claim flat-rate attendance allowance as
of right (without proof of loss of earnings) on the performance of council
business; they are also entitled to travelling and subsistence allowances. Parish
and community councillors cannot claim for duties within their own areas.
In England, Wales and Northern Ireland each council annually elects a
chairman and vice-chairman. Some districts have the ceremonial title of
borough granted by royal charter and some are also cities. In boroughs and
cities the chairman is normally known as the Mayor (in the City of London
and certain other large cities, he is known as the Lord Mayor). In Scottish
regions and islands areas the chairman is called the convener and the chairman
of each of the four cities is called the Lord Provost. No general title is laid
down for the chairmen of the other district councils, but some are known as
conveners, while others continue to use the old burghal title of ‘provost’.
The term of office of a councillor elected to any form of local government is
usually four years. In England and Wales county council elections took place
in 1977 and will be held every fourth year thereafter. Metropolitan district
elections are held for a third of the seats in each year when there is no county
council election. Non-metropolitan district councils may adopt the same
procedure or opt for whole council elections; the latter took place in 1976
and will be held again in 1979 and every fourth year thereafter. In London,
elections to the Great London Council were held in 1977 and elections to the
London borough councils will take place in 1978. In Scotland the next
elections for the regions and islands areas will be in 1978. Elections for the
districts were held in 1977. Elections for the district councils in Northern
Ireland took place in 1977 and will be held every fourth year thereafter.

BRITAIN 1978: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Functions and
Services
Any person (including a member of the House of Lords) is entitled to vote
at a local government election in Great Britain provided that he or she is 18
years of age or over, is a British subject or a citizen of the Irish Republic, is not
subject to any legal incapacity and is registered as a local government elector for
the area for which the election is held. A person qualifies for registration as a
local government elector if, on the qualifying date for the register (compiled
annually), he or she is resident in the council area. In Northern Ireland the
qualification for voting is a little different.
A candidate for election as councillor—man or woman—normally stands
as a representative of one of the national political parties, as a member of an
association representing some local interest, or as an independent. He must be
a British subject or a citizen of the Irish Republic and aged 21 or over. In
addition, he must be registered as a local government elector in the area of
the local authority to which he seeks election; or have resided or occupied (as
owner or tenant) land or other premises in that area during the whole of the
12 months preceding the day on which he is nominated as a candidate; or, in
that 12 months, have had his principal or only place of work there. A candidate
is also subject to a number of statutory disqualifications designed to ensure
that unsuitable people do not offer themselves for election.
Local authority areas are generally divided into electoral areas for local
council elections. Administrative counties in England and Wales are divided
into electoral divisions returning one or more councillors. Districts in England,
Wales and Northern Ireland are divided into electoral ‘wards’. In Scotland
in the regions and islands areas the electoral areas are called electoral divisions,
each returning a single member; the districts are divided into wards, similarly
returning a single member. For parish or community council elections in
England and Wales, each parish or ward of a parish (or, in some cases, a com¬
bination of parishes) forms an electoral area which returns one or more
members. For elections to the Greater London Council, Greater London is
divided into electoral divisions, each returning one councillor.
Voting takes place at polling stations arranged by the returning officer con¬
cerned, and under the supervision of a presiding officer appointed for the
purpose. I he procedure for local government voting in Great Britain is similar
to that for parliamentary elections, although facilities for postal voting are
more restricted. In Great Britain each elector has one vote for each seat con¬
tested in his electoral area: he need not record all his votes, but must not give
more than one vote for each candidate. In Northern Ireland local govern¬
ment elections are held on the basis of proportional representation and for this
purpose electoral wards are grouped into district electoral areas. Facilities
for postal voting are available.
The functions of local authorities are far reaching. Some are framed primarily
as duties mandatory on an authority, others are purely permissive.
Broadly speaking, functions in England and Wales are divided between
county and district councils on the basis- that county councils are responsible
for matters requiring planning and administration over wide areas or requiring
the support of substantial resources. Within the metropolitan areas district
councils are responsible for functions needing substantial resources because
they have populations large enough to give such support. District councils as a
whole administer functions of more local significance. In London the division
of functions is slightly different.
In England all county councils are responsible for such matters as strategic
planning, transportation planning, highways, traffic regulation, consumer pro-
GOVERNMENT
65
tection, refuse disposal, police and the fire service. Education, libraries and the
personal social services are functions of county councils in non-metropolitan
areas and of district councils in metropolitan areas. All district councils are
responsible, for instance, for environmental health, housing, decisions on most
planning applications and refuse collection. They may also provide off-street
car parks subject to the consent of the county council. Powers to operate some
functions—such as the provision of museums, art galleries and parks—are
available at both levels; arrangements depend on local agreement.
In Greater London the London boroughs and the Corporation of the City of
London are responsible for the same range of functions as district councils in
metropolitan areas (with the addition of consumer protection). The Greater
London Council (GLC) deals only with those services which by their nature
require unified administration and control over the whole area. In the inner
London area education is administered by the Inner London Education
Authority, an independent committee of the GLC. Responsibility for highways
in London is divided according to the type of road: the main strategic road net¬
work is a matter for the GLC, while the London boroughs look after the other
roads. The boroughs are primarily responsible for the provision of housing,
although the GLC also maintains a stock of housing. It is additionally involved
in such matters as the provision of housing outside London for people from the
London area, assisting the inner London boroughs in relation to slum clearance,
the provision of accommodation for people on the London boroughs’ housing
waiting lists, and the rehousing of its own tenants and those of the London
boroughs whose accommodation needs have changed. Greater London and
certain areas just outside are policed by the Metropolitan Police Force.
In Wales the division of functions between county and district councils is
much the same as that between county and district councils in non-metropolitan
areas of England. The main differences are that Welsh district councils are re¬
sponsible for refuse disposal; they may, subject to the consent of the county
council, provide on-street as well as off-street car parking facilities; and they
may, exceptionally, exercise library and consumer protection functions.
Local authorities in England and Wales may arrange for most of their func¬
tions to be carried out on their behalf by another local authority. The exceptions
to this general rule are functions relating to education, police, the personal social
services and national parks.
In Scotland the regional and district authorities discharge local government
functions in a way broadly similar to that of authorities in England and Wales,
including some at both levels. Orkney, Shetland and the Western Isles, because
of their isolation, have single, virtually all-purpose authorities.
In Northern Ireland, local environmental and certain other services are
administered by the district councils, but responsibility for planning, roads,
water supply and sewerage services is exercised in each district by a local
office of the Department of the Environment for Northern Ireland working
closely with the district council and its staff. Area boards, responsible to
appropriate central departments, administer locally education, public libraries
and the health and personal social services. The Northern Ireland Housing
Executive, responsible to the Department of the Environment, administers
housing.
Internal
Organisation
of Local
Authorities
Local authorities are free to a very considerable extent to make their own in¬
ternal arrangements and to choose the means and methods by which they dis¬
charge their responsibilities. Most councils use the committee system, whereby
questions of policy and principle are decided in full council, and committees are
66
BRITAIN 1978: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Officers and
Employees
Local
Government
Finance
appointed to administer the various services. Parish and community councils in
England and Wales are often able to do their work efficiently in full session
although they appoint committees from time to time as necessary. Some
councils have established policy advisory or co-ordinating committees with
powers to originate policy, subject to the approval of the full council.
The powers and duties of local authority committees (which may be advisory
or executive) are usually laid down in the appointing council’s standing orders.
A council is free to delegate all its powers to committees, except its powers in
connection with raising loans, levying rates (see p. 67), or making financial
demands on other authorities liable to contribute, which are legally reserved to
the council as a whole.
Local authorities can make arrangements among themselves for the discharge
of their functions. These include co-operation through joint committees, joint
teams and the loan of staff. One authority may discharge functions for another,
and may also supply others with a range of goods and services.
The public and the press are admitted to all meetings of a council (and of
committees) but may be excluded while a particular item is considered if the
council (or committee) resolves that publicity for that matter would be pre¬
judicial to the public interest.
The execution of council policy rests with salaried officers and employees, of
whom there may be tens of thousands in the larger authorities. Some 2*8 million
people are employed by local authorities in Great Britain. These include ad¬
ministrative, professional and technical staff, manual workers and teachers.
Although a few appointments, such as chief education and fire officers and the
director of social services, must by law be made by all the authorities responsible
for the functions concerned, councils are individually responsible within
national policy requirements for determining the size and composition of their
work forces and the way they should be used. An authority must not, however,
employ one of its own councillors. In Northern Ireland, each council must
by law appoint a clerk of the council as its chief officer.
As a general rule, employees are of three kinds: heads of departments or chief
officers, whose duties are mainly of an administrative and managerial kind;
subordinate officers employed in an administrative, a professional, clerical or
technical capacity; and manual workers who are employed to do the physical
work for which the council is responsible. Senior staff appointments are usually
made at the instance of the committee or committees particularly concerned;
most junior appointments are made by heads of departments, who are also
responsible for engaging manual workers. Appointments and engagements
always conform to the council’s set establishment, and committees are informed
of any appointments which they have not made themselves.
Rates of pay and conditions of service for local authority staff are within the
jurisdiction of the employing council, although there are recommended scales.
Local authority expenditure in the United Kingdom (on both current and
capital accounts) was nearly £20,000 million in 1976* A clear distinction is made
between capital and current expenditure. Capital expenditure (just under a
quarter of the total) is normally financed by borrowing. Housing, the major
element, accounts for almost a third of the total. The education service accounts
for about a third of current expenditure, followed by roads, the personal social
services, the police, and refuse collection and disposal. Current expenditure is
financed from three principal sources: government grants (over a half in
I97^)» local rates paid by occupiers of land and buildings (almost a third);

and rents from council houses, and other income (about a sixth each).
Each local authority is responsible for its own finance, although in a few
cases several authorities combine to organise a specialised service which
it would be uneconomic for each authority to provide on its own.
Government ‘rate support grants’ to local authorities are paid in aid of revenues
generally. Grants are also paid towards the cost of specific services—either
towards current expenditure, such as on the police, or towards capital expen¬
diture, such as on the acquisition and clearance of derelict land. (In Wales,
approved schemes for the acquisition and clearance of derelict land are financed
by the Welsh Development Agency.) Annual subsidies are paid for local
authority housing.
Rate support grants are distributed among authorities in three parts: the
‘needs’ element which is designed to give most help to authorities whose spend¬
ing needs are greatest; the ‘resources’ element, which is used to supplement the
rate income of authorities whose rateable value per head of population falls
below a standard figure, prescribed for each year; and the ‘domestic’ element,
which compensates authorities for loss of rate income from reductions in rate
poundage which they are required to give to householders. The formula for
distributing the ‘needs’ element is subject to annual variations. Grants are also
made towards the cost of rate rebates for poorer people.
In Northern Ireland the district councils receive specific grants plus a
resources element towards the services they provide.
Rates are local taxes paid by the occupiers of non-agricultural land and build¬
ings to meet the cost of local services (after allowing for grants and other
income). Each occupier’s payment is calculated annually by the rating authority
by multiplying the rateable value of his property (broadly equivalent to its
annual rental value) by the rate poundage—an amount per £ of rateable value
fixed by the authority according to its projected financial needs. Rateable values
are assessed periodically in England and Wales by the Board of Inland Revenue,
which is independent of local authorities. The present valuation lists came into
force in 1973 (1976 in Northern Ireland). Disputes about rating assessments
are heard by local valuation courts, and then, on appeal, by the Lands Tribunal.
In Scotland valuation is on a basis similar to that in England and Wales; but
it is carried out by assessors appointed by the regional and islands councils.
Appeals are heard by the valuation appeal committee of each valuation area and
thereafter by the Lands Valuation Appeal Court of the Court of Session. In
Northern Ireland valuations are carried out by the Valuation Office of the De¬
partment of Finance. There is a right of appeal.
In England and Wales the responsibility for levying and collecting the rates
lies with the district councils and London borough councils. Expenditure by
county councils and the Greater London Council is met by contributions from
district councils and London borough councils respectively, who take these into
account in the rates they levy. In Scotland, every authority determines a rate
for its own services, but the collection of rates and the administration of rating
is the responsibility of regional and islands councils. In Northern Ireland
there are two rates: one set by the district councils (district rate) and the other
by the Department of Finance (regional rate). Both are collected by the depart¬
ment and the appropriate part paid over to the respective councils.
Agricultural land and buildings (apart from living accommodation) and
places of religious worship are exempted from rate payments, and in Scotland
and Northern Ireland industry and freight transport are rated at a half and a
68

quarter, respectively, of their net annual value. Householders benefit from
rate reductions financed by government grant and they have the right to pay
rates in ten instalments a year. In Scotland, the right to pay rates in instalments
extends to all ratepayers. Householders may be entitled to rebates depending
on their needs and resources. Charities pay half the full rate on property they
occupy for charitable purposes but may be given further reliefs by the rating
authorities, which can reduce or remit the rates for a range of non-profit-
making bodies. Full rates may be levied on empty properties. In Northern
Ireland the degree of charitable exemption is decided by the Valuation Office;
empty properties are not rated.
Loans may be raised by local authorities to finance capital expenditure under
general powers conferred by national legislation. For items of expenditure in
key sectors (such as education, housing and roads) local authorities in England
and Wales must seek approval from the government department concerned
before raising loans. For other capital expenditure, each authority receives an
annual loan authorisation within which it determines what sums to borrow and
what projects to undertake. The GLC applies annually for parliamentary sanc¬
tion to raise the money it needs for capital expenditure while the City of
London has ancient charter powers to cover its borrowings. In Northern
Ireland long-term borrowing by district councils is subject to approval by the
Department of the Environment for Northern Ireland. In Scotland depart¬
mental approval is given to capital expenditure, not to loans.
Local authorities may raise long-term loans by means of private mortgages,
issuing stock upon the Stock Exchange and bonds which may or may not be
quoted on the Stock Exchange. Local authorities also have right of access to the
Public Works Loan Board, financed by the Exchequer, or, in Northern Ireland,
to the Government Loans Fund, for long-term borrowing to finance a propor¬
tion of their reckonable capital payments, and may borrow temporarily for a
limited proportion of their current outstanding loan debt.
Internal control of finance is normally exercised on behalf of the council con¬
cerned by a finance committee, whose function it is to keep the financial policy
of the council under constant review. (There is no statutory requirement for
local authorities to appoint a finance committee, but they have to make proper
arrangements for the administration of their financial affairs.) Local authorities
must have their accounts audited. Those in England and Wales can choose
between the district auditor (appointed by the Secretary of State for the En¬
vironment) and an approved private auditor (or partly both). In Scotland the
auditing of accounts is the responsibility of an independent Commission for
Local Authority Accounts in Scotland appointed by the Secretary of State
for Scotland, and in Northern Ireland it is carried out by independent local
government auditors appointed by the Department of the Environment.
A complaints system for local government in England and Wales involves inde¬
pendent statutory Commissions for Local Administration (one each for Eng¬
land and Wales) comprising a number of local commissioners, each responsible
in a particular area of the country for investigating citizens’ complaints of mal¬
administration by local authorities. In Scotland there is a single Commissioner
for Local Administration. The commissioners help local authority councillors
to protect the interests of constituents.
In Northern Ireland a Commissioner for Complaints deals with complaints

alleging injustices suffered as a result of maladministration by district councils,
and certain other public bodies.
THE FIRE SERVICES
The fire services in Great Britain are organised on a local basis, subject to a
measure of central control. The cost is borne by local authorities, aided by
central government through the rate support grant (see p. 67). Every part of
the country is covered by a public fire brigade. Northern Ireland has its own
service responsible to the Northern Ireland Department of the Environment.
Each of 68 fire authorities in the United Kingdom must by law make provision
for fire-fighting purposes, and in particular maintain a brigade of sufficient
strength to meet efficiently all normal requirements (in some parts of Scotland,
authorities are combined to provide fire cover). Other fire-fighting organisa¬
tions are maintained, for instance, by the Army and Air Force Departments of
the Ministry of Defence; by the Department of Industry at certain establish¬
ments; and by some large industrial and commercial concerns.
The Home Secretary and the Secretary of State for Scotland have central
responsibility for the fire service in England and Wales and in Scotland respec¬
tively. Central control is directed mainly towards ensuring the operational effi¬
ciency of brigades. Ministers have statutory powers to make regulations on such
matters as appointments and promotions, standards of training and equipment,
pensions, and disciplinary matters. Their approval is also required for reduc¬
tions in the operational establishments of fire brigades. Each minister is advised
by a Central Fire Brigades Advisory Council, consisting of officers of the re¬
spective home departments, representatives of the local authority associations,
and of the associations representing members of fire brigades, and other persons
with special qualifications, appointed by the minister concerned. Inspectorates
of fire services advise the ministers on operational and technical matters.
Most fire brigade establishments include part-time retained personnel to aug¬
ment and support the full-time strength in return for a retaining fee and call-out
and attendance fee. Volunteer members (who receive no remuneration) under¬
take to attend a fire if called upon. Fire authorities also employ people for duties
in controls communications and mobilising and staff duties. Some brigades
have schemes for the employment of juniors of 16-18 years, prior to their enrol¬
ment as regular members at the age of 18.
Each fire authority must draw up a scheme showing the establishment of
personnel, the number and location of fire stations and the number and type of
appliances considered necessary for the provision of fire cover for its area.
Establishment schemes vary according to the fire risks in the area concerned. In
the United Kingdom there are about 34,000 full-time and 17,500 part-time
operational members of fire brigades.
Recruits and junior ranks in the fire service in England and Wales receive
practical training in basic firemanship at collective training schools run by the
larger fire authorities. In Scotland similar training is carried out at a central
training school. Management and command training is provided for the higher
and middle ranks at the Fire Service Staff College, where high-level operational
studies are also conducted. Fire prevention, practical firemanship, advance¬
ment and instructor training for junior and middle ranks is provided at the Fire
Service Technical College. Both colleges are maintained by the Home Office

and the Scottish Home and Health Department. Facilities for officers from
overseas fire services to study the organisation, current training methods,
appliances and equipment of British fire brigades are arranged by the Home
Office Fire Department.
Every fire authority must buy such appliances and equipment as may be neces¬
sary to meet efficiently all normal fire-fighting requirements in its area. Certain
items of equipment are standardised so that there is complete interchange-
ability when a fire is attended by personnel and appliances from more than one
area. The principal types of fire-fighting appliances are bought by fire authori¬
ties to requirement specifications approved by the Home Office and the Scottish
Home and Health Department on the advice of the respective Central Fire
Brigades Advisory Councils. These specifications ensure that minimum stan¬
dards are maintained, and allow sufficient freedom of design to meet special cir¬
cumstances and encourage further developments.
In the United Kingdom some 5,000 fire-fighting appliances are used (includ-
ing pumps, turntable ladders, hydraulic platforms, water tenders, emergency
tenders, foam tenders and hose-laying lorries), and are housed in nearly
2,000 fire stations.
Each fire authority must appoint a Chief Fire Officer (Firemaster in Scotland)
for its fire brigade. The appointment must be approved by the Home Secretary
or by the Secretary of State for Scotland.
Central control is exercised by the Chief Fire Officer from brigade head¬
quarters. Divisional officers in charge of the geographical divisions into which
most brigade areas are divided are responsible for mobilising forces to deal with
outbreaks of fire in their divisions. Constant communication is maintained
between divisional and brigade headquarters and, if at any time an outbreak of
fire should grow beyond the capabilities of a division, help is sent from one or
more neighbouring divisions, or even from the area of another fire authority.
Under arrangements for mutual help made by all fire authorities, the nearest
available force is sent to a fire, regardless of area boundaries.
Fire authorities have discretion to employ their brigades and equipment for
purposes other than fire-fighting, and they are in fact used in a variety of emer¬
gencies (such as rail, road and aircraft accidents, collapse of buildings, flooding
of premises, leakage of noxious gas or liquids and the rescue of people or animals
from dangerous situations) for which no charges are made. Brigades are also
used, by prior arrangement, for such purposes as emptying swimming pools
and filling water tanks.
Fire authorities are concerned with fire prevention measures relating to most
buildings to which the public have resort or in which they are employed. The
authorities are also under a statutory duty to give advice on fire prevention,
restricting the spread of fires, and means of escape in case of fire. Courses in
fire prevention are held at the Fire Service Technical College for fire brigade
officers.
Fire precautions are not normally required by law in private dwellings, so
that, in addition to enforcement duties, brigades are also involved in educa¬
tional and publicity activities to promote fire safety in the home.
Central government is advised on all these fire prevention matters by the
Joint Fire Prevention Committee of the Central Fire Brigades Advisory Coun¬
cils, representing the service and central and local authorities.
GOVERNMENT
71
Research
Research into the different aspects of fire is undertaken by a number of govern¬
ment departments and other organisations. A comprehensive programme of
research into fire brigade operations, organisation, fire-fighting appliances and
equipment is conducted by the Home Office with the help of the fire service
under the auspices of the Joint Committee on Fire Research of the Central Fire
Brigades Advisory Councils. Individual research projects are undertaken by
the Home Office Scientific Advisory Branch or, under contract to the Home
Office, by other government agencies, notably the Fire Research Station, which
is part of the Building Research Establishment of the Department of the En¬
vironment, or by private consultants.
The Fire Research Station is the main organisation undertaking the study
and investigation of the technical aspects of fire. Its work is supervised by a
steering committee, the membership of which is drawn from the Department
of the Environment, the Home Office and independent sources.
Membership of the
European Community
Formation of
the European
Communities
Britain, together with the Irish Republic and Denmark, joined the original six
countries—Belgium, France, the Federal Republic of Germany, Italy, Luxem¬
bourg and the Netherlands in the European Community on ist January 1973.
British membership of the Community was endorsed, after renegotiation of
the terms of membership, in June 1975 by a more than two-to-one majority in
the first national referendum to be held in Britain. Some 67-2 per cent of those
voting wanted Britain to remain in the Community, against 32-8 per cent who
voted for withdrawal. Almost 65 per cent of those eligible to vote did so.
Details of Britain’s participation in specific sectors of Community policies
are contained in the appropriate chapters.
, t , X ,
The European Community consists of three communities set up by separate
treaties—the European Coal and Steel Community, the European Economic
Community and the Kuropean Atomic Energy Community.
The European
Coal and Steel
Community
The European
Economic
Community
The European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC), set up in 1952, brought
together the coal and steel resources of the six member countries, and formed
the model for the ‘community’ approach to economic integration. The ECSC
is designed to ensure an orderly supply of coal and steel to member countries,
to promote the rational expansion and modernisation of production and to
provide better conditions of employment and living for the employees in the
industries The Treaty of Paris, signed in 1951, which established the ECSC,
provided for the abolition of duties and quantitative restrictions (or charges
having the same effect) on trade in coal and steel between member states; of
discrimination by producers in prices, delivery terms or transport rates; of any
measures which hampered free choice of supplier; and of restrictive practices
resulting in the collusive sharing or exploitation of markets. The treaty also
provided for action by the Community over a wide field of activity in the coal
and steel industries, the work of the Community being financed by a levy on
production. The Community provides funds for capital investment, research
and other programmes, as well as loans to help create new jobs where coal
seams are being exhausted or where restructuring of the steel industry is
taking place. Grants to assist redundant coal and steel workers until they find
new employment, or while they are undergoing retraining, are also made.
The European Economic Community (EEC) was created by the Treaty of
Rome signed by the six countries in 1957. It aimed to promote the continued
and balanced expansion of the member states’ economies by their progressive
harmonisation and integration. The preamble to the treaty included among the
basic objectives of the EEC the establishment of the foundations for a growing
unity among European peoples, the improvement of their working and living
conditions, the progressive abolition of restrictions on trade, and the develop¬
ment of the prosperity of overseas countries. The initial steps towards the
MEMBERSHIP OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITY

Community

attainment of these objectives were the creation of a customs union, abolition
of internal tariffs and other barriers to trade and establishment of a common
external tariff, the development of a common policy for agriculture, and the
introduction of measures to establish the free movement of labour, capital
and services. At the same time, provision was made for the overseas countries
which had special links with the member countries to have preferential treat¬
ment in aid and the development of trade. This principle has since been
embodied in the Lome Convention (see p. 357).
The European Atomic Energy Community (Euratom) was set up by a second
treaty signed in Rome in 1957, which provided for the co-ordinated develop¬
ment of members’ atomic energy industries and of their other peaceful nuclear
activities. Euratom has worked to develop a co-ordinated research programme
(for power production, industrial and medical purposes) and to ensure the
dissemination of technical information, to facilitate the co-ordination of invest¬
ment in the nuclear field, and to ensure an adequate supply of nuclear ores and
fuels and wider commercial outlets. A common market for all nuclear materials
and equipment came into effect at the beginning of 1959, with a common ex¬
ternal tariff on imports of nuclear materials, while the Community has estab¬
lished common nuclear legislation and a common control system for nuclear
materials to prevent their diversion to purposes other than those declared.
The Treaty of Accession was signed by the applicant countries and the original
member states in January 1972. Britain thereby became a party to the two
treaties of Rome establishing the EEC and Euratom, adjusted as necessary to
take account of enlargement. Accession to the ECSC was effected by a decision
of the Council of Ministers.
The Treaty of Accession provided for a transitional period during which
tariffs on trade in industrial products between Britain and the original six
members were progressively reduced; on 1st July 1977 the internal tariffs were
abolished and the phased introduction of the common external tariff on British
imports from countries neither members of the Community, nor having any
special arrangements with it, was completed. In addition, Britain has been
progressively adopting the Community system of agricultural support under
the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) during a transitional period ending
on 31st December 1977. The treaty provided for a slightly longer period of
adjustment with regard to payments to the Community budget. Other pro¬
visions included those relating to participation in the Community’s institutions
and to its relations with Commonwealth and other countries.
The European Communities Act became law in October 1972 and made the
legislative changes necessary for Britain to comply with the obligations entailed
by membership of the Community, and to exercise the rights of membership.
The Act gave the force of law in Britain to that part of Community law which
is directly applicable in member states. It also contained detailed legislation (in
part repealing or amending existing statutes) to implement Community obliga¬
tions. Other Community obligations are being met under existing powers to
make subordinate legislation, which is introduced as the measures become
applicable.
Community Law Community policies are implemented by means of regulations, which are
legally binding and directly applicable in all member countries; directives,

Institutions
which are binding on those member states to which they are addressed regard¬
ing their objectives, but allow national authorities to decide on the means of
implementation; decisions, which are binding on those to whom they are
addressed (for example, member states, firms, or individuals); and recommen¬
dations and opinions, which have no binding force.
The separate institutions established by the treaties for each of the three Com¬
munities were merged in 1967- The Community institutions, comprising the
Council of Ministers, the Commission, the Court of Justice, the Assembly
or Kuropean Parliament and others, including a number dealing with specific
subjects, provide a framework within which the interests of the member states
are represented and reconciled and common policies formulated and adminis¬
tered. In each of the institutions Britain has a position equal to that of France,
the Federal Republic of Germany or Italy. English is one of the official lan¬
guages of the Community.
The Council of Ministers is the final decision-making body for all major
Community questions and is the only institution established by the treaties
whose members, usually the foreign minister or other ministers appropriate to
the subject of discussion, directly represent each member country. Most
council decisions are taken on the basis of a proposal by the Commission.
Where member states vital interests are involved, the council’s practice is to
proceed only on the basis of unanimity. Some issues may be decided by
majority, or qualified majority, with votes weighted according to provisions in
the Treaty of Accession.
The Presidency of the Council (the chairmanship of meetings of the council
and its subordinate bodies) changes at six-monthly intervals. Britain held the
Presidency for the first time from January to June 1977.
The Commission is responsible for formulating detailed policy proposals for
submission to the Council of Ministers, for promoting the Community interest
and attempting to reconcile national viewpoints and for implementing the pro¬
visions of the treaties and Community measures. It has some limited powers of
decision relating mainly to the detailed administration of the CAP. It is com¬
posed of 13 commissioners nominated by the member governments; two are
from Britain. In January 1977, a former British Cabinet Minister took office
as President of the Commission. The President, who is appointed for a two-
}ear renewable term, acts as the Commission’s representative and is respon¬
sible for its general administration. Each of the other commissioners is
responsible for one or more of the main Community activities. The Com¬
mission is pledged to act independently of national or sectional interests and
to formulate its proposals and administer policy in the interests of the Com¬
munity as a whole. Its proposals are made only after extensive consultation
with officials of the national governments and with producers, trade unions,
employers’ associations and many others.
The Court of Justice interprets and adjudicates on the meaning of the
treaties and of any measures taken by the Council of Ministers and Com¬
mission under them, hears complaints and appeals brought by or against Com¬
munity institutions, member states or individuals and gives preliminary rulings
on questions referred to it by courts in the member states. As a court of final
appeal its procedure in such cases is broadly similar to that of the highest
courts in member states; its rulings are binding on member countries, Com¬
munity institutions and individuals. The Court consists of nine judges,
assisted by four advocates-general.
The Assembly or European Parliament is currently composed of 198

nominated members of the parliaments of member states, sitting according
to party affiliation and not nationality. Britain is entitled to nominate 36
members. The Assembly is consulted on and debates all the major policy
issues of the Community. Members of the Assembly may question the Council
of Ministers and Commission and have the power to dismiss the Commission
by a two-thirds majority. The Assembly may reject in its entirety the Com¬
munity’s draft annual budget as presented by the Commission and approved
by the Council; a formal conciliation procedure has been adopted for use in the
event of disagreement between the Assembly and the Council of Ministers
on matters with major budgetary or financial implications. In future the
Assembly is to be directly elected and its size is to be increased to 410 mem¬
bers, with 81 from Britain. It is hoped that it will be possible to hold the first
direct elections in May or June 1978. In a Bill introduced in June 1977, the
Government recommended the adoption for Britain of the regional list
system of proportional representation, subject to a provision that would
enable the House of Commons to substitute the simple-majority system
(except for Northern Ireland, which would use the single transferable vote
system) if it so decides.
The Committee of Permanent Representatives consists of representatives of
the member states of ambassadorial rank, whose task is to prepare for the
meetings of the Council of Ministers and perform whatever additional func¬
tions it might delegate.
The Economic and Social Committee is a consultative body representing a
cross-section of economic interests. Its members—representing employers’
organisations, trade unions and other interests—are consulted by the Council
of Ministers and Commission during the formulation of policy. Britain is
entitled to send 24 members out of a total of 144.
Other Community institutions include the European Investment Bank, the
European Monetary Co-operation Fund and the Court of Auditors.
In addition to, and separate from, these Community institutions, the mem¬
ber states have set up the European political co-operation machinery for the
consideration of important problems of foreign policy. The British Govern¬
ment attaches considerable importance to Community co-operation in this
area. The Community foreign ministers meet in this framework four times a
year. Under the foreign ministers there is a structure of specialised com¬
mittees. The country having the Presidency of the Council of Ministers
provides the Secretariat. Close contact is maintained with Community institu¬
tions when this is appropriate, and decisions are made on the basis of consensus.
Among the problems considered in the framework of political co-operation
have been the prospects for negotiated settlements in the Middle East and in
Rhodesia.
The Community’s heads of State or of Government meet at least three times
a year as the European Council in order to ensure progress and consistency in
the activities of the Community. The European Council combines the func¬
tions of a meeting of the Council of Ministers with those of a meeting held
within the context of political co-operation.
All member countries contribute to a common budget for certain specific pur¬
poses, such as agricultural support (administered by the European Agricultural
Guidance and Guarantee Fund, often known by its French initials FEOGA),
the European Social Fund (used to finance occupational retraining and
re-adaptation programmes, and to encourage manpower mobility), the
Regional Development Fund, and administrative costs. The budget is financed
?6
BRITAIN 1978: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
by the direct income system, which came* into effect for the original member
states in January 1971. Except for a 10 per cent rebate to cover collection costs,
all levies on agricultural imports and all customs revenues are handed over to
the Community budget by the original six member states. From the beginning
of 19781 it is intended that the budget total be made up by a proportion (equiva¬
lent of up to a 1 per cent rate) of the proceeds of the value added tax raised on a
uniform basis in member states.
The Treaty of Accession made special arrangements for the budgetary
contributions of the new member states, under which the direct income system
would be adopted after a transitional period.
In Britain’s case, the treaty set a percentage (or key) based on Britain’s
share of the total gross national product (GNP) of the nine countries in the
enlarged Community, which represented the proportion of the budget which
Britain would nominally have been expected to pay. Provision was made for
this proportion to be reached in annual stages starting with a contribution
of 875 per cent of the budget in 1973, rising to about 19 per cent in 1977, and
increasing further, but by no more than a limited amount, in the two years
thereafter.
A correcting mechanism has been established providing for repayments to
a member state whose contribution to the Community budget is seriously out
of line with its share of total Community GNP and its economic situation.

THE LAW
Although the United Kingdom is a unitary State, it does not have a single body
of law. England and Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland each have their own
legal systems and law courts. Common opinions on broader issues, and a
common final court of appeal in civil matters have resulted in substantial
identity on many points, but considerable differences remain in law and in
procedure and practice. In Northern Ireland legal procedure and practice
have for centuries closely resembled those of England and Wales but there are
often differences in enacted law. However, a large volume of modern legislation,
particularly in the social security field, applies throughout the United Kingdom.
The main sources of law in the United Kingdom are legislation, common law
and European Community law. Legislation consists of Acts of Parliament,
orders, rules and regulations made by ministers under the authority of an
Act of Parliament, or by-laws made by local government or other authorities
exercising powers conferred upon them by Parliament. Common law is the
ancient law of the land as deduced from custom and interpreted by the judges.
Generally speaking it has never been precisely defined or codified but forms the
basis of the law except when it has been superseded by legislation.
Community law (see p. 73) arises out of the United Kingdom’s membership
of the European Community and is largely confined in impact to economic and
certain social matters. It stands alongside domestic legislation and the
common law but in the event of conflict takes precedence over them. Com¬
munity law is normally applied by the domestic courts, but the most
authoritative rulings are given by the European Court of Justice (see p. 74).
A feature common to the domestic legal systems of the United Kingdom is the
distinction made between the criminal law and the civil law. The criminal law
is concerned with wrongs against the community as a whole while civil law is
concerned with the rights, duties and obligations of individual members of
society between themselves.
CRIMINAL JUSTICE
Four distinct stages are involved in the British system of criminal justice: the
enactment of criminal legislation which, for instance, defines prohibited acts,
establishes criminal courts and provides for the treatment of offenders; the
prevention of crime and the enforcement of the law—largely matters for the
police service; the determination by the courts of the guilt or innocence of
people accused of crimes, followed by the selection of appropriate sentences for
the guilty; and the treatment of convicted offenders.
A Royal Commission has been set up to examine the powers and duties of
the police in England and Wales, the rights and duties of suspects and
accused people, and the process of and responsibility for the prosecution of
criminal offences.
The criminal law, like the law generally, undergoes constant reform in the
courts as established principles are interpreted, clarified or refashioned to meet
78
BRITAIN 1978: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
new circumstances. Substantial changes in the law are the responsibility of
Parliament. In practice most legislation affecting the criminal law is govern¬
ment-sponsored, but there is often consultation between government depart¬
ments and bodies representing the legal profession and the police. The views
of voluntary bodies are also taken into account.
Crime Statistics Chief constables in England and Wales have a duty to supply statistics relating
to offences, offenders, criminal proceedings and the state of crime in their
areas. Crime statistics are published annually by the Home Office and further
information about crime trends (as well as about police matters) is contained in
the annual reports of the Chief Inspectors of Constabulary and (for London)
the Commissioner of Police of the Metropolis.
The differences in the legal systems of the constituent countries make it
impractical to analyse in detail trends in criminality for the United Kingdom
as a whole. In considering trends for a single country, it has to be remembered
that the number of offences recorded as known to the police does not cover all
offences committed. The proportion of offences known to the police may
change as a result of several factors such as the public’s readiness to report
incidents, the general level of tolerance towards certain types of anti-social
behaviour and the allocation of police time and resources. Nevertheless it is
clear that, as in western Europe generally, there has been an upsurge in crime
since the early 1950s.
As Table 5 shows, there has been a rise in the rate of indictable offences
recorded as known to the police in the past few years in most of the main
offence groups; in 1976 in England and Wales there were some 4,342 indictable
offences per 100,000 population.
In 1976, 425,452 people were convicted by courts in England and Wales of
indictable offences. Of these about 15 per cent were women and about 46 per
cent were under 21 years of age. Not all apprehended offenders are proceeded
against in court. For indictable offences 97,678 people were given formal oral
cautions by the police; of these 89 per cent were under 21. For non-indictable
offences oral cautions were given to 37,685 people of whom 46 per cent were
aged under 21.

Social Research Studies series. Research is also carried out in university
departments, much of it financed by the Government. The principal university
research establishment is the Institute of Criminology at Cambridge.
The Criminal Injuries Compensation Scheme was established in 1964 to
provide ex gratia compensation to victims of crimes of violence and people hurt
as a result of attempts to arrest offenders and prevent offences. It is administer¬
ed by a board consisting of legally qualified members appointed by the
Home Secretary and the Secretary of State for Scotland after consultation with
the Lord Chancellor. Compensation, which is assessed on the basis of common
law damages and usually takes the form of a lump sum payment, has totalled
some £31 million since the scheme began. A review of the scheme is in progress
with a view to putting it on a statutory basis.
The scheme does not apply in Northern Ireland where there is statutory
provision in certain circumstances for compensation from public funds for
criminal injuries caused to people and also for malicious damage to property
(see below). Compensation for property damage includes losses of profits
arising from the damage.
Various temporary measures to deal with terrorism in connection with
Northern Ireland have affected some aspects of the British criminal justice
system. Under the Prevention of Terrorism (Temporary Provisions) Act 1976,
organisations concerned in terrorism connected with Northern Ireland affairs
and occurring in the United Kingdom can be proscribed. The appropriate
Secretary of State can exclude people concerned in terrorism from Great
Britain or Northern Ireland. If the person is not a British citizen he can be
excluded from the United Kingdom as a whole. The Act provides powers for
the arrest and detention of suspected terrorists. There is also a system of
controls at ports on passengers travelling between Great Britain and Ireland.
The Criminal Jurisdiction Act 1975 creates extra-territorial offences under
Northern Ireland law so that it is possible to try in the province a person
accused of certain offences committed in the Irish Republic. It also enables
evidence to be obtained in Northern Ireland for the trial of offences in the
Irish Republic. Reciprocal legislation has been passed by the Irish Parliament.
Trials in Northern Ireland criminal courts of offences involving terrorism
are heard by a judge sitting without a jury to obviate the possibility of
intimidation of juries or of perverse acquittals by partisan juries.
As a result of the civil disturbances in the province since 1968, over £27
million has been paid from public funds in compensation for personal
injuries and about ^208 million for damage to property.
Crime prevention and crime investigation, the preservation of the peace and
the bringing to trial of offenders are primarily the concern of the police service.
The action of the British police in enforcing the law rests mainly upon common
consent, for there are only a small number of officers in relation to the
population (roughly one officer to 500 people). Officers do not normally
carry firearms (their only weapon is a wooden truncheon) and there are
strict limitations on police powers.
The police service in Great Britain comprises 51 independent forces linked with
local government—43 in England and Wales and eight in Scotland. Each
force is responsible for law enforcement in its own area, but there is constant
co-operation among them. The Northern Ireland police service is organised
in a single force, the Royal Ulster Constabulary.

Central
Authorities
Outside London most counties (regions or islands in Scotland) have their
own police forces, though in the interests of efficiency several have combined
their forces. In London, the Metropolitan Police Force, with headquarters at
New Scotland Yard, is responsible for an area within a radius of about 24
kilometres (15 miles) from the centre but excluding the City of London,
where there is a separate force. The strength of the regular police force in
Great Britain is about 122,000 (including about 7,750 policewomen), the size
of individual police forces depending on the area and population which they
serve. The strength of the Metropolitan Police Force is about 22,400.
In addition to the regular police forces, constabularies are maintained by the
British Railways Board and some other public authorities and by the Ministry
of Defence. Considerable numbers of people are employed by commercial
security organisations which are subject to the ordinary law of the land.
Each of the regular police forces is maintained by a police authority, a com¬
mittee consisting of local councillors and, in England and Wales, magistrates.
The police authority for the Metropolitan Police Force is the Home Secretary.
The primary duty of the police authority is to provide an adequate and
efficient police force for the area for which it is responsible. Its functions, some
of which are subject to ministerial approval, include appointing the chief
constable and deputy and assistant chief constables and, if necessary, calling
upon them to retire; fixing the manpower of the force and the number of
officers in each rank; appointing traffic wardens; and providing and maintaining
buildings and equipment. In the Metropolitan Police area the chief officer of
police and his immediate subordinates are appointed on the recommendation
of the Home Secretary.
Chief constables are responsible for the direction and control of police forces
and for the appointment, promotion and discipline of all ranks below deputy or
assistant chief constable. They are generally answerable to the police authori¬
ties on matters of efficiency, and must submit a written report every year.
The Home Secretary and the Secretary of State for Scotland have overall
responsibility for the preservation of law and order and are concerned with
the general organisation, administration and operation of the police service.
They approve the appointment of chief constables, and may require a police
authority to retire a chief constable in the interests of efficiency, call for a
report from a chief constable on any matters relating to the policing of his
area, or cause a local inquiry to be held. They are also empowered to make
regulations, with which all police authorities must comply, covering such
matters as rank; qualifications for appointment, promotion and retirement;
discipline; hours of duty, leave, pay and allowances; and uniform and equip¬
ment. Some of these regulations are first negotiable on the Police Council (a
negotiating body on which are represented the police authorities, police staff
associations and ministers); others are discussed on representative advisory
bodies, together with any general questions affecting the police service.
All police forces in Great Britain (except the Metropolitan Police for which
the Home Secretary is directly responsible) are subject to inspection on behalf
of ministers. Inspectors of constabulary carry out, under Her Majesty’s Chief
Inspector of Constabulary and Her Majesty’s Chief Inspector of Constabulary
for Scotland, a formal annual inspection of the forces in their regions, inquiring
into efficiency and reporting to the Home Secretary or the Secretary of State for
Scotland. Annual reports are published, covering the whole range of police
matters. The inspectors also maintain close touch with forces for which they are
responsible, and have various advisory functions.

Duties
'The income of police authorities derives from central Government, the ‘rates’
(a form of local property tax) and various other local sources. The Government’s
contribution, a half of approved expenditure (a third in the City of London),
is conditional on the Home Secretary or the Secretary of State for Scotland
being satisfied that the force is being efficiently administered and maintained.
In general, entry to the regular police force is open to men and women between
the ages of 18J and 30. A chief constable may approve the appointment of
especially suitable older men and women.
The standard police ranks in Great Britain, except in the Metropolitan Police
and City of London Police areas, are: chief constable, assistant chief con¬
stable, chief superintendent, superintendent, chief inspector, inspector,
sergeant and constable. The chief officer in the Metropolitan Police area, the
Commissioner of Police of the Metropolis, is assisted by a deputy commis¬
sioner and four assistant commissioners. Next in rank are deputy assistant
commissioners, and then commanders; from chief superintendent the ranks
are the same as in the regions. In the City of London the ranks are the same as
in the regions except that the chief officer is the Commissioner of Police and
the second in command is an assistant commissioner, and there is one
commander.
Cadet training is designed to prepare boys and girls between 16 and i8£ years
of age for a police service career. They have no police powers but, in addition
to their educational studies and physical and adventure training, are instructed
in elementary police work.
In order to release as many uniformed police officers as possible for opera¬
tional duties, police authorities employ over 37,700 civilians on administrative
duties (pay, records, finance and other general subjects), technical duties
(fingerprint, scenes of crime and control room work) and other duties,
including catering and domestic work.
Traffic wardens (of whom there are over 6,600) discharge specified duties
connected with road traffic, vehicles and pedestrians normally undertaken by
the police. They may be authorised to serve fixed penalty notices1 for some
minor traffic offences; to man police car pounds (except in Scotland); to
enforce some aspects of the vehicle excise laws; and to obtain the names and
addresses of people thought to have committed certain types of traffic offence.
They may also be authorised to direct traffic, to act as parking attendants at
street parking places, and as school-crossing patrols, if the police agree.
Wardens are under the control of the chief constable.
Each police force has an attachment of special constables, who are volunteers
willing to perform police duties without pay in their spare time. In England and
Wales, they act as auxiliaries to the regular force when required. In Scotland
they are employed only in emergencies although they may be assigned for
duty for training purposes.
A police officer in Great Britain is an independent holder of a public office;
he is an agent of the law of the land, not of the police authority nor of the
central Government, and he may be sued in respect of any wrongful act he
may commit in the performance of his duties. Strict procedures govern the
way complaints against police officers are handled and an independent element
is being introduced into the way complaints are investigated.
No member of the police service may belong to a trade union since it is a basic

principle of the service that its members must not only be free from political
bias, but must also be seen to be free of it. All ranks, however, have their own
associations which can make representations to ministers or to police authorities
on matters of interest or concern to their members.
Police work ranges from the protection of people and property, road or
street patrolling and traffic control to crime prevention, criminal investigation
and the apprehension of offenders. It inevitably includes many ‘social’
functions, for example, juvenile bureau schemes for dealing with children and
young people arrested on minor charges and community liaison officers
responsible for maintaining contact with ethnic minorities. Police officers can
also become involved with social problems.
The main departments in all police forces are the uniform department, the
criminal investigation department and the traffic department. Many forces’also
have specialised departments, including river police (in districts with stretches
of navigable waterway), a mounted branch and dog handlers.
A number of common services are provided by the central government depart¬
ments and by communal arrangements made between forces. The most
important of these are: training; a forensic science service in England and
Wales with seven regional laboratories (in addition to the Metropolitan Police
Laboratory); telecommunications, including depots which in England and
Wales supply and maintain radio equipment for the police; and central and
provincial criminal records which are available to all forces. In addition,
regional crime squads, consisting of teams of experienced detectives from
several forces, operating under a committee of chief constables, are employed
in England and W ales to investigate major crimes involving inquiries in more
t an one police area. The Scottish Crime Squad operates in the same way
throughout Scotland.
Certain special services such as liaison with the International Criminal Police
Organisation (Interpol) are provided for other British forces by the Metropoli¬
tan Police Force. The services of the force are available, on request, to assist
any other police force in England and Wales in criminal investigation, as are
the services of the Fraud Squad, which is run jointly by the Metropolitan
Police and the City of London Police for the investigation of company frauds.
Researdi into technical services is organised in separate units within the
Home Office’s Police Department: the Forensic Science Service, with its
regional laboratories; a Central Research Establishment staffed by scientists;
a Directorate of Telecommunications with one section of engineers engaged
solely on research and development; and the Police Scientific Development
Branch, staffed by scientists and technicians assisted by police officers
seconded from the Police Research Services Unit—both being concerned with
operational research into police methods and the development of equipment.
Co-ordination and policy are the responsibility of a separate division. The
Economic Planning Unit, composed mainly of economists and accountants, is
responsible for the development of a planning-programming-budgeting
system for the police; this includes the production of programme accounts and
studies of the use of resources.
In all aspects of police work, the application of scientific aids has reached an
advanced stage. A national police computer is being developed to rationalise
the keeping of records and to speed up the dissemination of information.

which is maintained by the Police Authority for Northern Ireland. The

Secretary of State for Northern Ireland makes appointments to the authority
on the basis that membership should as far as practicable be representative
of the community. The chief constable is responsible for the control and
direction of the force which has a strength of nearly 5,400. Ranks, conditions
of service, pay and general duties follow closely on the lines of the service in
Great Britain. The regular force is assisted by the Royal Ulster Constabulary
Reserve, a largely part-time body of men and women.
Criminal proceedings in England and Wales are held either in magistrates’
courts, where cases are tried without a jury, or in the Crown Court, where the
more serious cases are tried on indictment with a jury. Magistrates’ courts also
conduct preliminary investigations into the more serious cases. About 97 per
cent of all criminal cases are heard and determined by magistrates’ courts.
Average waiting time for people committed by magistrates for trial in the
Crown Court is about ten weeks.
The 700 or so magistrates’ courts normally consist of a ‘bench’ of three lay
unpaid magistrates whose function is to ascertain the facts of a case and apply
the law to them. The magistrates are advised on points of law and procedure by
a clerk to the justices (or one of his assistants) who is normally legally qualified
and is also in charge of the court’s administrative arrangements. Magistrates
are appointed by the Lord Chancellor.
In inner London and some other large urban areas where the pressure of work
is heavy and continuous there are also professional ‘stipendiary’ magistrates who
are full-time, salaried and legally qualified. They usually preside alone.
Magistrates must as a rule sit in open court, but when they make preliminary
inquiries into a more serious case to see whether there is sufficient evidence to
justify committal for trial in the Crown Court the evidence must not be reported
in the press at the time except at the defendant’s request, unless the magistrates
discharge him.
Magistrates cannot usually impose a sentence of more than six months’
imprisonment or a fine exceeding £400. If an offence carries a higher maximum
penalty, they may commit the offender for sentence to the Crown Court if they
consider their own power inadequate.
To hear cases involving people under the age of 17 brought before the court in
‘care’ (see p. 94) or criminal proceedings, and to deal with applications for
the adoption of children, magistrates’ courts sit as juvenile courts, either in a
different room or building from other courts, or at a different time; only
limited publicity is allowed. If a young person under the age of 17 is charged
jointly with someone of 17 or over, the case is heard in the ordinary magis¬
trates’ court. If the young person is found guilty, that court remits the case
to a juvenile court, unless it wishes to dispose of the case by discharge or fine.
The Crown Court is responsible for trials of the more serious cases, the senten¬
cing of offenders committed for sentence by magistrates’ courts, and appeals
from magistrates’ courts. It has about 90 centres and is served by High Court
judges, full-time ‘circuit judges’ and part-time recorders. All contested trials
in the court take place before a jury. Lay magistrates have a role to play in the
court; a circuit judge or recorder sits with between two and four magistrates
for appeals and committals for sentence from magistrates’ courts and may sit
with magistrates to try the less important cases. For the most serious cases a
High Court judge sits alone.

pleaded guilty to some or all charges, 17-5 per cent were convicted after trial
and 17 per cent were acquitted on all counts.
A person convicted by a magistrates’ court may appeal against the conviction or
against the sentence to the Crown Court. Where the appeal is on a point of law,
either the prosecutor or the defendant may appeal from the magistrates’ court
to the High Court, which sits in London and some regional centres (see p. 96).
Appeals from the Crown Court, either against conviction or against sentence,
are usually made to the Court of Appeal (Criminal Division) which normally
consists of three judges, who may be Lords Justices of Appeal or judges of the
High Court, although the Lord Chief Justice or a Lord Justice of Appeal
usually presides. A further appeal from the Court of Appeal to the House of
Lords can be brought if the court certifies that a point of law of general public
importance is involved and it appears to the court or the House of Lords that
the point is one that ought to be considered by the House. A prosecutor or
defendant may appeal to the House of Lords from a decision of the High
Court in a criminal case.
The Attorney General may seek the opinion of the Court of Appeal on a point
of law which has arisen in a case where a person tried on indictment is acquitted;
the court has power to refer the point to the House of Lords if necessary. The
acquittal in the original case is not affected, nor is the identity of the acquitted
person revealed without his consent.
In Scotland there are two main criminal courts—the High Court of Justiciary
and the sheriff court. The High Court deals with the more serious crimes and
the sheriff court with the less serious. District courts deal with minor offences.
Criminal cases in Scotland are heard either under solemn procedure, when
proceedings are taken on indictment and the judge sits with a jury of 15
members, or under summary procedure, when the judge sits without a jury.
All cases in the High Court of Justiciary and the more serious ones in the
sheriff courts are tried by a judge and jury. Proceedings are taken under
summary procedure in the less serious cases in the sheriff courts, and in the
district courts.
A government committee is considering the effect on the criminal courts and
the prosecution system of the volume of minor offences dealt with by sum¬
mary prosecution and whether some other process could be devised to deal
with such offences while maintaining safeguards for accused persons.
The system of lay summary courts is based on the district and islands areas of
local government. Judges in the district courts are justices of the peace, includ¬
ing up to one-quarter of the membership of district and islands authorities who
may be nominated as ex q^no justices. In Glasgow there are three stipendiary
magistrates who are full-time salaried lawyers.
Scotland is divided into six sheriffdoms which are further divided into sheriff
court districts. A sheriffdom has a sheriff-principal and a number of sheriffs
who are legally qualified and act as the judges of the court. The sheriff courts
exercise an extensive civil as well as a criminal jurisdiction.
The High Court of Justiciary is Scotland’s supreme criminal court. It is both a
trial court and an appeal court. Any one of the following judges is entitled to try
cases in the High Court: the Lord Justice General (the head of the court), the
Lord Justice Clerk (the next judge in seniority) or any one of the 20 judges

who preside at sessions of the court in other towns. The main seat of the court
is in Edinburgh where all appeals are heard.
All appeals are dealt with by the High Court of Justiciary. In both solemn and
summary procedure, an appeal may be brought against conviction, or sen¬
tence, or both. The High Court cannot order a retrial if it sets aside a convic¬
tion. Appeals are heard by three or more judges; there is no further appeal to
the House of Lords.
Children under 16 years (and in some cases people between 16 and 18) who
have committed an offence or are considered to need compulsory care are
normally brought before an informal children’s hearing comprising three
members of the local community. (Prosecution in the criminal courts is rare,
and may take place only on the instructions of the Lord Advocate.) An official
‘reporter’ decides whether a child should come before a hearing. The hearing’s
main task is to decide, after the grounds for referral have been accepted by the
child and his parents, the most appropriate measures of care and treatment.
If the grounds for referral are not accepted, the case must first go to the sheriff
court sitting as a civil court for proof. The sheriff also decides appeals against
a decision of a children’s hearing.
The day-to-day work of dealing summarily with minor local criminal cases in
Northern Ireland is carried out by magistrates’ courts presided over by a
professional, paid resident magistrate. Young offenders under 17 years and
young people under 17 who need care, protection and control are dealt with
by juvenile courts consisting of the resident magistrate and two lay members
(at least one of whom must be a woman) with special qualifications for dealing
with juveniles. Appeals may be made to a county court.
The county courts and the High Court of Justice share a similar jurisdiction
in criminal matters, except that the most serious cases, such as murder, are tried
in the High Court only. Other cases are heard at the court where the trial
can be heard soonest. For people convicted of serious crimes there may be
an appeal to the Court of Criminal Appeal and from there to the House of
Lords. Government proposals to reform the system have been published.
The decision to prosecute normally rests, in England and Wales, with the police
and in Scotland with public prosecutors. In Northern Ireland the decision to
prosecute the more serious offences rests with the Director of Public Prosecu¬
tions, though for certain less serious offences it rests with the police. In
England and Wales (and very exceptionally in Scotland) a private person may
institute criminal proceedings. Police have powers to issue cautions (warnings
in Scotland) instead of prosecuting, especially in the case of young people.
Some offences in England and Wales can be prosecuted only by, or with the
consent of, the Attorney General or the Director of Public Prosecutions. Where
the consent of the Attorney General is required (for example, under the official
secrets legislation), such prosecutions are invariably in the hands of the director
(a senior civil servant and prominent lawyer appointed by the Home Secretary)
who is responsible to the Attorney General. His other duties include: pro¬
secuting all serious offences, which must be reported to him by the police;
advising the police and others concerned with the administration of the criminal
lawq and taking over, where he considers it necessary, criminal proceedings
instituted by another prosecutor. He is also concerned with complaints of
criminal offences by the police, extradition and offences committed by foreign
servicemen stationed in England and Wales.
86
BRITAIN 1978: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Arrest
When cases go for trial, barristers in private practice are instructed to appear
on the director’s behalf; at the Central Criminal Court in London, these are
drawn from a panel of ‘Treasury Counsel’ appointed by the Attorney General.
Each year the director’s department conducts between five and ten per cent
of the prosecutions brought on indictment in England and Wales; it also con¬
ducts some summary prosecutions.
In Scotland the Lord Advocate, acting through the Crown Office and
subordinate prosecutors, is responsible for the prosecution of practically all
crimes before Scottish courts. The Crown Office is concerned with the pre¬
paration of prosecutions in the High Court; the public prosecutors in the sheriff
courts and district courts, known as ‘procurators fiscal’, are full-time civil
servants and must be advocates or solicitors. The police make preliminary
investigation of all offences known to them, and report the details to the
procurator fiscal, who can decide whether to prosecute, subject to the discre¬
tion and control of the Crown Office.
The Director of Public Prosecutions in Northern Ireland, who is responsible
to the Attorney General, initiates criminal proceedings in certain circum¬
stances, represents the. Crown in criminal actions, and prosecutes offences
against statutory provisions on behalf of government departments. The
director also has functions in relation to the granting of bail.
In England and Wales arrest may be made on a warrant issued by a judicial
authority on sworn information laid before it or without warrant. In the latter
circumstances, a police officer may release the defendant on bail by discharging
him temporarily to appear in court or at a police station at an appointed time.
It is an offence to abscond while on bail. If the defendant cannot be brought
before the magistrates court within a day, and his alleged offence is not
serious, the police must release him on bail. Magistrates also have discretion
to grant bail, which they exercise according to well-defined principles. If bail is
refused by the magistrates, the defendant is entitled to apply to the Crown
Court or the High Court, and he must be informed of this right. There is a
statutory presumption in favour of granting bail.
About 87 per cent of the people remanded by magistrates’ courts in 1975
were granted bail.
Once anyone has been charged with an offence, the police may not put any
further questions to him, save, in exceptional circumstances, to prevent or
minimise harm or loss to any person or to the public, or to clear up an ambiguity
in a previous answer or statement. This is laid down by the Judges’ Rules
which do not have the force of law but carry very great weight.
A person detained in custody who thinks that the grounds for his detention
are not lawful1 may apply for a writ of habeas corpus against the person who
detained him, this person being required to appear before the court on the
day named to justify the detention. An application for such a writ is normally
made to a divisional court of the High Court either by the person detained or by
someone acting on his behalf.
In Scotland the police have similar powers of arrest as have the police in
England and Wales. Although the Judges’ Rules do not apply, an arrested
person must be cautioned and have the charge read over to him. There¬
after, only his voluntary statements are used in evidence at his trial, and
Lawful grounds are: in pursuance of criminal justice; for contempt of court or of
either House of Parliament; detention of persons found to be mentally disordered;
detention of children by their parents or guardians; and detention expressly authorised
by Act of Parliament. The writ of habeas corpus applies in both criminal and civil cases.
JUSTICE AND THE LAW

Trial
the court will reject any statements made by him unless it is satisfied that they
have been fairly obtained. When anyone is apprehended he must be brought
before a court with the least possible delay. Where a prosecution on indict¬
ment is contemplated, the accused is brought before a judge for judicial
examination and the judge may then commit him for trial or for further
examination. Eight days may elapse between commitment for further examina¬
tion and commitment for trial.
People in custody in Scotland, other than those charged with murder or
treason, may be liberated on bail by the sheriff or, if the offence is within the
jurisdiction of a summary court other than the sheriff court, by that court or by
the police. Even in the case of murder or treason, bail may be granted at the
discretion of the Lord Advocate or the High Court of Justiciary. There is a right
of appeal to the High Court by the accused person against the refusal of bail, by
the prosecutor against the granting of bail, or by either party against the amount
fixed. The writ of habeas corpus does not apply in Scotland, but the High Court
of Justiciary has power to release anyone unlawfully detained and trials must
be brought to a conclusion within no days of committal to custody.
All criminal trials in the United Kingdom take the form of a contest between
the prosecution and the defence.
Since criminal law in Britain presumes the innocence of the accused until his
guilt has been proved, the prosecution is not granted any advantage, apparent or
real, over the defence. A defendant has the right to employ a legal adviser for his
defence and if he cannot afford to pay he may be granted legal aid wholly or
partly from public funds. If remanded in custody he may be visited in prison
by his legal adviser to ensure that his defence is properly prepared. In England
and Wales during the preparation of the case, the prosecution usually informs
the defence of any relevant documents which it is not proposed to put in
evidence and discloses them if asked to do so. The prosecution should also
inform the defence of any witnesses whose evidence may assist the accused
and whom the prosecution does not propose to call. The defence or prosecu¬
tion may suggest that the mental state of the defendant is such that he is
unfit to be tried. A jury must decide whether or not this is so. If they find that
it is, the defendant will be admitted to a hospital specified by the Home
Secretary in England and Wales, and in Northern Ireland to one specified by
a health and social services board (see p. 118).
Criminal trials in England and Wales are normally held in open court and
the law of evidence (which is concerned with the way facts may be proved
and what facts may not be proved) is rigorously applied. If evidence is
admitted in contravention of the law, a conviction can be quashed on appeal.
During the trial the defendant has the right to hear and subsequently to cross-
examine (normally through his lawyer) all the witnesses for the prosecution; to
call his own witnesses who, if they will not attend the trial of their own free will,
may be legally compelled to attend; and to address the court either in person or
through his lawyer—the defence having the right to the last speech at the trial.
Moreover, the defendant cannot be questioned unless he consents to be
sworn as a witness in his own defence. When he does testify, he may only be
cross-examined about his character or other conduct in exceptional circum¬
stances and generally, the prosecution may not introduce evidence of such
matters. Although confessions made in the course of previous judicial
proceedings are admissible as evidence if they have been made upon oath, no
confessions made in any other circumstances are admitted unless it can be
proved that they were made voluntarily.

The Jury
Scotland
SPECIAL COURTS
Coroners’ Courts
In criminal trials by jury the judge determines questions of law, sums up the
evidence for the benefit of the jury, and discharges the accused or passes
sentence according to the verdict of the jury; but the jury alone decides whether
the defendant is guilty or not guilty. If the jury cannot reach a unanimous
verdict, the judge may direct it to bring in a majority verdict provided that,
in the normal jury of 12 people, there are not more than two dissentients.
If the jury returns a verdict of ‘not guilty’, the prosecution has no right of
appeal against the verdict and the defendant cannot be tried again for the same
offence. From a verdict of ‘guilty’ there is a right of appeal on the part of the
defendant to the appropriate court.
A jury is completely independent of the judiciary. Once members are
sworn in, they are protected from interference of any kind. There are provi¬
sions for both the prosecution and the defence to object to particular jurors.
In England and Wales people whose names appear on the electoral register are
liable for jury service; in Scotland, the minimum age for jurors is 21, and
accordingly not all those on the register are eligible to serve as the minimum
voting age is 18.
At summary trials in Scotland the accused is asked to plead to the charge at
the first calling of the case and, if he pleads guilty, the court may dispose of the
case. Where the plea is ‘not guilty’, the court may proceed to trial at once or it
may appoint a later date.
In Scottish trials on indictment, the first ‘pleading’ proceedings take place in
the sheriff court, when the accused person is called upon to plead guilty or not
guilty. If he pleads not guilty, the case is continued to the second ‘trial’ pro¬
ceedings in the appropriate court. If he pleads guilty, and the case is to
be dealt with in the sheriff court, the sheriff may dispose of it at once If it is a
High Court case, it is continued to the second proceedings for disposal.
The trial proceedings are held at least nine days after the pleading pro¬
ceedings, either before the sheriff or the High Court, with a jury of 15.
Evidence is led (without opening speeches) and there are closing speeches for
the prosecution and for the defence, followed by the judge’s charge to the
jury. The jury may return a verdict of ‘not guilty’ or ‘not proven’, both of
which result in acquittal, or they may find the accused ‘guilty’, in which case
the court proceeds to deliver sentence. The verdict may be by a simple
majority. With a few minor exceptions, no person may be convicted without
the evidence of at least two witnesses, or corroboration of one witness by
facts and circumstances which clearly implicate the accused in the crime.
Most of the work of coroners’ courts involves the investigation of violent
and unnatural deaths or of sudden deaths where the cause is unknown.
Cases may be brought to the notice of the local coroner (a senior lawyer or
doctor appointed by local government) by doctors, the police, various public
authorities or members of the public, and it is his duty to hold an inquiry into
how, when and where the deceased died. If the death is a sudden one of which
the cause is unknown, the coroner need not hold an inquest in court, but may
order a post-mortem examination to determine cause of death. If, however, he
has reason to believe that the deceased died a violent or unnatural death or died
in prison or other circumstances provided for by statute, he must hold an
inquest. The requirement to summon a jury if the coroner suspects that
death was caused by homicide or a road traffic accident is to be abolished
under the Criminal Law Act 1977.
In Scotland the office of coroner does not exist. The procurator fiscal

inquires privately into all sudden and suspicious deaths in his district and may
report the result of his inquiries to the Crown Agent.
Coroners in Northern Ireland are mostly senior lawyers; the work of their
courts is similar to that of coroners’ courts in England and Wales.
Courts martial have jurisdiction over serving members of the armed forces and
in certain circumstances their dependants and other civilians who accompany
them outside the United Kingdom. The courts do not deal with certain serious
offences if committed in the United Kingdom, such as treason, murder, man¬
slaughter, treason-felony and rape. Other non-military criminal offences
committed by servicemen in the United Kingdom are also normally dealt
with in the ordinary courts.
A court martial (which consists of a president and a number of serving
officers) may be convened by an authorised officer. A judge advocate is appointed
to sit with the court in more serious Army and Air Force cases (and at every
Navy trial) to advise upon law and procedure and in the former case, to sum up
the evidence. An appeals system exists for people convicted by a court
martial.
The chief aims of the penal systems of the United Kingdom are to deter the
potential law-breaker and to reform the convicted offender. The element of
deterrence is in the probability of detection, public trial and punishment rather
than in the severity of the punishment itself.
Imprisonment and, for certain categories of young offender, other forms of
custodial treatment form an important part of British penal practice, but are
increasingly seen as the last resort in dealing with people who break the law.
Wherever possible and appropriate for the safety of the public, the treatment
of offenders within the community is regarded as preferable to custody.
In England, Wales and Northern Ireland a judge is free to pass a suspended
sentence of not more than two years. The sentence is not served by the
offender unless he is convicted of a further offence punishable with imprison¬
ment; in that event the suspended sentence normally takes effect and another
sentence may be imposed for the new offence. An offender receiving a
suspended sentence of more than six months may be made subject to super¬
vision by a probation officer for all or part of the period. Under the Criminal
Law Act 1977 courts in England and Wales will have power, when passing
a sentence of between six months’ and two years’ imprisonment, to order
that part should be served and the rest held in suspense.
Non-custodial treatment includes fines; probation; absolute or (in England,
Wales and Northern Ireland) conditional discharge for up to three years (one
year in Northern Ireland)—a discharge being made when the court feels that
there is no need to impose punishment on a convicted person; and ‘binding
over’ where the offender is required to pledge money, with or without
sureties, to keep the peace and be of good behaviour.
A recent innovation is the community service order for offenders con¬
victed of imprisonable offences in England and Wales. A similar scheme
is to be introduced in Northern Ireland. Examples of work done include
decorating houses and flats for old people and building adventure playgrounds
for children. Up to 240 hours’ service may be ordered within 12 months.
An offender in England, Wales and Northern Ireland may also with his
consent have his sentence deferred for up to six months to enable a court to
arrive at the most appropriate sentence, taking into account his conduct after,
for instance, some expected change in his circumstances.
9°
BRITAIN 1978: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Probation
The courts may order an offender to pay compensation for any personal
injury, loss or damage resulting from his offence and, in the case of major
crimes against property, bankruptcy proceedings may be brought against him
in England and Wales. In Scotland a committee has reported to the Secretary
of State and the Lord Advocate on the question of the potential role of the
criminal court in ordering reparation by the offender to the victim.
In certain circumstances the courts may order the forfeiture of property
involved in the commission of a crime. An offender convicted of a serious crime
may be disqualified from driving if a motor vehicle was used in its commission.
The mandatory penalty for murder in the United Kingdom is imprisonment
for life. This is also the maximum penalty in England and Wales for man¬
slaughter and certain other very serious offences, including rape, robbery
offences and arson, but in almost all other cases the courts have complete dis¬
cretion to select the sentence in the light of the nature and gravity of the offence
and the available information about the offender. In certain cases this discretion
is modified by statutory provisions designed to ensure that prison sentences are
kept to a minimum.
In Scotland, unless the sentence is limited by statute, the maximum penalty
is determined by the status of the court trying the accused. In trials on indict¬
ment, the High Court may impose a sentence of imprisonment for any term up
to life and the Sheriff Court up to two years. In summary cases, the sheriff may
impose up to three or, sometimes, six months’ imprisonment.
In all parts of Britain, there are special provisions for dealing with children in
trouble and young adult offenders (see pp. 94-96). In England, Wales and
Northern Ireland, a person who has not previously served a custodial sentence
of a particular kind may not be sentenced to custodial treatment of that kind
unless he is legally represented or has chosen not to be, and in the case of
imprisonment unless the court is satisfied that no other sentence will suffice. On
the other hand, in England and Wales special sentences longer than the normal
maximum term (extended sentences) may be imposed on persistent offenders.
In most circumstances, a person convicted of a criminal offence need not
reveal or admit it after a rehabilitation period of from six months to ten years
depending on the nature of the sentence imposed. This does not apply to
those who have received a prison sentence of more than zb years.
Probation is designed to secure the rehabilitation of an offender while he
continues his ordinary life under the supervision of a probation officer, whose
duty it is to advise, assist and befriend him. Before making a probation order
(which lasts for between one and three years), the court must explain its effects
and make sure that the probationer understands that if he fails to comply with
the requirements of the order he will be liable to be dealt with again for the
original offence. A probation order can be made only if the offender is 17 years of
age or over (14 in Northern Ireland) and must have his consent; it usually
requires the probationer to keep in regular touch with the probation officer,
to be of good behaviour and to lead an industrious life. It may also require
him to live in a specified place, or in appropriate circumstances, to submit to
treatment for a mental condition.
In England and Wales the probation service is administered locally by
probation and after-care committees consisting of local magistrates and co¬
opted members with legal and specialist interests. In Northern Ireland it is
administered by the Northern Ireland Office. Probation officers are usually
members of small teams, although each has a large measure of independence
in his or her casework with an offender.

Probation and after-care committees may, with the approval of the Home
Secretary, provide and maintain day training centres (which offenders may be
required to attend for up to 60 days for intensive supervision and social educa¬
tion as a requirement of a probation order), bail hostels, probation hostels and
other establishments for use in connection with the rehabilitation of offenders.
The service is also responsible for administering the community service
scheme.
In England, W ales and Northern Ireland, the services of probation and
after-care officers are available to every criminal court.
In Scotland, where there is no separate probation service, offenders subject
to probation orders or to after-care supervision following release from a penal
institution are supervised by specially approved local authority social workers.
Although the courts have made proportionately less and less use of prison as a
penalty for criminal activity, there has been a steady rise in the prison popula¬
tion as a result of the rise in crime. In 1976 the average number of people in
prisons, borstals, and detention centres was about 41,000 in England and
Wales and 5,000 in Scotland; there are 135 prison service establishments
and the size of the prison service in 1976 was 23,700.
The aims of the prison service are to detain those committed to custody
and to develop constructive methods of treatment and training in the hope that
they will lead to the prisoner’s rehabilitation and reform. To this end prisoners
are classified into groups, taking into account the likelihood of their escaping,
the degree to which their escape would offer a threat to the public or the
State, and the justification of high expenditure on providing secure con¬
ditions. People awaiting trial are entitled to privileges not granted to convicted
prisoners and as far as practicable are separated from convicted prisoners.
Prisoners under 21 are separated from older prisoners.
Prisons to which offenders may be committed directly by a court are known as
local prisons ; all are closed establishments. Other prisons, which may be open
or closed, receive prisoners on transfer from local prisons. Separate prisons cater
for women prisoners.
Many British prisons were built during the nineteenth century and are un¬
satisfactory by modern standards. Overcrowding is also a problem. However,
a number of new prisons have been built in the past few years, and existing
establishments have been redeveloped and modernised, as far as limited
resources allow.
All prisoners in Great Britain serving a sentence of imprisonment for an
actual term of more than one month, except those sentenced to imprisonment
for life, are allowed remission of one-third of their sentence provided that this
does not reduce their sentence below 31 days (in Scotland, 30 days). Remission
may be forfeited for serious misconduct in prison. In addition, prisoners
serving fixed sentences totalling more than 18 months become eligible for
consideration for release on parole after serving one-third of their sentence or
12 months, whichever expires later.
The parole licence remains in force until the date on which the prisoner
would have been released if he had not been licensed or, for prisoners serving
extended sentences (in England and Wales only) and offenders sentenced while
under 21 years of age, until the end of the sentence. Nearly 8 per cent of
prisoners granted parole in England and Wales in 1976 were recalled to
prison.
Prisoners serving life sentences are also eligible for release on licence, after
consultation with the judiciary and on the recommendation of the Parole Board.

Those released in this way remain on licence for the rest of their lives and are
subject to recall at any time should the circumstances warrant it.
In Northern Ireland, where there is no parole scheme, prisoners receive
one-half remission on determinate sentences, provided that remission does
not reduce the sentence to below 31 days. For those serving over a year, a
court can order all or part of the outstanding balance of the remitted period to
be served in the event of reconviction for an imprisonable offence in the
remitted period, in addition to any penalty imposed for a further offence.
The main aim of prison industries is to give an inmate a training and experi¬
ence that will fit him to get and retain a job on discharge. The prison industries
manufacture clothing for prisoners and furniture and furnishings for the
prison service. Goods and services are also supplied to other government
departments and public bodies, and there is a steady growth of sales of a wide
range of products in the open market—-for example, textiles, woodwork and
engineering products. The profitable farming and horticultural industries
contribute to the prison food provision. A few prisoners are employed outside
prison. Small payments are made to inmates for the work they do; in some
prisons, special incentive schemes provide an opportunity for higher earnings
on the basis of output and skill.
Any prisoner serving a sentence of four years or more may be considered for
employment in a civilian job outside prison for about six months before his
discharge. Prisoners selected for the scheme may live either in a separate part
of the prison or in a prison hostel; they are paid normal wages, from which
they support their families and meet their own expenses.
Education for those in custody is provided by local education authorities in
close liaison with central departments. Each prison in England and Wales has
an education officer and a number of part-time teachers.
In many prisons the education officer is assisted by one or more full-time
teachers. Attendance at evening classes is voluntary but full-time day classes
are provided for young people under 16 years of age (such as those in borstals
and in junior detention centres) and on a selective basis for people over that
age. Day release may be granted to certain prisoners to improve their basic
education standards or to pursue examination courses. Some prisoners take
Open University courses. All inmates have access to the prison library. Other
recreational activities include films, plays, concerts, lectures and discussions.
Selected prisoners take vocational training courses leading to recognised
qualifications. Others learn construction industry crafts, their skills being later
used in maintaining and improving existing establishments and building new
ones. Facilities in Scotland and Northern Ireland are similar to those in England
and Wales.
Physical education in custodial centres aims to promote and maintain
physical fitness and development; to provide opportunities to attain externally
recognised standards of proficiency; and to ensure that men leaving prison
are physically competent to sustain the demands of employment outside.
Remedial exercise therapy is available for those in need of such treatment.
All offenders under 21 must attend a certain number of classes, but adults
may choose whether to take part.
Medical Services The physical and mental care of inmates is a statutory duty of the prison medical
officer. Large establishments have medical teams, while others need only the

services of a medical officer on a part-time basis. All prisons have hospital
treatment facilities.
Some large prisons provide specialist treatment and have the services of
visiting medical specialists. I he facilities are available to patients referred
from other establishments, hour prisons have surgical units, one of which is
contained in the psychiatric prison at Grendon which is the only one of its
type in England and Wales. Several other prison hospitals have staff qualified
in psychiatry. Patients can also be referred to National Health Service
clinics and hospitals; some consultants in forensic psychiatry hold joint
appointments with the prison service and the National Health Service.
A number of selected establishments have one or more psychologists on their
staff while certain others are covered on a visiting basis. They are engaged on
tasks agreed with management including research into management processes,
treatment programmes for inmates, staff training and diagnostic assessments
for treatment or allocation purposes.
All prisoners, from the beginning of their sentence, have a general right to write
and receive letters and to be visited by their relatives at regular intervals. They
also have such privileges as additional letters and visits, the use of books,
periodicals and newspapers, and the right to make purchases from the canteen
with money they have earned in prison. Depending on the facilities available,
they may be granted the further privileges of dining and recreation in association
and watching television in the evening.
Breaches of discipline are dealt with by the prison governor, or by the
board of visitors (visiting committees in Scotland), who have power to order,
among other penalties, forfeiture of remission and forfeiture of privileges.
Boards of visitors consist of lay people, two of whom must be magistrates.
The welfare of prisoners is the general concern of the prison staff as a whole.
A special role is played by probation officers attached to the staff (social
workers in Scotland) who provide links between the probation service outside
the prison and with statutory and voluntary welfare services. These arrange¬
ments are designed to assist prisoners’ wives and families, and help the
prisoner on release by making some provision for his needs in employment
and accommodation.
Prisoners may also receive visits from specially appointed prison visitors
whose work is voluntary and, in England and Wales, is co-ordinated and guided
by the National Association of Prison Visitors.
For the spiritual welfare of the inmates, a chaplain of the Church of England
(in Scotland of the Church of Scotland, and in Northern Ireland of the Church
of Ireland and of the Presbyterian Church), a Roman Catholic priest and a
Methodist minister are appointed to every prison. Ministers of other denomina¬
tions are appointed or specially called in as needed. The chaplaincy programme
not only provides for worship, group work and pastoral counselling, but covers
involvement with other members of staff in treatment and in management.
After-care starts at the beginning of a prisoner’s sentence and probation
officers arrange interviews for offenders in the cells at court immediately
after sentence. All prisons in England and Wales arrange pre-release prepara¬
tions for prisoners, for example, discussion groups at which experts consider
with prisoners the domestic, social and employment problems with which
they are likely to be faced on release. For adult prisoners serving two years or
more and for women and young prisoners serving 18 months or more, home

Children in
Trouble
leave is extensively granted towards the end of their sentences to enable them
to re-establish links with their families and friends or to make new contacts
with people, including potential employers, who may be able to assist them
on release. For some male prisoners serving four years or more and for some
women serving 18 months or more there is provision for work outside the
prison before release. Prisoners granted parole may have preparatory leave.
There are two systems of after-care in England and Wales, both run by the
probation and after-care service. A compulsory system applies to prisoners
released from life imprisonment or extended sentences, young prisoners and
young people discharged from borstals and detention centres. A voluntary
system is offered to the remainder. After-care is also provided by a number of
voluntary societies, most of which are members of the National Association for
the Care and Resettlement of Offenders. Hostels and other forms of accom¬
modation are provided, often with some financial help from the Home Office.
In Northern Ireland after-care duties are carried out by probation and
after-care officers and in Scotland by local authority social workers.
In England and Wales no child under ten years can be held guilty of any offence.
A child aged ten to 16 years who is alleged to have committed an offence may be
the subject of criminal proceedings or of ‘care’ proceedings, both of which are
normally held before juvenile courts (see p. 83).
In care proceedings the fact that a child is found guilty of an offence is not
in itself sufficient justification for the making of a care order; the court must
also be of the opinion that the child is in need of care or control which he is
unlikely to receive unless an order is made. In criminal proceedings a court
may make a care order without the need to consider whether the child is in
need of care or control; this applies to a child found guilty of an offence
punishable in the case of an adult by imprisonment.
A number of orders are available to courts in both care and criminal pro¬
ceedings. A care order commits the child to the care of the local authority,
so that the authority becomes responsible for deciding where the child should
be accommodated, for example, with foster parents or in a community home.
The care order is reviewed every six months by the authority, and can be
discharged at any time by the court; normally it expires at the age of 18 or 19.
For children who are too severely disturbed or disruptive to be treated
successfully in other child care homes, ‘youth treatment centres’ are being
provided by the Department of Health and Social Security.
Under a supervision order (usually valid for three years or less) a child
normally remains at home under the supervision of a local authority social
worker or a probation officer. He or she may be required to undergo ‘inter¬
mediate treatment’ which is a compromise between measures involving complete
removal from home and those which do not. It consists of participation under a
supervisor in a variety of constructive and remedial activities through a short
residential course or, more usually, attendance at a day or evening centre.
A court may also order a parent or guardian to enter into recognisances to take
proper care of the child and to exercise proper control over him; such an order
may only be made in criminal proceedings with the consent of the parent or
guardian. In care proceedings, the court may order a stay in hospital in
accordance with the mental health legislation.
In criminal proceedings the courts may also order payments of compensation,
or impose fines or grant a conditional or absolute discharge. If the offender is a
boy, he may be ordered to spend a total of (normally) 12 to 24 hours of his spare
time on Saturdays at one of 60 attendance centres (up to three hours on any one

occasion). The centres are for boys found guilty of offences for which older
people could be sentenced to imprisonment, and provide physical training and
instruction in handicrafts or some other practical subject. For boys aged 14 or
over courts may make a detention centre order (see below), and young people of
15 and over may be committed to the Crown Court with a view to borstal
training (see below). In the case of a very serious crime, detention in a place
approved by the Home Secretary may be ordered.
In Scotland the age of criminal responsibility is eight years, but prosecution is
the exception; no child can be prosecuted for an offence other than at the
instance of the Lord Advocate. Children under 16 years who have committed an
offence or need care and protection are generally brought before an informal
children’s hearing (see p. 85) which can commit a child to supervision by a
local authority subject to conditions appropriate to the child’s needs (this
may include a requirement to stay in a residential home).
The age of criminal responsibility in Northern Ireland is ten. Children aged
16 and under charged with committing a criminal offence may be brought
before a juvenile court. If found guilty of an offence punishable by imprison¬
ment in the case of an adult, the child may be sent to a training school.
Children brought before the courts in need of care and protection may be
placed in care locally. The law relating to young offenders is under review.
Offenders aged 17 to 20 years are recognised as a category distinct from child
and adult offenders and special forms of custodial treatment are devoted to
them. The main non-custodial measures are generally the same as those used
in dealing with adults, although in the London and Manchester areas an
attendance centre order (usually made for younger boys, see above) may be
given. The custodial sentences available are: detention in a detention centre,
borstal training and imprisonment.
Some 12 senior detention centres provide a means of treating young male
offenders in Great Britain for whom a long period of residential training away
from home does not seem necessary or justified by the offence, but who cannot
be taught respect for the law by such non-custodial measures as fines or proba¬
tion. There are also six junior centres for boys aged 14 to 16 years. Detention is
usually for a period of three to six months (a fixed period of three months in
Scotland). Life in a centre is brisk and formal, demanding the highest possible
standard of discipline and achievement. Training comprises a normal working
week of 40 hours, including an hour each day devoted to physical training,
with considerable attention paid to education. All offenders discharged from
a detention centre are supervised for a year.
Borstal training is remedial and educational, based on personal training by
carefully selected staff. Emphasis is placed on vocational training in skilled
trades. There is much freedom of movement and many borstals are open
establishments. Offenders are placed as near their homes as possible in order
to maintain their ties with the local community. The training system is
available to offenders aged 15 to 20 years (16 to 20 years in Scotland and North¬
ern Ireland). Courts rarely order borstal training unless they have already tried
fines, probation or detention centre training, perhaps all three. The training
period usually ranges from six months to two years and is followed by super¬
vision in the community.
A person under 17 years cannot be sentenced to imprisonment in England
and Wales, and no court may pass a sentence of imprisonment on an offender
aged 17 to 20 years unless satisfied that no other method of dealing with him is
96
BRITAIN 1978: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
appropriate. Sentences of up to two years may be ordered by a court to be
suspended. Prisoners under the age of 21 at the time of their sentence are
classified as ‘young prisoners’, and serve their sentences separately from
older prisoners unless they are reclassified as adults and treated as such in
an adult prison. In Scotland no offender under 21 years may be sent to prison;
where neither borstal nor detention training is suitable for an offender aged
16 to 20 years, detention in a special ‘young offenders’ institution’ may be
ordered.

CIVIL JUSTICE
The main sub-divisions of the civil law of England, Wales and Northern Ireland
are: family law, the law of property, the law of contract and the law of torts
(covering injuries suffered by one person at the hands of another irrespective of
any contract between them and including such concepts as negligence, defama¬
tion and trespass). Other branches of the civil law include constitutional and
administrative law (particularly concerned with the use of executive power),
industrial law, maritime law and ecclesiastical law. Scottish civil law has its
own, often analogous, branches.
The limited civil jurisdiction of magistrates’ courts extends to matrimonial
proceedings for custody and maintenance orders, adoption and affiliation and
guardianship orders. The courts also have jurisdiction in respect of such
matters as nuisances under the Public Health Acts and the recovery of rates.
Committees of magistrates license public houses, betting shops and clubs.
County courts (of which there are about 300) are so located that no part of the
country is more than a reasonable distance from one of them.
The jurisdiction of the county courts covers, for instance, actions founded
upon contract and tort (with minor exceptions) where the amount claimed is
not more than £2,000; trust and mortgage cases, where the amount does not
exceed £15,000; and actions for the recovery of land where the net annual value
for rating does not exceed £2,000. Cases outside these limits may be tried in the
county court by consent of the parties, or may in certain circumstances be
transferred from the High Court.
Other matters dealt with by the county courts include hire purchase, the
Rent Acts, landlord and tenant and adoption cases. In addition, undefended
divorce cases are heard and determined in county courts designated as divorce
county courts (defended cases are transferred to the High Court) and outside
London bankruptcies are dealt with in certain county courts. The courts also
deal with complaints of racial discrimination and sex discrimination in
education and the provision of goods, facilities, services and premises (see p.
I35)- Where small claims are concerned (especially those for less than £200
involving consumers), there are special facilities for arbitration and simplified
procedures.
All judges of the Supreme Court (comprising the Court of Appeal, the
Crown Court and the High Court) and all circuit judges and recorders have
power to sit in the county courts, but each court has one or more circuit judges
assigned to it by the Lord Chancellor, and the regular sittings of the court are
mostly taken by them. The judge normally sits alone, although on the request
of a party the court may, in exceptional cases, order a trial with a jury.
The High Court of Justice is divided into the Chancery Division, the Queen’s
Bench Division and the Family Division. Its jurisdiction, which is both original
JUSTICE AND THE LAW
97
Appeals
Scotland
Sheriff Courts
The Court of
Session
and appellate and covers all civil and some criminal cases, is vested in all its
divisions. In general, however, particular types of work are assigned to a
particular division—distribution of work being governed by statute, the rules of
court and the practice of the court. The Family Division, for instance, is
concerned with all jurisdiction affecting the family, including that relating to
adoption and guardianship of children. The Chancery Division deals with
the interpretation of wills and the administration of estates. Maritime and
commercial law is the responsibility of admiralty and commercial divisional
courts of the Queen’s Bench Division.
There are 72 High Court judges, each of whom is attached to one division on
appointment but may be transferred to any other division during his term of
office. The Lord Chancellor is president of the Court of Appeal and of the
Chancery Division—the administration of the Chancery Division being the
responsibility of the senior judge known as the Vice-Chancellor. The Queen’s
Bench Division is presided over by the Lord Chief Justice of England, who
ranks next to the Lord Chancellor in the legal hierarchy, and the Family Divi¬
sion is headed by the President. Outside London (where the High Court sits at
the Royal Courts of Justice) sittings of the court are held at 23 Crown Court
centres.
For the hearing of cases at first instance, High Court judges sit singly.
Appellate jurisdiction in civil matters from inferior courts is exercised by
courts of two (or sometimes three) judges, or by single judges of the appropri¬
ate division, nominated by the Lord Chancellor.
Appeals in matrimonial proceedings heard by magistrates’ courts go to a
divisional court of the Family Division of the High Court. Affiliation appeals
are heard by the Crown Court, as are appeals from decisions of the licensing
committees of magistrates. Appeals from the High Court and the county courts
are heard in the Court of Appeal (Civil Division) and may (with leave of the
court or of the House of Lords) go on to the House of Lords, which is the
ultimate court of appeal in civil cases.
The ex officio members of the Court of Appeal (Civil Division) are the Lord
Chancellor, the Lord Chief Justice, the President of the Family Division and the
Master of the Rolls; the ordinary members are 16 Lords Justices of Appeal.
The judges in the House of Lords are the nine Lords of Appeal in Ordinary,
who must have a quorum of three, but usually sit as a group of five, and some¬
times even of seven. Lay peers do not attend the hearing of appeals (which
normally take place in a committee room and not in the legislative chamber),
but peers who hold or have held high judicial office may also sit. The president
of the House in its judicial capacity is the Lord Chancellor, and proceedings
take the form of the normal proceedings of the House: judgments are given
as speeches to a motion, and the decision is in the form of a vote.
The main civil courts in Scotland are the sheriff courts which, in their
civil capacity, correspond roughly to English county courts, and the Court
of Session.
The civil jurisdiction of the sheriff court extends to most kinds of action and is
normally unlimited by the value of the case. Much of the work is done by the
sheriff, against whose decisions an appeal may be made to the sheriff-principal
or directly to the Court of Session.
The Court of Session sits only in Edinburgh, and has jurisdiction to deal with
all kinds of action, subject to a few exceptions. The main exception is an action
98
BRITAIN 1978: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
The Scottish Land
Court
Northern Ireland
Civil
Proceedings
where the value claimed is less than £500—a matter for the sheriff court. The
Court of Session has sole jurisdiction in divorce and certain other actions. The
court is divided into two parts: the Outer House, a court of first instance, and
the Inner House, which is mainly an appeal court. The Inner House is divided
into two divisions of equal status, each consisting of four judges—the first
division being presided over by the Lord President and the second division by
the Lord Justice Clerk. Appeals to the Inner House may be made from the
Outer House and from the sheriff court. From the Inner House an appeal may
go the House of Lords. The judges of the Court of Session are the same as
those of the High Court of Justiciary. The Lord President of the court holds
the office of Lord Justice General in the High Court (see p. 84).
The Scottish Land Court is a special court whose jurisdiction relates to
agricultural tenancies and similar matters. It consists of a judge (ranking
equally with the judges of the Court of Session) and four laymen who are
specialists in agriculture.
Minor civil cases in Northern Ireland are dealt with in magistrates’ courts, but
as in England and Wales most civil actions are heard in the county courts. The
superior civil law court is the High Court of Justice and appeal may lie to the
Court of Appeal. Together, these two courts comprise the Supreme Court of
Judicature and their practice and procedure are similar to those in the corres¬
ponding English courts. The House of Lords is the final civil appeal court.
The Government is proposing to reform the civil court system.
In England and Wales civil proceedings are instituted by the aggrieved person;
no preliminary inquiry as to the authenticity of the grievance is required.
Actions in the High Court are usually begun by a writ of summons served on
the defendant by the plaintiff, which notifies the defendant that the plaintiff
has a claim against him and states the nature of the claim. If the defendant
intends to contest the claim, he informs the court. Documents setting out the
precise question in dispute (the pleadings) are then delivered to the court.
County court proceedings are initiated by a ‘request’ served on the defendant
by the court; subsequent procedure is simpler than in the High Court.
A decree of divorce must be pronounced in open court, but the special
procedure introduced for a limited class of case in 1973 and extended to most
undefended cases in 1977 dispenses with the need to give evidence in court
and provides for written evidence to be considered by the registrar.
Civil proceedings, because they are a private matter, can usually be aban¬
doned or compromised at any time without leave of the court—the parties to a
dispute being able to settle their differences through their solicitors before the
stage of actual trial is reached. Actions that are brought to court are usually
tried by a judge without a jury, except in cases involving claims for defama¬
tion, false imprisonment, or malicious prosecution, when either party may
insist on trial by jury, or in a case of fraud, when the person against whom
fraud is alleged may claim this right. The jury decides questions of fact and
damages awarded to the injured party; majority verdicts may be accepted.
Judgments in civil cases are enforceable through the authority of the court.
Most are for sums of money and may be enforced, in cases of default, by seizure
of the debtor’s goods or by attachment of earnings (a court order requiring an
employer to make periodic payments to the court by deduction from the
debtor’s wages). Other judgments can take the form of an injunction restraining
someone from performing an illegal act. Refusal to obey a judgment directing
the defendant to do something or to refrain from doing something may result

in imprisonment for contempt of court. Arrest under an order of committal
may be effected only on a warrant of the court.
The general rule is that the costs of the action (the barristers’ fees, solicitors’
charges, court fees and other payments) are in the discretion of the court.
Normally, the court orders them to be paid by the party losing the action.
In Scotland proceedings in the Court of Session or ordinary actions (of a
value exceeding ^5°°) in sheriff court are initiated by serving on the
defender a summons (an initial writ in the sheriff court). In Court of Session
actions the next step is the publication of the action in the court lists. If the
defender intends to contest the action, he must inform the court; if he does
not appear, the court grants a decree in absence in favour of the pursuer. In
ordinary actions in the sheriff court the defender is simply required to enter
appearance within a certain number of days after service of the initial writ,
and if he does so this is followed by a formal appearance in court by solicitors
or, in some cases, the parties to the dispute. Trial by jury in civil actions in
Scotland is more common than in England and Wales, being the usual form
of procedure in actions for damages for personal injuries in the Court of
Session. In the sheriff court it is relatively rare, being confined to actions
between employer and employee.
In summary causes (actions normally of a value less than £500) in the sheriff
court the procedure is less formal. The statement of claim is attached to the
summons, which in most cases is a printed form obtained from the sheriff
clerk. The procedure is designed to enable most actions to be carried through
without the parties involved having to appear in court. They (or their repre¬
sentatives) need appear only when an action is defended or there is some doubt
about the method of paying the debt.
The Restrictive Practices Court is a specialised United Kingdom court which
deals with monopolies, restrictive trade practices and resale price main¬
tenance. It comprises five judges and up to ten other people with experience
and expertise in industry, commerce or public life.
Administrative tribunals consist of persons or bodies exercising judicial or
quasi-judicial functions outside the ordinary hierarchy of the courts. As a rule,
they are set up by Act of Parliament or under powers conferred by statute, which
also govern their constitution, functions and procedure.
The continuing expansion of governmental activity and involvement in the
social and economic affairs of the nation has greatly multiplied the occasions on
which the individual may find himself at issue with the administration, with a
group of people or with another individual. Consequently there has been a sub¬
stantial growth during the past 30 years of administrative tribunals with the
function of deciding or adjudicating in disputes arising under regulatory or
welfare legislation. Such tribunals include those concerned with: land and
property; national insurance; supplementary benefits; employment rights;
mental health; transport; taxation; and many which do not fall into any
specified group. Usually they consist of an uneven number of people so that a
majority decision can be reached. Members are normally appointed by the
minister concerned with the subject but other authorities (for instance, the
Lord Chancellor) have the power of appointment in appropriate cases. The
Lord Chancellor (or the Lord President of the Court of Session in Scotland)
makes appointments in most cases where a lawyer chairman or member is
required. Members usually hold office for a specified period.
There are also tribunals which enforce professional discipline (for example of
100
BRITAIN 1978: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
GOVERNMENT
RESPONSIBILI¬
TIES
England and
Wales
doctors and solicitors) but these are entirely different in constitution from the
statutory tribunals and have no jurisdiction over the general public.
Appeals on a point of law from all the more important tribunals may be
made in England and Wales to the High Court, in Scotland to the Court of
Session and in Northern Ireland to the Court of Appeal. An appeal may also
be made to a specially constituted appeal tribunal, to a minister of the Crown
or to an independent referee. The Employment Appeal Tribunal which hears
appeals on questions of law from decisions of industrial tribunals (see p. 323)
has High Court and Court of Session status. The Council on Tribunals
(appointed jointly by the Lord Chancellor and the Lord Advocate) exercises
general supervision over tribunals and reports on particular matters, those
peculiar to Scotland being dealt with by the Scottish Committee of the Council.
ADMINISTRATION OF THE LAW
The United Kingdom judiciary is entirely independent of the Government and
is not subject to ministerial direction or control. There is no minister of justice.
Responsibility for the administration of justice rests with the Lord Chancellor,
the Home Secretary and the Secretaries of State for Scotland and Northern
Ireland. The Prime Minister is concerned with the legal system in that he
recommends the highest judicial appointments to the Crown.
The Lord Chancellor is the head of the judiciary (and sometimes sits as a judge
in the House of Lords). He is the Cabinet minister responsible in England
and Wales for magisterial and all but the most senior judicial appointments.
He is concerned with court procedure and is responsible for the administra¬
tion of all courts other than magistrates’ courts. On the civil law side, law
reform and supervision of the legal aid and advice scheme are matters for him.
The Home Secretary, also a senior Cabinet minister, is concerned with the
criminal law, including law reform. He is responsible for the prevention of
crime, the apprehension of offenders and the penal system. He also exercises
a general supervision over magistrates’ courts, with some specific responsibili¬
ties (such as approving the appointment of justices’ clerks). On matters relating
to crime prevention and the treatment of offenders, he is advised by the
Advisory Council on the Penal System. Although probation and after-care of
prisoners is carried out by a locally organised service, the Home Secretary is
responsible at a national level for the service’s efficiency and he has wide
regulatory powers. Prison policy and the administration of custodial centres
are functions of the Home Office Prison Department and the Home Secretary
appoints to each centre a board of visitors representing the local community
to investigate and advise him on the state of the buildings, administration
and the treatment of inmates. The boards have certain disciplinary powers in
relation to serious breaches of discipline and they hear applications or com¬
plaints from inmates. The Home Secretary is advised by a special Parole
Board on the release of prisoners on licence.
Special provisions within the penal system applying to young offenders
are the responsibility of the Home Office and the Department of Health and
Social Security. (Local authority social services departments also have many
functions relating to children and young people.)
The Home Secretary is also responsible for advising the Queen on the
exercise of the royal prerogative of mercy to grant a free pardon in connection
with a person’s conviction, or to remit all or part of a penalty which may have
been imposed on an offender by a court.
The Secretary of State for the Environment is responsible for the building

and maintenance of county courts and providing accommodation for all the
superior courts in England and Wales, except the Central Criminal Court in
London, which is the responsibility of the City of London.
The Attorney General and the Solicitor General, the Law Officers of the
Crown for England and Wales, are the Government’s principal advisers on
English law, and represent the Crown in appropriate domestic and international
cases. They are senior barristers, elected members of the House of Commons
and hold ministerial posts. The Attorney General is also Attorney General for
Northern Ireland.
As well as exercising various civil law functions, the Attorney General has
ultimate responsibility for the enforcement of the criminal law in England and
Wales, and the Director of Public Prosecutions (see p. 85) is subject to his
superintendence. The Attorney General is concerned with the institution and
prosecution of certain types of criminal proceedings, but he must exercise an
independent discretion, and must not be influenced by his Government
colleagues. The Solicitor General is subject to the authority of the Attorney
General, with similar rights and duties.
In Scotland, all judges other than the most senior ones (and including justices
of the peace) are appointed on the recommendation of the Secretary of State,
who also appoints the staff of the High Court of Justiciary and the Court of
Session and is responsible for the composition, staffing and organisation of the
sheriff courts. District courts are staffed and administered by the district and
islands local authorities.
The Secretary of State is responsible for the administration of the penal
system. Prison policy is a matter for the Scottish Home and Health Depart¬
ment and there are visiting committees for each custodial centre similar to
the boards of visitors in England and Wales. The Secretary of State is
advised on parole matters by the Parole Board for Scotland. Scotland has
no separate probation service; local authority social work departments
provide the services and officers required by the criminal courts in their areas.
I he Lord Advocate and the Solicitor General for Scotland are the chief legal
advisers to the Government on Scottish questions and the principal repre¬
sentatives of the Crown for the purposes of litigation in Scotland. The Lord
Advocate is closely concerned with questions of legal policy and administra¬
tion; he is also responsible for the Scottish parliamentary draftsmen, and for
the public prosecution of all major crimes. He delegates most of the work of
prosecution to the Solicitor General, to eight Advocates Depute and to Pro¬
curators Fiscal who are full-time legally qualified prosecutors. The permanent
adviser to the Lord Advocate on prosecution matters is the Crown Agent who
is head of the procurator fiscal service and is assisted by a staff of civil
servants known as the Crown Office.
In Northern Ireland the judiciary are appointed on the advice of the Lord
Chancellor. The Northern Ireland Office, under the Secretary of State, deals
with the staffing and general organisation of the county and petty sessions courts
and is responsible for the penal system.
The courts of the United Kingdom are the Queen’s Courts (since the Crown is
the historic source of all judicial power) and all appointments to the High Court
or the Court of Session are made by the Queen acting on the advice of ministers.
Full-time judges do not engage in politics, except for the Lord Chancellor,
who, as well as being head of the judiciary and speaker of the House of Lords, is

a leading member of the Government. With the exception of lay magistrates,
judges are normally appointed from practising barristers or advocates or
solicitors who have served three years as recorders; neither their training nor
their careers are in any way dictated by the State. Lay magistrates in England,
Wales and Northern Ireland need no legal qualifications but on appointment
they undertake to complete a period of basic training, so that they may
obtain a sufficient knowledge of the law, including the rules of evidence, and
may understand the nature and purpose of sentencing. A special committee
advises the Lord Chancellor on training policies. Justices of the peace in
Scotland likewise need no legal qualifications, and the Secretary of State for
Scotland is responsible for providing such training for them as is necessary.
Justices of the peace in Northern Ireland do not need legal qualifications but
training courses are undertaken by those serving as members of lay panels
for juvenile courts. In certain circumstances (for instance, in cases of mis¬
conduct or proven incapacity) judges of the inferior courts in England and
Wales and Northern Ireland may be removed from their position by the Lord
Chancellor, and in Scotland, by the Secretary of State on a report by the
Lord President of the Court of Session and the Lord Justice Clerk.
In order to safeguard and perpetuate the independence of the judiciary from
the executive, however, superior judges in England and Wales and Northern
Ireland (other than the Lord Chancellor who, as a Cabinet minister, changes
with the Government) are subject to a power of removal only by the Sovereign
on an address presented by both Houses of Parliament; in Scotland there is no
statutory provision for removal of judges of the Court of Session or High Court
of Justiciary from office and it is probable that special legislation would be
required to effect such a dismissal.
The legal profession is divided into two branches: barristers (advocates in
Scotland) and solicitors. Barristers are known collectively as the ‘Bar’, and
collectively and individually as ‘counsel’. Solicitors undertake legal business
for lay clients, while barristers advise on legal problems submitted through
solicitors and present cases in the higher courts although certain functions
are common to both.
Although the law allows an individual to conduct his own case if he
wishes, in important cases most people prefer to be legally represented.
Royal commissions are inquiring into the provision of legal services and con- .
sidering the structure, organisation, entry, training and remuneration of the
legal profession.
In England and Wales every barrister and every student wishing to become a
barrister must be a member of one of the four Inns of Court (Lincoln’s Inn, Inner
Temple, Middle Temple and Gray’s Inn). To become a student member of an
Inn, an entrant must normally have a law degree from a United Kingdom
university or polytechnic. People with other degrees and ‘mature’ students may
also be accepted, but they must pass a diploma in law. All students must pass
the professional examinations run by the Council of Legal Education. After
training, a student can be called to the Bar, but may not practise independently
until he has completed a year’s pupillage with an established barrister. The
governing body of the profession is the Senate of the Inns of Court and the
Bar. The Bar Council (composed of those members of the Senate who are
elected by the Bar) maintains the standards and independence of the profession
and improves its services.
A prospective solicitor in England and Wales must be considered suitable by
the appropriate committee of The Law Society (the professional organisation
JUSTICE AND THE LAW
103

ADVICE AND
ASSISTANCE
Advice and
Assistance

Proceedings
of solicitors) and he must enter into ‘articles of clerkship’ with a practising
solicitor of not less than five years’ standing before he can begin his professional
career. The term of articles lasts for two to four years, depending upon the
educational qualifications of the student. An articled clerk must pass the
necessary examinations prescribed by The Law Society and, unless he has been
a barrister or is a law graduate of a university, he is generally required to attend
a course of studies at a recognised law school. Once a solicitor is qualified, he
may become a member of The Law Society.
In Scotland prospective advocates and solicitors undergo much the same
training. While the respective professional organisations—the Faculty of
Advocates and The Law Society of Scotland—have their own professional
examinations, candidates usually obtain exemption from them by including the
necessary subjects in a law degree of a Scottish university. The prospective
advocate must, thereafter, undergo a period of training (either of 21 months or
of 12 months depending on whether or not he has been granted exemption from
nine months’ training) in a solicitor’s office, followed by about nine months’
pupillage with a practising advocate. The prospective solicitor must serve an
apprenticeship of two years in a solicitor’s office before he can begin his pro¬
fessional career.
In Northern Ireland barristers are members of the Inn of Court of Northern
Ireland; there is also a General Council of the Bar of Northern Ireland. The
professional organisation for solicitors is The Incorporated Law Society of
Northern Ireland.
Legal aid is provided for people of limited means to pay for the cost of advice and
assistance and for legal representation in court proceedings. Lawyers’ costs and
the expenses of litigation are paid out of a fund provided by the State.
The fund is entitled to be reimbursed from contributions which assisted
people may have to pay according to their means and costs, damages re¬
covered from legally aided people’s opponents in litigation, and a government
grant.
Where court proceedings are not involved, people with limited means can
obtain help from a solicitor on any legal matter for little or no cost. This includes
giving advice, writing letters, drafting wills and obtaining opinions from a
barrister. A solicitor may act for a client until his costs and expenses reach a
total of £25 (^45 for undefended divorce cases), but authority may be
obtained for this limit to be exceeded. A person seeking help has to give the
solicitor brief details about his income and savings. The income limit laid
down by the scheme is reviewed at least annually.
In some urban areas law centres exist to provide free legal advice; all have at
least one full-time salaried lawyer and most employ community workers. There
are also voluntary legal advice centres in many parts of the country, often linked
with Citizens Advice Bureaux.
Legal aid is available to people whose disposable incomes and disposable capital
do not exceed certain prescribed amounts,1 but a contribution is payable accord¬
ing to the level of the applicant’s income; if that is below a prescribed amount,
legal aid is given free of any contribution. As in the case of legal advice and
1 Assessments of disposable income and capital are made by the Supplementary Benefits
Commission and are governed by regulations which allow for deductions from gross
income for maintenance of dependants, interest on loans, income tax, rent and other
matters for which a person may reasonably provide out of income, and deductions for
the value of a person’s house, furniture and other household effects from his capital.
io4
BRITAIN 1978: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
assistance, the qualifying income limits for aid are reviewed at least once a year.
The civil legal aid schemes are run by The Law Society, The Law Society of
Scotland and The Incorporated Law Society of Northern Ireland, under the
general guidance respectively of the Lord Chancellor, the Secretary of State for
Scotland and the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland.
An applicant for legal aid must show that he has reasonable grounds for
taking or defending the proceedings. If his application is successful, he is
entitled to select from a panel a solicitor (who, if necessary, instructs counsel),
and the case is then conducted in the ordinary way, except that no money passes
between the assisted person and his solicitor—payments being made in and out
of the legal aid fund. The costs of an action which an assisted litigant loses against
an unassisted opponent may also, subject to certain conditions and if the court
so orders, be met out of the fund. Local committees have the right to refuse
assistance if it appears unreasonable that the applicant should receive it in the
particular circumstances of a case; both solicitors and counsel have a duty to
leview the case at each stage to see that it is not being pursued unreasonably at
public expense. Legal aid is not generally available in cases where redress is
sought for alleged defamation or in proceedings in administrative tribunals.
Aid in Criminal In criminal proceedings in England and Wales a legal aid order may be made by
Proceedings the court concerned if it appears to be in the interests of justice and that a
defendant s means are such that he requires financial help in meeting the costs
of the proceedings in which he is involved. An order must be made when a per¬
son is committed for trial on a charge of murder or applies for leave to appeal
from the Court of Appeal (Criminal Division) or the Courts Martial Appeal
Court to the House of Lords. No person can be given a custodial sentence for
the first time unless he is legally represented.
\ oluntary duty solicitor schemes at some magistrates’ courts provide 'stand¬
by’ help for unrepresented defendants.
The criminal legal aid scheme in England and Wales is administered by the
courts, under the overall responsibility of the Home Secretary.
The arrangements for aid in criminal proceedings in Scotland and Northern
Ireland are broadly similar, but in Scotland there is a statutory duty solicitor
scheme for accused people in custody in sheriff, and district, court cases and
the interests of justice test applies only in summary cases.
LAW REFORM The duty of keeping the law under review in order to ensure that it meets the
needs of modern society lies in England and Wales with the Law Reform
Committee, the Criminal Law Revision Committee and the Law Commission,
and in Scotland with the Scottish Law Commission. The Law Reform Com¬
mittee and the Criminal Law Revision Committee are standing committees of
j udges and distinguished practising and academic lawyers, appointed respectively
by the Lord Chancellor and the Home Secretary, to examine such aspects of the
civil and criminal law as may be referred to them by the appropriate minister.
The Law Commission is a permanent body consisting of five lawyers of high
standing, charged with the duty of scrutinising the law with a view to its
systematic development and reform, including the possibility of codification,
the elimination of anomalies, the repeal of obsolete and unnecessary enact¬
ments, and the reduction of the number of separate enactments. It reports to the
Lord Chancellor. The Scottish Law Commission, which has a constitution
similar to that of the English body and similar functions reports to the Lord
Advocate. The work of the two commissions has led to changes in many
areas of the law, the repeal of over 720 obsolete Acts and the pruning of the
contents of more than 1,220 others.
Europe
The decisions taken in the 1974 Defence Review, which aimed at reducing
defence costs as a proportion of national resources while maintaining a modern
and effective defence system, continue to form the basis of Britain’s defence
policy. As a result of the review, completed in early 1975 following consulta¬
tions with Britain’s allies, defence forces are being concentrated on those areas
in which a British contribution to collective defence will be most effective in
ensuring the nation’s own security and that of its allies. Thus the North
Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO) remains the primary charge on
Britain’s defence resources, and Britain is withdrawing from its non-NATO
commitments wherever this is consistent with its fundamental military and
political obligations. At the same time, general purpose forces are being main¬
tained as insurance against the unforeseen.
Reductions in planned defence expenditure for the period 1977/78-1978/79
were announced in July and December 1976 as part of the overall reductions
in public expenditure programmes (see p. 186). The precise measures for
the later years have yet to be identified, but for 1977/7O the savings will
come mainly from those areas of the support structure not directly associ¬
ated with front-line units and from rephasing the equipment and works
programme. The Government’s overriding objective is to keep to the mini¬
mum the effect of the reductions on Britain’s front-line contribution to
NATO.
POLICY
Britain’s basic security depends on the strength of the North Atlantic Alliance,
and it is to NATO that by far the greater part of Britain’s military forces is
committed. Britain makes a major contribution to the full range of deterrent
capabilities, both conventional and nuclear, required to maintain NATO’s
defensive posture. Within NATO, Britain plays an important part in the efforts
of the European members to assume, through closer co-operation, an increasing
responsibility for Western defence. In the ‘Eurogroup’ Britain and ten other
European members are working to improve their contribution to the Alliance
and to achieve a more effective collective result from the available resources.
The sub-groups of the Eurogroup, each of which concentrates on a specific
area such as training or logistics, make an important contribution towards
the strength of the Alliance by increasing co-operation among its members.
Britain also participates in the independent European Programme Group
of all European members of the Alliance; the group has been set up to extend
co-operation among European countries in defence equipment and to contri¬
bute to greater equipment co-operation throughout the Alliance.
Britain is playing a major part in the efforts to reduce tension and achieve
more lasting peace in Europe. It is working to ensure that the agreements
signed in Helsinki with the Soviet Union and Eastern European countries
on security and co-operation in Europe, which are to be reviewed at a con¬
ference in Belgrade in the autumn of 1977, will contribute to increased
stability and improved relations. It is also seeking to achieve progress in
the negotiations for mutual and balanced force reductions in Central Europe.

Britain retains responsibility for the protection of its remaining dependencies;
is a member of the Central Treaty Organisation (CENTO); and participates
with Australia, New Zealand, Malaysia and Singapore in the Five Power
Defence Arrangements. In addition, the armed forces continue to give
assistance to communities overseas, particularly in such activities as disaster
relief and development work.
Britain also plays an active part in the United Nations (UN) and other
international bodies working to eliminate the sources of tension and conflict
between nations and to promote arms control and disarmament. It supports
the peacekeeping efforts of the UN—supplying the largest national contingent
to the UN Peace-Keeping Force in Cyprus. Britain is a frequent contributor
to debates in the Conference of the Committee on Disarmament and has
played a leading part in strengthening the regime of non-proliferation of
nuclear weapons, through the International Atomic Energy Agency and other
bodies.

PLANNING AND CONTROL
Supreme responsibility for national defence rests with the Government as a
whole, which is responsible to Parliament. The formulation of defence
policy is the responsibility of the Secretary of State for Defence. In recent
years the emphasis in defence organisation has been on increased central
policy control and the co-ordinated planning of the defence effort as a whole.
The Ministry of Defence (see p. 44) ensures effective co-ordination of policy
and administration concerning the Services. The Secretary of State is assisted
by a Minister of State, and by three Under-Secretaries of State—for the Navy,
Army and Air Force respectively. They, together with the Chief of the Defence
Staff, the three Service Chiefs of Staff, the Permanent Under-Secretary of
DEFENCE

State for Defence, the Chief of Personnel and Logistics, the Chief Scientific
Adviser and the Chief of Defence Procurement form the Defence Council,
which deals with major aspects of defence policy under the chairmanship of
the Secretary of State. The Chiefs of Staff Committee, comprising the Chief
of the Defence Staff as chairman and the Chiefs of Staff of the three Services,
is responsible for giving professional advice on strategy and operations, and
on the military implications of defence policy. The day-to-day management
of the three Services is the responsibility of the Admiralty, Army and Air
Force Boards of the Defence Council.
Information about defence policy and the armed forces is provided in an annual
Statement on the Defence Estimates (Cmnd. 6735 in 1977, published in
February). The defence estimates for 1977-78 totalled £6,329 million, which
represents about 5 per cent of gross domestic product at market prices. Of
the total expenditure £2,874 million (45 per cent) is on personnel (pay,
allowances, pensions), £2,350 million (37 per cent) on equipment and the
remaining £1,105 million (18 per cent) on buildings and miscellaneous stores
and services. (See also diagram on p. 106.)
DEPLOYMENT
The basis of the NATO strategy of flexibility in response, which retains
the principle of forward defence, is that credible deterrence of military aggres¬
sion of all kinds is essential. While NATO must be ready to use nuclear weapons
if necessary, its conventional forces must be maintained to enable it to respond
to aggression at a variety pf levels, the level of response being that which enables
NATO to maintain the territorial and maritime integrity of the Alliance and
thereby to gain time for negotiations to end a conflict. The strategy requires a
comprehensive range of mobile and well-equipped conventional forces and
tactical and strategic nuclear weapons.
Britain makes a major contribution to the forces required by NATO’s present
strategy. Together with its tactical nuclear forces, the British Polaris strategic
force provides a unique European contribution to NATO’s nuclear deterrent.
Virtually all ships of frigate size and above are earmarked for assignment in
an emergency to NATO. The Royal Navy also contributes to NATO’s
Standing Naval Force Atlantic, Standing Naval Force Channel, and the
Naval On Call Force Mediterranean. The British Army of the Rhine
(BAOR) and Royal Air Force Germany are deployed in the Federal Republic
of Germany and there is a Field Force in Berlin. The main combat element
of BAOR is First (British) Corps which is being reorganised, and by 1979
will comprise four new-style armoured divisions, an artillery division, and a
new infantry formation. Its peace-time strength of around 55,000 would be
more than doubled on mobilisation by reinforcements and reserves from
Britain (see p. 112). Virtually all the RAF’s combat and combat support
aircraft are assigned to NATO. RAF Germany is a tactical air force including
strike/attack, reconnaissance, close support and air-defence aircraft. In
addition, combat units based in Britain provide an important part of
NATO’s mobile reinforcement capability. These include the ground elements
of the United Kingdom Mobile Force, the British contribution to the
Allied Command Europe Mobile Force (Land) and three squadrons of 22
Special Air Service Regiment. RAF Strike Command provides forces for
strike/attack, reconnaissance, close support, air defence and maritime patrol
and anti-submarine warfare, together with transport forces and air elements

At home a major task of the armed forces since 1969 has been to assist the
civil authorities in Northern Ireland in the maintenance of law and order, and
they have operated to counter the terrorist activities of extremist organisations.
In the Mediterranean, British forces are deployed in Gibraltar, in Malta until
1979, and in Cyprus to meet Britain’s commitment to the United Nations
Force and to provide for the security of the Sovereign Base Areas. In Hong
Kong, units of all three services provide a garrison for external defence, and
a Gurkha battalion is stationed in Brunei. A Royal Marines detachment is
maintained in the Falkland Islands; and in the Caribbean, units of the Army
and the RAF provide a garrison for the external defence of Belize.
THE ARMED FORCES
Britain’s armed forces consist of the Royal Navy and Royal Marines, the
Army and the Royal Air Force.
The Royal Navy has four main arms: the Naval General Service, which
mans and maintains the surface fleet; the Fleet Air Arm; the Submarine
Service; and the Royal Marines, who primarily provide an amphibious
striking force. The Royal Navy has a unified sea command, Commander-in-
Chief, Fleet; and the Naval Home Command, Portsmouth, under a
Commander-in-Chief, with subordinate area commands based at Plymouth'
Chatham and Rosyth.
The Army is organised into some 30 arms and services which include the
Household Cavalry, the Royal Horse Artillery, the Royal Armoured Corps,
the Royal Regiment of Artillery, the Corps of Royal Engineers, the Royal
Corps of Signals, the Regiments of Foot Guards and Regiments of Infantry,
the Special Air Service Regiment, the Army Air Corps, the Royal Corps of
Transport, the Royal Army Medical Corps, the Royal Army Ordnance Corps
and the Corps of Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers. At home the
Army is under a single command, United Kingdom Land Forces, with
subordinate district commands; Northern Ireland remains a separate com¬
mand while the emergency continues. Overseas there are British Army of the
Rhine, land elements of British Force Headquarters in Cyprus and Hong
Kong, Fortress Headquarters Gibraltar and Garrison Headquarters in
Brunei and Belize.
The Royal Air Force General Purpose Forces are organised in two opera¬
tional commands, Strike Command and Royal Air Force Germany. Support
and training organisations are grouped within one United Kingdom
command.
The three women’s Services, the Women’s Royal Naval Service, the Women’s
Royal Army Corps, and the W omen’s Royal Air Force are integral parts of
the armed forces, and servicewomen serve alongside servicemen in Britain
and overseas. Nursing services are provided by Queen Alexandra’s Royal
Naval Nursing Service, Queen Alexandra’s Royal Army Nursing Corps and
Princess Mary’s Royal Air Force Nursing Service.
Britain s armed forces excluding non-United Kingdom personnel totalled
334,5°° on 1st January 1977, 76,000 in the Royal Navy and Royal Marines,

Britain’s armed forces consist entirely of personnel serving on a voluntary
basis. Engagements available to non-commissioned ranks range from three to
22 years, with a wide freedom of choice on the length and terms of service.
Recruits to non-commissioned ranks of all three Services are committed for
only a minimum period of productive service (about three years) and, subject
to that minimum, may leave at any time,at 18 months’ notice. Discharge may
also be granted on compassionate grounds, by purchase, or on grounds of
conscience (applications being assessed by an independent tribunal). Com¬
missions may be granted for short, medium and long terms. In all three Services
there are opportunities for promotion from the ranks. Entry to commissioned
ranks is on the basis of educational and other qualifications. All three Services
have schemes for university cadetships.
Entrants to non-commissioned ranks are given basic training, and further and
specialist training is given during the course of their careers. Young service¬
men and women are encouraged to study for educational qualifications, all
three Services providing extensive facilities for the consolidation and develop¬
ment of their personnel’s education. Trade and technical training, though
primarily designed for Service purposes, leads for about half the total
number of service personnel to nationally recognised qualifications.

Service technical training is highly valued in industry, which is a significant
advantage on return to civilian life. To assist such resettlement the Services
provide an advisory service, familiarisation attachments to civilian organisa¬
tions, and opportunity and assistance to study for suitable civilian qualifica¬
tions. There are also opportunities for short- and longer-term retraining
both before and after discharge from the Services.
Entrants to commissioned ranks receive initial training at the Britannia
Royal Naval College, Dartmouth, the Royal Military Academy, Sandhurst, the
Royal Air Force College, Cranwell, or similar institutions. This is followed by
specialist training, often including degree courses at university or Service
establishments.
Staff training is provided by the Royal Naval Staff College, Greenwich, the
Army Staff College at Camberley, and the Royal Air Force Staff College at
Bracknell. The National Defence College at Latimer is designed to fit
selected mid-career officers of all three Services for key posts that contribute
to formulation of defence policy in the Ministry of Defence and on inter¬
national staffs. Specially selected senior officers and officials from Britain,
the Commonwealth, NATO, CENTO and other countries attend the Royal
College of Defence Studies (formerly the Imperial Defence College) in
London, which provides the wider background necessary for those destined
to fill higher appointments.
Considerable operational training is done through Joint-Service and inter¬
allied exercises. All three Services provide training facilities for the armed
forces of allied and Commonwealth countries.
Combat forces are functionally divided into the nuclear strategic force (costing
an estimated £96 million in 1977-78), Royal Navy general purpose combat
forces (£843 million), European theatre ground forces (£1,091 million), other
Army combat forces (£7° million) and Royal Air Force general purpose
forces (£1,034 million).
The British contribution to NATO’s strategic deterrent is provided by the
Royal Navy’s force of four Polaris nuclear submarines—Resolution, Repulse,
Renown and Revenge. Each can remain on underwater patrol for long periods
and is equipped with 16 Polaris missiles, armed with nuclear warheads, with
a range of about 2,800 miles (4,506 km).
Britain’s maritime forces are concentrated in the Eastern Atlantic and English
Channel, but retain an ability to be deployed world-wide in defence of
allied or national interests. Nearer home there is an increasing commitment
arising from the need to protect Britain’s offshore resources, in particular
the North Sea oil and gas installations, and to continue the traditional task
of fishery protection.
HMS Invincible, the first of a new class of anti-submarine warfare cruiser,
was launched in 1977. Its prime role will be to deploy the Sea King anti¬
submarine helicopter. The cruiser will also provide a command and control
function for maritime task forces and will contribute to area air defence
with its Sea Dart missile system and Sea Harrier maritime vertical short
take-off and landing (V/STOL) aircraft. The aircraft carrier HMS Ark
Royal also deploys the Sea King helicopter and operates Buccaneer strike
aircraft (equipped with the Anglo-French Martel air-to-surface missile),
Phantom air-defence and Gannet airborne early warning aircraft. Sea Kings
are also embarked on the anti-submarine warfare cruiser HMS Hermes

and the command helicopter cruisers HMS Blake and Tiger, which are
responsible for directing and controlling naval forces. The County class
guided-missile destroyers, all armed with Seaslug and Seacat surface-to-air
missiles and four with the Exocet surface-to-surface guided-missile system,
have been joined by the Type 82 guided-missile destroyer HMS Bristol
(equipped with Sea Dart area air defence missile system and the Ikara anti¬
submarine guided weapon system), and two of the new class of Type 42
Sea Dart guided-missile destroyers. Other surface vessels include the first
of the new Type 22 anti-submarine frigates, 37 general purpose frigates
(comprising 26 Leander class, seven Tribal class and four of the new Type 21
Amazon class), two anti-aircraft frigates, three aircraft direction frigates,
11 anti-submarine frigates, 38 mine counter-measure vessels and five new
Island class offshore patrol vessels. The frigate classes are variously armed
with automatic guns, surface-to-air missile systems, underwater detection and
anti-submarine weapons. Most have the Wasp helicopter embarked, which is
being replaced, where appropriate, by the Anglo-French Lynx. Improved
surface-to-surface capability of these vessels will follow the installation of
Exocet missile systems in some Leander class and the Type 21 and Type 22
frigates. Some Leander class frigates are also equipped with the Ikara anti¬
submarine weapon. Nine nuclear-fleet submarines are in service, including the
first three of the Swiftsure class as also are 18 conventional patrol submarines.
There is also an amphibious capability comprising the two assault ships
HMS Fearless and HMS Intrepid and the Royal Marines Commando Forces,
supported by HMS Hermes, which after its conversion into an anti-submarine
warfare cruiser retains a secondary role as a commando ship.
Ships under construction include HMS Illustrious, the second of the new
anti-submarine warfare cruisers, and two of the new Type 22 class frigates
which will be armed with the Sea Wolf surface-to-air and Exocet anti-ship
missile systems. In addition, work is in hand on three nuclear-fleet submarines,
seven Type 42 Sea Dart destroyers, three Type 21 frigates and two of a new
class of glass-reinforced plastic mine counter-measure vessels.
The European theatre ground forces consist of BAOR, and the forces stationed
in Britain, the main elements of which have primary roles in support of
NATO (see p. 107).
Other Army combat forces comprise land forces stationed overseas to meet
treaty commitments to Commonwealth and other countries (see p. 106).
Armoured regiments are equipped with the Chieftain main battle tank. A new
series of tracked combat reconnaissance vehicles is in service, including
Scorpion and Scimitar, mounting respectively a 76mm and a 30mm gun,
which will shortly be joined by Striker, carrying the Swingfire anti-tank
missile, and Sultan, a command vehicle. The primary tracked armoured
personnel carriers used by mechanised infantry battalions are the FV432, and
entering service with the infantry is the crew-portable Milan anti-tank weapon
system. Artillery units are equipped with the Abbot 105mm self-propelled gun,
155mm and 175mm self-propelled guns and Field Artillery Computer Equip¬
ment (FACE). A new 105mm light gun is entering service and will be joined
by the FH70 155mm field howitzer. Tactical nuclear support is provided by
the Lance missile system. Air defence is provided by the Rapier low-level
surface-to-air missile system and the Blowpipe man-portable very-low-level
missile.

Phantom and Lightning aircraft, together with Rapier and Bloodhound
surface-to-air missiles, are employed in air defence. Radar w arning is provided
by Shackleton airborne early warning aircraft and by the ground radars and
control and reporting centres of the United Kingdom Air Defence Ground
Environment system. Jaguars, Buccaneers and Vulcans operate in the strike/
attack role; Jaguars, Canberras and Vulcans are employed for reconnaissance;
Jaguars and the Harrier V/STOL aircraft for offensive support (with the
Harrier also having a tactical reconnaissance capability); Nimrods for long-
range maritime patrol and anti-submarine warfare and for offshore surveillance
and fishery protection duty.
The VC 10 provides strategic transport and the Hercules (which also has a
strategic capability) is used for tactical transport over medium ranges. For
short-range tasks, the Wessex and Puma helicopters are used, while for search
and rescue operations Wessex and Whirlwind helicopters are deployed around
the shores of Britain. Victor tankers are used for in-flight refuelling, which
gives added range and flexibility to combat aircraft.
Reserve and auxiliary forces are an integral part of the armed forces. Apart
from their essential military role—to supplement the regular forces in time of
war or emergency with trained personnel able immediately to take their places
in the Services either as formed units or as individual reinforcements—they
form an important link between the Services and the civil community. Some
of their members have a reserve liability following a period of regular service
(regular reserve); others are volunteer men and women who devote their spare
time to training for the roles they wTould undertake in war or an emergency. On
1 st January 1977 regular reserves totalled 173,900, and volunteer reserves and
auxiliary forces 74,700. Cadet forces, which make a significant contribution to
recruitment to the regular forces, totalled 137,100.
The Royal I\avy regular reserve consists of various categories of former full¬
time officers and ratings liable to recall in emergency, including the Royal Fleet
Reserve of men with recent experience of regular service. The volunteer
reserves comprise the Royal Naval Reserve, with its associated women’s
reserve, and the Royal Marines Reserve. Both carry out regular part-time
training, the former to man a number of operational minesweepers and support
maritime and other headquarters, the latter to reinforce the regular corps and
in particular the Royal Marine Commandos.
1 he Army reserves comprise the Territorial and Army Volunteer Reserve
(TA\ R) and regular reserves consisting of ex-regular servicemen.
The PA\ R s primary role is to reinforce the ground forces committed to
NATO and to assist in maintaining a secure United Kingdom base in support
of the forces deployed in Europe. It consists of independent units, organised
on a local basis with regular Army and permanent civilian staff, and sponsored
units of specialists recruited on a country-wide basis. They undergo regular
part-time training. The task of regular reservists would be to bring regular and
TAVR formations to war strength.
The Ulster Defence Regiment is a locally-recruited, largely part-time force
designed to support the regular forces in Northern Ireland.

The Royal Air Force Reserve consists of former regular officers and personnel
with a reserve liability, and the Royal Air Force Volunteer Reserve, which
includes the university air squadrons. The Royal Auxiliary Air Force consists
of units which would support regular formations in an emergency.
CIVIL DEFENCE
Civil defence arrangements are principally based on the extended and adapted
use of existing public services operated by nationalised industries, local,
authorities, police authorities and government departments. Supplementary
effort from individual volunteers and voluntary organisations would be brought
in either at the discretion of local authorities or in response to a national
appeal in time of crisis. A central point of recent policy has been to improve the
preparedness of local government to meet a war emergency. Since there is
common ground between such planning and the preparations and organisation
for a major peace-time emergency or national.disaster, activities have also been
directed towards creating a closer relationship in local planning for the
different emergencies of peace and war.
Within an annual budget of ^23-8 million, emphasis is placed on a high level
of central and local government planning. Studies and seminars are arranged
by the Home Office on staff college lines.
Arrangements also include an emergency system for decentralised govern¬
mental control and communications. The United Kingdom Warning and
Monitoring Organisation, which includes the civilian Royal Observer Corps, is
organised to provide public warning of an attack, of the location and strength of
nuclear explosions, and of the distribution and level of radioactive fall-out.
DEFENCE PROCUREMENT
Responsibility for the procurement (that is, research, development and pro¬
duction) of defence equipment, including aircraft, ships, ordnance, guided
weapons and electronics, lies with the Procurement Executive within the
Ministry of Defence. The Executive is responsible for maintaining liaison
between the Service users and the machinery for procurement, and co¬
ordination with industry in the formulation of programmes; this ensures a
co-ordinated and cost-effective approach.
The major part of research is undertaken by the Ministry of Defence’s research
and development establishments, but the Ministry also sponsors a substantial
amount of research by industry and the universities. The research and develop¬
ment establishments have a very wide technological capability, which has
civil as well as military applications: for example, support is given to civil
aerospace-projects and advanced aero-engines. On the development side, the
establishments collaborate closely with the Ministry’s contractors by monitor¬
ing their progress, and by assisting in testing programmes and in solving
particular technical problems.
Modern defence equipment is becoming ever more complex, and its develop¬
ment requires a high initial investment; in 1977-78 the total cost of British
equipment research and development is estimated at £826 million. The
search for a more efficient use of these resources has caused attention to be
concentrated on collaborative projects, which enable the cost of development
and production to be shared with other countries. On occasions, the outright
purchase of foreign equipment is the most economical solution. Nevertheless,
the importance of maintaining a sound national industrial base for defence
II4
BRITAIN 1978: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
National Projects
Production
procurement is recognised, and there is close consultation between government
and industry both in the National Defence Industries Council and through
other specialised machinery.
Collaboration between Britain and other European countries is already
extensive, and may be expected to increase, particularly through the work of
the European Programme Group. Successful joint projects so far include the
Anglo-French Jaguar aircraft, the Martel air-to-surface missile, the Lynx,
Puma and Gazelle helicopters and the Anglo-Belgian family of armoured
combat reconnaissance vehicles; an agreement has been signed with the
Federal Republic of Germany and Italy covering the production and continued
development of the Tornado multi-role combat aircraft (MRCA), and good
progress is being made in the development, with these two countries, of the
medium artillery pieces FH70 and SP70. Equipment collaboration also
facilitates joint logistic support and training arrangements, like those being
discussed among the five European countries which have agreed to purchase
the Lance surface-to-surface missile system from the United States.
A considerable number of projects, covering all the main equipment areas, are
under development. They include a complete range of new avionic and sonic
equipment which will greatly improve the effectiveness of the Nimrods; an air
defence variant of the Tornado, which is planned to replace the Phantom; a
search and rescue version of the Sea King helicopter with a greater range and
capability; a new range of logistic vehicles for battlefield support; a new type
of tank armour, Chobham Armour, which weight for weight provides greatly
improved protection for armoured vehicles; and the Wisp and Wideye
remotely-piloted helicopters. An airborne early warning (AEW) version of the
Nimrod is being developed, equipped with an advanced AEW radar.
Following the development of defence equipment, either nationally or in
co-operation with allies, production is usually undertaken by private industry
on a contract basis or by the Royal Ordnance Factories and Royal Dockyards.
Production may also be undertaken on a collaborative basis. The Defence
Sales organisation provides support, assistance and advice to British industry
and the Royal Ordnance Factories in promoting the sales of defence equipment
overseas. In i977_7^ the value of exports of British defence equipment is
expected to reach £850 million.
Voluntary
Services
6 Social Welfare
The British social welfare system comprises the National Health Service, the
personal social services and social security. Education is described in Chapter
7, and housing in Chapter 9. The National Health Service supplies, largely
free, the best medical service available to all, irrespective of means. The
local authority personal social services and voluntary organisations pro¬
vide advice and help to elderly people, disabled people and children in need of
care. The social security system is designed to secure a basic standard of living
for people in financial need by providing income support during periods of
inability to earn, by helping families and compensating for disablement.
Although public spending on health and personal social services has been
increased in real terms, the high rate of growth in recent years will not con¬
tinue because of restrictions on central and local government expenditure.
Spending in 1976 amounted to £7,310 million, 6-6 per cent of GNP. Protec¬
tion of the elderly, the sick and the poor is, however, a central part of the
Government’s social programme; pensions and other social security benefits
have been unaffected by cuts in public expenditure and are raised annually.
In the health service, priority is being given to services for the mentally ill,
the mentally handicapped, the elderly, families with children and primary
health care. Efforts are being made to distribute resources more fairly between
different parts of the country. The Government is also placing even greater
emphasis than hitherto on the need to obtain value for money. Among addi¬
tional money-saving measures being studied are cuts in administrative costs,
more preventive medicine, a more efficient utilisation of hospital beds, more day
hospital treatment and improved systems of purchasing supplies and equipment.
The Government, in collaboration with local authorities, has continued to
build up the personal social services. Joint finance and planning between
health and local authorities aims to prevent overlapping of services and to en¬
courage the development of community services such as more hostels for dis¬
charged hospital patients. In deciding their priorities, some local authorities
attach greater importance than others to the personal social services, with the
result that provision can vary from area to area.
As part of its attack on poverty the Government has increased social security
benefits in real terms. The new earnings-related, inflation-proofed pension
scheme being introduced in 1978 ends many years of debate, and is perhaps
the biggest social advance since the 1940s. Special importance has been
attached to helping disabled people.
Central government is responsible directly for the National Health Service,
administered by health authorities and boards acting as its agents, and for the
social security system. It has an indirect responsibility for the personal social
services administered by local government authorities which also have res¬
ponsibility for environmental health.
The State services are complemented by those provided by voluntary organi¬
sations and by individual volunteers. Voluntary organisations, especially the
churches, pioneered the development of many social services by providing
schools, hospitals, clinics, dispensaries and social and recreational clubs. How¬
ever, these facilities were not uniformly spread throughout the country and
Voluntary
Organisations
BRITAIN 1978: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
did not cover everyone in need. Gradually the State accepted responsibility for
the major services by developing a comprehensive structure to ensure a mini¬
mum standard of living and well-being for the population.
State and voluntary social services work in co-operation. Central and local
government make grants to the voluntary agencies. Public authorities plan
and carry out their duties taking account of the work of voluntary organisa¬
tions. Local authorities and voluntary agencies provide residential care
for elderly, disabled, mentally ill and mentally handicapped people and for
children.
Co-ordination of government interests in voluntary social service through¬
out Britain is the responsibility of the Home Office Voluntary Services Unit.
The Volunteer Centre, a national centre for information and research on
voluntary work, was established in 1973 with the aid of a government grant.
There are many full-time and part-time local volunteer bureaux.
In England and Wales the Charity Commission, a Government agency, gives
free advice to trustees of charities, making schemes to modify their purposes or
facilitate their administration when necessary. It maintains central and local
registers of charities which are open to public inspection, and it investigates and
checks abuses, though it has no power to act in the administration of a charity.
The number of voluntary organisations runs into thousands; they range from
national organisations to small individual local groups. Most are members of
larger associations or are represented on local or national co-ordinating councils
or committees. Some are chiefly concerned with giving personal service, others
in the formation of public opinion and exchange of information. Some carry
out both functions.
The main voluntary body in England which aims to provide central links
between voluntary organisations and official bodies is the National Council of
Social Service, which brings together most of the principal voluntary agencies
for consultation and joint action, either as a whole or in groups of those con¬
cerned with particular aspects, such as youth work. There are also the Scottish
Council of Social Service, the Council for Social Service for Wales and the
Northern Ireland Council of Social Service, which perform similar functions.
Organisations concerned with personal and family problems include the
voluntary family casework agencies like the Family Welfare Association, Family
Service Units, and the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to
Children; marriage guidance centres affiliated to the National Marriage
Guidance Council; the National Council of Voluntary Child Care Organisa¬
tions; the National Council for One Parent Families; and the Samaritans, who
help people who are near to committing suicide.
Community service of many kinds is given by young people, particularly
those belonging to a number of national and local organisations, for example,
the Young Volunteer Force Foundation, Community Service Volunteers, Task
Force, Scouts, Girl Guides and school groups.
Voluntary service to the sick and disabled is given by—among others—the
British Red Cross Society, St. John Ambulance, the Women’s Royal Volun¬
tary Service and the Leagues of Hospital Friends. A number of societies
exist to help people with particular disabilities and difficulties. These societies
include the Royal National Institute for the Blind, the Royal National
Institute for the Deaf, MIND (National Association for Mental Health), the
National Society for Mentally Handicapped Children, the Spastics Society,
Alcoholics Anonymous, Age Concern, Help the Aged and their equivalents
in Scotland and Northern Ireland.
SOCIAL WELFARE
Iiy
National organisations whose social work is specifically religious in inspira¬
tion include the Salvation Army, the Church Army, Toe H, the Commit¬
tee on Social Service of the Church of Scotland, the Church of England
Children’s Society, the Church of England Council for Social Work, the Young
Men’s Christian Association, the Young Women’s Christian Association, the
Society of Friends, the Catholic Marriage Advisory Council and the Jewish
Welfare Board.
A wide range of voluntary personal service is given by the Women’s Royal
Voluntary Service, which brings ‘meals on wheels’ to housebound invalids and
old people, provides flatlets and residential clubs for the elderly, helps with
family problems and assists in hospitals and clinics, as well as doing relief work
in emergencies.
Some 710 Citizens’ Advice Bureaux give explanation and advice to the
citizen who is in doubt about his rights or who does not know about the
State or voluntary services which could help him. There are law centres and
housing advisory centres in some areas.
NATIONAL HEALTH SERVICE
The National Health Service is based upon the principle that medical care and
advice should be readily available to everyone, at little or no cost. Health ser¬
vices are available largely free of charge to everyone normally resident in Britain.
Visitors can also use the service if they require treatment for an unforeseen
emergency; they are expected to pay if the purpose of their visit is to seek treat¬
ment. There are reciprocal health agreements with some countries (see p. 124).
The service is administered by appointed statutory authorities. It is financed
largely from general taxation revenue but other sources of revenue include
charges for some items and a small part of the national insurance contribution.
Since the beginning of the service in 1948, the infant mortality rate has been
halved. The health of children has steadily improved, and deaths from such
diseases as tuberculosis, poliomyelitis and diphtheria have fallen so steeply
that they are no longer major health problems. As part of the general growth of
facilities under the National Health Service, staffing has improved markedly.
Since 1965, for example, the hospital medical staff in England, Wales and
Scotland has increased by nearly 50 per cent and the nursing staff by over 40
per cent.
Although major advances have been made in the provision of health facilities,
certain problems remain, notably regional disparities in health provision and a
shortage of resources resulting from the need to restrain the growth in public
expenditure. An additional problem is the high cost of technologically advanced
equipment required for diagnosis and treatment. To help alleviate some of
these difficulties the Government is allocating more funds to the less-favoured
regions. Greater emphasis is being placed on preventive services (such as
immunisation, family planning and measures to discourage cigarette smoking)
and on developing the services provided by family doctors, dentists and
ophthalmic practitioners, district nurses, midwives and health visitors. A
continued rise in standards in general practice is expected as a result of
compulsory vocational training schemes for family doctors.
A Royal Commission is considering the best use and management of the
financial and manpower resources of the National Health Service.
ADMINISTRATION The health ministers—the Secretary of State for Social Services in England
and the Secretaries of State for Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland—are
BRITAIN 1978: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Il8
responsible for all aspects of the health services in their respective countries.
Within each of the four countries the health departments (the Department of
Health and Social Security in England, the Scottish Home and Health Depart¬
ment, the Welsh Office and the Department of Health and Social Services in
Northern Ireland) are responsible for strategic planning. Area health authori¬
ties in England and Wales, health boards in Scotland and health and social
services boards in Northern Ireland are responsible for area planning and opera¬
tional control of all health services in their area. In England because of its greater
size and population, there is an additional tier of regional authorities responsible
for regional planning and certain services best administered on a regional basis
(for example, research and major capital building work).
There are 14 regional health authorities and 90 area health authorities in
England, 8 area health authorities in Wales and 15 health boards in Scotland.
They are all statutory agencies of central government and co-operate closely
with local authorities responsible for social work, environmental health, educa¬
tion and other services. In general the areas covered by area health authorities
and health boards correspond with those of the major local authorities. Health
and local authorities in England and Wales co-operate by means of joint plan¬
ning arrangements and joint consultative committees.
In Northern Ireland the four health and social services boards act as agents
for the Department of Health and Social Services.
Area authorities and health boards in Great Britain have discretion to deter¬
mine the pattern of services best suited to their area but they have to take
account of national priorities. In most areas the day-to-day running of services
is carried out by management teams in districts which usually contain a district
general hospital and have a population of between 200,000 and 500,000, though
some are considerably larger (in Scotland and Wales they may be much smaller
in the remoter areas). In Scotland a Common Services Agency organises certain
central services; there are similar agencies in Wales and Northern Ireland.
The health authorities and boards consist of unpaid part-time members. All
members of the English regional authorities and the Scottish health boards,
and the chairmen of the English and Welsh area health authorities are appointed
by the health minister concerned after consultation with professional, local
authority, university and other interests. Two-thirds of the members of the
area health authorities are appointed by the regional health authorities in
England and the health minister in Wales; these include at least one university
nominee and some professional members who work within the service. The
remainder are appointed by the corresponding local authorities. Area authori¬
ties in areas containing teaching facilities are known as area authorities (teach¬
ing) and in addition to two university nominees contain at least two members
with teaching hospital experience.
Medical and dental schools are not under the control of the health ministers
but it is their responsibility to provide hospital clinical facilities for the training
of medical students. The universities are responsible for teaching.
There is statutory provision for professional advisory committees at national,
regional and area level; the authorities have a duty to consult with these com¬
mittees. The main national advisory bodies are the Central Health Services
Council in England and Wales, the Scottish Health Service Planning Council
in Scotland and the Health and Social Services Council in Northern Ireland.
The Health Advisory Service for England and Wales reports to the Secretaries
of State on conditions in hospitals and the community health service.
The Scottish Hospital Advisory Service reports to health boards and the
Secretary of State.

Public representation in the service for England and Wales is provided by
district community health councils. These consist of about 20 to 30 members,
half of them appointed by local government councils and the rest mainly on the
nomination of voluntary bodies interested in local health services. They have
access to the area health authority, the right to secure information and the right
to visit hospitals.
In Scotland local health councils have been set up by the health boards to
represent the interests of the public. District committees exercise this function
in Northern Ireland.
Legislation provides for the appointment of three Health Service Commis¬
sioners (for England, Scotland and for Wales) to investigate complaints from
members of the public about the health service. All three posts are held by the
Parliamentary Commissioner for Administration (see p. 35). His health service
jurisdiction covers the failure of a health authority to carry out its statutory
duties, maladministration, and injustice or hardship caused by a failure in a
service. A complaint can only be considered if the complainant has sent it first
to the health authority and given it sufficient time to investigate and reply.
Matters outside his jurisdiction include action taken solely in the exercise of
clinical judgment and the action of family practitioners (see p. 120).
The commissioner reports annually to ministers who lay the reports before
Parliament; he also publishes at regular intervals full texts of his reports of
investigations without, however, naming individuals or institutions.
In Northern Ireland the Commissioner for Complaints (see p. 68) investi¬
gates complaints concerning the health service, but not the actions of medical
practitioners or the professions supplementary to medicine.
Public expenditure on the health services in Britain was about £6,180
million in 1976. Over four-fifths of the cost falls on the Treasury while the
rest is met from the national health service contribution paid with the national
insurance contribution and charges paid by people using certain services.
There are charges for medical prescriptions but these do not apply to
children under 16 years, expectant and nursing mothers, women aged 60 and
over and men aged 65 and over, patients suffering from certain medical condi¬
tions, war and Service disablement pensioners, and families with very low
incomes, including those receiving supplementary benefits and family income
supplement. In addition there are charges for treatment in the general dental
service (but not for examination only or for treatment given to people under
21 years or women who are pregnant or have borne a child in the past year);
for dentures (except for children under 16 or still at school, and women who
are pregnant or have borne a child in the past year); for spectacles (except
children’s standard spectacles); and for some other articles. Certain low
income groups are exempt from dental and optical charges (those receiving
supplementary benefit or family income supplement and those receiving free
prescriptions or welfare foods).
A limited amount of accommodation may be made available at a small
charge for hospital patients wanting privacy as long as it is not needed on
medical grounds for non-paying patients.
Provision is also made at certain hospitals for patients to be treated as private
patients on payment of the whole cost of their accommodation and treatment.
The Government is phasing out private pay beds in National Health Service
hospitals (for private health provision, see p. 125).
Hospital medical staffs are either full-time and salaried, or part-time; part-

time medical officers are usually paid on a sessional basis and are free to accept
private patients. General medical practitioners are self-employed and paid in
accordance with a system of fees and allowances designed to reflect responsi¬
bilities, work load and practice expenses.
Dentists providing treatment in their own surgeries are paid on a prescribed
scale of fees according to the treatment they have carried out. Pharmacists
dispensing on their own premises are paid on the basis of the prescriptions they
'dispense. Ophthalmic medical practitioners and ophthalmic opticians taking
part in the general ophthalmic service are paid approved fees for each sight test
made; opticians who dispense spectacles are paid according to the number and
type of pairs supplied.
Primary health care is in the hands of doctors, dentists, opticians and pharma¬
cists working within the service as independent practitioners, and district
nurses, midwives and health visitors employed by the health authorities.
The family practitioner services cover the services given to patients by doctors,
dentists, opticians and pharmacists of their own choice. They are administered
in England and Wales by family practitioner committees established by the
health authorities, in Scotland by the health boards and in Northern Ireland
by the Central Services Agency.
Nearly 25,000 general medical practitioners (principals and assistants) in
Great Britain take some part in the service. The maximum number of patients’
names permitted to be on a family doctor’s list is normally 3,500; the average
number in Great Britain is about 2,200. In Northern Ireland there are some 735
general practitioners with about 2,100 patients each. Access to most other parts
of the health service is obtained through the family doctor.
There are over 13,200 dentists taking part in the health service.
Nearly 1,000 ophthalmic medical practitioners and about 6,800 ophthalmic
and dispensing opticians are engaged in the general ophthalmic services which
provide for the testing of sight and provision of spectacles. Patients requiring
treatment are dealt with through the hospital eye service.
There are about 11,500 retail pharmacies under contract to the National
Health Service with responsibility for the dispensing of prescriptions except
for the small number dispensed by hospital pharmacies and some family
doctors.
District nurses attend to people needing nursing at home or elsewhere outside
hospital. Although almost all babies are born in hospital, there is a domiciliary
service for mothers having their babies at home, midwives and family doctors
caring for mothers and babies after birth. Midwives also assist births in hos¬
pital. Health visitors are concerned with the health of the household as a whole
although much of their effort is devoted to caring for very young children and
elderly people; they take part in health education, assist in preventing ill-
health, and work closely with doctors, nurses and social workers.
Family doctors often work as members of co-ordinated primary health care
teams. About three-quarters are in partnership or group practices, and most
district nurses are attached to these. About a fifth of the doctors in Great
Britain and two-fifths in Northern Ireland work in modern and well-equipped
health centres built and maintained by the health authorities. Additional
services at health centres may include dentistry, chiropody, family planning,
ante-natal care, health education and sessions for children. Provision may also

be made for ophthalmic services and on occasions a social worker participates
in the activities of the primary health care team.
The hospital and specialist services include district general hospitals with
treatment and diagnostic facilities for in-patients, day-patients and out¬
patients, hospital maternity departments, infectious disease units, psychiatric
and geriatric facilities, rehabilitation facilities, convalescent homes and all
forms of specialised treatment. A number of specialist hospitals for mentally
ill and mentally handicapped people are also provided. In the long term the
Government plans to replace the majority of mental illness hospitals by facili¬
ties based on psychiatric units in district general hospitals. Mentally handi¬
capped people are cared for in hospital and in the community; it is long-term
government policy to shift the emphasis from hospital to community care but,
where hospital treatment is required, it will be provided in small units near to
the patient’s own home.
A large proportion of the hospitals in the National Health Service were built in
the nineteenth century; some trace their origins to much earlier charitable
foundations, such as the famous St. Thomas’ and St. Bartholomew’s hospitals
in London. Much has been done to improve and extend existing hospitals,
some of which are housed in inconvenient buildings, and a number of new
hospitals have been built. The most recent development in hospital design is
the nucleus hospital of some 300 beds which will make a more intensive use
of space and facilities; it can be used either as the first stage of a new hospital or
as an extension of an existing hospital. Building work on the first nucleus hos¬
pital is expected to begin in 1978.
There are 2,700 NHS hospitals; they have nearly half a million beds and
a nursing and midwifery staff of almost 400,000 (whole time equivalent).
There are 37,500 medical staff including over 14,000 consultants.
Rehabilitation is an important aspect of medical care. Treatment is not limited
to the relief of pain or cure of pathological conditions but aims at helping
people to resume normal living as soon as possible. Rehabilitation has been
applied with advantage in the care of many patients, including the younger
disabled, the mentally ill and the aged and has enabled many patients to
become self-sufficient and to resume an independent life in their own homes.
Facilities are provided in the majority of hospitals and at special centres. The
work is carried out by teams of doctors, nurses, physiotherapists, remedial
gymnasts, occupational therapists, speech therapists and social workers. The
hospital departments work closely with the Disablement Resettlement Service
of the Employment Service Agency (the Department of Manpower Services
in Northern Ireland).
Medical rehabilitation may include the provision, free of charge, of artificial
limbs and eyes, hearing aids, surgical supports, wheel chairs, and other
appliances. Very severely physically handicapped patients may be issued with
electrical control equipment which enables them to operate up to 11 devices
such as alarm bells, radio and television, a telephone, and heating. The
controls are operated by continuous depression of a microswitch or by
sustained suction through a pneumatic tube with a pipe-stem mouthpiece.
Nursing aids for the handicapped at home can be borrowed through the
service.
Local authority social workers, home helps and occupational therapists are
available to hospital patients who, because of their illness, have difficulties on

their return home. Social workers help to solve problems and are concerned
with the rehabilitation and resettlement of patients especially where the illness
has been long or where the disability results in changes in the patient’s life.
Treatment for narcotic addiction is available at drug treatment clinics. Some
doctors are licensed by the Home Secretary to prescribe heroin and cocaine to
addicts (in Northern Ireland licensing is the responsibility of the Department
of Health and Social Services). Doctors do not require a licence to prescribe
methadone and other controlled drugs to addicts, but all doctors must notify
the Home Office of any patient they consider to be addicted to certain con¬
trolled drugs.
Hospital services have treatment for drug misusers including accident and
emergency services for people who take overdoses. Several voluntary bodies
organise rehabilitation facilities including accommodation, day centres and
counselling. The Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs advises ministers
on measures to prevent the misuse of dangerous drugs or to deal with the social
problems connected with their misuse.
Treatment is provided for alcoholics as part of the general psychiatric service.
In the National Health Service there are some 23 specialised treatment units
as well as a day hospital. Three experimental detoxification centres are being
sponsored by the Department of Health and Social Security. Closely linked
with treatment are community services (including those provided by voluntary
organisations) covering prevention, advice and rehabilitation.
Special preventive health services, including free dental care, are available for
expectant and nursing mothers and young children. Maternity and child health
clinics are provided either in health centres, purpose built or rented premises,
or in mobile units. Special sessions are held for vaccination and immunisation
and for early testing of very young children for vision, hearing, speech and
language deficiencies. A feature of the service is the education of parents before
and after the birth by means of talks, discussion groups, demonstrations and
classes.
About four-fifths of babies in their first year of life are taken to the centres.
Family planning advice and help is provided at many of the centres and welfare
foods (dried milk and vitamins) are distributed from them.
Sick children are treated at home or as hospital out- or day-patients. If
admission to hospital is necessary, the Government encourages health authori¬
ties to accommodate them in children’s departments staffed by paediatricians
and specially trained nurses.
The school health service, which is part of the National Health Service,
organises health surveillance of school children including medical inspection
and dental inspection and treatment where appropriate. The staff of the school
health service work closely with local education authorities in the medical
assessment of handicapped children thought to need special attention.
Child guidance facilities provide help and advice concerning children with
psychological or emotional problems. These are run by local authority social
services and education authorities and by the health authorities. In Scotland
child guidance clinics are run by education authorities.
Free family planning facilities are available to everyone through family plan¬
ning clinics, hospitals and a domiciliary service. Most family doctors provide
a similar service for women only.

L nder the Abortion Act 1967 termination of a pregnancy may take place if two
registered doctors think that its continuance would involve a greater risk to the
life of the pregnant woman (or of injury to her physical or mental health or
that of any existing children in the family) than if the pregnancy were ended.
Termination may also be allowed if the two doctors think that there is a sub¬
stantial risk of the child being born with severe physical or mental abnormali¬
ties. Abortions may be carried out in National Health Service hospitals or in
premises officially approved for the purpose. The Abortion Act does not applv
in Northern Ireland.
The national blood transfusion service is administered by regional health
authorities in England and by the South Glamorgan area health authority in
Wales. Donors give their blood voluntarily without payment. There are three
central laboratories: the Blood Group Reference Laboratory, administered by
the Medical Research Council on behalf of the Department of Health and
Social Security, which distributes blood grouping sera and investigates blood
grouping problems referred to it; the Blood Products Laboratory, administered
by the Lister Institute of Preventive Medicine on behalf of the department,
which prepares blood products and researches into the production and uses of
plasma fractions and plasma substitutes; and the Plasma Fractionation Labora¬
tory which is associated with the Blood Products Laboratory. In Scotland the
blood transfusion service is administered by the Common Services Agency
and in Northern Ireland it is operated by the Eastern Health and Social Services
Board.
free transport by ambulance between home and hospital is provided, where
necessary, by the health authorities. The Hospital Car Service (organised by
St. John Ambulance, the British Red Cross Society, and the Women’s
Royal V oluntary Service) augments the ambulance service in some areas.
Health education in England, Wales and Northern Ireland is promoted by the
Health Education Council which assists in the development of programmes of
health education with the health authorities, professional organisations, volun¬
tary bodies and industry. Central health education services in Scotland are
organised by the Scottish Health Education Unit, which is part of the Common
Services Agency. Major themes of publicity campaigns are the encouragement
of family planning and warnings against cigarette smoking and excessive
consumption of alcoholic drink. Expenditure for health education is met
largely from central government funds.
Under the Medicines Act 1968, which came into force in 1971 and applies to
the whole of the United Kingdom, the health and agriculture ministers are
responsible for licensing the manufacture, marketing and importation of
medicines for human and veterinary use. The Medicines Commission advises
the ministers on policy regarding medicines and a Committee on Safety of
Medicines advises the health ministers on the safety, efficacy and quality of
new medicines and monitors adverse drug reactions. A review of medicines
on the market began in 1975, the health ministers being advised by the Com¬
mittee on the Review of Medicines. The Act also controls the advertising,
labelling, packaging, distribution, sale and supply of medicines.
Only people whose names are on the medical and dental registers may prac¬
tise as doctors and dentists in the National Health Service. Dental auxiliaries
(who have undergone a two-year training course) and dental hygienists (who
124
BRITAIN 1978: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
have undergone a training course of about a year) may carry out some simple
dental work under the direction of a registered dentist. Registration as a doctor
requires five or six years’ training in medical school and hospital, with an addi¬
tional year’s experience in a hospital; for a dentist, four or more years at a
dental school are required. The governing body of the medical profession is the
General Medical Council and that of the dentists is the General Dental Council.
The British Medical Association is the doctors’ main professional association;
that of the dentists is the British Dental Association.
The minimum period of hospital training required to qualify for registration
as a nurse is normally three years. Training may be in general, sick children’s,
mental or mental subnormality nursing. An enrolled nurse takes a two-year
course. The examining bodies of the nursing profession in England and Wales
and in Scotland are the general nursing councils. Midwives in England and
Wales and in Scotland must have the certificate of the appropriate Midwives
Board. The examining body for nurses and midwives in Northern Ireland is
the Northern Ireland Council of Nurses and Midwives. Most pupil midwives
are already registered general nurses or sick children’s nurses; for them the
two-year midwifery training period is reduced to one year and for other
registered and enrolled nurses to 18 months. The Royal College of Nursing
and the Royal College of Midwives are the professional bodies for nurses and
midwives. Health visitors are registered general nurses who have undergone
at least the first part of the midwifery course or obstetric nursing before taking
a year’s course in health visiting, promoted by the Council for the Education
and Training of Health Visitors. District nurses are state registered or state
enrolled nurses, the majority of whom have undertaken additional training.
To practise as a retail or hospital pharmacist, a pharmaceutical chemist must
have his or her name entered in the register maintained by the Pharmaceutical
Society of Great Britain, the governing body of the profession, or, in Northern
Ireland, in the register of the Department of Health and Social Services.
Four years’ academic study and practical training are necessary for registra¬
tion. The dispensing of all medicines on doctors’ prescriptions and sale of
certain specified medicines can be carried out only by, or under the super¬
vision of, a registered pharmaceutical chemist. Under the Opticians Act 1958
the General Optical Council regulates the professions of ophthalmic optician
and dispensing optician; only registered ophthalmic opticians (or registered
medical practitioners) may test sight. Training of ophthalmic opticians takes
four years including a year of practical experience under supervision. Dispens¬
ing opticians may take a two-year full-time course with a year’s practical
experience or a part-time day-release course while employed with an optician.
State registration may be obtained by chiropodists, dietitians, medical
laboratory technicians, occupational therapists, orthoptists, physiotherapists,
radiographers and remedial gymnasts. The governing bodies are eight boards,
corresponding to the eight professions, under the general supervision of the
Council for Professions Supplementary to Medicine. A professional training
lasting two to four years is needed to qualify for registration. Only members of
those professions who are state registered may be employed in the National
Health Service and some other public services.

COUNTRIES
Britain has special health arrangements with members of the European Com¬
munity; under the community’s social security regulations, most United
Kingdom residents are entitled to urgent medical treatment in another Com¬
munity country on the same basis as insured nationals of that country. There
are also similar reciprocal arrangements with some other countries.

CONTROL OF
INFECTIOUS
DISEASES
Though practically all residents in Britain use the National Health Service, a
number of people sometimes prefer to pay for private consultations and treat¬
ment. Among the major users are the families of subscribers to the provident
schemes which make provision for private health care in return for annual
subscriptions. It is the Government’s policy to phase out private beds from
National Health Service hospitals, but patients will remain free to seek
medical treatment, and doctors to practise, in private hospitals or nursing
homes. Some of these are run by charitable institutions.
Local authorities are responsible for environmental health. Environmental
health officers are responsible for the control of air pollution and noise, the
inspection of offices, the investigation of unfit housing, and refuse collection
and disposal. Administrative doctors who specialise in community health and
are employed by the health authorities advise local authorities on the medical
aspects of environmental health. They may also assist the water authorities
responsible for water supply and sewerage.
Environmental health officers are also employed at ports and airports where
they carry out a range of duties concerned with shipping, inspection of imported
foods and disease control.
In Northern Ireland district councils are responsible for noise control, collec¬
tion and disposal of refuse, clean air and food composition, labelling and
hygiene.
In England and Wales the composition, labelling and description of food are the
concern of food and drugs authorities (county councils, London borough
councils and the City of London Corporation) while food hygiene and the safety
and fitness of food are the concern of district councils, London borough coun¬
cils and port health authorities. The Department of Health and Social Security
and the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food are the central departments
responsible for giving advice and making regulations. Premises where food or
drink is prepared, handled, stored or sold must conform to certain hygiene
standards. Environmental health officers may take for analysis or for bacterio-
logical or other examination samples of any food on sale for human consump¬
tion. There are special regulations for milk, meat and ice-cream.
In Scotland regional and islands councils are responsible for food standards
and labelling; district and islands councils have responsibility for food hygiene.
The health authorities have general responsibility for the prevention of disease
and co-operate with the local authority environmental health services. The
area health authorities and health boards carry out planned programmes of
vaccination and immunisation against diphtheria, measles, rubella (females
only), poliomyelitis, tetanus, tuberculosis and whooping cough. Such protec¬
tion is given in family doctors’ surgeries, health centres or at child health clinics.
The Public Health Laboratory Service provides a network of bacteriological
and virological laboratories throughout England and Wales which conduct
research and assist in the diagnosis, prevention and control of epidemic
diseases. Its largest establishment is the Central Public Health Laboratory at
Colindale, in north-west London, which includes the National Collection of
Type Cultures, the Food Hygiene Laboratory, and reference laboratories
specialising in the identification of infective micro-organisms. In addition it
has a communicable disease surveillance centre, opened in 1977, which in¬
vestigates, controls and monitors human communicable diseases. In Scotland
bacteriological work is done mainly in hospital laboratories. In Northern Ire-

land a central public health laboratory shares the bacteriological work with
hospital laboratories.
PERSONAL SOCIAL SERVICES
Responsibility for personal social services rests with the social services authori¬
ties (local authority social services departments in England and Wales, social
work departments in Scotland and health and social services boards in Northern
Ireland). Many of their services are directed towards the same groups of
people needing health services, for example, many elderly or disabled people.
Other groups helped are young families with social problems, children deprived
of a normal home life, the mentally disordered and young offenders. Close
co-operation is maintained between local authority social services departments
and health authorities. In Scotland local authorities also undertake duties
similar to those of the separate probation and after-care service in England
and Wales (see p. 90).
The Personal Social Services Council advises ministers on policy issues and
provides information and advice to all concerned with the personal social
services in England and Wales, based on research projects or inquiries
sponsored by the council. Its members are from local government, voluntary,
educational and research bodies and professional organisations. There is cross¬
representation with the Central Health Services Council and the Central
Council for Education and Training in Social Work. Finance comes from
central and local government. In Scotland there is an Advisory Council on
Social Work and in Northern Ireland a Central Personal Social Services
Advisory Committee.
Social services authorities have a duty to provide social services for handi¬
capped people. In Great Britain they are required to ascertain the number of
handicapped people in their area and to publicise services. A wide range of
facilities may be available including advice on personal and social problems
arising from disability, assistance in overcoming the effects of disability,
adaptations to people’s homes (such as fitting ramps, ground floor toilets and
grab rails) and various aids to living. In certain circumstances a telephone or a
television set may be installed. Other facilities include social and occupational
clubs, residential homes and the organisation of outings and holidays. In
addition some authorities make arrangements for the teaching of handicrafts
and other occupations. Voluntary organisations also provide services for dis¬
abled people.
Help available from other sources includes social security, medical treatment,
special education, employment and training services and specially designed
housing and means of access to public buildings.
Services for elderly people in their own homes are provided by statutory and
voluntary bodies to help them to live there for as long as possible. These
include the advice and help of social workers, domestic help, sitters-in, night
attendants and laundry services as well as day centres, clubs, recreational work¬
shops and meals services. In many areas ‘good neighbour’ and friendly visiting
services are also arranged by the local authority or a voluntary organisation.
Chiropody services for the elderly are provided by area health authorities.
Social services authorities also provide residential accommodation for the
elderly and infirm and have powers to register homes run by voluntary organisa¬
tions or privately. The newer homes usually have accommodation for 30 to 50

residents. About 2,500 homes for elderly people are provided by local authori¬
ties in England which house about 1*5 per cent of the population over the age
of 65. I here are similar homes in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.
Local authorities, as part of their responsibility for public housing, build
flats specially designed for elderly people; some of these blocks have resident
wardens. Housing associations also build this type of accommodation.
Social services authorities have a duty to make arrangements for helping the
mentally ill or mentally handicapped in the community, and for prevention and
after-care services. Recent developments in the treatment of mental illness,
which enable patients either to be treated at home or to be discharged from
hospital more quickly provided support is available in the community, are
adding to demands for these services and particularly for social work support.
Arrangements include training centres for the mentally handicapped, day
centres for the mentally ill, as well as social centres and a variety of residential
care for the mentally ill and mentally handicapped of all ages. Social workers
help patients and their families to deal with social problems arising from mental
illness or mental handicap.
Social services authorities, through their own social workers or a voluntary
organisation, make available help and advice to families facing special problems.
Home help is provided mainly for elderly people but others receiving it
include pregnant women and severely disabled, mentally ill and mentally
handicapped people.
Some authorities make direct provision for the special needs of unmarried
mothers and their babies, but most contribute to the cost of work done by
voluntary organisations and other bodies.
bor the homeless, local authorities arrange temporary accommodation.
Social services authorities are responsible for child care. This includes the
provision of day care for children, often with special social or health needs, and
is done through day nurseries and part-time nursery groups, voluntary and
private day nurseries, child minders and play-groups.
The authorities have a duty to offer advice, guidance and assistance to
families in difficulties in order to promote the welfare of children. The aim is
to intervene at an early stage to diminish the need to receive children into care
or bring them before a juvenile court.
Authorities have a duty to receive into their care any child under the age of 17
who has no parent or guardian or who has been abandoned or whose parents
are unable to provide for him if they are satisfied that such intervention is in
the interests of the child. The child remains in care until he is 18 years old unless
discharged to the care of parents, other relatives or friends before that time.
When taking a decision on a child in care, the authorities have to give first
consideration to the need to safeguard and promote the welfare of the child.
Where children are in care, efforts are made to work with their families in order,
where appropriate, to enable the child to return home.
Children in England and Wales may be brought before a juvenile court if
they are neglected or ill treated, exposed to moral danger, beyond the control
of parents, not attending school or (if ten years or over) have committed
an offence. At the same time it must be shown that the child is in need of
care or control which he is unlikely to receive unless a care or other relevant
order is made by the court. Local authorities are responsible for undertaking,
through social workers, inquiries and consultations with parents, schools and
the police.

A child may be committed to the care of a local authority under a care order
if the juvenile court is satisfied that he is in need of care or control. As an
alternative the court may issue a supervision order for a period of up to
three years. Supervision is carried out by a social worker or a probation officer.
In Northern Ireland the court may send the child to a training school (see
p. 95), commit him to the care of a fit person (which may include a health and
social services board) or make a supervision order. In Scotland, children’s
hearings, composed of people from the local community, have powers to impose
compulsory measures of care on a child by means of a supervision requirement
which can remain in force until he is 18 years old (see p. 95).
When practicable, children in care are boarded out with foster parents, who
receive an allowance to cover the cost of maintenance. If a foster home is not
the most suitable place for a child or if a suitable foster home cannot be found
for him, he may be placed in a children’s home, a voluntary home or other
suitable residential accommodation. Community homes for children in care
in England and Wales comprise local authority and voluntary children’s
homes and community homes with education on the premises which provide
long-term care usually for the more difficult children. In Scotland local
authorities are responsible for providing accommodation for children in their
care and arrangements exist for the development of services on a regional
basis. In Northern Ireland there are residential homes for children in the
care of the health and social services boards, although training schools and
remand homes are administered separately.
Regulations regarding conduct of community homes and registered volun¬
tary homes and the boarding out of children in care are made by central
government.
Voluntary organisations, many of which were pioneers in child care, continue
to play a valuable part in this work. Children’s homes run by voluntary
organisations must be registered and are subject to inspection by social work
service officers of the central government.
Voluntary bodies concerned with the welfare of children in their own
homes include local family casework agencies and the Family Service Units.
The National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children and its
Scottish counterpart maintain inspectors and visitors to investigate reported
cruelty or neglect.
Adoption of children is strictly regulated by legislation and some 17,600 adop¬
tion orders were made in England and Wales in 1976; the Registrars General
keep registers of adopted children. Local authorities have the power to act as
adoption agencies and eventually will be obliged to offer such a service.
Adoption societies (over 70 societies arrange adoptions) must be registered with
their local authority.
Adoptions of minors under the laws of most European and Commonwealth
countries are recognised but this does not confer British citizenship on the
adopted person.
The effective operation of the social services is dependent upon the availability
of professionally qualified social workers trained in the methods of social
work. Training courses in social work are provided by universities, polytechnics
and colleges of further education; their length depends upon previous educa¬
tional qualifications and can last from one to four years. The Central Council for
Education and Training in Social Work is responsible for recognising social
work courses and offers advice to people considering entry to the profession.
SOCIAL WELFARE
129
Professional social workers (including those working in the National Health
Service) are employed by social services authorities. Others work in voluntary
organisations or in the probation service (see p. 90). Not all social workers
employed by social services authorities are professionally qualified, and
efforts are being made to increase the number of trained personnel.
SOCIAL SECURITY
National insurance, industrial injuries insurance, child benefit, family income
supplement, supplementary benefits, and war pensions constitute a compre¬
hensive system of social security.
The Department of Health and Social Security administers these services in
Great Britain; within the department, the Supplementary Benefits Commission
is responsible for the system of supplementary benefits. In Northern Ireland
the first five of these schemes are administered by the Department of Health
and Social Services which contains the Supplementary Benefits Commission
for Northern Ireland. Pensions and welfare services for war pensioners and their
dependants are the responsibility of the Department of Health and Social
Security throughout the United Kingdom. Appeals relating to claims for the
various benefits are decided by tribunals.
A series of Acts in the 1940s established the main features of today’s com¬
prehensive social security system which became operative in July 1948. Benefits
were flat-rate but as the level of earnings rose in the 1950s and the 1960s the gap
between earnings and benefits tended to widen. In the 1960s, therefore, an
earnmgs-related supplement to retirement pension was started, based' on
graduated contributions; this principle was extended to unemployment and
sickness benefit and, later in 1975, to maternity allowance. In the 1970s new
benefits have included better pension arrangements for widows, pensions
for people aged 80 and over who have not qualified for a national insurance
retirement pension, and more benefits for disabled people (see p. 133).
From April 1978, there will be a new State pension scheme under which
retirement, invalidity and widows’ pensions will be earnings-related and fully
protected against inflation. The purpose of the scheme is to provide improved
benefits. The new pension will have two parts—basic pension (equivalent to
the present flat rate pension) and an additional pension. Rights to additional
pension will build up year by year over a 20-year maturity period, finally
reaching 25 per cent of a person s earnings between a lower earnings limit
(equivalent to the basic pension) and an upper earnings limit of seven times
that amount. Women will receive equal benefits as men with the same earnings
and rights to basic pension will be safeguarded during years of home responsi¬
bility. A married man with average earnings will qualify for a combined pension
for himself and his wife worth more than half his psy. Employers providing
occupational pension schemes will be able to contract their employees out of
part of the State scheme and pay a lower contribution to it. Pension rights
earned under the former graduated scheme will be protected against inflation
for the first time.
Social security benefits or allowances (other than child, maternity, unemploy¬
ment, sickness, invalidity, injury or disablement benefit) are included in
the taxable income on which income tax is assessed. On the other hand
various income tax reliefs and exemptions are allowed on account of age or
liability for the support of dependants. Supplementary benefit, family income
supplement, attendance allowances and war disablement pensions are not
taxable.

BRITAIN 1978: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
There are three kinds of social security benefit: those paid in return for contri¬
butions (for example, retirement pension, sickness and unemployment benefit,
maternity benefits, widows’ benefits and industrial injuries benefits); non¬
contributory benefits paid to certain groups of people regardless of income (for
example, child benefit, attendance allowances and pensions for people over 80);
and supplementary benefit (also non-contributory) for people not in full-time
work with incomes below specified levels. Family income supplement is pay¬
able to low wage earners in full-time work with children to support.
The national insurance scheme provides benefits where contribution conditions
have been fulfilled. The benefits are paid for by contributions from individuals,
by contributions of employers in respect of their employees, and by a contribu¬
tion made by the Treasury.
There are four classes of national insurance contribution. Class 1 is paid by
employed people and their employers, Classes 2 and 4 by self-employed people
and Class 3 by voluntary contributors. The employee’s Class 1 contribution
(which includes a small contribution towards the cost of the National Health
Service) is earnings-related and amounts to 5 75 per cent of earnings up to £ 105
per week provided that these are at least £15 a week. The employer’s contribu¬
tion per employee is 875 per cent over the same earnings range; it includes
payments to the national insurance, redundancy and maternity pay funds
(see p. 316) as well as the National Health Service. The employer also pays an
extra 2 per cent into the Exchequer. Employed married women and employed
widows pay full contributions unless, before May 1977, they opted to pay a
reduced contribution of 2 per cent. If they continue to pay the lower contribu¬
tion, they rely on their husband’s (or late husband’s) insurance for maternity
grant, retirement pension (at a lower rate) and death grant. Contributions are
collected at source through the ‘Pay as You Earn’ income tax system.
Self-employed people pay a flat-rate Class 2 contribution of £2^66 a week
(j£2‘55 f°r women) and a Class 4 contribution amounting to 8 per cent of
net profits or gains between £1,750 and £5,500 a year. Before May 1977
self-employed married women and widows could choose whether or not to pay
Class 2 contributions but since then all new contributors have been liable for
Class 2 contributions. Voluntary Class 3 contributions of £2’45 a week are
paid by people wanting to safeguard rights to some benefits. Class 2 and Class
3 contributions are paid by stamps bought from a post office or by direct
debit or a bank or National Giro account.
Some people do not have to pay contributions. An employed person ceases
to be liable for contributions at the age of 65 for a woman or 70 for a man; the
employer, however, remains liable for contributions when the employee’s
earnings reach the lower earnings limit of £15. People who retire from work
after reaching pensionable age (60 for women and 65 for men) do not pay con¬
tributions. Self-employed people with earnings below £875 a year may be
excused payment of Class 2 contributions.
The graduated pension scheme initiated in 1961 ended in 1975 but entitle¬
ment to pension on the basis of contributions paid remains.
Class 1 contributions cover the employee for retirement pension, unemploy¬
ment and sickness benefit, invalidity benefit, widow’s benefits, maternity
benefits, death grant, and child’s special allowance. Industrial injuries benefits
are also payable to Class 1 contributors but there are no contribution conditions.
All these benefits, with the exception of unemployment and industrial injuries

benefits, are also covered by Class 2 contributions paid by self-employed
people. Class 3 contributions give entitlement to retirement pension, widow’s
benefits, maternity grant, death grant and child’s special allowance.
For most of the benefits there are two contribution conditions. First, before
benefit can be paid at all, certain contributions have to be paid; secondly, the
full rate of benefit cannot be paid unless contributions have been paid or
credited up to a specific level over a specified period. There are special rules
to help a widow who does not become entitled to a widow’s pension at widow¬
hood or when her children have grown up, to qualify for sickness or unemploy¬
ment benefit in the period before she can have established or re-established
herself in insurance through her own contributions; there are also provisions
to help a divorced woman who was not paying contributions during her mar¬
riage. The main national insurance benefits (payable weekly) are summarised
below. The rates quoted are those effective from November 1977; allowances
for children include the I977—7^ ra*e °f child benefit which is being increased
in April 1978 (see p. 133).
Retirement pension is j£i7'5° f°r a single person and ^28 for a married
couple, payable to men over the age of 65 and women over 60 when they
cease working full-time. The pension is paid to men over 70 and women over 65
even if they continue to work. Retirement pensioners under the age of 70 (65 for
women) have their pensions reduced in step with their earnings over specified
amounts. An age addition of 25P is paid to pensioners over the age of 80. An
earnings-related graduated pension is payable to people who contributed to the
graduated pension scheme between 1961 and 1975.
Unemployment or sickness benefit is £1470 plus £9-10 for an adult dependant
and j£4'5° f°r each child inclusive of child benefit (see p. 133). Married
women under 60 who pay full contributions receive £10-50. Unemployment
benefit is payable for up to a year in any one spell of unemployment (spells
which are 13 weeks or less apart count as one spell) and sickness benefit is
payable for 28 weeks. Earnings-related supplement (up to a maximum of
£i5'42 from January 1978) is calculated on reckonable weekly earnings in the
relevant income tax year but it, together with the flat rate benefits, cannot
exceed 85 per cent of the average weekly earnings on which the supplement is
based. The supplement is payable for a maximum of six months from the 13th
day of a period of interruption of employment.
Invalidity pension is £17-50 plus £10-50 for a wife and £8-40 for a child inclu¬
sive of child benefit and is payable when sickness benefit ends if the bene¬
ficiary is still incapable of work. An invalidity allowance (ranging from £1-15 to
£3'7° according to age) is paid with the pension to those people who become
sick more than five years before retirement age.
Widow’s allowance is £24-50 plus £8-40 for each child inclusive of child
benefit. It is payable for the first 26 weeks of widowhood and there may be
an earnings-related addition calculated on the husband’s reckonable earnings in
the relevant tax year.
Widowed mother’s allowance is £17-50 plus £8-40 for each child inclusive of
child benefit, payable when widow’s allowance ends if the widow has dependent
children.

Widow’s pension is ^17*50 if the widow is over the age of 50 when her husband
dies or when widowed mother’s allowance ends. It reduces on a scale to £5*25
for widows aged 40 at that time. This continues until the widow has reached
pensionable age and retires provided that she does not remarry before that age.
On retirement she receives a pension not lower than her widow’s pension. All
widows’ benefits are payable regardless of a widow’s earnings.
Maternity grant is £25 for each living child born and for a stillborn child if the
pregnancy lasts for at least 28 weeks.
Maternity allowance is £ 14-70 payable normally for 18 weeks (11 weeks before
the expected week of confinement and 6 weeks after this or the actual confine¬
ment). The allowance is payable only to working women who have paid full
Class 1 or Class 2 national insurance contributions. An earnings-related supple¬
ment may be payable.
A maximum of £30 is payable on death. Less is payable for a child.
Child’s special allowance is £8-40 inclusive of child benefit. It is payable
to a woman whose marriage has been dissolved or annulled and who has not
re-married, if her former husband dies and if she has a child to whose support
he was contributing before he died.
The industrial injuries scheme provides benefits (from the national insurance
fund) for personal injuries caused by accidents arising from employment and
for prescribed diseases due to the nature of employment. It covers practically
everyone liable to pay Class 1 contributions but there are no contribution con¬
ditions for payment of benefit.
Injury benefit for an adult is £17-45 a week plus £9-10 for an adult dependant
and £4-50 for each child inclusive of child benefit. It is paid when the insured
person is incapable of work as a result of an industrial accident or prescribed
disease, and payment can continue for a maximum of 26 weeks beginning on
the date of the accident or development of the disease. A person entitled to
sickness benefit who draws injury benefit instead, also receives any earnings-
related supplement (see p. 131) to which he is entitled.
Disablement benefit may be paid (but not at the same time as injury benefit)
when, as the result of industrial accident or prescribed disease, there is a loss of
physical or mental faculty. The amount depends on the extent of the disable¬
ment as assessed by a medical board; it varies from £28-60 a week for 100 per
cent disablement to £5-72 for 20 per cent disablement, but for disablement of
less than 20 per cent a gratuity is normally paid.
In certain circumstances disablement benefit may be supplemented as
follows: unemployability supplement at the weekly rate of £17-50; constant
attendance allowance of up to £11-40 weekly normally, or a special rate of
£17-10 or £22-80 a week in exceptionally severe cases; an allowance of £11-40
a week for exceptionally severe disablement; a special hardship allowance of
up to £11-44 f°r a person who is unfit to return to his regular job or to do
work of an equivalent standard; and hospital treatment allowance which
raises the benefit to that for a 100 per cent assessment during hospital treat¬
ment for the industrial disability. Increases of disablement benefit for
dependants may be payable with unemployability supplement.
If the accident or disease results in the insured person’s death, death benefit
may be paid to his or her dependants.

tor a widow a pension of ,£24-50 a week is payable for the first 26 weeks of
widowhood. In addition she receives earnings-related supplement if she is
entitled to the national insurance widow’s allowance. Thereafter, the widow
can receive a pension of ,£18-05 a week if she was aged 50 at the date of her
husband s death, or has dependent children or fulfils certain other conditions;
otherwise, she receives ,£5'25 a week. If she had been living apart from her
husband, a pension is payable only if she was receiving or entitled to receive at
least £0-25 a week for her maintenance from him.
In addition allowances are paid for children under the child benefit age
limits. For widows they are ,£8-40 for each child inclusive of child benefit.
Other beneficiaries receive ,£4-50.
Certain other dependants, such as parents and other relatives, may be en¬
titled to pensions, allowances or gratuities.
NON-CONTRIBU-
TORY BENEFITS
Child Benefit
The child benefit scheme came into operation in 1977 and replaced family
allowances. Income tax allowances for children are being phased out gradually
and their value transferred to tax-free child benefit payable to the mother for all
children. The rate of benefit in 1977-78 is ,£i-oo for the first child (£1-50 in the
case of single-parent families) and ,£1-50 for every other child. From April
1978 benefit will be ,£2-30 for every child (,£3-30 for the first child of single
parent families). Benefit is payable for children under the minimum school
leaving age of 16 and for those under 19 if they are in full-time education or
are apprentices with low earnings; benefit is not payable after October 1977
for students under 19 on advanced courses (see p. 147).
Guardian’s
Allowance
Guardian’s allowance is a weekly benefit of ,£7-40 payable to a person entitled
to child benefit who has in his or her family a child who has lost both parents,
one of whom must have been born in Britain or must have satisfied a residence
condition.

over 80
A pension of ,£6-55 for a married woman and ^10-75 for any other person
(including an age addition of ,£0-25) is payable (subject to conditions of resi¬
dence in Britain) to people over 80 years old who have not qualified for a
contributory retirement pension.
Benefits for
Disabled People
An attendance allowance of ,£14-00 is paid to severely disabled people requiring
a great deal of attention by day and at night. A lower rate of ^9-30 may be paid
to those who need help either by day or at night. A non-contributory invalidity
pension of ,£10-50 is payable to people of working age unable to work and not
qualifying for the national insurance invalidity pension; from November 1977
it is being paid to disabled housewives incapable of work and unable to perform
their normal household tasks.
A weekly invalid care allowance of £10-50 is payable to people (aged between
16 and pension age) who cannot go out to work because they are caring for a
severely disabled relative receiving an attendance allowance. In addition the
Government is introducing (over a three-year period from 1976) a mobility
allowance of £7 a week for severely disabled people (aged between five and
pension age) who are unable, or virtually unable, to walk and are likely to
remain so for at least 12 months. The allowance aims to assist all such severely
disabled people with their transport costs. This is unlike the previous system
when mobility help depended on ability to drive a motorised vehicle.

SUPPLEMENTARY
BENEFITS
FAMILY INCOME
SUPPLEMENT
WAR PENSIONS
AND RELATED
SERVICES
Every person aged 16 or over who is not in full-time work and whose resources
are insufficient to meet his or her needs may be entitled to supplementary
benefit. It is not awarded to people attending school or for the requirements of
people involved in a trade dispute (dependants of strikers, however, are
covered). In Northern Ireland a residence condition must also be satisfied.
The benefit takes the form of a supplementary allowance for people under the
minimum retirement age, and a supplementary pension for those over. The
benefit is the amount by which a person’s requirements exceed his available
resources, both being defined by rules approved by Parliament. The calculation
of requirements is based on different amounts for single people and family
groups (for blind people there are special higher amounts) with, in each case,
an addition for rent. A higher long-term scale of requirements is used for
retirement pensioners and for people who have received benefit for more than
two years without having to sign on for work. Additions can be made for
special dietary or heating requirements. A single payment of benefit may be
made to meet an exceptional need. When resources are calculated, most social
security benefits are taken into account in full. Part of most other income in¬
cluding part-time earnings, disablement benefit and war widow’s pension is
ignored, as is the capital value of an owner occupied house or capital resources
of less than £1,250.
The payment of a supplementary allowance to an able-bodied person
of working age may be conditional on registering for employment at an
unemployment benefit office of the Department of Employment or, in North¬
ern Ireland, the Department of Manpower Services. The supplementary
benefits scheme is administered by a Supplementary Benefits Commission
within the Department of Health and Social Security and there is a similar
commission in Northern Ireland.
The Supplementary Benefits Commission also has a duty to influence people
without a settled way of living to lead a more normal life. It provides temporary
accommodation for them in 21 reception centres, one of which is administered
by a local authority on its behalf. For men who have been unemployed for long
periods and who are receiving supplementary allowances, it runs 17 re-estab¬
lishment centres, three of which have residential accommodation, where they
are given help to fit them again for work.
Family income supplement is a cash benefit for families (including single
parents) with small incomes where the head of the family is in full-time
work and there is at least one dependent child. It is payable when the gross
weekly income of a family falls below a prescribed amount, fixed at £43-8o a
week where there is one child plus £4-00 for each additional child. The weekly
rate of the supplement is half the difference between the family’s income and
the prescribed amount up to a maximum of £9-50 for a one-child family and
this is increased by £i-oo for each additional child.
The war pensions scheme is administered throughout the United Kingdom
by the Department of Health and Social Security. Pensions are payable to
people disabled as a result of service in the armed forces or from injuries
received in the merchant navy or civil defence during war-time.
The current basic pension for 100 per cent disablement for a private soldier is
£28-60 a week, but the amount varies according to rank and the degree of dis¬
ablement. Allowances for a wife and children are paid in addition to the basic
pension. There is a wide range of supplementary allowances, the main ones
being for unemployability (£18-60 a week), constant attendance (up to £11-40

and, exceptionally, £22-80 a week), comforts (£2-45 or £4-90 a week), and
lowered standard of occupation (up to £11-443 week). An age allowance
(between £2 and £6-20 a week) is payable to disablement pensioners who are
aged 65 or over and whose assessment is 40 per cent or more.
Pensions are also paid to war widows and war orphans. The standard rate of
pension for widows of private soldiers is £22-70 a week, with additional allow¬
ances for their children and, in certain cases, a rent allowance (up to £8-6o a
week). There is an additional allowance of £2-20 for widows aged 65 which is
increased to £4-40 at the age of 70. Parents or other relatives who were depen¬
dent on a person whose death resulted from service in the Forces may receive
pensions if they are in financial need.
The Department of Health and Social Security maintains a welfare service
for war pensioners, war widows and war orphans. It works in close co-operation
with many voluntary and ex-Service organisations who give financial aid and
personal service to disabled ex-Service men and women and their families.
The European Community regulations on social security, framed to protect
the benefit rights of people moving within the Community, apply to most
United Kingdom nationals resident within the Community. People covered
by these regulations are entitled to benefit under the social security arrange¬
ments of any Community country, and Gibraltar, where they are working or
visiting, on the same basis as nationals of that country. There are also bilateral
reciprocal agreements between the United Kingdom and individual member
states of the European Community which apply to people who are outside the
scope of the European Community regulations. Reciprocal agreements on
child benefit and most national insurance benefits are in operation with
Australia, Austria, Finland, Jersey and Guernsey, New Zealand, Norway,
Spain, Sweden, Switzerland and Yugoslavia. Agreements with Cyprus,
Israel, Malta, and Turkey cover industrial injuries and most national insurance
benefits. There are limited agreements with Bermuda, Canada, Jamaica and
the United States. The Isle of Man is party to most of the bilateral agreements
with other countries and Jersey and Guernsey to a few; neither the nationals of
these areas nor their social security schemes are covered by European Com¬
munity regulations.
In addition to payments provided under the social security legislation, there are
a number of other benefits for which people with low incomes may be eligible.
These include legal aid and assistance (see p. 103), rent rebates and allowances
(see p. 176), rate rebates (see p. 68), exemption from health service charges (see
p. 119) and free school meals (see p. 145).
EQUAL OPPORTUNITIES FOR WOMEN
The Sex Discrimination Act 1975, one of the most comprehensive on this
subject in the world, makes discrimination between men and women unlawful
in employment, education, training and the provision of housing, goods, facili¬
ties and services. Discriminatory advertising is also unlawful. Sex discrimina¬
tion is defined as treating a person less favourably than another on the grounds
of his or her sex. Northern Ireland has similar legislation.
Under the Equal Pay Act 1970 (and corresponding legislation in Northern
Ireland), women are entitled to equal pay with men when doing work that is
the same or broadly similar.

Equal Opportunities
Commission
The Equal Opportunities Commission assists in the enforcement of both
Acts and promotes equal opportunities between the sexes. There is a separate
commission in Northern Ireland.
Employers must not discriminate against a man or woman because of his or
her sex. This applies to recruitment, promotion and training. It is also unlawful
for employers to discriminate against a person on grounds of marriage. There
are a limited number of exceptions including employment in private households
and employment in jobs where a person’s sex is a ‘genuine occupational
qualification’, such as acting. Employers of not more than five people are
exempt from the Act.
Co-educational schools, colleges and universities may not discriminate in
the provision of facilities or in their admissions. Single sex establishments are
permissible, however, and there are arrangements for such institutions to
move gradually towards co-education if they wish.
It is unlawful to discriminate against a man or a woman in the sale or letting
of land, houses, flats and business premises. The law applies equally to public
and private housing, furnished and unfurnished. The Act does not apply to
lettings in a small dwelling occupied by the landlord.
Discrimination is also unlawful in the provision of goods, facilities and
services. For example, banks, building societies or finance companies must not
refuse to give credit, mortgages or loans to women on the same terms as would
be applied to men. Exceptions include services provided in certain special
care establishments such as hospitals; places used for religious purposes
where religious susceptibilities would be offended; places where it is necessary
to preserve privacy; competitive sports in which, for reasons of physique,
women would be at a disadvantage; and life insurance and similar matters
where risk is assessed on reliable actuarial or other data.
It is unlawful to publish or place discriminatory advertisements whether
for jobs, goods, facilities or services. These are not unlawful if they apply only
to the exceptions set out by the Sex Discrimination Act.
Complaints of discrimination may be brought before the county courts in
England and \\ ales or the sheriff courts in Scotland, except for complaints
concerning employment which are dealt with by industrial tribunals (see
p. 99). Complaints concerning State educational establishments must first
be made to the relevant Secretary of State before they can be brought before
a court. Only the Equal Opportunities Commission is responsible for handling
complaints about discriminatory advertisements and can bring proceedings in
matters concerning advertising. \\ here necessary, legal advice or assistance,
or legal aid if the case is taken to court, are available for complainants with
low incomes (see p. 103). Legal aid is not available for industrial tribunal
cases but applicants can receive advice and assistance.
The Equal Opportunities Commission helps to enforce the Sex Discrimination
Act and the Equal Pay Act. Its roles are to eliminate sex discrimination and to
promote equal opportunities. The commission advises people of their rights
under both Acts, and in certain circumstances, may assist individuals to pre¬
pare and conduct a case before a court or tribunal. It may also attempt to secure
a settlement. The commission has power to conduct formal investigations and,
if satisfied that practices are unlawful, it can issue non-discrimination notices
requiring that discriminatory practices cease. For certain formal investigations,
the commission has the power to require a person to give information and to

attend hearings to give evidence. In addition it reviews the workings of both

RACE RELATIONS
After the 1950s considerable numbers of people entered Britain from Com¬
monwealth countries in the West Indies, Asia and Africa to take up employ¬
ment, many with the intention of settling permanently. It was estimated that
coloured Commonwealth and Pakistani immigrants and their families num¬
bered some 1-33 million at the time of the 1971 census (about per cent of the
total population of Great Britain), nearly 40 per cent of whom were born there.
In 1976 the population of New Commonwealth1 and Pakistani ethnic origin
was nearly i-8 million. The ethnic minorities make an important contribution
to the economy and public services and have settled mainly in urban areas
where opportunities for employment are greatest. Two-thirds live in the
major urban areas of England—Greater London and Birmingham having
the greatest numbers. The difficulties experienced by residents of the older
inner city areas are being alleviated by continuous social service programmes in
housing, education, hospitals, health and personal social services, which benefit
the whole community and by other social programmes which are directed at
areas of special need. Additional teachers have been appointed to schools in
immigrant areas and government grants are available to local authorities with
substantial minority groups towards the salaries of extra staff, such as inter¬
preters, health visitors and helpers in schools and community homes. Language
teaching is recognised to be of prime importance in schools and schemes
arranged for adults include classes at their place of work. The welfare of ethnic
minorities and good relations between minority groups and the local community
are promoted by community relations councils and other voluntary bodies.
The Race Relations Act 1976 makes discrimination unlawful on grounds of
colour, race or ethnic or national origin in the provision of goods, facilities and
services, in employment, training and related matters, in education, in housing
and in advertising. It strengthens the previous legislation passed in 1968 which,
in turn, widened the scope of the first race relations legislation enacted in 1965.
The 1976 Act brings the law against racial discrimination into line with that
against sex discrimination (see above), and gives complainants direct access to
civil courts and, in the case of employment complaints, to industrial tribunals.
Complaints concerning educational establishments are made first to the
appropriate education minister. (Previously complaints were dealt with
by the Race Relations Board or by investigating bodies within industry.)
The remedies available from the courts are damages, a declaration of rights or
an injunction. Industrial tribunals are also able to declare the rights of parties,
make recommendations or award compensation. Legal aid (see p. 103) is
available to complainants with low incomes.
The 1976 Act also strengthens the criminal law on incitement to racial hatred.
A prosecution made under the Act may only be brought in England and Wales
by, or with the consent of, the Attorney General.
The Commission for Racial Equality was established under the Act to work
towards the elimination of discrimination and to promote equality of oppor¬
tunity and good relations between different racial groups. It replaced the Race

Relations Board and the Community Relations Commission set up under the
earlier legislation. It has powers to investigate unlawful discriminatory prac¬
tices and to issue non-discrimination notices, enforceable in the courts,
requiring that such practices should cease. The commission has sole responsi¬
bility for those contraventions of the Act which do not result in a particular
person being discriminated against, for example, discriminatory advertise¬
ments and instructions; it may also assist individuals with their complaints.
It has an important educational role and has power to issue codes of practice
in employment.
The commission supports and co-ordinates the work of nearly 100 local
community relations councils operating in areas with significant minority
groups; their purpose is to promote harmonious community relations.
It makes grants towards the salaries of community relations officers and towards
special projects which help to improve community relations or to assist mem¬
bers of the ethnic minorities. Particular encouragement is given to self-help
schemes run by members of the minority communities.
/ Education
Priorities
British education aims to develop individual abilities to the full and to shape
those abilities for the benefit of society as a whole. Compulsory schooling
takes place between the ages of five and 16, although some provision is made
for children under five and many pupils remain at school beyond the minimum
leaving age. Post-school education (mainly at universities, polytechnics, and
further education colleges) is organised flexibly in order to provide oppor¬
tunities for academic work, vocational training and continuing study through¬
out life.
Considerable educational change has taken place in the last 15 years or so.
New methods of teaching and learning have increasingly been used, particu¬
larly in modern languages, mathematics and science. Informal techniques
designed to awaken children’s curiosity and interest have been introduced,
especially in primary schools. Secondary education has been extensively
re-organised into comprehensive schools which dispense with selection
procedures for entry at 1 i-plus and provide a wide range of studies for children
of all abilities. Post-school facilities have also been expanded, particularly for
advanced studies in the higher education sector.
The bulk of the expenditure on education comes from public funds; some
£7,340 million in 1976 which represented 67 per cent of the gross national
product, 12-5 per cent of all public expenditure and an increase in real terms of
about two-thirds on spending ten years earlier. The need for restraint on
public expenditure (see p. 186), however, has made it necessary to consider
educational priorities and make the best use of existing resources.
Following the period of substantial innovation and change the Government has
initiated a national debate on educational issues, involving teachers, admini¬
strators, parents, employers, trade unionists and others. The debate has
largely focused on schools education, and a consultative document on the
subject was published in June 1977 (see Bibliography, p. 437).
There is a general concern that schools’ curricula should be reviewed to see
that they are meeting the needs of modern Britain, and that there should be a
coherent and soundly-based means of assessment for individual pupils, for
schools and for the educational system as a whole. The Assessment of Per¬
formance Unit of the Department of Education and Science which promotes
the development of methods of assessing and monitoring the performance
of children at school is concentrating on the development of tests suitable
for national monitoring in English language, mathematics and science.
The Government is encouraging further links, especially locally, between
schools and industry, to try to ensure that every pupil grows up with a basic
understanding of the economy and the activities which are necessary for
the creation of the country’s wealth (particularly manufacturing industries),
and to encourage more of the able pupils to consider and prepare for careers
in productive industry. Many organisations already work to improve liaison
between school and industry; national initiatives include Schools Council
Industry Project, being mounted with the Confederation of British Industry
and the Trades Union Congress, and the confederation’s own project
‘Understanding British Industry’.
140
BRITAIN 1978: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Administration
SCHOOLS
Within the necessary strict financial limitations the Government remains
committed to improving educational provision for all. Nursery education for
children of pre-school age is being expanded, and priority in the allocation of
resources is being given to those with social and educational disadvantages
and to handicapped children. In many ‘priority areas’ within large cities, for
instance, special annual payments are made to teachers working in schools
of exceptional difficulty, and extra funds are allocated for school building.
Educational responsibilities are devolved in varying degrees to ministers of the
four countries of Britain: the Secretary of State for Education and Science is
responsible for all aspects of education in England, for further education in
Wales, and for universities, civil science and the arts throughout Great Britain;
the Secretary of State for Wales is responsible for nursery, primary and secon¬
dary education in Wales; the Secretaries of State for Scotland and Northern
Ireland have full educational responsibilities in their countries except that the
Secretary of State for Scotland is consulted about Scottish universities but is
not responsible for them.
Administration of publicly provided schools and further education is divided
between the central government departments (the Department of Education
and Science, the Welsh Office, the Scottish Education Department, and the
Northern Ireland Department of Education), local education authorities
(education and library boards in Northern Ireland), and various voluntary
organisations. Their relationship is based on consultation and co-operation.
Local education authorities are responsible for the provision of school
education and most post-school education outside the universities, and provide
grants to students proceeding to higher education (including universities).
In Scotland the central institutions (for higher education) and colleges
of education (for teacher training), which are administered by independent
governing bodies, are financed directly by the Scottish Education Department
and grants to students are also paid by the department. In Northern Ireland
the Ulster College (an institution of higher education) is likewise administered
by an independent board of governors and is financed directly by the Northern
Ireland Department of Education. Colleges of education are controlled by the
department or voluntary agencies.
Universities are administratively independent and their governing bodies
are appointed according to the terms of their individual charters or statutory
provisions. The Government exercises its responsibilities in relation to the
universities through the University Grants Committee (see p. 147).
Parents are required by law to see that their children receive efficient full-time
education, at school or elsewhere, between the ages of 5 and 16.
There were over 11 million children attending about 38,000 schools in
Britain in 1976. Most were receiving free education financed from public funds
(9'3 million in England and Wales and i-05 million in Scotland), while a small
proportion were attending schools wholly independent of public financial
support (426,500 in England and Wales and 17,500 in Scotland). In addition,
131,000 children in England and Wales and 22,000 in Scotland were attending
schools receiving grants direct from the education department concerned. This
direct grant system is being phased out (see p. 142). In Northern Ireland
373,000 children were attending publicly maintained or assisted schools.
Boys and girls are taught together in most primary schools and in an increas¬
ing number of secondary schools. Over 80 per cent of pupils in maintained
secondary schools in England and Wales and over 50 per cent in Northern

Ireland attend mixed schools. In Scotland nearly all secondary schools are
mixed. In the independent sector most of the schools for younger children are
co-educational, but of those providing secondary education the majority are
single sex.
Schools supported from public funds are of two main kinds in England and
Wales: county schools and voluntary schools. County schools are provided
and maintained by local education authorities wholly out of public funds.
Voluntary schools have mostly been established by religious denominations
and receive varying amounts of public finance according to type (‘aided’,
‘controlled’ and ‘special agreement’). About a third of the 28,335 schools
maintained by local education authorities in England and Wales are voluntary
schools: some 5,918 are Church of England, 2,667 are Roman Catholic, and
348 belong to other groups and religious denominations. Each publicly
maintained school has a body of managers or governors, some or all of whom
are appointed by the local education authority. In Scotland most of the schools
supported from public funds are provided by education authorities and are
known as public schools (in England this term is used for a type of independent
school, see p. 142). In Northern Ireland controlled schools managed by
education and library boards and voluntary schools managed by maintained
school committees, boards of governors and individual managers (usually
clergymen) are both grant-aided from public funds.
In England and Wales no fees are charged to parents of children attending
maintained schools (over 94 per cent of the school population) and books and
equipment are free. In Scotland, education authorities may charge fees where
this can be done without prejudice to the adequate provision of free school
education (although no authorities make use of this power). In Northern
Ireland no fees are charged to parents of children attending grant-aided
schools, with the exception of grammar schools, where qualified pupils
receive from the education authorities scholarships which cover the whole or
most of the fees charged by the school.
Facilities for informal education and play for children aged two to five are pro¬
vided free in public sector nursery schools and nursery classes in public sector
primary schools, and are also available for a fee in a few independent schools
and a large number of ‘pre-school playgroups’ organised by voluntary organisa¬
tions or by groups of parents. Apart from children only just under five, the
proportion ofchildren aged two to fourwho attend public sector schools remains
low (the supply of places being inadequate to meet the demand for them)
though attendance, and particularly part-time attendance, has been increasing
very rapidly in recent years.
Compulsory education begins at five when children in England and Wales
go to infant schools or departments; at seven they go on to junior schools or
departments. The usual age of transfer from primary to secondary schools is
11 in England, Wales and Northern Ireland but an increasing number of
local authorities in England are establishing ‘first’ schools for pupils aged
5 to 8 or 10 and ‘middle’ schools covering various age ranges between 9 and 14.
In Scotland, the primary schools take children from 5 to 12, normally
having infant classes for children under 7, although in some areas there are
separate infant schools.
The public or State system of education aims to give all children an education
suited to their particular abilities. About 76 per cent of the maintained secon-

dary school population in England and Wales attend some 3,400 comprehen¬
sive schools which take pupils without reference to ability or aptitude and
provide a wide range of secondary education for all or most of the children of
a district. They can be organised in a number of ways including schools that
take the full secondary school age-range from 11 to 18; middle schools whose
pupils move on to senior comprehensive schools at 12 or 13, leaving at 16 or
18; and schools with an age-range of 11 or 12 to 16 combined with a sixth-
form college for pupils over 16. Most of the remaining children receive their
secondary education in ‘grammar’ and ‘secondary modern’ schools to which
they are allocated after selection procedures at the age of 11. In order to hasten
progress towards the re-organisation of secondary school provision along
comprehensive lines, the Education Act 1976 requires local authorities, if
they have not already done so, to submit plans for such re-organisation. By
March i977> 27 °f the 105 authorities in England and Wales were providing
wholly comprehensive education, 77 were partially re-organised and one had
no comprehensive schools. A small number of selective grammar schools have
in the past received direct grant payments from central government funds.
The system is being phased out, however, and of 170 such schools 51 have
opted to join the publicly maintained sector and the remainder will become
wholly independent (see below).
Secondary education in Scotland is almost completely organised according to
the comprehensive principle and in 1976 about 98-6 per cent of all pupils in
education authority secondary schools were in schools with a non-selective
intake. The majority of schools are six-year comprehensive schools. Because
of local circumstances there are some comprehensive schools whose courses
may extend to four years or less and from which pupils may transfer at the
end of their second or fourth years to a six-year comprehensive school.
In Northern Ireland there are grammar schools and secondary (intermediate)
schools, the latter being the equivalent of the secondary modern schools in
England and Wales. Some comprehensive-type schools exist, and arrangements
for transfer between the other types of schools are flexible. The Government
has announced its intention of eliminating selective secondary education
throughout Northern Ireland and of developing a comprehensive system.
Independent schools in England and Wales receive no grants from public funds
but all are open to inspection and must register with the Department of Edu¬
cation and Science or the Welsh Office which have power to require them to
remedy any objectionable features in their premises, accommodation or in¬
struction and to exclude any person regarded as unsuitable to teach in or to be
the proprietor of a school. In default, the appropriate Secretary of State can, in
effect, close a school, but schools have a right of appeal to an Independent
Schools Tribunal against any of the requirements. There are over 2,300
registered independent schools. In Scotland where there are 103 registered
schools, the position is generally the same. In Northern Ireland there are only
four independent schools; these have to be registered with the Department
of Education for Northern Ireland and be open to inspection. As in England
and Wales they receive no grants from public funds.
Independent schools cater for pupils of all ages. The largest and most im¬
portant of them are the public schools,1 which accept pupils at about 12 or 13
1 ‘Public schools’ are usually taken to mean those schools in membership of the Head¬
masters Conference, the Governing Bodies Association or the Governing Bodies of
Girls Schools Association. They should not be confused with the State-supported
public schools in Scotland.

years of age usually on the basis of a fairly demanding examination. There are
about 260 public schools, most of them still single sex (about half of them for
girls) and at least partly boarding; but there are some coeducational schools and
certain boys’ schools have recently begun to admit girls direct to their top
forms. Combined tuition and boarding fees in the public schools are usually
between £ 1,500 and £1,850 a year, but some of this may be remitted for
children winning competitive scholarships. A number of preparatory schools,
day and boarding, coeducational and single sex, prepare children for entry to
the public schools.
Special education is provided for children who require it because of physical
or mental disability either in ordinary schools or special schools (including
hospital schools). It has long been government policy to send as few handi¬
capped children as possible to special schools, and provisions within the
Education Act 1976 established the principle that such children should be
educated in ordinary schools whenever practicable and compatible with
efficient teaching. There are, however, some 1,800 separate special schools
(both day and boarding) for a number of categories of disability. These are
the blind, partially sighted, deaf, partially hearing, delicate, educationally
subnormal (mentally handicapped in Scotland), epileptic, maladjusted,
physically handicapped, autistic and those suffering from speech defects.
There is no separate category for the delicate in Scotland. As many children
have multiple handicaps, there is a growing tendency to relate educational
provision to an assessment of overall needs.
Teachers in publicly maintained schools are appointed by local education
authorities or schools governing bodies or managers. In 1976 there were over
535,000 teachers (including the full-time equivalent of part-time teachers) in
publicly maintained schools in Britain and the pupil/teacher ratio was about
20 to 1. Teachers must hold qualifications approved by the appropriate
education department. Their salaries are determined by nationally negotiated
scales taking account of qualifications, responsibilities and experience.
In England and Wales the secular curriculum in maintained schools is the
responsibility of the local education authority, or, in the case of voluntary aided
secondary schools, of the schools’ governors. In practice there is a very high
degree of devolution to headteachers, particularly in nursery and primary
schools. In Wales, the Welsh language is taught and is used as either the main
or secondary medium of teaching in some schools. Her Majesty’s Inspectors
of Schools are responsible to the Department of Education and Science and
the Welsh Office for the inspection of all schools including independent
schools. They review and report on the content and value of the education pro¬
vided and are available as advisers. Local education authorities also employ
inspectors to guide them on maintained schools. Teachers’ organisations and
institutions concerned with the education and training of teachers are additional
sources of advice. Further guidance and encouragement for school-based
research and development is available to teachers through the Schools Council
for Curriculum and Examinations. The council, an independent body repre¬
sentative of all educational interests, acts as an advisory body and sponsors
and carries out research and development work on curricula, teaching methods
and examinations in primary and secondary schools.
Local education authorities are being asked to review their curricular
arrangements. In the light of the review the Government is to seek to establish
a broad consensus on a framework for the curriculum and on whether part of
H4

it should be protected because there are aims (such as the achievement of
basic literacy and numeracy at the primary stage) common to all schools and
pupils at certain stages.
In Scotland the function of Her Majesty’s Inspectors is in general the same;
the content and balance of the curriculum is kept under continuous review by
the Consultative Committee on the Curriculum. Provision is made, where
appropriate, for the teaching of Gaelic. Northern Ireland has a Schools
Curriculum Committee which works in close liaison with the Schools Council;
the Inspectorate of the Department of Education helps and advises teachers
and inspects and evaluates the work of all schools.
In England and Wales by law all children in county or voluntary schools
receive religious instruction and take part in a daily corporate act of worship
unless their parents choose otherwise. In county schools, and sometimes in
voluntary schools, religious instruction of a non-denominational character is
given which may include the study of comparative religions. (In areas with
large immigrant populations this can take the form of lessons on compara¬
tive cultures.) In all kinds of voluntary school there is opportunity for
denominational instruction. In Scotland, subject to safeguards for the indi¬
vidual conscience, religious instruction must be given, but the content is
determined by education authorities or, more commonly, by the schools
themselves. Roman Catholic children generally have their own schools. In
controlled schools in Northern Ireland clergy have a right of access wdiich may
be used for denominational instruction; in voluntary schools corporate worship
and religious education are controlled by the management authorities.
The freedom of schools to frame their own curricula has facilitated quite
rapid change and experiment, partly stimulated by the Schools Council and
other organisations. The general purpose has been to adapt the curriculum to
reflect technological advance and social change; and to enable it to respond to
needs of individual children. Greater emphasis has also been placed on
appreciation of music and the arts.
Among the most clearly observable general trends in new teaching methods
have been the increased emphasis, particularly for younger children, on
learning by doing ; the efforts to reduce or modify ‘streaming’ (grouping
according to ability) in such a way as to minimise its ill effects on children
placed in a lower stream; and the increased importance attached to pupils’
motivation. At the same time greater use is being made of new educational aids.
The broad direction of changes in curricula and teaching methods is among
the subjects being discussed in the national debate on education (see p. 139).
Broadcasting is a major resource for school teachers—most schools can
receive television, and almost all have radios. Relaxation of copyright for
educational purposes enables many schools to make recordings for more
flexible use within the school timetable. Films and slides are also used, often
in conjunction with tape recordings for audio-visual presentations. These
may be prepared by the schools themselves, but commercial products,
including the BBC’s ‘Radiovision’ programmes, are available.
The Council for Educational Technology for the United Kingdom and the
Educational Foundation for Visual Aids advise those connected with educa¬
tion on the use of audio-visual aids.
Computers are increasingly used to assist learning by means of calculation,
information retrieval and the simulation of situations. They are also widely
used in secondary schools to plan timetables, and help in the management of
courses in some schools.

There is no national school-leaving examination in England and Wales, but
secondary school pupils may attempt examinations, in various subjects, leading
to the Certificate of Secondary Education (CSE) or the General Certificate of
Education (GCE). The CSE is designed for pupils completing five years’
secondary education and is normally taken at the age of 16. It is controlled by
14 Regional Examining Boards, consisting mainly of teachers serving in the
schools which provide the candidates. The highest grade in the CSE (grade 1)
is widely accepted as being of the same standard as at least grade C at GCE
‘Ordinary’ level. The GCE examinations are conducted by eight independent
examining bodies and are set at two levels: Ordinary (‘O’) and Advanced
(‘A’). Normally candidates taking ‘O’ level are about 16 years of age, although
some take it earlier, at the discretion of their head teacher. ‘A’ levels are
usually taken after a further two years’ study. Control over the scope and
standards of the examinations is exercised by the Schools Council (see p. 143)
to ensure national comparability. Entries for both levels of the GCE are
accepted from candidates at further education establishments and from
candidates entering privately.
Grade C or above in various subjects at GCE ‘O’ level and the equivalent
CSE grade 1 are usually considered to be qualifications for entry to courses of
further education and training. Since the inception of the CSE the number
achieving the highest grade has increased steadily as the popularity of the
examination has grown while GCE ‘O’ level subject performances have also
improved. The ‘A’ level examination is at the standard for entrance to university
and for entry to many forms of professional training.
In Scotland examinations are conducted by the Scottish Certificate of Edu¬
cation Examination Board. School pupils in the fourth year of secondary
courses sit an examination at 16 years for the Ordinary grade of the Scottish
Certificate of Education, and pupils in the fifth or sixth year are presented for
the Higher grade. Passes at the Higher grade are the basis for entry to uni¬
versity or professional training. For those who have completed their main
studies at the Higher grade but wish to continue their studies in particular
subjects there is a Certificate of Sixth Year Studies.
In Northern Ireland candidates may take the Northern Ireland General
Certificate of Education or the Northern Ireland Certificate of Secondary
Education, which are equivalent to those examinations in England and Wales.
Physical education, including organised games, is part of the curriculum of all
schools. Those receiving financial assistance from public funds must have the
use of a playing field, and most secondary schools have a gymnasium.
The School Health Service (part of the National Health Service) provides for
medical inspection of school children and for advice and treatment of specific
medical and dental problems associated with children of school age.
Milk (normally one-third of a pint, O’19 litre, a day) is given free to children
of 7 years or under, to children aged between 7 and 12 if they have a medical
requirement, and to pupils in special schools for the handicapped. The School
Meals Service provides a mid-day meal at a subsidised charge (remitted where
there is need). Education authorities have a statutory duty under certain
conditions to provide free school transport; and have discretionary powers to
assist financially in the provision of transport for pupils between home and
school and for other school activities.
School Building
Local education authorities and voluntary bodies are responsible, under the
general supervision of the central departments, for providing the schools and
146
BRITAIN 1978: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
POST-SCHOOL
EDUCATION
Institutions
other buildings needed for public education in their areas. The central depart¬
ments determine the maximum size of the authorities’ individual programmes
in the light of national priorities; they also offer guidance to authorities by
means of building bulletins and in other ways.
Since 1945 an extensive school building programme has been carried out
resulting in the completion of about 16,300 new schools in Britain, together
with extensions, alterations and remodelling of existing State schools; over
9 million new places have been provided.
Grants of up to 85 per cent of the approved cost are normally available from
the Department of Education and Science or the Welsh Office for the building
of new voluntary aided schools and for alterations and external repairs to exist¬
ing aided schools. In Northern Ireland capital grants of 85 per cent are
available for voluntary schools managed by maintained school committees
and voluntary grammar schools which have entered into an agreement under
statutory provisions.
The school building programme has provided for new ideas and methods in
design and construction. Industrialised building techniques have been widely
adopted. New schools are designed to be light, airy and colourful as well as to
have enough teaching area and space for auxiliary activities and outdoor games.
Space is being used more flexibly, particularly in primary schools to meet the
needs of new teaching methods.
Education for those who have left school is organised very flexibly. It is avail¬
able to everyone above school-leaving age, is provided at all levels and may be
part-time or full-time, vocational or non-vocational.
About 34 per cent of young people receive some form of post-school
education compared with 20 per cent in 1965. Many courses lead to recognised
qualifications, varying from degrees and professional qualifications through
technician level to qualifications similar to those obtained before leaving
school. Further education is a broad term usually taken to refer to all post¬
school education outside the universities. Higher education (postgraduate,
first degree and similar level work) is provided at universities and on advanced
courses at polytechnics and other establishments of further education. Adults
of every age make extensive use of widespread and varied facilities for the
educational and cultural leisure activities included under the term ‘adult
education’ (see p. 151).
The principal institutions ot post-school education are the 45 universities (see
p. I4^)> 30 polytechnics in England and Wales and the 14 Scottish central
institutions, in which advanced (or higher) courses outside the universities are
increasingly being concentrated; the Ulster College in Northern Ireland; and
well over 700 other colleges, some of which have a very wide range of courses,
while others concentrate on particular subjects. These colleges include the
‘liberal arts’ colleges and institutions of higher education in England and
Wales into which the former colleges of education (for teacher training) have
been assimilated. All these institutions offer courses leading to recognised
qualifications, while their premises as well as school and other premises are
often also used for adult education.
Apart from the universities, most establishments of post-school education
are maintained and administered by the local education authorities. The
Scottish central institutions, however, the Scottish colleges of education and
the Ulster College do not come under the control of the education authorities,
but are managed by independent governing bodies, representative of the
authorities and other appropriate interests.

In addition, there are many independent specialist establishments, such as
secretarial colleges, correspondence colleges and colleges teaching English as a
foreign language; a number of voluntary bodies and private undertakings
providing cultural and general education, sometimes with financial or other
assistance from local education authorities; and a large number of other
education and training schemes run by public or private organisations.
Most establishments for post-school education are either maintained or assisted
from public funds. Where industrial training is provided by a college, the
charges are the responsibility of the employer, and broadly reflect the
economic cost of provision. Many full-time students are helped by awards
from public funds. These awards are mandatory for students who are taking
university first degree and other comparable advanced courses. They are
assessed to cover tuition fees and a maintenance grant, but parents who can
afford to contribute towards the cost are required to do so. In England and
Wales these awards are made by local education authorities up to first degree
level, while in Scotland awards to students on advanced level courses are
made by the Scottish Education Department. In Northern Ireland awards up
to first degree level are made by the education and library boards. Grants for
postgraduate study and research are offered by the education departments and
the research councils. In all, about 90 per cent of full-time students on
advanced courses receive help from public funds. Some scholarships are
available from endowments and from particular industries or companies.
Although largely dependent on public funds, the universities are guaranteed
as autonomous institutions by a special financial arrangement. The University
Grants Committee is appointed by the Secretary of State for Education and
Science to advise on State aid to the universities; its members are drawn from
the academic and business worlds. This body acts as a link and buffer between
the Government from which it receives a block grant and the universities to
which it allocates this grant. So, although the Government is responsible for
financing about 90 per cent of universities’ central expenditure (colleges
within universities may have their own investments, endowments and
budgets), it does not control their work or teaching. (The Open University,
see p. 149, is financed directly by the Department of Education and Science,
not through the University Grants Committee; and in Northern Ireland,
government grants are made direct to the universities by the Department of
Education which first seeks the advice of the University Grants Committee.)
In 1975-76 there were about 812,000 students taking full-time and sandwich
courses (courses where substantial periods of full-time study alternate with
periods of supervised experience on a relevant job) at universities and other
major establishments of further education in Britain. Of these about 269,000
were at universities while another 246,000 were following advanced courses
outside universities, at colleges of further and higher education, polytechnics
and Scottish central institutions. Another 297,000 were taking non-advanced
courses, over 82 per cent of them studying for recognised vocational or
educational qualifications.
Additionally, there were about 3-53 million part-time students, some 616,000
of whom were released by their employers for study during working hours.
The remainder were for the most part taking some of the wide variety of
adult education classes (see p. 151).
There has been a rapid expansion in higher education since the early 1960s.
The total number of full-time students increased from 222,400 in 1962 to
148
BRITAIN 1978: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Universities
5I5>000 I975~7^> nearly 14 per cent of 18 year-olds enter courses of
higher education. This expansion has been achieved by creating ten new
universities; by developing a number of colleges into universities, 30 of them
into polytechnics specialising in advanced work; and by widening the range
and flexibility of courses.
There are 45 universities in Britain, including the Open University, compared
with 17 in 1945. In addition, the University College at Buckingham, which
receives no assistance from public funds, began courses in 1976 but has not yet
achieved university status.
The English universities are: Aston1 (Birmingham), Bath,1 Birmingham,
Bradford,1 Bristol, Brunei1 (London), Cambridge, City1 (London), Durham,
East Anglia,1 Essex,1 Exeter, Hull, Keele, Kent at Canterbury,1 Lancaster,1
Leeds, Leicester, Liverpool, London, Loughborough,1 Manchester, New¬
castle upon Tyne, Nottingham, Oxford, Reading, Salford,1 Sheffield, South¬
ampton, Surrey,1 Sussex,1 Warwick,1 and York1. The federated University
of Wales includes five university colleges, the Welsh National School of Medi¬
cine, and the University of Wales Institute of Science and Technology. The
Scottish universities are: Aberdeen, Dundee,1 Edinburgh, Glasgow, Heriot-
Watt1 (Edinburgh), St. Andrews, Stirling,1 and Strathclyde1 (Glasgow). In
Northern Ireland there is the Queen’s University of Belfast, and the New
University of Ulster1 in Coleraine.
The universities of Oxford and Cambridge date from the twelfth and
thirteenth centuries, and the Scottish universities of St. Andrews, Glasgow,
Aberdeen and Edinburgh from the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries. All the
other universities were founded in the nineteenth or twentieth centuries.
Admission to universities is by examination and selection; there is no
religious test and no colour, nationality or sex bar, though in practice there are
about twice as many men as women. Prospective candidates for nearly all the
universities apply for places through the Universities Central Council on
Admissions. The only students to apply directly are applicants to the Open
University and British candidates who apply only to the universities of Glas¬
gow, Aberdeen and Strathclyde.
Most students at universities are undergraduates: in 1975-76 there were
about 269,000 full-time university students in Britain, including over 50,000
postgraduates. Just under a half lived in colleges and halls of residence, over
one-third were in privately rented accommodation, and the remainder lived
at home. There were over 31,000 full-time university teachers paid wholly
from university funds. The ratio of staff to students was about one to eight, one
of the most favourable in the world.
Except at the Open University, first degree courses are mainly full-time and
usually last three or four years, though medical and veterinary courses may
require five or six. A full-time course at a university remains the most usual way
of obtaining a first degree, in spite of the extension of facilities for obtaining a
degree in other ways. About four-fifths of all students on full-time first degree
courses are at universities. The range of courses is wide and has been increasing,
becoming more flexible with greater choice of combinations of subjects.
Nearly half the university undergraduates, however, are taking courses within
the categories of ‘science’ or ‘social administration and business studies’.
Actual degree titles vary according to the practice of each university; in
England and Wales the commonest titles for a first degree are Bachelor of Arts

(BA) or Bachelor of Science (BSc) and for a second degree Master of Arts
(MA), Master of Science (MSc), Doctor of Philosophy (PhD); while in
Scotland Master is used for a first degree. On the other hand, uniformity of
standards between universities is promoted by the practice of employing
outside examiners for all university examinations, and the general pattern of
teaching (a combination of lectures, small group seminars or tutorials with
practical classes where necessary) is fairly similar throughout Britain.
The Open University is a non-residential university which provides part-time
degree and other courses, using a combination of television and radio broad¬
casts, correspondence courses and summer schools, together with a network
of viewing and listening centres. No formal academic qualifications are
required to register for these courses, but the standards of its degrees are the
same as those of other universities. The university’s first degree, the BA (open),
is a general degree awarded on a system of credits for each course completed;
the average amount of study needed for a full course is estimated at 12 to 14
hours a week. The first courses began in January 1971 and in 1977 some
55,ooo students were following courses. More than 5,000 people a year obtain
degrees from the Open University—about 1 in 14 of the total for Britain.
The university also has a consultancy service to make its advice and facilities
available on a fee-paying but non-profit-making basis to bodies throughout
the world interested in ‘teaching at a distance’ projects.
Until 1975 the majority of teachers in England and Wales qualified by taking a
three-year course at one of some 150 colleges of education, so as to obtain a
teacher’s certificate. In 1970 professional training at university education
departments or colleges of education became mandatory for all intending
school teachers with degrees or certain other specialised qualifications (who
before then were entitled to teach without further training).
Since 1975, a basic reorganisation of the system of teacher training in
England and Wales has been started. All higher and further education outside
the universities, including teacher training, is being assimilated into a common
system under the control of local education authorities. A number of colleges
of education have been merged either with each other or with other colleges
of further education to form ‘liberal arts’ colleges or ‘institutions of higher
education’; some are to discontinue completely the initial training of teachers.
In response to the continued decline in the birthrate and its implications for
the size of the future school population, the Government plans to reduce
substantially the annual number of teacher training places available. Present
proposals envisage a target of 47,000 places by 1981 (compared with about
100,000 in 1976-77) and will involve the closure of some training colleges.
As the first move towards a wholly graduate profession, three- and four-year
degree courses incorporating educational studies are being developed,
although the three-year certificate courses will also be maintained as long
as they are needed.
In Scotland all teachers in education authority and grant-aided schools must
be registered with the General Teaching Council for Scotland. All teachers
of academic subjects in Scottish secondary schools must be graduates. Courses
in colleges of education lead to the award of a Teaching Qualification (Primary
Education) or a Teaching Qualification (Secondary Education). Graduates and
holders of specialist diplomas undergo a one-year course; courses in practical
and aesthetic subjects for non-graduates extend to two, three or four years.
Most Scottish colleges of education also offer four-year courses leading to the
degree of Bachelor of Education.
BRITAIN 1978: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK

In Northern Ireland teacher training takes place in the two university edu¬
cation departments, three colleges of education, the Ulster College and one
technical college. The principal courses are three-year (certificate) and four-
year (Bachelor of Education) but there are also one-year courses for graduates or
holders of other appropriate qualifications.
Increased importance is being given to the continued professional education
of practising teachers in Britain, and local authorities, universities and colleges
provide a variety of in-service courses.
Other Advanced In 1975-76 about 281,000 students, almost half of them full-time, were taking
Courses advanced courses other than in universities and teacher training colleges in a
wide variety of subjects, including architecture, art and design, catering,
engineering, natural sciences, social work and business and management
studies. An increasing proportion of the students were taking courses leading
to the awards of the Council for National Academic Awards (CNAA). The
council has power to award degrees and other academic qualifications, compar¬
able in standard with those granted by universities, to students who success¬
fully complete approved courses of study in establishments which do not have
the power to award their own degrees. In the academic year 1975-76 over
850 CNAA courses wrere being followed by about 63,000 first degree and
nearly 1,800 higher degree students. These courses ranged from science and
technology to the arts, social studies, business studies and law, but the pro¬
portion of technological, business or other explicitly vocational courses was
much higher than in universities and the proportion of arts, language and
science courses lower.
In England and Wales higher education provision outside universities and
teacher training colleges is being concentrated within 30 major national
institutions named polytechnics’. These provide all types of courses (full¬
time, sandwich and part-time) on a wide range of subjects at all levels, though
the trend is towards a concentration on advanced work. In Scotland similar
provision is made in 14 central institutions and a few further education
colleges managed by education authorities, though there is a tendency for the
Scottish establishments to specialise more by subjects than do the English
polytechnics. In Northern Ireland such higher education provision is
concentrated within the Ulster College.
Vocational
Courses
The British education systems offer facilities for obtaining all types of
vocational education and training and are notable for providing alternative
routes to higher qualifications for those who have found themselves unable to
continue full-time education after leaving school.
There is a wide variety of courses for young people in various trades and
occupations, leading to appropriate qualifications at the end of a course of
up to five years. Other, more academic, courses lead to the National Certificates
and Diplomas awarded by joint committees consisting of representatives of
education departments, teachers’ organisations and appropriate professional
bodies. Courses are normally at two levels, ordinary and higher. The Ordinary
National Certificate (ONC) courses normally last two years part-time and
students usually follow them between the ages of 16 and 19; the level of the
certificate is generally considered to approach that of GCE ‘A’ level. The
Ordinary National Diploma (OND) courses are the full-time or sandwich
counterparts of the ONC bat involve wider and deeper study. The Higher
National Diploma (HND), which requires a further two years’ full-time or
three years’ sandwich study, is recognised, within its more restricted field, as

approaching the standard of a pass degree; the Higher National Certificate
(HNC), after two further years’ part-time study, is lower in standard because
it is more narrowly based, but is nevertheless classified as an advanced course.
A Technician Education Council has responsibility for developing a
unified system of courses for technicians in England, Wales and Northern
Ireland, leading to awards which will eventually replace those of the joint
committees. A similar council has been established in Scotland.
Many further education colleges offer courses in shorthand, typing, book¬
keeping, and office studies. More advanced level work, however, is generally
concentrated in polytechnics or other colleges with a department of business
studies, notably those designated as regional centres of management education.
Courses for the post-experience postgraduate Diploma in Management
Studies are run by about 75 colleges; and some polytechnics run courses
leading to the Master’s degree of the Council for National Academic Awards
(see also p. 150). Much business education is related to the specialised
examination requirements of various professional bodies, and courses leading
to them are provided in many colleges, although numbers of candidates seeking
such qualifications do so through correspondence courses. A Business Educa¬
tion Council was established in 1974 with the same functions as the Technician
Education Council (see above) in relation to courses of business education. In
Scotland, similar courses lead to the Scottish National Certificate, the Scottish
Higher National Certificate and the Scottish National Diploma in Business
Studies, awarded by the Scottish Business Education Council.
Adult education is generally taken to mean courses of post-school education
outside the main areas of higher, professional and technical education. In
1974-75 about 27 million people over the age of 18 attended such courses
which were provided by local education authorities, certain residential colleges,
the adult education (‘extra-mural’) departments of universities and various
voluntary and statutory bodies.
A major part of adult education is financed by local education authorities and
provided mainly in their establishments, including schools (used for adult
evening classes). Most of the courses are part-time, and nearly 2-4 million
students attended local authority adult education classes in 1974-75. In
addition local authorities maintain or aid most of the short-term residential
colleges or centres, of which there are 45 in England and Wales, and which
provide courses varying in length between a weekend and a fortnight. Many
of the courses are practical, but there are widespread opportunities for
academic study.
Long-term residential colleges (six in England and Wales, one in Scotland)
which are grant-aided by the central government departments, provide courses
of one or two years, some of which lead to a diploma. The colleges aim to
provide a liberal education and do not apply academic entry tests. Most
students admitted to them are entitled to full maintenance grants at mandatory
rates.
The extra-mural departments of the universities and the Workers’ Educa¬
tional Association (WEA), the largest of the recognised voluntary bodies, pro¬
vide extended part-time courses of more academic studies, though recently
there has been a tendency for more short courses organised for special
(including vocational) interests. Often the WEA provides the organisation and
the teaching is provided by the extra-mural departments, many of which have
full-time staff appointed for this purpose and can also call on the services of
other departments of the university. In 1974-75 about 300,000 students
I52
BRITAIN 1978: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Teaching
Methods
attended such courses. Similar work is promoted in some local education
authority centres.
There are a large number of other organisations (both national and local)
which provide many kinds of education and training. Several non-political
bodies, such as the National Federation of Women’s Institutes and the
National Council of Young Men’s Christian Associations, receive govern¬
ment grants; others are commercially or privately financed. Some make their
facilities available to the public as a whole, others to a particular group, such
as the disabled or the unemployed, or the employees or members of an
organisation.
A recent development has been the spread of community schools and col¬
leges and community centres. Community schools and colleges are secondary
schools planned to serve also as cultural community centres, providing educa¬
tional, social and cultural opportunities for the whole community. Community
centres have a more social character and, though aided financially by the local
education authorities, are usually managed by voluntary community associa¬
tions many of which are affiliated to the National Federation of Community
Associations.
The National Institute of Adult Education provides a national centre of
information, research and publication for adult education, as well as a channel
of co-operation and consultation for the many interested organisations in Eng¬
land and Wales. It is mainly financed by contributions from local education
authorities and assisted by a grant from the Department of Education and
Science. The National Institute of Adult Education has created an Adult
Literacy Resource Agency to administer funds of about £3 million which the
Government is making available to assist local education authorities and other
organisations working to combat adult illiteracy. The Scottish Institute of
Adult Education and the Scottish Adult Literacy Resource Agency are the
corresponding bodies in Scotland. A Council for Continuing Education has
been established in Northern Ireland to advise on the co-ordination of
existing facilities and assist in planning for the future.
The general pattern of teaching and learning on full-time courses at universi¬
ties and colleges remains a mixture of lectures, prescribed or suggested reading,
seminars or tutorials, exercises and tests, and, where appropriate, practical
work. Nevertheless, each institution has different ways of preparing its course
material and different approaches and emphases in teaching it. They make
use of the teaching and learning aids provided by radio and television and of
other visual aids. Teaching machines and language laboratories are also used,
as are computer-assisted and computer-managed learning techniques. All
universities have access to computers for educational and research purposes,
and most universities and many colleges have closed circuit television.
Radio and television programmes, both specially instructional and general,
are perhaps the most penetrating purveyors of adult education, and are often
linked to a range of supplementary publications and activities. Most BBC radio
study programmes are grouped in hourly sessions on five nights a week and
week-end afternoons. Television study programmes are shown on Saturday
and Sunday mornings and in the early morning and late evening on weekdays.
Both the BBC and Independent Television provide programmes at successive
intellectual levels from domestic, social and craft skills to progressive voca¬
tional training. The BBC also works with the Open University, producing
and broadcasting radio and television programmes as an integral part of
courses.

Research into the theory and practice of education and the organisation of
educational services is supported financially by the central government
education departments, local education authorities, philanthropic organisa¬
tions, universities and teachers’ associations. Some research is also sponsored
at further education institutions and by a few independent organisations.
The Schools Council and the Social Science Research Council are important
channels for government support.
The major institute undertaking research in education, outside the universi¬
ties, is the National Foundation for Educational Research in England and
Wales, an autonomous body which derives its income mainly from corporate
members, including local education authorities, teachers’ organisations and
universities, and from an annual grant from the Department of Education and
Science. There are also the Scottish Council for Research in Education and the
Northern Ireland Council for Educational Research.
There are many opportunities for overseas students to study in Britain and
for British students to study abroad and some British teachers serve overseas
for a period.
The promotion of educational work overseas, including advice and assistance
in English teaching, is a major concern of the British Council (see also p. 386).
The council (founded in 1934) is financed mainly from public funds, and is
governed by a board which is broadly representative of many elements of
British life and includes members nominated by government ministers. Its
purpose is defined in its Royal Charter as the promotion of a wider knowledge
of the United Kingdom and the English language abroad and the develop¬
ment of closer cultural relations between Britain and other countries. Through
its staff in 78 countries, the council’s activities also include fostering personal
contacts between British and overseas people, especially in the educational,
professional and scientific fields; running, or helping to maintain, over 170
libraries of British books and periodicals; and presenting British achieve¬
ments and the arts. Its work in Britain is concerned mainly with professional
visitors and with the welfare of overseas students.
British membership of the European Community is creating closer educational
ties with other member countries. Both at school level and in the colleges and
universities there has been an expansion of interest in European studies and
languages. Post-to-post exchanges of teachers have been encouraged by
government-sponsored schemes which are administered by the Central
Bureau for Educational Visits and Exchanges. The bureau also makes appoint¬
ments available to European teachers wishing to teach in Britain, negotiates
posts on an in-service training basis for British teachers wishing to further
their experience in another European country, and operates a scheme for
foreign language teaching assistants. Britain has adhered to the Statute
of the European Schools (six of which have been established throughout
the Community) to provide school education for children of people em¬
ployed in the European Community institutions. Negotiations are in progress
to promote recognition of professional qualifications which will enable qualified
people to practise anywhere in the Community.
Two aspects of education being given particular attention within the
Community are the relationship between education and working life, and the
educational needs of migrant workers’ children.

BRITAIN 1978: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Overseas
Students
in Britain
Students come to Britain from countries throughout the world to study at
universities or other educational institutions or for professional training. In
the academic year 1975-76 there were about 114,000 overseas students in
Britain, of whom about 32,000 were at universities, another 43,000 at further
education colleges and the remainder learning English or training as teachers,
nurses, for the law, banking and accountancy, or in industry. About 47 per
cent of all overseas students were from the Commonwealth and about 69 per
cent were from developing countries.
A range of public and private study fellowships and scholarships are
awarded annually to students and research workers from other countries.
As part of British technical assistance to developing countries, the Ministry
of Overseas Development supports many students with subsistence and
fees, encourages the development of special courses of particular value to
students from developing countries and of advisory and welfare services to
meet their needs. Over 12,000 students and trainees were helped in this way
in 1976. Under the Commonwealth Scholarship and Fellowship Plan, the
governments of certain Commonwealth countries have made awards avail¬
able at their own institutions of higher education to men and women from other
Commonwealth countries. At the beginning of the academic year 1976-77,
569 scholarships and fellowships (including medical awards) were held in
Britain under the plan. The Commonwealth Education Fellowship Scheme
provides opportunities for further training, study and research for teachers and
others with appropriate experience. Over 1,000 study fellowships were
financed during 1976.
About 450 British Council Scholarships tenable usually for one year in
Britain, and 25 British Council Fellowships tenable for two to three years, are
offered annually to graduates of overseas universities. Some 30 Marshall
Scholarships for two years’ study at any university in Britain are offered
annually by the British Government to graduates from the United States of
America. Over 70 Rhodes Scholarships are awarded annually to graduates
from the Commonwealth, the United States and the Federal Republic of
Germany for two years of study at the University of Oxford. Other univer¬
sities and colleges themselves offer many scholarships for which graduate
students of any nationality are eligible.
The Association of Commonwealth Universities publishes three handbooks
(see Bibliography p. 436) which include information about sources of financial
aid tenable in Britain. The association promotes co-operation between
Commonwealth universities. Its activities include the provision of publication,
information and academic appointments services, and of secretariats for
various bodies affecting its member institutions, such as the Commonwealth
Scholarship Commission and the Marshall Aid Commemoration Commission.
Fellowships and training awards for study in British institutions are
additionally available under the Central Treaty Organisation, the Colombo
Plan, and the Special Commonwealth African Assistance Plan. Over 1,500
awards for study or training in Britain are also made under various multi¬
national programmes such as those of the United Nations and its specialised
agencies (UNESCO, FAO, WHO, for example), the Council of Europe,
OECD and the European Development Fund of the European Community.
The Atlantic College at St. Donat’s, South Wales (one of the three consti¬
tuent colleges of the United World Colleges) provides two-year residential
courses for selected fee-paying pupils of different nationalities prior to their
entering university. About 80 per cent of its students benefit from scholarships
which are provided mainly by governments and international companies.

The Commonwealth Education Liaison Committee supplements normgl
direct dealings on education between the countries of the Commonwealth, and
regular Commonwealth education conferences are held. The United Kingdom
Council for Overseas Student Affairs is an independent body serving overseas
students and organisations, and individuals concerned in student affairs. It
provides both a forum for the exchange of ideas, and machinery for consulta¬
tion with government and other authorities. An Overseas Student Welfare
Expansion Programme is administered by the British Council and makes
grants available for the provision of hostels and other services (by 1977 some
262 projects had been approved assisting over 7,000 overseas students).
There are about 19,000 British students overseas, following courses at
universities and other institutions of higher education, mainly in Canada,
the United States and France.
In 1976-77 17 awards were taken up by British students in Commonwealth
countries under the Commonwealth Scholarship and Fellowship Plan (see p.
I54)- The United States—United Kingdom Educational Commission (still
sometimes called the Fulbright—Hays Commission) offers travel and mainten¬
ance grants for postgraduate study in the United States. Notable among other
scholarships are the Kennedy scholarships, to enable British students to study
at an American university, and the Churchill travel scholarships, for men and
women in all walks of life. British students are also offered scholarships at
institutions of higher education in many European and non-European coun¬
tries outside the Commonwealth.
Between 4,000 and 5,000 British teachers serve overseas in schools, colleges
of education, technical colleges, universities, and as teacher trainers and educa¬
tional advisers in developing countries. Many of them are supported by
public funds and most work in Commonwealth countries. Recruitment is
carried out by the Ministry of Overseas Development, the British Council
and voluntary teacher recruiting agencies, such as Christians Abroad. Some
developing countries carry out their own recruitment of British teachers
through their offices in London.
Most of the several hundred British people teaching in universities overseas
are placed through the Inter-University Council for Higher Education
Overseas, the Association of Commonwealth Universities and the British
Council. The Government supports a number of schemes of assistance for
overseas universities. These are administered by the Inter-University Council
and include the Special Commonwealth Awards which are made to leading
scholars from British universities who are willing to work for a minimum of
two years in important posts in the universities of developing Common¬
wealth countries.
In addition, four voluntary organisations, co-ordinated under the British
Volunteer Programme, recruit graduate and qualified volunteers for service
overseas. More than half the volunteers working overseas- in education are
teachers. The programme receives financial assistance from the British
Government.
Several schemes designed to assist interchange between institutions of higher
education in Britain and overseas countries through staff visits are adminis¬
tered by the British Council. Study and research visits by British and overseas
scholars are supported through programmes of the British Academy, the
Royal Society, the Science Research Council, and other British and inter¬
national bodies.
156 BRITAIN 1978: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Schemes under which teachers in Britain exchange posts for a year with
teachers overseas include one with the United States and another with Com¬
monwealth countries involving each year about 225 British teachers.
Official exchange schemes also operate between Britain and several European
countries both for teachers and for assistants’ posts for language specialists.
The largest of these schemes is the modern languages assistants’ scheme,
administered by the Central Bureau for Educational Visits and Exchanges,
which enables students and young teachers to serve overseas, particularly in
Europe, and for their counterparts to serve in Britain.
Britain provides assistance, on request, to the developing countries in several
other ways, including the loan of educational experts for specialist missions
and technical and consultancy services. Areas of particular activity include the
introduction of new materials, methods and techniques. This assistance is
provided through various educational organisations, the Ministry of Overseas
Development and the British Council. In addition, the most extensive language
teaching undertaking in the world is provided by the English by Radio and
Television service of the British Broadcasting Corporation. English lessons
are broadcast weekly by radio with explanations in 30 other languages, and
recorded lessons are supplied to some 300 stations in 100 countries. English
by television programmes have been used in more than 90 countries.
THE YOUTH SERVICE
The aim of the youth service is to promote the social and informal education
of young people by offering them opportunities in their leisure time to mix
socially and to develop and enlarge their range of interests. The service is
provided by a partnership between public authorities and a large variety of
voluntary organisations. Membership of groups is voluntary and there is no
attempt to impose uniformity or to create anything in the nature of a national
youth movement.
State The youth service forms part of the education system. The central govern-
Involvement ment education departments formulate broad policy objectives for the service
and encourage their achievement through financial assistance and advice.
They assist national voluntary organisations through grants towards the cost
of administration and building projects. They also make known the Govern¬
ment’s attitude by means of circulars to local education authorities and through
contacts between departmental officials and representatives of the authorities
and the voluntary organisations. The Scottish Education Department is
advised by a council representing both statutory and voluntary bodies
concerned in youth and community work, while in Northern Ireland the
advisory body is the Youth Committee for Northern Ireland. The Youth
Service Forum for England and Wales acts as a central forum for the considera¬
tion of national policies.
Local education authorities (education and library boards in Northern
Ireland) are responsible for local administration of the youth service. Authori¬
ties provide and run their own youth clubs and centres (some of which are
residential) which may be purpose-built or associated with schools. They also
assist local voluntary groups by lending premises and equipment and by
contributing to their capital and running costs. Many authorities have
appointed youth committees on which official and voluntary bodies are
represented, and employ youth organisers to co-ordinate youth work in
their areas and to arrange in-service training. In Scotland these committees

and organisers are normally concerned with services for both young people
and adults.
Although there are many local education authority youth clubs and centres,
national voluntary organisations still promote the largest share of youth
activities through local groups which raise most of their day-to-day running
expenses by their own efforts. These have an estimated combined membership
of over 6 million. They vary greatly in character, some concentrating on social
and recreational pursuits while others concentrate on educational or religious
activities. Most of the national organisations in England are members of the
National Council of Voluntary Youth Services (NCVYS),- a consultative
body which takes action only in the name and with the consent of its member
bodies. The council has over 50 national organisations and 32 local co¬
ordinating bodies as members. In Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland
there are similar representative bodies.
Among the largest of the voluntary youth organisations in membership of
NCVYS are the Scout and Girl Guides Associations (with about 600,000 and
800,000 members), the National Association of Youth Clubs (about 500,000),
the National Association of Boys’ Clubs (some 170,000) and the Youth
Hostels Association (about 275>000)' There are three pre-service organisa¬
tions (the Combined Cadet Force, Army Cadet Force and Air Training
Corps) which are also members of NCVYS. They are financially assisted by
the Ministry of Defence and combine social, educational and physical
development with training for possible entry to the armed forces.
There are some 4,000 full-time youth workers in Britain and these are
supported by many thousands of part-time workers, many of them unpaid.
Part-time workers usually have no professional qualification in youth work but
some have allied qualifications, for instance as teachers, and a large number
attend short courses and conferences on youth work. Qualified school teachers
are recognised as qualified youth workers.
In England and Wales, there is a basic two-year training for youth and com¬
munity workers. Provided at further education colleges, the course leads to
a professional qualification. In addition a number of teacher training colleges
provide a study of youth work as a principal or subsidiary subject within
teacher-training courses. In Scotland one- and three-year courses are
provided at certain colleges of education and in Northern Ireland courses are
provided by the Ulster College.
The Duke of Edinburgh’s Award Scheme, which operates through bodies
such as local authorities, schools, youth organisations and industrial firms, is
designed as a challenge to young people to reach certain standards in leisure¬
time activities with the voluntary assistance of adults. Over 100,000 young
people between the ages of 14 and 25 from Britain and other Commonwealth
countries entered the scheme in 1976. There are three awards—Bronze,
Silver and Gold—for each of which young people must attempt activities in
four out of five sections: service; interests; expeditions; and either physical
activity or design for living.
The King George’s Jubilee Trust is a charitable body which, since its
creation in 1935, has distributed over £3-1 million in grants to voluntary
youth organisations and towards experimental youth projects.
There are, in addition, a number of organisations, which, although primarily
concerned with the welfare and out-of-school pursuits of young people,
158 BRITAIN 1978: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
operate in a context broader than that of any individual youth movement.
Among the most important are the Sports Councils for England, Wales,
Scotland and Northern Ireland, which provide practical and advisory services
for many youth organisations; the National Playing Fields Association, which
advises local authorities and sports organisations on the acquisition, layout,
construction and use of sports grounds; and the Outward Bound Trust,
which maintains five schools in areas of outstanding natural beauty and offers
full-time residential courses designed to encourage a sense of adventure,
responsibility, confidence and achievement.
The National Youth Bureau is a forum for association, discussion and joint
action for those concerned with the social education of young people. It pro¬
vides comprehensive information, training and research services, and has a
specialist information unit on social work with young people. In Scotland the
Board for Information in Youth and Community Service undertakes similar
functions.
Thousands of young people voluntarily take part in community service
designed to assist those in need, including the elderly and the disabled.
Organisations providing opportunities for community service such as Inter¬
national Voluntary Service, Task Force and Community Service Volunteers
receive grants from the Government. Many schools also organise com¬
munity service activities as part of the curriculum.
The Young Volunteer Force Foundation is an independent body which
advises interested organisations in England and Wales on methods of involving
young people in providing service to the community. The foundation is grant-
aided by the Government and employs teams of young people who are available
on request to assist such bodies as local authorities, voluntary organisations and
hospital boards in promoting voluntary service. In Scotland, a similar
organisation, ‘Enterprise Youth’, exists to co-ordinate and promote voluntary
community service.
The Queen’s Silver Jubilee Trust, launched in 1977, encourages the efforts
of young people in Britain and the rest of the Commonwealth in community
and other projects.

8 Planmngand the
Environment
By comprehensive land-use planning and development control Britain has
had considerable success in resolving the conflicting demands of industry,
commerce, housing, transport, agriculture and recreation and in reducing
environmental pollution. The legal and administrative framework for
planning, which has evolved over many years, has encouraged positive
planning to ensure the wise use of land for the benefit of the community.
The Department of the Environment (see p. 45) brings together the major
responsibilities for land use, planning, housing and "construction, countryside
policy and environmental protection in England. The Scottish, Welsh and
Northern Ireland Offices have broadly equivalent responsibilities. All
government departments in Great Britain have a legal duty when exercising
functions relating to land to keep in mind the desirability of conserving the
countryside’s natural beauty and amenity. Many voluntary organisations take
an active interest in planning, conservation and the control of pollution.
The basis of the modern system of land use planning—derived from legis¬
lation passed in 1947—contained in the Town and Country Planning Acts of
1971 (for England and Wales) and 1972 (for Scotland) and the Planning
(Northern Ireland) Order 1972. There is a centralised structure under the
Secretaries of State for the Environment, Scotland and Wales, and compulsory
planning duties are imposed on all local planning authorities. The prior
consent of these authorities is needed for most development including mining
and quarrying and change of use of land or buildings. Large scale planning in
England and Wales is primarily the responsibility of the county councils and
the Greater London Council while district councils and the councils of the
London boroughs and the City of London are responsible for most local plans
and development control, the main housing functions and many other environ¬
mental health matters. In certain areas of planning, the two types of authority-
exercise concurrent powers. In Scotland, planning functions are undertaken by
regional and district councils whose responsibilities are divided on a basis
broadly similar to that in England and Wales. In the more rural regions and
islands areas, all planning responsibilities are carried out by the regional and
islands councils respectively.
In Northern Ireland the Northern Ireland Department of the Environment
is responsible for planning matters through its local offices which work closely
with the district councils and the local offices of the Housing Executive (see
p. 179). District councils have local environmental health responsibilities.
Special provisions, in addition to the general town and country planning
measures, control the location of industry and offices (see p. 210). General
problems of industrial development are dealt with jointly by a number
of government departments, but each development scheme, as a rule,
requires the local planning authority’s consent. Financial incentives from the
Government encourage the location of industry in particular areas.

BRITAIN 1978: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
A development plan system of structure and local plans was provided for
in legislation introduced in England and Wales in 1968. Structure plans are
prepared by county planning authorities and require ministerial approval.
They set out broad policies for the development and other use of land
(including measures for the improvement of the physical environment and
traffic management) and indicate ‘action areas’ where comprehensive develop¬
ment or improvement is expected to start within a specified period. Local
plans, which have to conform generally with the structure plan, contain
detailed proposals including plans for ‘action areas’ and are normally prepared
by district councils, though sometimes by county councils. Local plans are
adopted by the planning authorities without being subject to ministerial
approval unless the Secretary of State calls in a plan for his own decision.
All plans are under continuous review and may be altered from time to time.
A similar planning system was introduced in Scotland in 1975. In Northern
Ireland there is a single-tier system. Plans are prepared by the Department of
the Environment for Northern Ireland.
Members of the public and interested organisations are given an opportunity
to express their views on the planning of their areas during the formative
stages of the structure and local plans. The local planning authorities must
ensure adequate publicity for matters proposed for inclusion in the plans;
representations may be made about them to the authorities. These oppor¬
tunities for public participation are additional to provisions for objecting to
prepared plans. In the case of structure plans the Secretary of State holds an
examination in public of matters on which he requires more information in
order to reach a decision. In the case of local plans objectors have a right to be
heard and a public local inquiry is normally held for this purpose.
Where specific proposals for development differ substantially from the
intentions of a development plan, they must be publicised locally. Other
schemes affecting a large number of people are usually advertised by the local
planning authority and applications seeking permission for certain types of
development must also be advertised. The applicant has a right of appeal to
the appropriate Secretary of State if planning permission is refused or granted
subject to conditions. Most appeals are transferred for decision to inspectors
(in Scotland reporters) appointed by the Secretary of State.
The Secretary of State can direct that a planning application be referred to
him for decision. This power is exercised sparingly and usually only in respect
of proposals of national or regional importance. The applicant has the right to
be heard by a person appointed by the Secretary of State and a public inquiry
is normally held for this purpose. In the case of development schemes of
national or regional importance or of a technical or scientific nature, and if an
ordinary inquiry is inadequate for the purpose, the ministers responsible may
decide to set up planning inquiry commissions to carry out investigations and
hold inquiries locally. Where highway development is proposed, the govern¬
ment minister concerned can hold such inquiries as he considers appropriate.
Similar provision is made in Northern Ireland for public participation in the
planning process and for the hearing of objections. There is a right of appeal
to an independent Planning Appeals Commission.
The Secretary of State for the Environment has responsibilities for regional
planning in England, which is carried out with the help of the Regional Eco¬
nomic Planning Councils and Economic Planning Boards. There is a council
and a board in each of the eight economic planning regions: Northern, York¬
shire and Humberside, East Midlands, East Anglia, South East, South West,

West Midlands and North West. The councils, which are advisory bodies,
comprise voluntary part-time members with wide experience of their
regions. They help in the preparation of broad economic and land-use
strategies which provide a regional framework for national and local planning
and investment decisions. The boards consist of senior officials in the regions
of the government departments concerned with aspects of regional planning.
They co-ordinate the regional work of departments and provide the councils
with information and advice.
Scotland also has an Economic Council and an Economic Planning Board;
there is a Welsh Council and a Welsh Planning Board; and Northern Ireland
has an Economic Council.
The Community Land Act of 1975 established the principle that ultimately
all substantial private development should take place on land which has been
brought into public ownership and then, except where needed for owner-
occupied housing, released on leasehold terms. It gave local planning authori¬
ties new powers and duties to buy land needed for development (other than
relatively minor development). Undef associated tax legislation authorities
are empowered to buy land at a price net of the tax payable on its development
value. A separate Land Authority for Wales has been set up to assume in
Wales the functions connected with acquisitions and disposals of develop¬
ment land which are carried out in England and Scotland by local authorities.
New towns were established in Britain primarily to relieve overcrowding in
large cities such as London, Birmingham, Liverpool and Glasgow, which had
become a serious problem in the early post-war period, and also to provide
growth points for industry. Similar considerations led to the introduction of
town development schemes, which encouraged the transfer of population and
industry from congested cities to areas suitable for expansion.
In Great Britain the New Towns Act 1946, later replaced by Acts of 1965
and 1968, gave the Secretaries of State for the Environment, Scotland and
Wales power to designate any area of land (which might include an existing
centre of population) as the site of a new town. The New Towns Act (Northern
Ireland) 1965 made similar provision for Northern Ireland. Legislative
provision for town development schemes was made by the Town Develop¬
ment Act 1952, for England and Wales, and the Housing and Town Develop¬
ment (Scotland) Act 1957.
Since 1946, 32 new towns have been designated: 21 in England; 2 in
Wales; 5 (formerly 6, but one decision was reversed by the Government in
1976) in Scotland; and 4 in Northern Ireland. The planning and growth of
each new town is supervised by a government-appointed development
corporation which is given general powers to acquire, by compulsory purchase
if necessary, land or property needed for the provision of houses, factories
and other buildings and for roads and essential services. (At Newtown in
mid-Wales responsibility now rests with the newly formed Development
Board for Rural Wales.) The capital cost is advanced from public funds and
is repayable over 60 years. Parliament has approved a fund to provide for
advances to the development corporations, which, for Great Britain, stands
at £2,750 million, of which £2,035 million had been advanced by 31st
March, 1977.
Four of the new towns (Crawley, Hatfield, Hemel Hempstead and Welwyn
Garden City) have been substantially completed and have become the
responsibility of the Commission for the New Towns, a government-
162 BRITAIN 1978: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
appointed agency which functions in England and Wales. In Northern Ireland,
development of the new towns has been incorporated in a new District
Towns Strategy which is the responsibility of the Northern Ireland Depart¬
ment of the Environment.
Since the late 1940s over 900,000 people have moved to live in the new
towns in Great Britain and their total population is about 1-9 million. Young
people form a somewhat higher proportion than in the population of the
country as a whole. Several of the more developed towns are becoming
regional centres and, as the populations grow large enough to give the
necessary support, offices, hotels and department stores, as well as art centres
^rid full entertainment and recreational facilities, are gradually being provided.
The expansion of large existing towns such as Northampton, Peterborough
and \\ arrington has the advantage, among others, that many of these facilities
are already available. Most of the towns expanded under town development
schemes (for example, Aylesbury, Basingstoke, Swindon and Thetford) are
well established and are providing homes, jobs and amenities for people from
large cities.
The new and expanded towns represent a notable achievement in positive
land use and are generally recognised as among the most successful post-war
experiments, both socially and industrially, and as profitable long-term
investments. In the light of a changed situation, however, particularly in the
larger cities (see below), and of the need to allocate scarce financial resources
to the areas of greatest deprivation, the policy of population dispersal has been
reviewed and the future role and pace of development of the new towns are
being re-assessed.
Urban Renewal Local authorities have extensive powers (often aided by government grants) to
clear slum dwellings, to improve individual houses or whole residential areas,
to reclaim derelict land, to secure clean air and to manage traffic; and these
powers have been used, often in partnership with private developers, to
improve living conditions and enhance the physical environment in a great
many towns and cities.
There remain, nevertheless, crucial problems in the inner areas of large
cities, where a decline in the economic and industrial base, loss of jobs and
migration of skilled workers and young people have produced conditions of
economic blight and social deprivation among the populations still living in
them. This is seen as partly the result of conscious planning policy (such as
the development of new and expanded towns) but mainly of unforeseen
factors including a voluntary movement, greater than had been expected, of
people and industry away from the cities and a slower rate of population
increase than had been forecast. Over the past two decades several million
people have moved from the large cities to the suburbs and peripheral towns.
Government concern about the plight of the inner cities is not new. An
urban programme, designed to relieve social problems resulting from over¬
crowding, inadequate housing and schools and other forms of deprivation,
was launched wdth the help of government funds in 1968.
In September 1976, however, a new initiative was taken with the decision
to give special responsibility for urban affairs in England and Wales to the
Secretary of State for the Environment and to set up a ministerial committee
under his chairmanship, charged with working out a strategy for inner citv
regeneration. This strategy was outlined in a report published in June 1977.
A new priority for the inner cities is to be built into all relevant Government
expenditure programmes. The inner city programme is to be expanded by

^1,000 million over the next ten years, and over the two years 1977-79 an
extra ^100 million will be available for construction work in inner cities
throughout Britain. Special partnerships of central and local government are
to be established in the inner areas of some major conurbations. In Scotland
and Northern Ireland major programmes for the renewal and regeneration of
inner areas of Glasgow and Belfast have been initiated.
The strategy has been formulated with the help of several studies of urban
areas in England which have been undertaken by the Department of the
Environment and local authorities with the aim of emphasising an integrated
approach to urban problems.
Research into urban planning problems is also undertaken by a number of
institutes and university departments and by the Centre for Environmental
Studies, which is financed by the Government and other sources, including
the Ford Foundation.
Lists of buildings of special architectural or historic interest are compiled, as
required by the planning Acts, by the Secretary of State for the Environment
and the Secretaries of State for Scotland and Wales; about 260,000 buildings
are already listed. It is an offence to demolish or alter the character of any listed
building without special consent from the local planning authority or the
appropriate Secretary of State; where consent is given to demolish a building,
the Royal Commission on Historical Monuments (for England) and similar
bodies for Scotland and Wales have an opportunity to make a photographic
record of the building. Emergency ‘building preservation notices’ can be
served by the local planning authority to protect buildings not yet listed.
The respective Secretaries of State (on the recommendation of the appropri¬
ate Historic Buildings Council) can make grants and loans for the repair or
maintenance of buildings (or groups of buildings) of outstanding interest, and
local authorities can make grants and loans for any building of architectural or
historic interest even if it is not listed. A Government-sponsored Architec¬
tural Heritage Fund was established in 1975 to provide loans for local historic
buildings trusts. Over 4,000 grants totalling some £16 million have been made
to buildings under the Historic Buildings and Ancient Monuments Act 1953.
Local planning authorities have designated for special protection over 4,000
‘conservation areas’ of particular architectural or historic interest. Grants and
loans are available for works for the preservation or enhancement of con¬
servation areas designated as outstanding. Studies have been made in Bath,
Chester, Chichester and York of the difficulties of preserving features of
historic interest in ancient towns in the face of commercial development
and increasing motor traffic.
The Secretaries of State for the Environment, Scotland and Wales are
responsible for the maintenance of royal parks and palaces and for the protec¬
tion of ancient monuments of which about 800 are in their care. Some 15-1
million people visited them in 1976. The Ancient Monument Boards for
England, Scotland and Wales recommend to the respective Secretaries of
State which monuments are considered to be of national importance and
therefore worthy of preservation.
In Northern Ireland 138 historic monuments are maintained and protected
by the state, and there is planning legislation on the listing of buildings of
special architectural or historic interest (over 2,000 have been listed since
work started in 1974). Grants for repairs and maintenance are made by the
Northern Ireland Department of the Environment, which is also responsible
for the designation of ‘conservation areas’. Six areas have been designated.

The local planning authorities have power to protect trees and woodlands
in the interest of amenity by means of tree preservation orders; when granting
planning permission for development, a local planning authority must,
wherever appropriate, impose conditions to secure the preservation or planting
of trees, and landowners are generally required to replace 'preserved* trees,
which die or are removed or destroyed.
Id order to restrict the further sprawl of large built-up areas, to prevent
adjacent towns merging into one another, and in some cases to preserve the
character of a town and the amenities of the countryside, ‘green belts’ (areas
where it is intended that the land should be left open and free from building
development and where people can seek recreation) have been established or
proposed on the fringes of certain urban areas. About three-quarters of
London s green belt is agricultural land or woodland, some of which can be
used for recreation. There are also country parks, public open spaces, playing
fields and golf courses specifically for recreational use. In Scotland there are
green belt areas around the main cities.
The maritime local planning authorities are responsible for planning land use
at the coast, for example, providing recreational facilities and amenities for
holidaymakers and local residents; at the same time they attempt to safeguard
and enhance the coast s natural attractions and preserve coastal areas of
scientific interest.
A comprehensive study of the coastline of England and Wales, undertaken
by the Countryside Commission in 1966-70, recommended that certain
stretches of underdeveloped coast of particular scenic beauty should be
treated as heritage coast. Policies for these areas, now extending to 1,059
kilometres (658 miles), are being incorporated in the relevant authorities’
structure and local plans.
In 1965 the National Trust (see p. 171) launched its Enterprise Neptune
campaign to raise funds for the nation to acquire stretches of coastline of great
natural beauty and recreational value. More than ^3 million has been raised
so far and as a result the National Trust has under its protection 612 kilo¬
metres (380 miles) of coastline in England and Wales. Some 127 kilometres
(79 miles) of coast in Scotland are protected by conservation agreements
with the National Trust for Scotland. To give guidance on the planning
questions raised by oil-related developments the Secretary of State for Scot¬
land has issued coastal planning guidelines.
The protection of the coastline against erosion, for which the Department
of the Environment, the Welsh Office and the Scottish Office are centrally
responsible in Great Britain, presents difficult engineering problems and
heavy costs for the maritime local authorities. All sizeable coast protection
schemes drawn up by the authorities under the Coast Protection Act 1949
are investigated by government engineering staff. Substantial grants from
central funds (up to a maximum of 80 per cent) may be made to the authorities.
Protection against sea flooding where there is no question of erosion is the
responsibility of the water authorities (see pp. 263 and 277). To help to
prevent the pollution of the sea and coastline, international conventions
restrict the discharge of oil into the sea (see p. 169).
The display of outdoor advertisements is controlled by planning legislation.
General consents have been issued for certain classes of advertisement but
these can be withdrawn in particular cases where there is a serious threat to
amenity or public safety. Consent for advertisements outside these classes

must be sought from the local planning authority. Rural areas and urban
areas requiring special protection can be designated as areas of special control
which may impose more restrictive standards.
1 wo Countryside Commissions (one for England and Wales, the other for
Scotland) encourage the development of facilities for open-air recreation in
the countryside. These include the provision by local authorities (some¬
times in association with other bodies) and private individuals of country
parks within easy reach of towns; the establishment of camping sites and picnic
areas; and the increased use of reservoirs, canals and other waterways for
bathing, sailing and other activities. By 1977, 137 country parks and 167 picnic
sites had been recognised in England and Wales by the Countryside Com¬
mission. In Scotland a large number of local authority schemes for the provision
of a variety of countryside facilities have been approved for grant aid. The
Countryside Commission for Scotland has approved six country parks.
The commissions are also responsible for encouraging and promoting
measures to conserve and enhance the natural beauty and amenity of the
countryside and may undertake research projects and experimental schemes,
working in consultation with local authorities and such bodies as the Nature
Conservancy Council (see p. 167) and the Sports Councils (see p. 417). In
England and Wales, the Countryside Commission may give financial assistance
to public bodies and individuals carrying out countryside recreation and
amenity projects.
The Countryside Commission (for England and Wales) is empowered to
designate, for confirmation by the appropriate minister, national parks and
‘areas of outstanding natural beauty’ and to make proposals for the creation
of long-distance footpaths and bridleways. Ten national parks have been estab¬
lished: Northumberland, the Lake District, the Yorkshire Dales, the North
York Moors and the Peak District in northern England; Snowdonia, the
Pembrokeshire Coast and the Brecon Beacons in Wales; Exmoor and Dart¬
moor in south-west England. They cover some 13,600 sq km (5,2150 square
miles), or 9 per cent of the area of England and Wales. Administration is
based on local authority representation, with a third of the members appointed
by the Government. By 1977, 33 areas of outstanding natural beauty had been
designated, covering some 14,500 sq km (5,589 square miles).
The land in these designated areas generally remains privately owned, but
agreements or orders to secure additional public access may be made by local
authorities. Steps are taken to preserve and enhance the landscape’s natural
beauty by high standards of development control, and by positive measures,
for which grants are available, such as tree planting and preservation, and
the removal of eyesores. In the national parks, other measures for the benefit
of the public include the provision of car parks, camping and caravan areas,
and information centres. All national parks and some other designated areas
have warden services. Most local authority expenditure on national parks
is met by central government grants. Some 2,414 km (1,500 miles) of long¬
distance footpaths and bridleways had been approved by 1977. Large stretches
of these paths are already public rights of way. A number of the routes are
open and further routes are being established.
In Northern Ireland the Ulster Countryside Committee advises on the
establishment of national parks and the designation of areas of outstanding
natural beauty. Eight areas of outstanding natural beauty have been designated
and six areas are being managed as country parks.

Although there are no national parks in Scotland, there are five national
park direction areas, in which all except minor planning applications are
subject to scrutiny by the Secretary of State. The areas are: Loch Lomond-
Trossachs; Glen Affric-Glen Cannich-Strath Farrar; Ben Nevis-Glencoe-
Black Mount; the Cairngorms; and Loch Torridon-Loch Maree-Little Loch
Broom. Ministerial supervision, with the advice of the Countryside Commis¬
sion for Scotland, is exercised over planning permission in ‘areas of special
planning control’ which are areas of particular beauty, designated by the
Secretary of State. One such area forms part of the Pentland Hills to the
south of Edinburgh. Over 98 per cent of the land in Scotland has been
designated as countryside within the jurisdiction of the Countryside Commis¬
sion for Scotland.
The Forestry Commission (see p. 284) has formed, and opened to the public,
seven forest parks in some of the finest country in Great Britain: Argyll, Glen
Trool, Glen More and the Queen Elizabeth Forest Park in Scotland; the
Forest of Dean and the Wye valley woods on the borders of England and
Wales; Snowdonia in Wales; and the Border Forest Park on the borders of
England and Scotland. Camping and other recreational facilities are provided
in all the parks. The historic New Forest, in Hampshire, although not a
forest park, is also open to the public. The parks and the New Forest together
cover some 196,000 hectares (491,000 acres). In addition the Forestry Com¬
mission welcomes the public to many parts of the 1-2 million hectares (3
million acres) under its management. In Northern Ireland, the Department of
Agriculture has established six forest parks (Tollymore, Castlewellan,
Gortin Glen, Drum Manor, Gosford and Glenariff) and there are also five
forest scenic drives; in some 50 forests recreational facilities have been
provided.
Under the National Parks and Access to the Countryside Act 1949 county
councils in most areas of England and Wales have prepared definitive maps
showing all public rights of way within their areas. A path not shown may
still be a public right of way if it has been used over a period of years without
interruption. Public footpaths must be kept free of obstruction and, where
appropriate, signposted and waymarked by local authorities. Maintenance is
generally the responsibility of highway authorities, but the cost of repairing
stiles and gates is shared by the landowner. Local authorities in Great Britain
can create paths, close existing paths no longer needed for public use and
divert paths to secure either a shorter route or the efficient use of land. Rights
of way affected by development which is the subject of planning permission
can be diverted or extinguished by the local planning authorities, who
can also convert minor roads into footpaths or bridleways to improve the
amenities of their area.
There is no automatic right of public access to open country, but local
planning authorities can secure access by means of agreements with land-
owners; if agreements cannot be obtained, authorities may acquire land or
make orders for public access. These powers extend to Scotland.
Common land, a large proportion of which is open to the public, totals an
estimated 600,000 hectares (1-5 million acres) in England and Wales. (There is
no common land in Scotland or Northern Ireland.) This land is usually
privately owned, but people other than the owner have various rights on or
over it, for example, of pasture for farm animals. Commons are protected by
law and cannot be built on or enclosed without the consent of the Secretaries

of State for the Environment or Wales. The Commons Registration Act
I9^5 provided for the registration of all commons and village greens. Under
the Countryside Act 1968 local authorities can provide facilities for enjoyment
on any common land to which the public has access.
The Nature Conservancy Council is the official body responsible for nature
conservation in Great Britain. By April 1977 there were 153 national nature
reserves, covering 120,465 hectares (279,680 acres). Over 50 nature reserves
are run by local authorities; in woodland areas there are nine forest nature
reserves; in addition a number of reserves have been established by voluntary
bodies. There are also some 3>600 sites of special scientific interest in Great
Britain, notified because of their flora, fauna or geological or physiographical
features: local planning authorities must consult the Nature Conservancy
Council before granting planning permission for development affecting them.
In Northern Ireland over 28 nature reserves have been established and 40
areas of scientific interest designated by the Northern Ireland Department of
the Environment on the advice of the Nature Reserves Committee.
I hroughout Britain voluntary organisations co-operate in the conservation
of nature (and in many cases establish their own reserves or other specially
protected areas).
Local authorities, and in Scotland and Wales the Development Agencies
(see p. 209), bear the main responsibility for reclaiming land so damaged
by industrial or other development that it is incapable of beneficial use.
Local planning authorities have powers for reclaiming land in pursuit of
the general well-being of their districts—for example, in the course of
providing open spaces and industrial estates; they can acquire and develop
land and carry out restoration and improvement; and they can require an
owner of land which is damaging and offensive to the surrounding area to
improve its condition. Government financial assistance, which can extend to
the entire cost of a reclamation scheme, is available to local authorities.
Planning controls to prevent the spread of dereliction require that, when
permission is granted for mineral working, various measures must be taken to
minimise the disturbance caused by the work and to secure whatever restora¬
tion is practicable, either progressively or when working ceases. The use of
land for disposal of waste materials is also subject to conditions restricting
height or requiring treatment on completion.
CONTROL OF POLLUTION
Responsibility for the control of environmental pollution is shared by central
government departments, local authorities, water authorities and the Scottish
river purification authorities. Industry co-operates with these authorities and
voluntary organisations help to focus public interest on the process of control.
An independent standing Royal Commission on Environmental Pollution,
set up in 1970, advises the Government on national and international matters
concerning the pollution of the environment, on the adequacy of research
and on the future possiblities of danger to the environment. The commission
has so far published six reports.
The Secretary of State for the Environment has a general co-ordinating
role concerning pollution matters as a whole, exercised through a Central
Unit on Environmental Pollution within his department. Specific responsibili¬
ties of the Department of the Environment in England include air pollution
BRITAIN 1978: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK

control, fresh water pollution control, waste disposal, control of radioactive
wastes (jointly with the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food), of oil
and chemicals on beaches and of noise other than aircraft noise and noise in
the workplace. Most of these responsibilities in Scotland are exercised by
the Scottish Development Department, in Wales by the Welsh Office and in
Northern Ireland by the Northern Ireland Department of the Environment.
The Department of Trade is responsible for the control of oil pollution at
sea (other than from offshore operations) and its clearance, and for the control
of aircraft noise. The Department of Energy is responsible for the control of
pollution arising from the offshore exploration and exploitation of oil. The
Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, the Department of Agriculture
and Fisheries for Scotland, the Northern Ireland Departments of Agriculture
and the Environment and the Health and Safety Executive are responsible for
the control of agricultural chemicals and pesticides, for the protection of
fisheries from pollution and for the prevention of food pollution. The protec¬
tion of the health of employees at the workplace is the responsibility in Great
Britain of the Department of Employment and is controlled by HM Factory
Inspectorate which forms part of the Health and Safety Executive (see
p. 326); in Northern Ireland it is the responsibility of the Department of
Manpower Services. Other departments such as the Department of Education
and Science, the Department of Health and Social Security and the Scottish
Home and Health Department have an interest in health aspects of pollution
control.
Local authorities in Great Britain are responsible for matters such as
collection and disposal of domestic wastes; control of air pollution from
domestic and certain industrial premises and noise abatement measures.
Sewerage and sewage treatment and disposal are the responsibilities of water
authorities in England and W ales and of local authorities in Scotland. The
regional water authorities in England, the Welsh National Waiter Develop¬
ment Authority in W ales, the river purification boards and islands councils in
Scotland and the Northern Ireland Department of the Environment are
responsible for control of water pollution.
The European Community has adopted a Community Environment
Programme as a result of which a number of measures for community action
are being developed.
The Control of The Control of Pollution Act 1974 is a major legislative measure extending
Pollution Act earlier statutory provisions dealing with certain aspects of public health and
1974 pollution control in Great Britain; these relate particularly to waste on land,
including waste collection and disposal, pollution of inland and coastal waters,
noise and pollution of the atmosphere. The Act also increases the penalties
for a large number of pollution offences. It is, as yet, only partly in operation.
The Land The main risks of land pollution lie in the indiscriminate dumping of wraste
materials on land, application of pesticides and chemicals, fall-out of materials
from the atmosphere and the deposition of materials from floodwater. The
Control of Pollution Act lays a duty on the waste disposal authorities (the
councils of counties in England, of districts in WTales and of districts and
islands areas in Scotland) to operate a licensing system for all waste disposal
sites. It also makes special provision for regulations governing the disposal
of dangerous waste. Contravention of any such regulations or of the licensing
system is subject to penalty.
The Pesticides Safety Precautions Scheme, agreed between the agro-

chemical industry and the Government, ensures that new pesticides intended
for use in agriculture and gardens, forestry and food storage, or new methods
of using existing pesticides, are not introduced until enough experimental
work has been done on their possible hazards (including those to users,
consumers of treated produce, livestock or domestic animals and wildlife)
to allow the Government to make recommendations for their safe use. A
key role in the administration of the safety scheme is played by the Govern¬
ment s Advisory Committee on Pesticides which reviews all risks that may
arise from the use of pesticides.
Under the Litter Act 1958 and the Dangerous Litter Act 1971 it is an offence,
subject to a fine of up to j£ioo, to leave litter on land in the open air to which
the public have free access. Under the Civic Amenities Act 1967 the deliberate
dumping of rubbish carries a similar maximum fine with the possibility of a
£200 fine and three months’ imprisonment for subsequent offences.
Recycling and reclamation of waste materials is undertaken both to reduce
pollution and to help in the conservation and re-use of scarce resources.
The Government has a Waste Management Advisory Council which is
looking at possibilities for extending reclamation and reducing waste.
There is extensive government research and development on such aspects
as mechanical sorting plants. The Department of Industry has a Waste
Materials Exchange which brings together producers and possible users of
industrial wastes beyond obvious categories such as scrap. The Control of
Pollution Act gives new powers to waste disposal authorities to undertake the
recycling of waste materials.
The general provisions of the Food and Drugs Acts (see p. 125) make it
illegal to sell food which is injurious to health, not of the nature, substance or
quality demanded, or unfit for human consumption. Expert committees of
the agriculture, food and health departments periodically review regulations
dealing with food, including contaminants.
The water authorities, the Scottish river purification authorities and the
Department of the Environment for Northern Ireland are responsible for the
control of pollution in rivers, lakes, estuaries and some coastal waters, and
they control discharges of effluent to these waters. In recent years there has
been a steady and significant improvement in water quality. Improvements
in the tidal part of the Thames, for example, have made it one of the cleanest
metropolitan estuaries in the world.
The discharge of oil into British territorial waters was first restricted in 1922.
The United Kingdom is a party to the International Convention for the
Prevention of the Pollution of the Sea by Oil 1954, as amended in 1962.
Amendments to the convention agreed upon in 1969, which come into force
in January 1978, prohibit the discharge of persistent oil or mixtures containing
any oil anywhere at sea except at a rate which has been shown not to cause
pollution; no oil whatever may be discharged from cargo spaces of tankers
within 80 kilometres (50 miles) of land. Further amendments made in 1971,
not yet in force, relate to the design of tankers and are aimed at reducing the
volume of oil that could escape in the event of an accident. Although the 1969
amendments are not yet applicable internationally, Britain has applied them
to its own ships through the Prevention of Oil Pollution Act 1971. The
shipping provisions of this Act are administered by the Department of
BRITAIN 1978: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Trade. The Act also covers discharges of oil, or mixtures of oil, arising from
the development of offshore oil and was extended by the Petroleum and
Submarine Pipe-lines Act 1975 to allow certain exemptions to be made in
respect of off-shore installations and associated onshore terminals. This
latter Act is mainly administered by the Department of Energy. The Depart¬
ment of Trade, the Department of the Environment for Northern Ireland and
coastal local authorities are equipped to deal with oil spills which threaten or
cause coastal pollution or are likely to endanger wildlife. Civil liability for oil
pollution damage from offshore operations, at present covered regarding
Britain by a voluntary agreement, was the subject of an international Conven¬
tion agreed in London in December 1976 (not yet ratified).
The International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships
1973 will, when in force, replace the 1954 convention (see p. 169) by more
stringent requirements and will regulate pollution by chemicals, sewage and
garbage as well as by oil.
The loading of wastes for dumping at sea by means of vehicles, ships,
aircraft, hovercraft, marine structures (such as North Sea oil and gas installa¬
tions) and conveyor belts is controlled by the Ministry of Agriculture,
hisheries and Food and the appropriate departments in Scotland and
Northern Ireland, through the Dumping at Sea Act 1974, which gave
statutory backing to voluntary arrangements which had been operated for
several years. Under the Act a licence has to be obtained for the permanent
deposit of any substance or article into tidal waters and the sea. Dumping
at sea is permitted on the basis of the scientific criteria set out in the
annexes to the Oslo Convention (International Convention for the Prevention
of Marine Pollution by Dumping from Ships and Aircraft 1972) and the
London Convention on the Prevention of Marine Pollution by Dumping of
Wastes and Other Matter 1972. The Act does not, however, control discharges
of liquid effluent from pipelines, which will be covered by the Control of
Pollution Act 1974 when fully implemented, nor discharges incidental to or
derived from the normal operation of a ship, aircraft, hovercraft or marine
structure. Disposal of radioactive wastes at sea must also be licensed under the
Radioactive Substances Act i960.
Responsibility for clean air in towns and cities rests with local authorities
who may, under the provisions of the Clean Air Acts 1956 and 1968, declare
smoke control areas’ within which the emission of smoke from chimneys
constitutes an offence; over half the premises in the conurbations are covered
by smoke control orders. Central government is responsible through the
Alkali and Clean Air Inspectorate of the Health and Safety Executive (the
Industrial Pollution Inspectorate in Scotland and the Alkali Inspectorate
in Northern Ireland) for controlling certain industrial processes which give
rise to particularly dangerous or offensive emissions or which are technically
difficult to control. Emissions from motor vehicles are separately controlled
by regulations.
The Clean Air Council (set up in 1956) and a similar council for Scotland
review the progress made in abating air pollution in Great Britain. It is
estimated that the total amount of smoke in the air has been reduced by about
80 per cent since the early 1950s. The domestic smoke control programme
has been particularly important in achieving this result. London no longer
experiences the dense smoke-laden smogs of the 1950s and in central London
winter sunshine has increased by 70 per cent since 1958. Similar improve¬
ment has been achieved in other cities such as Glasgow.
Noise
Radioactivity
PLANNING AND THE ENVIRONMENT lyi
Local authorities are also responsible for the enforcement of noise control
and are required to inspect their areas for noise nuisances and to take action
(which can be enforced by the courts) to secure abatement. Measures against
noise, based on recommendations of the Noise Advisory Council (set up in
1970), were included in the Control of Pollution Act 1974. This improved
and strengthened local authorities’ existing powers and enabled them to set
up ‘noise abatement zones’ within which they can require noise levels to be
held constant or reduced and within which noise levels may not be increased
without their permission. The Act contained special provisions to control
noise from construction and demolition sites. Other noise abatement measures
include regulations governing maximum noise emissions by motor vehicles
and various measures in force at airports, including the stipulation of maxi¬
mum noise levels at take-off, routeing flights away from densely populated
areas and restrictions on night movement of jet aircraft. New subsonic aircraft
are required to satisfy noise criteria agreed by the International Civil Aviation
Organisation. Where airports or new public works cause unacceptably high
levels of noise, powers exist to provide insulation for houses.
In Britain radiation exposure of the population resulting from industrial
and other processes represents only a small fraction of that to which the
population is exposed from the natural environment. Nevertheless, that
fraction is subject to stringent control because of possible effects on health
or longer-term genetic effects. Under the Radioactive Substances Act i960
users of radioactive materials other than those subject to licence under the
Nuclear Installations Acts (see below) are required to be registered by the
Secretary of State for the Environment. Authorisation under the i960 Act
is also required for the disposal of radioactive waste from all premises. Very
minor uses and disposals of waste are exempted from the i960 Act controls.
Comparable controls are exercised by the Secretaries of State for Scotland,
and Wales and the Northern Ireland Department of the Environment. The
responsibility for granting site licences for nuclear installations under the
Nuclear Installations Act 1965 and subsequent Acts rests with the Nuclear
Installations Inspectorate of the Health and Safety Executive. Conditions
attaching to site licences require among other things, an efficient system for
detecting and recording ionising radiations and adequate measures for
storage and handling of nuclear wastes and irradiated nuclear fuel.
Control of the disposal of radioactive wastes from sites operated by the
United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority and from sites licensed under the
Nuclear Installations Acts is exercised in England by the Secretary of State
for the Environment; in Wales by the Secretary of State; and in Scotland by
the Secretary of State. The Government is carrying out a review of the
existing arrangements for the control of radioactive waste.
The National Radiological Protection Board (see p. 380) established under
the Radiological Protection Act 1970 provides an authoritative point of
reference on radiological protection and represents British interests inter¬
nationally.
VOLUNTARY ORGANISATIONS
Voluntary organisations are particularly active in ensuring that proposed
changes in the use of land take full account of the interests of the public and
considerations of amenity. The National Trust for England, Wales and North¬
ern Ireland, founded in 1895, is the largest private landowner in Britain and
172
BRITAIN 1978: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
has 550,000 members. For the benefit of the public it owns 160,000 hectares
(395>000 acres) of land and protects from harmful development a further
28,300 hectares (70,000 acres); and owns 232 historic buildings and large
stretches of coastline. Properties in Scotland covering some 33,200 hectares
(82,000 acres) are protected by the National Trust for Scotland, an indepen¬
dent body founded in 1931, which has over 82,000 members.
The Town and Country Planning Association, founded in 1899, seeks to
improve the qualities of land use and planning in Britain and operates a
planning aid service for local amenity groups; while the Royal Town Planning
Institute encourages high standards in town planning. The Civic Trust,
established in 1957, encourages high standards in architecture and planning
and has been closely associated with the drafting of conservation legislation.
It supports and advises over 1,300 local amenity societies. Associate trusts
exist in the north-east and north-west of England, and there are separate
Civic Trusts for Scotland and Wales.
Other voluntary societies concerned with amenity in town and country
include: the Council for the Protection of Rural England, the Council for the
Protection of Rural Wales, the Association for the Protection of Rural Scotland
and the Ulster Society for the Preservation of the Countryside; the National
Association for Environmental Education; the Keep Britain Tidy Group; the
Commons, Open Spaces and Footpaths Preservation Society and the Scottish
Rights of Way Society; the Ramblers’ Association; the Society for the
Protection of Ancient Buildings and the Ancient Monuments Society; the
Georgian Group and the Scottish Georgian Society; the Saltire Society
(which encourages the preservation of the architectural heritage in Scotland)
and the Ulster Architectural Heritage Society; the Victorian Society; the
Pilgrim Trust; the Council for British Archaeology; the Historic Churches
Preservation Trust; the Prince of Wales’s Committee (which promotes
environmental improvements in Wales); the Inland Waterways Association;
Friends of the Earth; the Noise Abatement Society; and the National Society
for Clean Air.
Among a large number of voluntary bodies concerned with nature conserva¬
tion are the Society for the Promotion of Nature Conservation, the Royal
Society for the Protection of Birds, the County Naturalists’ Trusts and the
Council for Nature (which consists of some 350 natural history and conserva¬
tion societies).
The Committee for Environmental Conservation, comprising many of the
main voluntary organisations, acts as a liaison body and is concerned with
broader questions of amenity than those covered by individual societies.
9 Housing
The main objectives of government housing policy are to secure a decent home
for every family at a price within its means, and to ensure fairness between
one citizen and another in giving and receiving help towards housing costs.
The Government is concerned to ensure that best use is made of the existing
housing stock and special emphasis is placed on gradual renewal rather than
clearance and on building for smaller households to match the changing
demographic pattern.
Particular attention is paid to the problems of areas of housing stress and
to housing policies designed to assist the regeneration of inner cities. A
housing policy review was completed in 1977 and two consultative documents
issued: one for England and Wales and one for Scotland. The review con¬
cluded that housing should no longer be considered as a single national
problem, but rather as a series of local problems needing attention area by
area. It proposed a new role for local authorities in developing four-year
housing strategies and investment programmes, in partnership with building
societies, housing associations and the building industry. The objective
would be to achieve a more flexible and sensitive approach in determining
local priorities and ensuring that resources go where they are most needed.
These new arrangements would include both public and private sectors.
It is proposed that they be introduced in 1978-79.
Although public expenditure provision for housing has had to be controlled
in recent times, the expenditure programme is still a substantial one, standing
at £4,000 million a year.
Housing There are over 20-5 million dwellings in Britain; nearly 17-2 million in
Characteristics England, 1 million in Wales, 1-9 million in Scotland and nearly 500,000 in
Northern Ireland. Although nationally the number of dwellings is slightly
larger than the number of households, there continue to be shortages in
certain areas; while, because of changing social habits, the houses available
may not always be of the type in demand.
Houses are much more common than flats. At the time of the most recent
General Household Survey, in 1973, some 78 per cent of households in Great
Britain occupied a whole house, 21 per cent lived in flats including some in
maisonettes or rooms, and the rest in accommodation rented with business
premises or mobile homes such as caravans.
Over half of all dwellings are owned by their occupiers, nearly a third
are rented from public housing authorities, and most of the remainder are
rented from private landlords. There are variations, however, in the distribu¬
tion of tenure between the different countries of Britain—in Scotland more
than half the dwellings are rented from public authorities—and in different
regions and areas of those countries. Private rented accommodation is
generally more common in the central districts of large towns, while owner-
occupation is more frequent in their outer suburbs and in country areas.
New house construction is undertaken by both public and private sectors.
Of the 314,600 dwellings completed in Great Britain in 1976 some 48 per cent
was provided by private interests, 47 per cent by public authorities, and
5 per cent by voluntary housing associations and societies. Public housing

authorities provide dwellings mainly for renting while private interests build
mainly for sale to owner-occupiers. The construction of private dwellings to
rent has dwindled to a very low level.
Over 9 million new dwellings have been built in Britain since 1945 and
more than two families in every five now live in a post-war dwelling. There
remain a large number of older dwellings, some of which have been kept in
good repair and modernised, but many others—particularly in the centres of
cities—are unsatisfactory by modern standards. The demolition of slum
dwellings, improvement of sub-standard houses and more advanced standards
for new house-building (particularly in the public sector) have led to signifi¬
cant improvements in the quality of housing.
Responsibility for formulating housing policy and supervising the housing
programme is borne by the Secretary of State for the Environment in England
and by the Secretaries of State for Scotland and Wales.
In Great Britain most of the public housing is provided by 459 local
housing authorities, which are responsible for ensuring that the supply of
housing in their areas is adequate. The authorities are: in England and Wales
(outside London) the district councils; in London, the Greater London Coun¬
cil, the London borough councils and the Common Council of the City of
London; and in Scotland, the district and islands councils. Other public
housing authorities in Great Britain are the new town authorities, the Scottish
Special Housing Association (SSHA), which was established in 1937 to
supplement building by local authorities in Scotland, and the Development
Board for Rural Wales.
The central government departments specify certain standards for the con¬
struction and equipment of all new dwellings; these are enforced by the local
authorities. Subsidies are made available to the authorities to assist them with
housing costs, and guidance is given on design and layout.
Local authorities are involved in many other aspects of housing policv, such
as the payment of house renovation grants and the implementation of housing
renewal programmes. A growing number are establishing housing advisory
centres to provide information on most aspects of housing.
Research into building materials and techniques, as well as into the social,
economic and design aspects of housing, is undertaken within the Depart¬
ment of the Environment. It is carried out by the Building Research Establish¬
ment of the department’s research directorate as well as by the directorates of
economics, statistics and housing development. The Research and Develop¬
ment Group of the Scottish Development Department also undertakes
research. Sponsored work is carried out in universities and local authorities
may also have housing research programmes. The Government is advised on
the need for, and application of, research and development by the Construc¬
tion and Housing Research Advisory Council. Advice on ways of increasing
productivity in house-building is also provided by the National Building
Agency.
In 1976 nearly 152,000 private sector dwellings were completed in Great
Britain, almost all of which were intended for owner-occupation. The number
of people owning their own houses has more than doubled in the last 20 years,
and the 11 million owner-occupied dwellings in Britain now account for over
half of the total housing stock.

Finance
Loans to enable people to buy their own houses by a system of instalment
purchase are available from various sources, including building societies,
insurance companies, industrial and provident societies and local authorities.
Local authority mortgage lending has been sharply reduced (from £636
million in England and W ales in 1975 to ^152 million in 1976), and building
societies, the most important of the lending agencies, have agreed with the
Government to fill the gap by accepting a proportion of applications from
people nominated by local authorities.
Building societies (see also p. 347) not build houses themselves but
provide long-term loans on the security of property bought for owner-
occupation. They usually advance up to 80 per cent of their valuation of a
house but it is possible to borrow up to too per cent with the help of an
appropriate guarantee. Loans are normally repayable over periods of 20 or 25
years (up to 30 or 35 years in certain circumstances) by equal monthly instal¬
ments to cover capital and interest. The average price in Britain of all houses
mortgaged to building societies in 1976 was about £12,700; houses in London
and the south-east of England cost some 22 per cent more than the national
average. In 1976 the societies advanced some £6,134 million.
Owner-occupiers are entitled to tax relief on their mortgage interest payments
arising on up to £25,000 of their mortgages (on one house only) and in 1976-77
this amounted to about £1,100 million. An alternative form of assistance is the
option mortgage scheme, designed to help those with smaller incomes. It
allows the borrower to receive, instead of tax relief, a subsidy which has the
effect of reducing the rate of interest on the loan. Assistance under this
scheme in Great Britain amounted in 1976-77 to £136 million. There is an
associated option mortgage guarantee scheme, whereby mortgage loans of up
to too per cent of the valuation of a house (not exceeding £14,000) may be
made to those participating. Other ways of helping people with lower incomes
to become owner-occupiers include a scheme which allows those buying
homes for the first time, subject to certain conditions, to defer part of their
mortgage payments in the first five years until the eleventh and subsequent
years; and ‘half and half’ schemes recently pioneered by some local authorities
under which initially a mortgage is required for only half the value of a house
and a rent is paid in respect of the other half. The Government proposes to
introduce legislation providing for new ‘savings bonus and loans’ schemes to
help first-time house-buyers. These would include an element of bonus,
related to savings, payable at the time of house purchase, and a loan of up to
£500, interest-free for the first five years.
For building in the private sector the National House Building Council
(NHBC) sets standards and enforces them by inspection and certification.
Almost all new private houses are covered by the council’s scheme which
carries a ten-year guarantee against major structural defects. A two-year
guarantee is also given against faulty workmanship. Most lenders will not
grant mortgages on a new house unless it is covered by a NHBC certificate.
Public housing authorities in Britain own some 6-6 million houses and flats
and in 1976 completed over 147,000 new dwellings. The number of homes
owned by each authority varies widely, some having a stock of well over 100,000.
Local authorities in Great Britain meet the capital costs of new house con¬
struction by raising loans on the open market or by borrowing from the Public
Works Loan Board. Current expenditure, including maintenance and
176
BRITAIN 1978: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
management costs and loan interest and repayments, is met from rents,
supplemented by subsidies from the Government and (particularly in Scot¬
land) from the rates. Local authorities are required to charge their tenants
reasonable rents (which keep a balance between the interests of tenants and
ratepayers) without making a profit. Subsidies for public housing in England
during 1976-77 totalled £1,233 million (including rent rebates, payable to
poorer tenants to assist in meeting rents of accommodation suited to their
needs).
Supplementary subsidies are available to assist local authorities with slum
clearance.
Tenants
Construction
and Design
In selecting tenants for new or vacant dwellings, local authorities normally
give preference to families living in overcrowded or unsatisfactory conditions,
but they are free to allocate homes according to their own schemes. Authori¬
ties normally establish waiting lists and treat applicants (outside priority
categories) in order of application; some require applicants to fulfil residence
qualifications before they are accepted on waiting lists.
Although a number of authorities employ direct labour to build houses, most
building is undertaken by private firms under contract. Some authorities work
in consortia to make the best use of industrialised systems.
Dwellings are constructed to meet the needs of different sizes of household.
More than a quarter are of the single bedroom type suitable for smaller house¬
holds including the elderly, but the majority are designed for families and
have two or three bedrooms, one or two living-rooms and a kitchen, bath¬
room and lavatory. Public housing in Britain is built to a high minimum
standard. In England and Wales, for example, some 89 per cent of new houses
built for local authorities in 1975 had central heating, and the average floor
area of houses to accommodate five people was 88’6 square metres (954 square
feet): the average building cost was £7,984.
Privately . During the last quarter of a century there has been a steady decline in Great
Rented Housing Britain in the number of rented dwellings available from private landlords
(including tied accommodation)—from nearly 52 per cent of the housing
stock in 1951 about 15 per cent (3 million) in 1976. Major factors in
this decline have been the increased demand for owner-occupation, the
greater availability of public rented housing, and the operation of rent
restriction. Privately rented dwellings form a high proportion of Britain’s
older housing, most landlords being individuals with limited holdings;
some rented housing is provided by larger property owners, including
property companies.
Most privately rented dwellings are subject to rent restriction. Tenants
have a wide degree of security of tenure, and eviction from any dwelling (with¬
out a court order) and harassment of occupiers are serious offences. Tenants
with low incomes and/or high rents are eligible for assistance with their rent
under a national scheme of rent allowances which is operated by local authori¬
ties and financed mainly by government subsidies.
There are three forms of rent restriction: control, regulation and the fixing
of a reasonable rent by a rent tribunal. Controlled rents (which apply to
dwellings of low rateable value where the tenant has lived continuously since
before 195?) are fixed, and may be increased only to an extent which reflects
expenditure by the landlord on improvements and repairs. However, if a
controlled dwelling reaches a satisfactory standard the landlord may transfer
it to the alternative system of rent regulation, which applies generally to
HOUSING
I??
privately rented accommodation, other than in the luxury or near-luxury class,
except for accommodation where the landlord lives on the same premises. In a
regulated tenancy a ‘fair rent’ is fixed by independent rent officers, at the
request of the landlord, the tenant, or both; if the rent officer’s decision is
objected to by the landlord or the tenant it is referred to a rent assessment
committee. Once fixed, the rent is registered and not normally reviewed for
at least three years. Since the system was introduced by the Rent Act of 1965
(and extended in 1974 to furnished accommodation let by non-resident
landlords), 800,000 fair rents have been registered.
The third form of rent restriction applies to tenants with resident landlords
and tenants of a few other types of furnished accommodation who may refer
their tenancy agreements to a rent tribunal for determination of a reasonable
rent. Tribunals may grant tenants security of tenure for up to six months with
a possibility of further periods.
Since the early 1960s the Government has encouraged the growth of non-
profit-making housing associations and societies, which between them own
nearly 300,000 dwellings in Great Britain; some 16,000 were completed or
acquired in 1976.
Voluntary housing associations, set up to provide low-rent accommodation
for people in need, fulfil an increasingly important housing function. There
is a National Federation of Housing Associations, of which 2,200 associations
are members. A separate Scottish Federation of Housing Associations covers
124 housing associations operating in Scotland.
In order to qualify for government financial assistance in their house¬
building operations, associations and societies are required to register with the
statutory Housing Corporation. A register was opened in 1975 and contains
details of more than 2,000 associations. Rented dwellings owned by housing
associations come within the fair rent and rent allowance schemes.
In 1976 the Government accepted the recommendations of a working party
which advocated the encouragement of alternative forms of tenure on local
authority estates and within the housing association sector in order to give
occupiers a greater stake in the ownership or management of their homes.
The Housing Corporation is engaged in a pilot programme including co-
ownership and community leasehold schemes. The corporation has set up a
specialised unit, known as the Co-operative Housing Agency, to advise,
assist and finance housing co-operatives (schemes of collective ownership and
management).
Modernisation and conversion of substandard housing, with the help of
grants from public funds, has increasingly been encouraged as an alternative
to clearing and rebuilding and as a way of preserving a social environment
and of making more economic use of resources. This policy of improve¬
ment rather than redevelopment has been reinforced by the Government’s
decision to give priority to inner city regeneration. Financial assistance is
available for the improvement of individual dwellings or of whole areas of
older housing.
Since renovation grants were first introduced in 1949, some 3-3 million
dwellings in England and Wales and (since 1950) 440,000 in Scotland have
been improved with their aid; in 1976 house renovation grants were approved
for over 168,000 dwellings in Great Britain.
There are four types of renovation grant: improvement grants, for carrying
out improvements to a high standard or for conversion into flats; intermediate
I?8
BRITAIN 1978: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK

grants, for the provision of standard amenities and associated repairs; special
grants (not available in Scotland) for providing standard amenities in houses
of multiple occupation; and repairs grants, available only in ‘housing action
areas and general improvement areas’ (see below). The amount of the award
depends on the location of the dwelling: up to 75 per cent (sometimes 90 per
cent) of the eligible expense in housing action areas; 60 per cent in general
improvement areas; and 50 per cent elsewhere. A government contribution
amounting to 75 per cent (90 per cent in housing action and general improve¬
ment areas) of each grant is paid to the local authority.
In order to tackle systematically the improvement of whole areas of older
housing, local authorities in England and Wales have powers to declare
general improvement areas . The aim in these areas is to encourage owners
to improve their dwellings with the aid of grants, while the local authority
uses its comprehensive powers to improve the environment. The government
contributes half the local authority’s expenditure on environmental improve¬
ments on costs of up to £200 a dwelling. In places of special housing stress,
local authorities are empowered to declare housing action areas in which
preferential rates of renovation grant are payable for the improvement of
houses to a given standard. In both general improvement areas and housing
action areas compulsory powers are available to local authorities. By the end
of March 1977 there were 1,086 general improvement areas and 212 housing
action areas in England and Wales. There are broadly similar arrangements
in Scotland where, however, the term ‘general improvement area’ is not used
and where the ‘housing action area’ powers are available for areas in which at
least half the houses fail to meet prescribed physical standards.
In urban areas of Britain slum clearance and redevelopment have been major
features of housing policy. Since the mid-1950s about 3-3 million people have
been rehoused in England and Wales as a result of slum clearance programmes,
and during 1976 over 48,000 houses were demolished or closed. Clearance of
irredeemable slums is now almost at an end and greater emphasis is placed
on renewal and modernisation wherever possible. Local authorities receive
special financial assistance from the Government. In England and Wales this
is payable if they incur a loss on slum clearance operations; in Scotland a
subsidy is paid as a proportion of approved expenditure.
Housing authorities are obliged to see that other accommodation exists, or
can be provided by them, for people displaced by slum clearance. Owners of
land compulsorily acquired during slum clearance programmes receive as
compensation either the full market value or, if the land consists of unfit
houses, a sum based on the value of the cleared site; additional payments are,
however, made to most owner-occupiers of unfit houses to bring their com¬
pensation up to market value.
Northern Ireland has a serious housing problem. About 40 per cent of the
total stock of some 460,000 dwellings are in need of repair and improvement
and many of the 25,000 houses damaged in civil disturbances have been left
unoccupied. The worst affected area is the inner city of Belfast. A series of
new measures, similar to those introduced in England and Wales, was
brought into force in 1976, providing for the designation of housing action
areas and for priority to be given to improvement and rehabilitation in these
areas. In February 1977 a £130 million special programme for the rehabilita¬
tion of the inner area of Belfast, with emphasis on housing renewal, was
announced.
HOUSING
179
The Northern Ireland Department of the Environment is responsible for
housing policy in the Province and the Northern Ireland Housing Executive
for the provision and management of all public authority housing and for
dealing with unfit housing, whether publicly or privately owned. The
executive is helped and advised by the Northern Ireland Housing Council
representing all district councils. Under a new system of housing finance the
Department of the Environment makes an annual grant to the Housing
Executive based on the difference between the executive’s expenditure (as on
loan charges, management and maintenance) and income (from rents). The
executive s capital programmes for new building, redevelopment, restoration
and modernisation and lending for house purchase are subject to the depart¬
ment s approval, within approved public expenditure figures. The Depart¬
ment of the Environment exercises a statutory power of approval of rents of
all public sector housing. There is a rent rebate scheme, similar to that in
Great Britain, to help poorer tenants.
In the private sector, home ownership is encouraged by subsidies payable
by district councils for houses built for owner occupation or for letting;
while improvement grants are also available. During 1976 the amount of
grant was increased to 75 per cent. The introduction has been recommended
of a rent regulation system broadly similar to that in Great Britain for
unfurnished accommodation outside designated redevelopment areas and of
rent allowances for poorer tenants.
A Northern Ireland Committee of the National Federation of Housing
Associations encourages the development of housing associations, particu¬
larly to help the elderly, the handicapped and those living in older houses
which can be improved or rehabilitated.
10 The Churches
The Church of
England
Everyone in Britain has the right of religious freedom (in teaching, worship
and observance) without interference from the community or the state.
Churches and religious societies may own property, conduct schools, and
propagate their beliefs in speech and writing. There is no religious or denomi¬
national bar to the holding of public office.
Clergy of the established churches of England and Scotland work in
services administered by the state, such as the armed forces, national hospitals
and prisons, and are paid a salary by the state. Clergy of other denominations
are also appointed. Voluntary schools provided by any religious denomination
may be wholly or partly maintained from public funds.
There is no precise or uniform information about the number of church
adherents since no incjuines are made about religious beliefs in censuses^ or
other official returns, and each church adopts its own criteria in counting its
members. Membership figures in this chapter are therefore approximate.
The established Church of England’s relationship with the state is one of
mutual obligation—privileges accorded to the Church balanced by certain
duties which it must fulfil. The Sovereign must always be a member of the
Church, and promises to uphold it; Church of England archbishops, bishops
and deans are appointed by the Sovereign on the advice of the Prime Minister;
all clergy take an oath of allegiance to the Crown. The Church can regulate
its own worship. The two archbishops (of Canterbury and York), the bishops
of London, Durham and Winchester, and 21 other bishops (according to their
seniority as diocesan bishops) sit in the House of Lords. Clergy of the Church
(together with those of the Church of Scotland, the Church of Ireland and the
Roman Catholic Church) are not allowed to sit in the House of Commons.
The Church has two provinces: Canterbury, comprising 29 dioceses, and
^ork, 14 dioceses. The dioceses are divided into parishes, of which there are
some 14,260. The Archbishop of Canterbury is ‘Primate of All England’, and
the Archbishop of York Primate of England’. Of the population born and
resident in the two provinces (roughly 46 million), about 60 per cent are
baptised into the Church and some 20 per cent are confirmed members.
The central governing body, the General Synod, has both spiritual authority
and legislative and administrative powers; and bishops, clergy and lay
members are involved in decisions. Certain important issues must be referred
for the approval of the dioceses before being decided by the synod. Lay
members are associated with church government in the parishes through the
ancient office of churchwarden and the modern parochial church councils.
The General Synod is the centre of an administrative system dealing with
such matters as education, recruitment and training for the ministry, and
church work at home and overseas. It is concerned with church schools and
some independent schools; church colleges of education; theological colleges;
and establishments for training women in pastoral work.
The Church has its own courts whose jurisdiction today extends only to
matters of purely ecclesiastical concern.
In Northern Ireland, recent full censuses have contained an optional question about
people s religious professions.

THE CHURCHES l8l
Church finance is administered locally by the parishes and the dioceses,
with contributions to a central fund for the maintenance of central services,
including capital expenditure on training and theological colleges and grants
for training candidates for ordination. The state makes no direct financial
contribution to church expenses. The Church’s endowment income is mainly
administered by the Church Commissioners, the body largely responsible for
the payment of clergy stipends and pensions.
The Anglican Communion comprises 25 autonomous provinces in Britain and
overseas and three regional councils overseas with a total membership of about
67 million. In the British Isles, there are four provinces: the established
Church of England and the unestablished Church in Wales, the Episcopal
Church in Scotland, and the Church of Ireland.
Every ten years (the next meeting is in 1978) the Lambeth Conference
meets for unofficial consultation between all Anglican bishops: presided over
by the Archbishop of Canterbury, it has no executive authority, but enjoys
great prestige, and its findings on doctrine, discipline, relations with other com¬
munions, and attitudes to political and social questions are widely studied.
The Anglican Consultative Council—an assembly of laymen and clergy as well
as bishops which meets every two years—is designed to provide consultations
within the Anglican Communion and to serve as an instrument of common
action. The council next meets in 1979.
The Church of Scotland has a presbyterian form of government. Its status as
the national church derives from the Treaty of Union 1707 and the Church of
Scotland Act 1921 which confirmed its complete freedom in all spiritual
matters. It appoints its own officers, and its decisions on questions of doctrine
and discipline are not subject to parliamentary discussion or modification.
All ministers have equal status, each of some 2,000 churches being governed
locally by the Kirk Session, consisting of the minister and the elected elders
of the church; above the Kirk Session is the Court of the Presbytery, then the
Court of the Synod, and finally the General Assembly, consisting of elected
ministers and elders, which meets annually under the presidency of an elected
moderator who serves for one year. The Sovereign is represented at the
General Assembly by the Lord High Commissioner.
The training for the ministry (to which women may be admitted) has given
the Church a high reputation for scholarship and has in turn influenced the
standard of education in Scotland. The adult communicant membership of
the Church of Scotland is estimated at over 1 million.
The phrase ‘Free Churches’ is commonly used to describe the ‘nonconformist’
churches of England (which dissent from certain practices of the established
church and, generally speaking, have distinctive convictions regarding organi¬
sation and worship) and Protestant churches in other parts of Britain (apart
from the established Church of Scotland). Certain other churches and religious
associations have links with the main Free Churches.
The Methodist Church, the largest of the Free Churches with some 558,000
adult full members, originated in the eighteenth century following the evan¬
gelical revival by John Wesley, and is nowadays based on a 1932 union of most
of the separate Methodist Churches. The Methodist Churches which did not
join the union include the Independent Methodists (5,200 members) and the
Wesleyan Reform Union (with some 4,400 members).
The United Reformed Church, with some 180,000 members, was formed
in 1972 when the Congregational Church in England and Wales (the oldest
182
BRITAIN 1978: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
The Roman
Catholic Church
Jewry
community of dissenters in Britain) and the Presbyterian Church of England
merged—the first transdenominational union of churches in Britain since the
Reformation in the sixteenth century.
The Baptists are nearly all grouped in associations of churches, most of
which belong to the Baptist Union of Great Britain and Ireland (formed in
1813), with a total membership of about 182,000; in addition there are separate
Baptist Unions for Scotland, Wales and Ireland and other Baptist churches.
Among the other Free Churches are the Presbyterian Church in Ireland
(with nearly 125,000 regular communicants in Northern Ireland); the Pres¬
byterian (or Calvinistic Methodist) Church of Wales, which arose from the
revivalist movement led in 1735 Howell Harris and now numbers about
94,000; the Union of Welsh Independents; the Free Church of Scotland; the
United Free Church of Scotland; the Free Presbyterian Church of Scotland;
the Reformed Presbyterian Church of Scotland; the Reformed Presbyterian
Church of Ireland; and the Non-Subscribing Presbyterian Church of Ireland.
Other Protestant denominations include: the Unitarian and Free Christian
Churches; the Churches of Christ (known also in the United States of
America as Disciples of Christ), which have been an organised community
in Britain since early in the nineteenth century; the British Province of the
Moravian Church, which is an international missionary church; the Free
Church of England (or Reformed Episcopal Church), which was formed in
1844 as a direct result of the Oxford Movement; and the Congregational
Federation, formed from Congregational churches which did not enter the
United Reformed Church. The Society of Friends (Quakers)—with over
20,000 members in Britain—came into being in the middle of the seventeenth
century under the leadership of George Fox and works for peace and the relief
of suffering in many parts of the world.
The Salvation Army, founded in Britain in 1865, has since spread to 82
other countries and has a strength of about 2 million. Within Britain it has
some 100,000 active members operating from more than 1,000 centres of
worship. Believing in a very practical expression of Christian concern, the
Salvation Army has 209 centres to help people in need.
There are also a number of other religious organisations with churches or
assemblies in Britain, including the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day
Saints (the Mormon Church); and the Christian Scientists with some 300
branch churches and societies in the British Isles.
The Roman Catholic hierarchy in England and Wales, which became tem¬
porarily extinct during the sixteenth century, was restored in 1850; the Scottish
hierarchy became extinct in the early seventeenth century and was restored in
1878. There are now 6 Roman Catholic provinces in Great Britain, each under
an archbishop, 26 episcopal dioceses, and some 3,000 parishes. In Northern
Ireland, there are 9 dioceses, some of which have territory partly in the Irish
Republic. It is estimated that there are some 4-2 million adherents (including
children) to the Roman Catholic faith in the whole of Britain.
The Roman Catholic Church attaches great importance to the education of
its children and requires its members to try to bring up their children in the
Catholic faith. Many schools for Catholic children are staffed by members of
the religious orders who also undertake other social work such as nursing,
child care, and the conduct of homes for old people.
Jews first settled in England at the time of the Norman conquest, but the
community in Britain dates from 1656; consisting of some 410,000 people,

including both Sephardi (originally from Spain and Portugal) and Ashkenazi
(from Germany and Eastern Europe), it has become one of the largest
groups of Jews in Europe. The community is divided into two schools
of thought—the Orthodox, to which about 80 per cent of practising Jews
belong; and the Reform, which originated in 1840 and was followed in 1901 by
the Liberal Jewish movement. The Chief Rabbi is the head of the largest group
(Ashkenazi) within Orthodox Jewry; the Haham is the head of the Sephardi
group. Jewish congregations in Britain number about 450. Jewish denomina¬
tional schools are attended by about one in five Jewish children.
Immigrants to Britain from Commonwealth and foreign countries have estab¬
lished centres of worship, especially in London, for their own communities.
Among the Christian communities represented are Orthodox, Lutheran and
Reformed Churches of various European countries and the Armenian Church.
The principal non-Christian communities in Britain, apart from the Jews,
are the Muslims, Buddhists, Hindus and Sikhs. It is estimated that there are
nearly 1 million Muslims in Britain; there are mosques or Islamic centres
in London, Birmingham, Manchester, Cardiff, Glasgow and in many
other large cities. The community’s headquarters are at the London
Central Mosque and Islamic Cultural Centre. The Buddhist Society has its
headquarters in London, with a Shrine Room and a Buddhist library claimed
to be one of the finest in Europe; there are also Shrine Rooms in the two
Viharas in London, one of which is run by Thai monks and supported by the
Thai Government. In Scotland there is a Shrine Room at the Tibetan Centre.
Hindu and Sikh temples have been established in many areas where Asian
immigrants have settled.
The British Council of Churches, with representatives or observers from all
the main Christian churches in the British Isles, facilitates common action
and seeks to further Christian unity. It works with the Conference of Mis¬
sionary Societies of Great Britain and Ireland.
The Free Church Federal Council (which has a concordat with the British
Council of Churches) comprises most of the Free Churches in England and
Wales. It promotes unity and joint action among the Free Churches and is a
channel for communication with central and local government.
The permanent Anglican-Roman Catholic Commission explores points of
possible unity between the two communions.
The Anglican and the main Free Churches in the British Isles also participate
in the World Council of Churches (of which the British Council of Churches
is an associated national council) which links together some 250 churches in
over 80 countries for co-operation and the study of common problems. The
Council of Christians and Jews works for better understanding among members
of the two religions and deals with problems in the social field.
The New English Bible, a modern English translation completed in 1970,
is the result of co-operation among many Christian churches.
The Sharing of Church Buildings Act 1969 enables agreements to be made
by two or more churches for the sharing of church buildings.
11 The National Economy
Britain has a mixed economy, nationalised industries accounting for more than
one-tenth of the national product and about one-fifth of total fixed investment.
Manufacturing industry accounts for about 28 per cent of total domestic
income and services1 for 46 per cent. International trade is of great importance
and exports of goods and services represent about 32 per cent of gross domestic
product. Britain ranks fifth in world trade (after the United States, the Federal
Republic of Germany, Japan and France) and accounts for 6 per cent of total
trade between the market economies. It takes over 6 per cent of the world’s
exports of primary products, and contributes about 9 per cent to the main
manufacturing countries’ exports of manufactured goods. It is among the
world’s largest exporters of aerospace products, motor vehicles, electrical
equipment, finished textiles, and most types of machinery, and is one of the
world’s largest importers of agricultural products, raw materials and semi¬
manufactures.
With abundant resources of coal and the discovery and exploitation of
North sea oil and gas, Britain is expected to become self-sufficient in energy by
1980 with substantial benefits to the balance of payments through the reduction
of oil imports. The potential balance of payments effect of British production
of oil in 1978 has been estimated at £3,400 million (1976 prices). Other eco¬
nomic effects of the offshore oil industry include the growing revenues accruing
to the Government through taxation, the new jobs created, and the stimulus
provided for the development and sales of highly specialised equipment and
services.
A high level of agricultural productivity enables Britain to provide just over
half the food it needs from its own soil, although only 2^7 per cent of the working
population are engaged in agriculture—a lower proportion than in any other
major industrial country.
Britain earns overseas currency by exports of (mainly) manufactured goods
and by invisible transactions—earnings on overseas investment, travel, civil
aviation, British-owned shipping, and financial, banking, insurance and other
services. It accounts for over 11 per cent of international invisible trade, more
than any country except the United States.
The significant contribution made to export earnings by invisibles is in large
measure a reflection of Britain’s position as a major financial centre. Its banks,
insurance underwriters and brokers and other financial institutions provide
worldwide financial services. The City of London contains perhaps the most
comprehensive and advanced capital market in the world.
ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT
Earlier As a result of the Industrial Revolution’ during the eighteenth and nineteenth
History centuries (when a series of inventions led to a complete change in the character
of production), Britain emerged as the first great industrial nation and as a
pioneer of new methods in transport, communications and technology. It
Services in this context cover transport, communication, distributive trades, insurance,
banking, finance and business services, public health and education, and other services
excluding public administration, defence and ownership of dwellings.
The Second
World War
and After
THE NATIONAL ECONOMY 185
occupied a leading position as world manufacturer, merchant, carrier, banker
and investor, and its fast-growing economy supported a rapidly increasing
population. In the period from 1870 to 1890 British industry had a clear lead
over that of other countries. Between 1890 and 1914, industrial competition
from Europe and North America grew, but its effects on Britain’s export
industries, particularly cotton textiles and coal, were offset by a number of
factors including the rise in world trade and the returns on Britain’s large over¬
seas investments.
Following the first world war Britain’s older industries met increasing com¬
petition, for example, in coal and iron and steel from other European countries
and in textiles from some eastern countries where labour was cheaper. The
difficulties were increased by the world economic depression which began in
1929 and the associated attempts by many countries to reduce imports. The
result in Britain, as in many other countries, was heavy unemployment.
After 1932 levels of production and employment rose. The decade saw a
strong expansion in the vehicles, electrical, chemical and aircraft industries,
while the construction of 3 million houses brought about a large growth in the
building and ancillary industries.
During the second world war (1939-45) rapid and far-reaching re-orientation
of the economy towards the war effort was secured by central planning. The
Government involvement in the economy which this implied has remained,
in a modified form, a permanent feature of the British economic system.
In spite of generous aid from the United States and Canada, the war ran
down British domestic capital by about £3,000 million, through shipping
losses, bomb damage, and arrears of industrial maintenance and replacements.
Some £1,000 million worth of overseas investments were sold, nearly half in
North America, and new external debts of £3,000 million were accumulated,
while exports were greatly reduced.
After the war rationing and other controls were relaxed gradually as civil
production expanded and trade recovered. Quantitative restrictions on most
imports were gradually removed, exchange controls on transactions between
the sterling area and the rest of the world were also for the most part lifted, and
convertibility of sterling on current account was introduced for non-residents.
The period after 1945 was one of rising production and, until 1970, a low level
of unemployment (generally 2-5 per cent or lower); but economic growth,
which averaged 2 to 3 per cent up to 1971, was slower than in most other western
European countries. There were also certain persistent economic problems,
particularly the periodic difficulties with the balance of payments. In spite of
the contribution from invisibles, there were substantial deficits on current
account in a number of years.
In the 1960s successive governments sought to deal with these problems
in a number of ways, sometimes restraining the growth in home demand and
implementing policies designed to hold down rises in incomes and prices. Fol¬
lowing the devaluation of sterling in 1967, from $2-80 to $2'40=£i, exports
recovered, leading to a substantial surplus on visible trade and a record current
account surplus by 1971.
In 1973, the economy achieved an annual growth rate of about 5 per cent in
response to government policies introduced from 1971 onwards. However,
with the onset of the world energy crisis towards the end of 1973, the growth
rate began to slow down. During 1974 the world economy entered a phase of
recession, caused mainly by accelerating inflation and the large increase in the
cost of oil.
BRITAIN 1978: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Recent The main impact of the recession on the British economy came in 1975, rather
Developments later than in many other countries. The Government has introduced a number
of policies directed towards three integrated aims: to reduce the rate of inflation
to the levels of Britain s main trading competitors; to achieve export-led
growth based on the strengthening of manufacturing industry; and to maintain
overseas confidence in sterling.
Measures The relatively rapid acceleration of inflation in Britain from 1970 until mid-
Against 1975 was due first to sharp increases in world prices of food and raw materials
Inflation (especially oil) which Britain must import in large quantities, and secondly to
very high rates of pay settlements from mid-1974, which led to substantial
increases in labour costs. In the last 30 years successive governments have
adopted policies (including statutory controls of prices or wages or of both) to
slow down the rate of inflation. Since the present Government took office early
in 1974, counter inflation policy has been within the framework of the ‘social
contract’ between the Labour Party and the Trades Union Congress (TUC)
which involves a wide-ranging understanding on economic and social matters.
The Labour Party originally accepted the need to maintain free collective
wage bargaining without statutory control, to control prices, to help the lower
paid and pensioners and to aim at full employment; while the TUC acknow¬
ledged that, in the absence of a statutory incomes policy, trade unions have
loyalties not only to their own members but to other members of the com¬
munity, and should therefore moderate their pay demands.
A voluntary limit on pay increases of £6 a week with no increases for those
earning more than £8,500 a year was universally observed in the period 1975-76
and the rate of inflation was reduced from 26-9 per cent to 12-9 per cent. A
second stage, running from 1st August 1976 to 31st July 1977, provided for
an average 4-5 per cent limit on pay increases.
The inflation rate rose again in the second half of 1976 as the effects of
poor harvests and of sterling depreciation began to work through into the
retail price index. By mid-1977 however the price level was benefiting from
the improved performance of sterling from the end of 1976, and the under-
lying rate of inflation started to fall again. Both the Government and the
TUC recognised that the period after July 1977 should bring an orderly
return to normal collective bargaining. The TUC published guidelines
stating that negotiators should continue to observe a 12-month interval
between pay settlements. This was endorsed by the Government which
urged that the general level of pay settlements after 31st July should be
moderate enough to secure that the national increase in earnings was no more
than 10 per cent in the next year.
To help ease the effects of inflation at a time of general restraint on pay
increases, income tax cuts were introduced in the April 1976 Budget, the
larger part of them being made conditional upon a satisfactory pay agreement
with the TUC for the second stage. In the March 1977 Budget and in July
I977 tax> price and employment measures were announced which were
designed to ensure that living standards did not generally fall as a result of
restraint after 31st July 1977, the help being concentrated especially on
families with children and those with low earnings. The attack on inflation
has also benefited from cuts in the planned levels of public expenditure
which the Government has kept under strict control by making extensive use
of cash limits (see p. 333). Cuts announced in July and December 1976
brought planned expenditure programmes for 1977-78 and 1978-79 lower
in real terms than in the two previous years.
THE NATIONAL ECONOMY
Price Control
Money Supply
Other Measures
187
A reaffirmation of continuing co-operation on economic policy and a
statement of priorities for the next three years was endorsed by the TUC-
Labour Party Liaison Committee (see p. 321) in July 1976.
Since 1973 a strict system of price control has been operated by the Price
Commission, an independent statutory agency set up under the Counter-
Inflation Act 1973* The controls are set out in the Price Code, drawn up by the
Government and amended from time to time as appropriate. Generally speak¬
ing the Price Code is designed to ensure that any price increases are fully
justified on grounds of unavoidable rises in costs. In addition, from August
1977 the Price Commission has been enlarged and given new powers to mount
specific investigations. Individual prices can be frozen by the commission
for up to a year.
In controlling the rate of monetary expansion the Government is concerned
to ensure that industry’s financial requirements are safeguarded against other
demands (including those of the public sector), and that monetary growth is
prevented from adding to inflationary pressures.
In the autumn of 1976, fears grew that the money supply was expanding
at too rapid a rate; these fears interacted with the disturbances on the foreign
exchange markets. To restore confidence in the authorities’ determination
and ability to maintain control over the money supply, a series of measures
were taken including the raising of the minimum lending rate to the record
level of 15 per cent. The subsequent expectations of falls in interest rates led
to substantial sales of government debt which helped to bring the growth of
money supply back under control, and interest rates fell sharply in early 1977.
As part of the agreement with the IMF in December 1976 (see below), the
Government undertook to limit domestic credit expansion (DCE) to £9,000
million in 1976-77 and to £7,700 million in 1977-78. These aims were con¬
sidered to be consistent with money supply (sterling M3) growth in a range of
9-13 per cent in both years. In the event, both DCE and sterling M3 were
below the limits set for 1976-77. (Sterling M3 comprises notes and coins in
circulation together with United Kingdom residents’ sterling deposits.)
The Government’s industrial strategy, introduced in 1975 (see p. 207), aims
to improve the prospects of some 40 sectors of manufacturing industry. The
resources released by the restrictions on public expenditure are expected to
help investment and exports. Measures have also been taken to slow down the
rising rate of unemployment (see p. 314).
With growing pressure on the exchange rate in the first half of 1976 and
substantial withdrawals of official sterling balances by overseas governments
in the second quarter, the Government drew a first credit tranche from the
International Monetary Fund (IMF) and obtained a stand-by credit of
$5,300 million from a group of industrialised countries (drawings on which
were repaid in December). The exchange rate came under pressure again
in late 1976, minimum lending rate was raised, and an application made
to the IMF for a stand-by which would make available Britain’s remaining
credit tranches of $3,900 million. The Government announced measures in
December intended, among other things, to reduce public sector borrowing
requirement in 1977-78 and 1978-79, mainly through public expenditure
cuts. At the same time it announced specific limits for domestic cr*edit expan¬
sion. In support of the Government’s economic policies the IMF approved
Britain’s request for a stand-by credit of $3,900 million in January 1977; it is
BRITAIN 1978: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
available for drawing during 197? an(^ I97^ and will help to repay external
debts and to maintain more stable conditions in the sterling exchange market.
An agreement between Central Bank Governors in Basle on the setting up
of a new facility amounting to $3,000 million for the official sterling balances
was announced in January 1977 (see p. 365). A seven-year $1,500 million loan
from a syndicate of banks in the Federal Republic of Germany, North America
and Britain was arranged to strengthen the reserves further on a secure
medium-term basis. Final repayment is to be made in 1984.
By the autumn of 1977 unemployment was continuing to rise slowly
while output and investment showed signs of decline. However major
improvements were seen in the balance of payments, associated with the
growing contribution of North Sea oil (then supplying about half British
requirements) and a continuing large surplus on invisibles. The increase in
earnings was kept to only 8*8 per cent over the second stage of the pay
policy and the annual rate of inflation had begun to fall. Increased confidence
in sterling was shown by rises in the reserves to record levels and upwards
pressure on the exchange rate; as a consequence interest rates fell, minimum
lending rate from a peak of 15 per cent in October 1976 to 6 per cent in
September 1977.
ECONOMIC MANAGEMENT
The objectives of the Government in managing the economy are to achieve a
steady and sustainable rate of growth, a high level of employment and a more
equitable distribution of income. This it attempts to do by encouraging invest¬
ment, output and exports within the constraints imposed by maintaining a
satisfactory balance of payments and reducing the rate of inflation. Its policies
are carried out by the main government departments with economic responsi¬
bilities on a national scale: the Treasury, the Departments of Trade, Industry,
Employment, Energy, Prices and Consumer Protection, the Environment,
and Transport, and the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food.
An important advisory body on general economic policy is the National
Economic Development Council, which brings together representatives of
government, management and trade unions under the chairmanship of the
Prime Minister. It has an independent but publicly financed secretariat and
has established a number of economic development committees dealing with
different industries and services and different aspects of industry. An industrial
strategy (see p. 207) was launched at the NEDC in i975‘ Other bodies respon¬
sible for advice on specific aspects of policy include the Monopolies and
Mergers Commission (on action to prevent the abuse of monopoly power, see
p. 213) and the Office of Manpower Economics (see p. 325).
On matters of major public policy such as the broad economic strategy, and
problems such as inflation, the Government makes known its purposes, and
keeps in touch with developments throughout the economy, by means of
informal and continuous links with the chief industrial, financial, labour and
other interests. Final responsibility for the broad lines of economic policy
rests with the Cabinet. For regional economic planning see Chapter 8.
In Britain’s mixed economy, direct state intervention in industry and com¬
merce (as well as in social, cultural and other affairs) is often effected through
special public corporations set up, usually by statute, to deal with a particular
activity. Though not part of a government department, the corporations are
under varying degrees of public control. Among the largest nationalised
THE NATIONAL ECONOMY
189
industries are the National Coal Board, British Gas and the electricity in¬
dustry ; the British Steel Corporation; the Post Office; British Rail; the National
Freight Corporation; British Airways; and the National Bus Company. These
industries and services, which together employ about 8 per cent of all em¬
ployees, are described in their relevant sections. The public sector as a whole
employs a little over a quarter of the working population.
Recent developments have included the nationalisation of the shipbuilding
and aircraft industries and the establishment of the British National Oil
Corporation through which the Government exercises its participation rights
in the exploitation of Britain’s offshore oil resources.
The managing boards and staffs of the nationalised industries are not gener¬
ally civil servants and although accountable to Parliament for their actions
in a variety of ways, it is they and not the ministers of the sponsoring depart¬
ments who are responsible for management. Certain of the nationalised indus¬
tries are self-supporting; others receive Exchequer grants to help them to carry
out duties with which they have been charged.
The extent to which the responsible minister has power over the working of
the boards which have been set up to run the nationalised industries varies
from industry to industry, but two features are common to almost all of them.
First, the minister appoints (and may dismiss) the chairman and members of
each board, and, secondly, he has power to give general directions as to how
the industry should be run, but does not interfere in day-to-day management.
It is usually also laid down that the board shall give to the minister any informa¬
tion, statistics and financial accounts which he may require. In practice, as the
responsible minister is kept fully informed and major policy decisions are
reached in consultation with him, there is very seldom occasion for him to issue
a formal directive.
The minister also has financial powers and responsibilities. The usual statu¬
tory requirement is that the board is required to conduct its business so that
receipts at least balance outgoings over a period. However, financial targets
have been agreed by the Government with the different industries (or are under
discussion) ranging from 15-5 per cent gross return on capital employed to
‘breaking even’ after interest and depreciation have been allowed for. In addi¬
tion the industries are expected to apply a test discount rate of 10 per cent for
new investment. The responsible minister is usually empowered, subject to
Treasury approval, to say what shall be done with any surplus revenues which
may accrue. As regards finance for capital expenditure, the present system is
that finance which cannot be met from internal sources is provided mainly by
interest-bearing loans from the Exchequer and by borrowing from abroad.
It is usual for the minister responsible for each nationalised industry to be
required by statute to take steps to see that the interests of the industry’s
customers are protected. This is generally done by the establishment of repre¬
sentative consumers’ councils to consider complaints and suggestions, and
to advise the board or the minister on the changes they think desirable.
Government policy towards the nationalised industries is subject to the
approval of Parliament. Opportunities for parliamentary discussion are
afforded by debates, including debates on their annual reports and accounts,
and by answers to parliamentary questions, which, in principle, are admissible
only if concerned with policy rather than details of administration. A House of
Commons Select Committee on the Nationalised Industries examines their
reports and accounts. (Its powers of investigation also include several other
public corporations such as the Independent Broadcasting Authority, Cable
and Wireless Limited and certain activities of the Bank of England.)

NATIONAL INCOME AND EXPENDITURE
The following sections sketch briefly the structure and disposal of Britain’s
national income in recent years.
Output In 1976 Britain’s gross national product at factor cost (the measure of the total
value of goods and services produced at home and net income from abroad) is
estimated to have amounted to £110,259 million. After allowing for price
changes, the increase over the ten years since 1966 was nearly 23*1 per cent.

Over a quarter of total output can be attributed to manufacturing industry.
Expanding industry groups in recent years (in relation to the economy as a
whole) have been most of the services, particularly insurance, banking and
finance, public administration and health and educational services. Agri¬
culture, forestry and fishing have accounted for a small and slowly declining
share. The relative contribution of the distributive trades has also declined.
Table 6 summarises the contribution of each industry group.
Table 7 shows the distribution of total supplies of goods and services in 1966,
1971 and 1976 at 1970 market prices, divided between personal consumption,
public expenditure on goods and services, investment and exports.
The main trends since 1966 are a fall in the proportion of total available out¬
put devoted to personal consumption and a significant rise in the proportion
devoted to exports.

b Excluding value of physical change in stocks and work in progress (£66 million in 1976).
Personal incomes before tax at current prices rose rapidly and fairly steadily
from £32,000 million in 1966 to £112,000 million in 1976. However, real
personal disposable income fell slightly between 1975 and 1976 (see p. 16).
Consumer expenditure amounted to 65 per cent of total pre-tax income in
1976 compared with 75 per cent in 1966. The difference is accounted for by a
higher incidence of both direct taxation and national insurance contributions
and by increased personal savings.
Income from employment in 1976 totalled £78,000 million and accounted for
about 70 per cent of total personal income (a slightly lower percentage than in
1966). The three other main sources of personal income were self-employment
(9 per cent), income from rent, dividends and interest (9 per cent), and grants
from general government (12 per cent).
The combined effect of taxation and transfer payments and benefits in kind
is to redistribute income on more egalitarian lines. According to studies by
the Central Statistical Office, the effect in 1975 was to raise the highest income

among the poorest fifth of households (that is, the income at the lowest quintile)
from 22 to 55 per cent of the median income of all households. Similar con¬
clusions about income redistribution were reached by the standing Royal Com¬
mission on the Distribution of Income and Wealth (see p. 318), in its fourth
report (see Bibliography, p. 440). Illustrating trends in income over a period

income recipients after tax from 177 per cent in 1949 to 14-3 per cent in
1973-74- The second report, on income from companies, shows that rather
more than one-third of dividends go indirectly to about 11 million members
of occupational pension schemes, 2-25 million taxpayers receiving occupational
pensions and 14 million taxpayers who save through life assurance.
A rise in the volume of consumers’ spending has been accompanied, in Britain
as in other advanced industrial countries, by changes in its pattern. The pro¬
portions of expenditure (at current prices) devoted to food, tobacco and clothing
have been falling while the proportions spent on housing, alcoholic drink, and
the running costs of motor vehicles have risen. (See Table 8.)
Current expenditure on goods and services by the central Government and
local authorities rose by about 29 per cent at 1970 market prices over the period
1966 to 1976 when it amounted to about 23-6 per cent of the gross domestic pro¬
duct (at current prices). The main cause of this increase was the continuing
growth of the social services, especially education. Defence has recently
accounted for a declining share of public expenditure on goods and services—
24 per cent in 1976 compared with 34 per cent in 1966 and 48 per cent in
1953-
THE NATIONAL ECONOMY
I93
In addition to their expenditure on goods and services, public authorities
transfer large sums to other sectors, mainly the personal sector, by way of
national insurance and other social security benefits, grants, and interest and
subsidies (see pp. 130 and 175). The Government also makes grants to local
authorities to finance about 55 per cent of their current expenditure.

Gross domestic fixed capital formation (total fixed investment) represents
about 20 per cent of the gross domestic product at factor cost. The total value
of fixed assets in Britain, valued at constant replacement cost, is estimated to
have increased by 16 per cent between 1966 and 1976 when their current
replacement value, net of depreciation, was some £385,000 million, of which
about two-thirds was accounted for by buildings and one-third by plant and
machinery, and vehicles.
Within the total of gross domestic fixed capital formation in 1976 (£9,724
million compared with £9,682 million in 1971 at constant 1970 prices) private
sector investment accounted for 11*5 per cent of the gross domestic product at
factor cost (12-6 per cent in 1971), general government for 4-5 per cent (5-4 per
cent) and public corporations for 4 per cent (3-8 per cent). The approximate
shares of industry groups in total fixed investment in 1976 were (1971 figures
in brackets): manufacturing, 17 per cent (21 per cent), gas, electricity and
water, 6 per cent (7 per cent), transport and communications, 10 per cent
(13 per cent), distributive trades, 6 per cent (5 per cent), dwellings, 19 per cent
(18 per cent), social and other public services, 14 per cent (16 per cent), and
other industries, 28 per cent (20 per cent). There is a marked cyclical pattern
in the flow of investment by manufacturing industry; it was at a peak in 1970
and 1974, fell in 1975 and 1976 but is expected to recover strongly in 1977 and
1978. Among the trends in recent years has been an increase in investment in
North Sea oil equipment.

BRITAIN 1978: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
THE EXTERNAL POSITION
In the years following devaluation in 1967 exports of goods and services
increased rapidly in real terms. Helped by a record surplus on current trans¬
actions of over £1,000 million in 1971, and by massive capital inflows, the
reserves stood at the high level of just over £2,740 million by the end of May
1972, after the repayment of all official short- and medium-term debt.
In 1972 the trade balance began to deteriorate; imports were swollen by the
rapid growth of domestic demand, and exports were affected by various factors
including the slower growth of world trade. This deterioration, together with
growing fears about inflation, led to a large outflow of short-term speculative
capital in June 1972, and the Government decided to allow the pound to float
and applied exchange control to transactions with the overseas sterling area
countries. The lower sterling exchange rate made Britain highly competitive,
and the volume of exports, which had not changed from 1971 to 1972,
increased by 14 per cent in 1973 and by 7 per cent in 1974. Nevertheless,’
mainly as a result of rising prices of imports, including oil, and despite the
positive invisible balance, there was a large deficit on the current account in
both 1973 and 1974. In 1975 the deficit on current account was reduced sub¬
stantially, as a lower level of activity in Britain and the rest of the world led
to import volume falling faster than export volume. There was a further im¬
provement in 1976, the result of a growing surplus on the invisibles account.
In future years increasing supplies of oil from the North Sea can be expected
to bring considerable advantage to the balance of payments (For details of
overseas trade and payments see Chapter 18.)
In 1971) a general international realignment of exchange rates was agreed at a
meeting held in the Smithsonian Institute in Washington, in which all the
main currencies were in effect revalued against the dollar. (The rates of ex¬
change fixed in that agreement are called Smithsonian parities.) As part of this
realignment, the sterling rate for the dollar moved up by just over 8^ per cent,
the new middle rate being $2'6o57i compared with the old par value of $2‘40.
In June 1972 sterling was allowed to float and over the next three years the
rate against the dollar fluctuated between $2-30 and $2-60; in 1975 the rate fell
to just over $2. Sterling came under pressure in 1976 (see p. 187) but recovered
somewhat towards the end of the year and in 1977. At the end of August 1977
the effective exchange rate index was 61‘9 (December 1971 = 100) and the
market rate was £1 = $174.
Five member countries of the European Community (Belgium, Denmark,
the Federal Republic of Germany, Luxembourg and the Netherlands) and
Norway maintain a scheme, usually called the ‘snake’, under which rates
between any two of their currencies cannot diverge from their cross parities
by more than 2J per cent. Britain, France, Italy and Sweden were formerly
members of the scheme.
The Committee of Twenty (representative of the major industrial and the
developing countries), which had been set up within the International Mone¬
tary Fund (IMF) framework, concluded its work on the reform of the inter¬
national monetary system in 1974. The committee agreed on a method of
valuation of the special drawing right (SDR—an international reserve asset)
for an interim period, recommended guidelines for the management of floating
exchange rates, and agreed on some principles of corrective action for countries
with balance of payments disequilibria.
In January 1976, at a meeting in Kingston, Jamaica, agreement was reached
THE NATIONAL ECONOMY
195
by the IMF s Interim Committee, subject to ratification, on revised IMF
Articles of Agreement, which incorporate many of the recommendations of the
Committee of Twenty. Provision has been made for a possible eventual return
to a par value system but meanwhile members may operate individual exchange
arrangements, subject to firm surveillance by the IMF. The articles, as revised,
facilitate the use of special drawing rights and substantially reduce the status
of gold by providing for the abolition of the official gold price and of gold
transactions between member countries and the IMF. The IMF’s gold hold¬
ings are, moreover, being gradually reduced; one-sixth is to be returned to
members, and a further sixth is being auctioned, the major proportion of the
proceeds from the auctions being used to finance a trust fund which has been
set up to provide medium-term balance of payments support to the poorest
developing countries.
Discussions on reform have been accompanied by measures designed to help
recycle oil funds and to assist the developing countries with the problems
caused for them by the increases in oil prices and the depression of world
trade. After the oil price increases, the IMF set up a borrowing agreement for
1974 (which was continued in I975)> known as the oil facility through which
countries could draw on funds lent mainly by the oil-producers. Although the
facility was not continued in 1976, the ordinary credit tranches of the IMF were
temporarily widened by 45 per cent (permanent increases in quotas have been
agreed upon but not yet ratified).
Other measures include a liberalisation of the Compensatory Financing
Facility which provides support for primary producing countries whose export
earnings decline temporarily. Since this liberalisation drawings under the
facility have increased dramatically.
With the likelihood of continuing large balance of payments deficits, both
as the counterpart to the surpluses of oil producing countries and also the
surpluses of some industrialised countries, the IMF has been giving urgent
consideration to ways of increasing the amount of balance of payments finance
it provides in order to supplement and support the lending activities of the
commercial banks. The Interim Committee agreed, at its April 1977 meeting
in Washington, that there was a need for an adequate increase in quotas. It also
recognised that there was an urgent need for a supplementary arrangement
which would enable the IMF to expand its financial assistance to members
whose payments imbalances are large in relation to their quotas. This arrange¬
ment would be financed by lines of credit from surplus countries.
Industry (mining and quarrying, manufacturing, construction and gas, elec¬
tricity and water) and distributive trades together account for more than half
of Britain’s gross domestic product, manufacturing for some 27-9 per cent and
distributive trades 9‘5 Per cent. About 30 per cent of Britain’s employed
labour force is engaged in manufacturing industry, while over 80 per cent of
Britain s visible exports consists of manufactured or semi-manufactured pro¬
ducts. This chapter describes the geographical distribution and structure of
industry and discusses some general industrial topics—such as trends in pro¬
duction and productivity, investment, the Government’s relations with
industry, regional development, fair trading and competition policy. It outlines
the major sectors of manufacturing industry, construction and distributive
and service trades. For the energy industries (coal, gas, petroleum, elec¬
tricity) non-fuel minerals and water supply see Chapter 13 and for the agri¬
culture, fisheries and forestry industries see Chapter 14.
ORGANISATION AND PRODUCTION
Location The following is a summary of how British industry is distributed through the
eight standard regions of England and in Wales, Scotland and Northern
Ireland.
Greater London London is Britain’s capital and main communication centre, and is one of the
and the South-East world’s most important financial centres. Lying at the head of ocean navigation
Region on the Thames estuary it is one of the world’s largest cities and largest ports,
though much deep-sea-going traffic has moved down-river to Tilbury docks.
It is the main centre in Britain of printing and the manufacture of clothing,
food and drink, furniture, materials for the arts, precision instruments and
many other specialised products. Small firms predominate in many of these
industries and the average size of manufacturing firms (particularly in the
central area) is well below the national average. London is also important,
especially in its outer ring, for light engineering, chemicals and consumer goods
and has some heavy engineering plants and a number of leading research
establishments. There has been in recent years, however, a considerable drop
in employment and population in London.
Towards the periphery of Greater London and in the surrounding Outer
Metropolitan Area, industry, particularly the electronics and consumer goods
industries, has expanded greatly; some of the largest aircraft plants are in these
areas, for example at Weybridge and Hatfield, as well as two of the four main
motor vehicle manufacturers at Dagenham, Luton and Dunstable. There are
other major motor vehicle manufacturing plants at Cowley, Oxford, some 50
miles north-west of London. Along the lower Thames and Medway estuaries
there are large oil refineries as well as some smaller shipyards, engineering
works and major concentrations of the paper and pulp and cement industries.
There are centres of manufacturing industry at Crawley, Basingstoke, in the
Medway towns and the Aldershot—Farnborough area. Heathrow and Gatwick
airports are also of major importance and are large employers.
A great part of the Channel coast eastwards from Southampton consists of
built-up areas, many of which are partly residential areas for people working in

West Midlands
London. Holiday resorts fringe the coast. Portsmouth is a naval port with some
shipbuilding and general manufactures. Southampton is one of Britain’s
leading ports for both passengers and freight; its industries include ship
repairing, oil refining, cable-making, electronics and synthetic rubber. Dover,
Folkestone and Newhaven are ferry ports.
Though famous for its tourism, leisure industries and agriculture, the south¬
west of England has a busy manufacturing sector. Bristol, the region’s admini¬
strative and commercial centre, is a leading port and the largest industrial city,
having tobacco, packaging materials, printing, aerospace, chocolate and metal
manufacture as well as a wide range of engineering and other industries; there
are extensive modern docks at Avonmouth, an industrialised suburb with
important basic chemicals and non-ferrous metal plants. Plymouth, with the
naval dockyard and electrical and other industries, is an important manu¬
facturing centre. The towns of Gloucester, Poole, Christchurch, Cheltenham
and Bath are major producers of machinery, instrumentation and other engineer¬
ing products. Swindon has vehicle, electrical and electronic engineering.
Chemical and engineering products are made at Yeovil, Taunton and Bridg¬
water. Clothing and other textile products and footwear are made at several
centres. In the Camborne, Redruth, Falmouth and St. Austell areas of Corn¬
wall there is china clay and tin mining, and machinery manufacture, ship
repairing and other forms of engineering.
Although the smallest of the regions East Anglia has been rapidly growing in
terms of both population and employment. A major contribution to this growth
has been made by the nine towns receiving overspill of population and industry
from London. The area is one of the most productive agricultural regions in the
world and this has provided a firm base for the growth of the food processing
industry, which is concerned mainly with canning, and more recently freezing
local produce. Cambridge is a major centre of research-based industry; Ipswich
and Peterborough are noted for diesel engines, agricultural machinery and
engineering generally and Norwich for footwear and food manufacture. The
east coast ports of Great Yarmouth and Lowestoft are important bases for
companies associated with natural gas exploitation in the North Sea.
This is the only landlocked region and it has a greater dependency on manu¬
facturing industry than any other region. However, more than three-quarters of
the land is still used for agriculture and includes some areas of great natural
beauty, particularly in the south and west. The main concentration of industry
is in the West Midlands metropolitan county which includes the districts of
Birmingham, Coventry, Dudley, Sandwell, Solihull, Walsall and Wolver¬
hampton. The economy is largely dependent upon the metal-using industries
and in particular on motor vehicle manufacture. Other notable industries are
mechanical and electrical engineering, machine tools, castings, tubes, locks,
jewellery, domestic metalware and rubber manufactures. The metropolitan
county also contains the new National Exhibition Centre, which is one of the
largest and most modern exhibition complexes in the world.
In north Staffordshire, a smaller conurbation centred upon Stoke-on-Trent
is the centre of the British pottery and china industry and the region’s major
coalmining area. Other industries are rubber and electrical products. Coal¬
mining is also important in the Cannock Chase and north Warwickshire areas.
Other important centres include Stafford, with heavy electrical and other
engineering; Worcester, mechanical engineering and pottery; Burton-on-
Trent, brewing and rubber; Kidderminster, carpets; and Rugby, electrical

engineering. Stratford-upon-Avon, the birthplace of William Shakespeare, is
an international tourist centre.
The two major new towns, Telford and Redditch, have large metal-based
industries.
Although some major industries are heavily concentrated in the East Midlands
(over 60 per cent of Britain s hosiery and knitwear, 40 per cent of its footwear
and more than 20 per cent of its coal) industry is well diversified. North Not-
tinghamshire and Derbyshire are traditional coalmining areas where produc¬
tivity rates are high. In the northern part of the region engineering is also
important. In Nottingham a high proportion of employment is in pharma¬
ceuticals, electronics, tobacco and bicycle manufacture. Nottingham lace is
famous throughout the world, but textiles and clothing are of more importance.
Derby is primarily an engineering town with aero-engines, rail rolling stock,
boilers and castings among a wide range of engineering products. The produc¬
tion of rayon is also of considerable importance. Agriculture is significant in
Lincolnshire as well as food processing and engineering, much of which pro¬
duces agricultural and constructional equipment. Lincoln has a substantial
engineering industry. Engineering is also a major industry in Leicestershire,
much of it supplying other local industries such as textiles and footwear.
Electrical engineering is of especial importance in Loughborough. Northamp¬
tonshire is famous for high quality footwear. In recent years light engineering,
much of it related to the motor and electronics industries, has expanded con¬
siderably. Corby has a large and fully integrated steel works.
The North-West comprises the metropolitan counties of Greater Manchester
and Merseyside and the counties of Lancashire and Cheshire. The Department
of Industry’s administration of this region extends also into parts of Cumbria
and Derbyshire. The region is one of the most highly industrialised in Britain.
Manchester is Britain s second most important commercial and financial
centre and an important port. It is one of the chief centres for electrical and
heavy engineering and for the production of a wide range of goods including
computers, electronic equipment, petrochemicals, clothing, dye-stuffs and
pharmaceuticals. Manchester’s traditional role as the centre for the Lancashire
textile industry is only a small part of its present-day activities.
The textile towns, while adapting to the decline of traditional textiles and to
increasing use of man-made fibres and moving into new textile products, such
as carpets, have seen engineering outgrow the textile industry. The largest
towns, Bolton, Stockport, Oldham, Blackburn, Preston, Rochdale, Burnley and
Bury, are diversified with such industries as paper-making, textile and electrical
machinery, light engineering and consumer durables, plastics, foods, chemicals,
nuclear process plant, electronics, aircraft and heavy commercial vehicles.
The Manchester Ship Canal, which carries a substantial volume of export
traffic, links Manchester and Merseyside. It passes through Warrington, with
its metal industries (such as wire-drawing), Widnes, Runcorn with the chemical
industry, and Ellesmere Port with its oil refinery installations, before reaching
the Mersey estuary. St. Helens, to the north of the canal, is famous for glass
manufacture. Liverpool, with its modernised dock system, is one of Britain’s
leading seaports and, after London, the largest centre for processing and con¬
verting imported foodstuffs and raw materials (grain milling, oils, fats and
tobacco, sugar refining and rubber products). The centre of economic activity
in Merseyside is still its port, but its industrial strength has moved from older
industries closely related to the port to the newer industries including motor
vehicles, electrical engineering, heavy industrial plant and chemicals.
INDUSTRY
I99
Yorkshire and
Humberside
Northern England
To the north of this industrial belt lies Blackpool and Lancaster with light
industries and chemicals and to the south, the Cheshire plain with agri¬
culture, while a variety of industries such as salt, chemicals, motor vehicles,
pharmaceuticals and rail engineering are located among the smaller towns.
The countryside lies close to most towns and the region contains some of
Britain’s most fertile farmland. There is a large tourist industry on the coast
and in historic towns, such as Chester and the four National Parks on or near
its boundaries. There are major airports at Liverpool and Manchester, a highly
developed rail system and one of the most advanced motorway networks in
Britain, providing good access throughout the region, and to the rest of the
country and continental Europe through the east coast ports.
Though some parts of Yorkshire and Humberside are heavily industrialised,
more than four-fifths of the region is open country.
The region’s industrial structure is diverse. About 70 per cent of Britain’s
worsted and woollen industry is located in West Yorkshire. Bradford is the
commercial centre of the wool trade. In addition there are strong sectors of
engineering, printing, textile machinery and carpets. The metropolitan
district of Leeds is an important commercial centre and also has a variety of
industries including men’s clothing and various engineering industries. In the
south, the steel centre based on Sheffield and Rotherham is noted for the manu¬
facture of high quality steels, tools and cutlery. Yorkshire’s coalfields are par¬
ticularly important and production is to be extended to the Selby area, where
major new reserves have been discovered. Doncaster, with tractor and nylon
manufacturing, and Barnsley are the largest towns on the coalfield where
dependence on steel and coal has been reduced by the introduction of new
industries in and around the major towns.
North Yorkshire is mainly agricultural but York, a leading tourist attraction,
is also noted for chocolate and confectionery manufacture. It is an important
railway centre, and has substantial railway workshops.
Kingston upon Hull is the principal industrial town in Humberside, which
is a major centre for maritime trade with ports at Grimsby, Immingham and
Goole in addition to Hull. Besides being important fishing ports, Hull and
Grimsby contain specialised food processing and cold storage facilities. The
British Steel Corporation’s plant at Scunthorpe is one of Britain’s largest steel
producers. Close by are chemical, fertiliser, oil refining, and food processing
plants. The north bank of the Humber contains a large proportion of Britain’s
caravan manufacturing industry.
The greater part of this region (the metropolitan county of Tyne and Wear and
the counties of Northumberland, Durham, Cleveland and Cumbria) is an area
of hills, lakes and moorland. The tourist industry is developing. Industrial
activity and the bulk of the population is concentrated in the eastern coastal
strip stretching from the coalfields north of the River Tyne southwards to the
River Tees, and to a lesser extent, on the western coastal strip of Cumbria.
The region is relatively more dependent than other parts of England on the
long-established heavy industries, notably coalmining, iron and steel manu¬
facture, shipbuilding and repairing and chemicals (the complex of chemical
plants on both banks of the Tees is probably the most extensive in Europe).
Europe’s largest steelmaking complex is being developed in the Teesside area.
New industries, however, with a broader technological base, have been suc¬
cessfully attracted to the region and the industrial structure is becoming more
diversified. Manufacture of electrical plant is a major industry. Other in¬
dustries include electric components, plastics, domestic appliances, pharma-
200

Scotland
ceuticals, machine tools, ropes, paint, glass, clothing and scientific instruments
as well as mining machinery, rolling mill plant and earth-moving equipment.
An aluminium smelter is operating on the Northumberland coast. Atomic
energy is important in Cumbria, with two nuclear power stations and other
installations, and considerable investment is taking place in the coalmining
industry to exploit large coal reserves below the sea bed off the Northumber¬
land and Durham coasts and to boost open-cast coal production. The region
is also involved in the North Sea oil programme. The new oil terminal at
Teesside will have a potential capacity of one million barrels a day of North
Sea oil. A major new reservoir at Kielder will, when completed, provide water
supplies for industry on Tyneside and Teesside.
Some two-thirds of the population (which totals 2-8 million) live in industrial
south Wales. Coalmining remains a major industry; although the numbers
employed in it have declined substantially, the area still produces virtually all
Britain’s anthracite and much of its steam and other specialised coals. Steel is
the other traditional industry of south Wales, which supplies all of Britain’s
output of tinplate and much of its sheet steel. Many new industries,
including mechanical and electrical engineering, motor vehicle components,
plastics, chemicals and textiles have been established throughout the former
coalmining valleys and on the coastal plain. Cardiff, Newport, and Swansea are
the largest urban centres and, with Barry and Port Talbot, are also the major
ports of the region. The latter has Britain’s largest steelmaking plant and a
deep water harbour for importing iron ore. Milford Haven is one of the finest
natural deep water harbours in the world and has developed as Britain’s major
oil-importing port with four oil refineries and a link with a fifth at Llandarcy.
The other main industrial area is in north-east Wales. Coal mining has now
contracted in importance but sheet steel, chemicals, man-made fibres and
aircraft construction remain significant sources of employment. A range of
new lighter industry, has been introduced in the post-war years, particularly
around Wrexham. The remainder of Wales is predominantly rural with agri¬
culture, forestry and tourism the traditional basis of the economy, but here
too manufacturing firms have been successfully introduced in many towns.
About three-quarters of Scotland’s population of 5-2 million and most of the
industrial activity is concentrated in the central lowlands between the Firth of
Clyde and the Firth of Forth. The principal cities in this area are Glasgow, a
major commercial centre, and Edinburgh, Scotland’s capital, an administrative
and cultural centre. Clydeside, which includes Glasgow, is a major shipbuilding
and marine engineering centre; it produces a great variety of general engineer¬
ing products, which include modules, pumps and other products for the oil
industry; the world’s largest oil production platform yard is situated at Ardyne
Point in the Firth of Clyde. Clydeside is also an important centre for food, drink
and tobacco manufactures, carpets and printing and publishing. The steel
industry, sited mainly in Central Strathclyde, is being modernised and capacity
expanded. There are important coalmining works in the Strathclyde, Central,
Lothian and Fife regions. The electronics equipment industry is represented
in Glasgow, Airdrie, East Kilbride and other parts of Strathclyde, Fife and
Dundee, as well as in Edinburgh, where this and other modern industries are
expanding alongside the traditional engineering, printing and brewing in¬
dustries. Large-scale plants producing cars in Linwood, near Paisley, and
commercial vehicles in West Lothian and the Scotstoun district of Glasgow,
are well established, while heavy earth-moving equipment and tracked
vehicles are produced in Uddington and Airdrie. The chemical industry is

concentrated at Saltcoats and at Grangemouth, where a major oil refinery
provides much of the basic raw material. The Firth of Clyde provides central
Scotland with valuable deep water facilities.
Outside the central belt there is considerable industrial concentration in and
around Dundee and Aberdeen and numerous towns outside these areas have
attracted light industry in recent years. Dundee’s traditional manufacture,
jute, has been supplemented by office machinery, clocks and watches, tyres
and electronic products.
North-east Scotland is now the centre of the offshore oil industry and a
wide variety of oil-related projects have been established alongside the
older industries of whisky distilling, paper manufacture and food and fish
processing. There are currently between 56,000 and 65,000 people employed
in work directly or indirectly related to oil.
Much of the rest of Scotland is mountainous and therefore sparsely populated.
In the Highlands and Islands, the main industries include high quality tweed
and knitwear, papermaking and aluminium smelting and there are significant
resources of hydro-electric power. Nuclear power is also generated. The
development of North Sea oil has led to very substantial oil-related activities
including oil platform production yards and a new oil refinery is planned at
Nigg. In the Borders and south-west of Scotland, the wool, cloth and knitwear
industries are important, together with food processing and chemicals manu¬
facture. Tourism is important throughout Scotland and there are extensive
holiday and recreational facilities.
Although the area of Northern Ireland is relatively small there is substantial
and growing industrialisation, particularly in and around Belfast, the capital
city, and Londonderry. Britain’s largest single shipyard is in Belfast; other
well-established activities include the manufacture of aircraft, textile machinery
and a wide range of other engineering products, ropes, twine, tobacco and
clothing. Northern Ireland has also long been an important centre for textiles—
it is particularly well known for linen. The textile industry is extensively
diversified and Northern Ireland is one of the most important areas in Europe
for man-made fibre production, providing over a quarter of Britain’s output.
There has also been extensive development in vehicle components, oil-well
equipment, electronic instruments, telecommunication equipment, carpets
and synthetic rubber.
The pattern of ownership and organisation in industry is varied. Personal,
corporate, co-operative and public enterprise all assume a number of different
forms, and all are important in the economy. Industrial enterprises vary from
such large-scale organisations as the General Electric Company (205,000
employees) and Imperial Chemical Industries (195,000), and the public
corporations such as the National Coal Board with about 312,000 employees, to
the many thousands of small firms. Most manufacturing is in the hands of
private enterprise (for the role of public enterprise, see p. 188). The Aircraft
and Shipbuilding Industries Act 1977 took into public ownership the bulk of
the aircraft and shipbuilding industries. Most iron and steel production is
already in public ownership. Other state-controlled products include a small
range of chemicals from the plants of the British Steel Corporation; loco¬
motives and rolling-stock built in the workshops of British Railways; military
equipment and supplies made in establishments of the defence services; and
fissile materials and radioactive isotopes, made by two statutory companies.
The Government has shareholdings in various companies; it has major

Association
holdings in British Petroleum Ltd., and through the National Enterprise
Board (see p. 207) in British Leyland Ltd. and Rolls-Royce Ltd.
The most recent complete analysis of the size distribution of establishments
and enterprises in manufacturing industry, and of the degree of concentration,
is contained in the the Census of Production 19J2. This shows that some
69 per cent (60,100) of the 86,900 or so establishments in manufacturing in¬
dustry had fewer than 25 employees each and accounted for 8 per cent of total
employment; 24,200 establishments had between 25 and 499 employees and
accounted for some 38 per cent of the total labour force; 1,950 establishments,
each with between 500 and 1,499 employees, were responsible for 22 per cent
of employment, while one-third was in the hands of the 667 establishments
each with over 1,499 employees. A high proportion of the biggest establish¬
ments were in the heavy industries. An enterprise, as defined in the 1972
census, normally consists of either a single firm or a parent company together
with its subsidiaries. In the private sector of British manufacturing industries
in 1972 37 per cent of all employment was accounted for by the largest 100
private enterprises.
A further indication of company size is the value of capital employed (net
assets). For each of the two companies British Petroleum and Shell Transport
and Trading, the figure exceeds £3-5 billion; over 60 companies registered in
Britain have each more than £200 million net assets. Of the top 20 industrial
groups in Europe in terms of annual sales, four are British.
The trend towards mergers and regrouping has gathered momentum as
competition in the economy has intensified and, in many branches of industry,
profitable operation has become dependent on concentration and economies of
scale. Larger units of control have been established in almost all the leading
industries and in some a small number of big companies and their subsidiaries
are responsible for a great proportion of total production. Examples are oil
refining, non-ferrous metal smelting, motor vehicles and aircraft, heavy
electrical engineering, electronics, machine tools, brewing, textiles, basic
chemicals, tobacco and magazine publishing. Shares in these companies are,
however, usually distributed among many holders or are held by insurance
companies or pension funds representing a broad cross-section of the com¬
munity, and it is rare for a few holders to have a controlling interest.
Voluntary associations are formed by private enterprises for a number of
different purposes, including the provision of common services, the exchange
of information and representation of their members’ point of view; the regula¬
tion of trading practices; and negotiation with trade unions on wages and
conditions of work. These associations cover, with varying completeness, most
of British industry. Trade associations, concerned mainly with representation
to the Government, the provision of common services and the regulation of
trading practices, are normally composed of firms manufacturing (and/or
retailing) a particular product or group of products. Employers’ organisations
which deal with employment matters usually consist of firms engaged in the
same type of operation or manufacturing process. In an industrial sector con¬
cerned wholly with an allied group of products, a single association may under¬
take all the required functions. The national employers’ organisations are
concerned with negotiation of wages and conditions of work (see p. 321).
Other voluntary associations include industrial development associations
for particular areas or regions, which are sponsored by trade associations,
individual firms and local authorities. Three of these bodies (the North of
England Development Council, the North West Industrial Development
INDUSTRY
203
Production
Productivity
Association and the Yorkshire and Humberside Development Association)
receive government grants, while the Scottish Council for Development and
the Development Corporation for Wales receive grants from the Scottish and
Welsh development agencies respectively.
The central body representing British business and industry nationally is
the Confederation of British Industry (CBI), recognised by the Government
as a channel for consultation between government departments and representa¬
tives of both the private and the public sector employers as a whole. The CBI
membership consists of some 13,000 companies and about 230 employers’
organisations and trade and commercial associations and the majority of the
nationalised industries. For its members it acts as an advisory and consultative
body providing them with information and statistics, ascertaining their collec¬
tive views and representing them nationally to the Government and the public
and also internationally (see p. 322). CBI representatives sit on the National
Economic Development Council, the Manpower Services Commission, the
Health and Safety Commission and other official advisory committees and
voluntary bodies concerned with matters affecting industry.
In matters of common concern the CBI often acts jointly with the chambers
of commerce. These are open to all kinds of producers and traders and exist to
promote the interests of local, regional and national industry and commerce.
Most chambers provide export facilities, including the sponsorship of outward
trade missions and visits. The Association of British Chambers of Commerce,
founded in i860, is the co-ordinating body to which about 85 local chambers are
affiliated, together with 16 British Chambers of Commerce operating in
Europe and elsewhere. These chambers have a membership of about 50,000
firms. In Scotland there is an additional central organisation, the Scottish
Chamber of Commerce, and in Northern Ireland the Northern Ireland
Chamber of Commerce and Industry, to which local chambers are affiliated.
Industrial production in general has been affected by the world recession in
industry. It has declined since 1973, and although slightly higher in 1976 than
in 1975 it was still only 2 per cent above the 1970 level, as measured by the
index of industrial production. Manufacturing production has also fallen
sharply since 1973, although it has increased by 116 per cent since 1948, the
highest increases being in chemicals and allied industries, in coal and petroleum
products and in engineering—instrument engineering and electrical engineer¬
ing being the sectors that grew most rapidly.
The improvement of productivity, which by international standards has
shown a relatively slow rate of growth in Britain, is recognised as being of
prime importance for the economy. Productivity, as measured by output per
head, increased by 17-8 per cent in manufacturing industries between 1970
and 1976. Both the long-term and the short-term growth of productivity are
influenced by such factors as the rate of capital investment, management,
advances in products, machinery processes and methods of work, sales pro¬
motion and labour. Over the last decade the size of the labour force employed
in industry has fallen steadily.
The improvement of productivity rests mainly with unions and management
in individual enterprises. It is also a prime objective of the Government’s
industrial strategy (see p. 207). The Department of Industry is responsible for
co-ordinating measures to improve industrial productivity. It assists the intro¬
duction of advanced machinery and techniques into industry, provides tech¬
nical advisory services and sponsors the Computer Aided Design Centre and
the National Computing Centre. It is concerned directly with research into
204
BRITAIN 1978: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
such factors as productivity measurement techniques, group technology and
production engineering. The Department of Employment advises firms on
aspects of productivity connected with manpower utilisation and industrial
relations. Many educational establishments also provide advice and assistance.

Within industry, employers’ organisations often provide technical assistance
and support schemes of vocational education and training, as do many trade
unions. The British Productivity Council is one of many bodies, both public
and private, concerned with various aspects of productivity. The council
provides information and advisory services to industry through a national
network of 45 local associations.

Productivity is particularly dependent on the quantity and efficiency of the
capital assets which the labour force has at its disposal. Investment in manu¬
facturing industry tends to reflect the level of demand in the economy as a
whole, with some time lag between the start of an increase in output and the
implementation of investment plans. There is thus a marked cyclical pattern
in the flow of investment by manufacturing industry, and since 1961 there have
been three discernible cycles. Details of investment in the period 1967-76 are
contained in Table 11.
Analysed by industry group, investment in the food, drink and tobacco
group in 1976, at current prices, was ^511 million, coal and petroleum
products totalled £119 million, chemicals £643 million, metal manufacture
£738 million; engineering, shipbuilding and metal goods £811 million,
vehicles £296 million, textiles, leather and clothing £217 million, paper,
printing and publishing £188 million and other manufacturing industries
£418 million.

“ After allowing for expenditure brought forward into 1968 from 1969 to secure the
higher rate of investment grants, estimated at £51 million.
Part of the investment in plant and machinery is associated with the intro¬
duction of new techniques and equipment. The process of automation is
changing the pattern and organisation of many industries and has brought
substantial increases in production and efficiency. Much investment, however,
still consists of replacements, additions and improvements of a more traditional
kind. Industrial technologies of plant maintenance, materials handling, lub¬
rication and corrosion protection, well developed in Britain, make possible
large savings in costs.
In Britain, as elsewhere, management is recognised as a subject requiring
special skills and training. The British Institute of Management (BIM) pro¬
vides a wide range of information services and has a particular interest in
management education and training, throughout industry, commerce and
public administration. The Institute of Directors also provides information
and other services to directors of all types of company. The Industrial Society,
whose membership includes trade unions as well as employers and their
associations, works to promote better use of human resources; it advises mem¬
bers and conducts conferences and courses.

A large proportion of management education is provided by the 30 poly¬
technics and many of the colleges of further education throughout Britain; 12
of these with established reputations for management work have been desig¬
nated as regional centres for management education. Universities also make an
important contribution, especially the full-time postgraduate programmes at
the business schools of London and Manchester Universities. Training courses
for higher management are offered by several colleges including the Adminis¬
trative Staff College, Henley-on-Thames, and Ashridge College of Manage¬
ment, Berkhamsted. The Council of Industry for Management Education,
jointly sponsored by the CBI, the BIM and the Foundation for Management
Education, works to foster the development of business and management
education. Many firms provide general management courses for senior execu¬
tives or systems of informal training. There are also a number of bodies con¬
cerned with specialised branches of management, for example, the Institute of
Personnel Management, the Institution of Works Managers, the Institute of
Administrative Management, the Institute of Supervisory Management and
the Institute of Marketing.
The large number of professional people working as management con¬
sultants indicates the concern for improved management performance in
Britain. Such consultancy services are being increasingly used by overseas
clients.
Design is an important factor in improving the quality and competitiveness
of manufactured goods. Improvement of the design of British goods is the
concern of the government-sponsored Design Council and its separate
Scottish Committee.
At the council’s Design Centres in London and Glasgow there are permanent
displays of well-designed modern British goods, together with special exhibi¬
tions illustrating new design developments. There is a third, smaller showroom
in Cardiff. All the products displayed are chosen from the council’s Design
Index, a record of some 9,000 current British products, chosen by independent
committees for their high standards of design, safety and performance. The
council’s services include advice on design matters, the organisation of product
displays at overseas trade fairs, conferences and seminars on design, help for
design education and the publication of a range of material. It provides annual
Design Council Awards for manufacturers of consumer and engineering
products and for medical equipment and motor vehicles.
Other bodies concerned with industrial design include the Royal Society of
Arts (see p. 382), the Society of Industrial Artists and Designers, which is the
representative professional body in Great Britain of industrial designers and
the Design and Industries Association, a voluntary association of industrial
companies, designers, and others interested in the promotion of good design in
industry. The Crafts Council of Great Britain, the Crafts Centre of Great
Britain and the Scottish Craft Centre are all grant-aided and work to improve
craft design and to promote closer relations between craftsmen and industry.
The British Standards Institution (BSI) is a voluntary non-profit-making body
incorporated by Royal Charter, funded in part by sale of standards, by sub¬
scription and by government grant. It prepares and promulgates standards
which, variously, specify dimensions, performance and safety criteria, testing
methods and codes of practice for a large range of products and processes in
most fields of production. Voluntary acceptance of such standards by manu¬
facturers, buyers and sellers reduces unnecessary variety and simplifies

the specification of requirements. BSI is governed by a council consisting of
representatives of the main organisations of employers and workers, pro¬
fessional institutions and the larger government departments.

THE GOVERNMENT AND INDUSTRY
The Government is giving priority to industrial development, in order to
reverse the relative decline in this sector that has been continuous for many
years. In view of the central importance to the economy of manufacturing
industry, government policy is concerned with improving its competitiveness
while at the same time developing effective solutions to such major problems
as regional imbalance and unemployment. The Government influences
industrial activity in a number of ways—through fiscal and monetary policy,
through the level of public expenditure, by incentives for industrial investment
and by the provision of services, information and advice. Legislative arrange¬
ments control aspects of employment, monopolies, mergers and restrictive
practices and new industrial and office building and changes in land use.
The Department of Industry is responsible for industrial policy as a whole on
both a national and regional level; 1975 saw the transfer of certain regional
responsibilities towards industry in Scotland and Wales to the Scottish and
Welsh Offices respectively. In Northern Ireland the Department of Commerce
deals with industry and industrial development.
There is close association between industry and the Government through
such channels as the National Economic Development Council (see p. 188) and
the Economic Development Committees. These cover particular industrial
sectors and bring together representatives of government, management and
unions to study, and make recommendations on, the efficiency and prospects of
individual industries.
Since 1975 provision has been made for voluntary planning agreements
between Government and some leading firms.
The Government initiated its industrial strategy in 1975 as a medium-to-
long-term programme to strengthen industrial performance. Some 40 tri¬
partite sector working parties have been set up in the National Economic
Development Council framework, and two sets of reports have been produced
with specific recommendations for action. The means of implementing plans
for improving the sectors’ shares of home and overseas markets are being
studied. Particular attention is being given to exploiting the main opportuni¬
ties and eliminating the constraints identified within a small number of sectors:
initially, the emphasis is on five sectors of the mechanical and electrical engi¬
neering industries, but the same approach may later be extended to other
sectors.
The National Enterprise Board (NEB), established under the Industry Act
1975, is a public corporation whose principal objectives are to assist the national
economy, promote industrial efficiency and international competitiveness and
provide productive employment. The NEB’s activities include the provision of
finance for industrial investment and restructuring. It has a holding company
role for shareholdings previously held by the Government, together with its
own investments. The NEB is expected to exercise a commercial judgement
and to look for an adequate return on its investments.
The Scottish, Welsh and Northern Ireland Development Agencies, estab¬
lished in 1975-76, are designed to stimulate industrial development within

their regions by exercising powers similar to those of the NEB with regard to
the provision of finance to industry and the establishment and management of
industrial undertakings. Where firms are based mainly in Scotland, Wales or
Northern Ireland, the development agencies take the initiative for action;
where they are more broadly based in Britain, the NEB is responsible. Close
consultation takes place between the NEB and the development agencies
wherever interests overlap. The Scottish and Welsh agencies also have
responsibilities under the regional development programme (see p. 210).
Britain has a generous system of national incentives for industrial development.
Under the Finance Act 1972 incentives to encourage capital expenditure in plant
and machinery take the form of a system of free depreciation enabling the whole
of such expenditure to be written off against profits for tax purposes in the year
in which it is incurred; there is in addition a 54 per cent initial allowance on new
industrial buildings and structures and an annual writing down allowance of
4 per cent thereafter. Direct investment from overseas is also encouraged, and
overseas firms are offered the same facilities and incentives as those applying to
British-owned companies. Under the Industry Acts 1972 and 1975 other
assistance may be provided throughout Britain where it is judged to be in the
national interest. Selective financial assistance is available for certain key
sectors of industry to encourage modernisation and increase efficiency.
Economic imbalance between different parts of the country is due partly to the
steady decline over the years of older industries, such as coalmining and ship¬
building, causing a high level of unemployment in certain regions and such
adverse factors as poor amenities, derelict buildings and land and net outward
migration. In addition, the newer and expanding industries have tended to
develop mostly in the Midlands and the South-East, and unemployment has
remained a persistent problem in Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland and some
parts of England, particularly the North and Merseyside. The ending of regional
imbalance has been an objective of successive Governments. Financial and other
aid to areas of high unemployment began in the 1930s and has been expanded
considerably over the years.
The map opposite shows those areas (as from April 1978) where assistance is
offered by the Government to encourage industrial development and the move¬
ment of office and other service employment. The assisted areas cover the whole
of Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland and in England the Northern, North-
West and Yorkshire and Humberside regions; parts of the South-West and
East Midlands regions; and Oswestry in the West Midlands. There are three
categories of assisted area; special development areas, where the economic
situation and consistently high rates of unemployment give rise to the most
urgent need for assistance; development areas with similar but rather less
severe problems; and the intermediate area, where some assistance is necessary
but where the need is relatively less acute than in the other types of area.
Under the Industry Act 1972 regional development grants are available in the
assisted areas to help meet the costs of buildings and works on premises used
wholly or mainly for specified activities in manufacturing, and, in the special
development and development areas only, towards the cost of plant and
machinery as well. These grants are not limited to projects creating employ¬
ment, and are thus available to help with improvements and modernisation.
In addition they are not treated as reducing the capital expenditure which
qualifies for tax allowances.

The Industry Act also provides for selective financial assistance for projects
which are likely to provide, maintain or safeguard employment in any part
of the assisted areas. Assistance may be provided in a number of forms, the
usual ones for employment-creating projects being loans at concessionary
rates of interest, interest relief grants, removal grants and service industry
grants.
Other forms of assistance available include the provision of modern fac¬
tories for rent or purchase, free use of government training services, and grants
to assist the transfer of key workers, to posts in the assisted areas. In the develop¬
ment and special development areas firms are given preferential treatment
when tendering for contracts placed by government departments and nationa¬
lised industries.
Special measures to improve the infrastructure in the assisted areas include
provisions under the Local Employment Act 1972 for grants towards the
improvement of basic services (such as transport, power and water facilities)
and towards the acquisition and clearance of derelict land (see p. 167).
The Government also influences, in many cases, the location of industry by
requiring industrial development certificates for the building of new factories
and extensions to existing factories outside the development and special
development areas. New office development in south-east England is controlled
in a similar way by a system of office development permits. However, to
arrest the decline of certain inner urban areas, the Government is encouraging
development in some of the older city centres (see p. 162).
Broadly speaking, responsibility for regional industrial development is exer¬
cised in England through the Department of Industry and in Scotland and
Wales through the Scottish and Welsh Offices respectively. An important
exception, however, is the regional development grant scheme, which is
operated throughout Great Britain by the Department of Industry.
In England the regional offices of the Department of Industry in the main
assisted areas (the North, North-West and Yorkshire and Humberside
offices) can handle applications for loans of up to £2 million under the selective
financial assistance scheme without reference to the department’s headquarters.
The Secretary of State for Industry has access to advice from the Industrial
Development Advisory Board, a statutory body, composed of prominent
members of the industrial and financial community, which makes recommen¬
dations on industrial opportunities and on applications for selective financial
assistance. Non-statutory industrial development boards have also been
established for the North, North-West, South-West and Yorkshire and Hum¬
berside regions.
In Scotland and Wales, day to day work is carried out by the Scottish
Economic Planning Department and by the Industry Department of the
Welsh Office. Statutory Scottish and Welsh Industrial Development Advisory
Boards advise the respective Secretaries of State for Scotland and Wales. The
Scottish and Welsh Development Agencies are responsible for the provision of
factories for rent or purchase and are also charged with the reclamation of
derelict land and with certain powers to allocate selective financial assistance.
Under separate legislation (the Industries Development Acts 1966 and 1971)
the Northern Ireland Department of Commerce offers a full range of incen¬
tives comparable to those available in the assisted areas of Great Britain.
INDUSTRY
211
All firms establishing factories in Northern Ireland, without regard to the
number of jobs created, are eligible for capital grants at the rate of 30 per cent
of the cost of new buildings, machinery and equipment; for selective employ¬
ment premiums; for grants towards training and free use of government training
services; for grants towards the cost of transferring key workers; and for the
derating of industrial buildings by 75 per cent. The capital grants, like regional
development grants in Great Britain, are not treated as reducing the capital
expenditure which qualifies for tax allowances.
Projects which are especially attractive because of the number of jobs
created can obtain special benefits which include industrial development
grants of up to 50 per cent of the cost of new buildings, machinery and equip¬
ment (as an alternative to capital grants); contributions towards setting-up
costs; grants of up to 100 per cent of the cost of transferring plant and machi¬
nery; grants to aid research and development costs; modern factories for
rent or purchase; and loans, loan guarantees and interest relief grants.
Assistance is also available to firms in the service sector which have a genuine
choice of location within Britain and which create additional net employment.
Projects serving primarily local needs are not assisted. The forms of aid avail¬
able to the manufacturing sector may also be offered to service sector projects.
The Northern Ireland Development Agency may also assist financially with
industrial development projects.
European Regional The European Regional Development Fund was set up in 1975 to assist regions
Development Fund of the European Community suffering from problems of a preponderance of
agriculture, industrial change and structural under-employment. In particular
payments are made from the fund in respect of approved industrial and infra¬
structure projects in the assisted areas. Britain’s share of the initial fund
(I975_77)was 28 per cent or about £150 million. A new fund will operate from
January 1978.
Rural Industries Encouragement for the development of rural industries in England is provided
and Small Firms under the aegis of the Development Commission set up in 1909. Through the
agency of the Council for Small Industries in Rural Areas (CoSIRA), the
commission provides business advice, credit for manufacturing and service
industries in rural areas, and loans for tourism projects in the rural parts of the
development and special development areas. In addition the commission
provides factory premises in rural areas and lends support for pioneering and
experimental schemes bearing on the rural economy, for voluntary bodies
aiming to enrich social and cultural life in the countryside, for miscellaneous
marketing and co-operative schemes in agricultural and fishing communities,
and for surveys and other work in rural areas.
In Scotland and Wales these services are provided by the Scottish and Welsh
Development Agencies. Separate bodies, however, cater for particular rural
areas. In Scotland the Highlands and Islands Development Board, set up by
Act of Parliament in 1965, provides assistance to the Highland region, and
surrounding islands, and to parts of the Strathclyde region. It provides grants
and loans to industrial and commercial enterprises, builds factories, and has
powers to acquire land and set up businesses. The Development Board for
Rural Wales has the general function of promoting and undertaking measures
for economic and social development in the county of Powys and the districts
of Meirionnydd and Ceredigion. It has a particular responsibility for new
towns in those areas and can acquire land, carry out building and provide
basic services. Within its area the board also acts as agent for the Welsh

Development Agency in the management of factories and estates and in the

The Department of Industry has a separate division which is the focal point
for the formation of policy towards small firms. In association with the Scottish
and Welsh Offices, the division operates a chain of Small Firms Information
Centres throughout Great Britain, which work in co-operation with local
business organisations and are linked to a central information bank in London.
The division is also experimenting with a counselling service for small firms; a
pilot scheme went into operation in 1976.
In Northern Ireland the Local Enterprise Development Unit, established to
promote the development of smaller industries, provides grants, loans,
premises and management advice to new and expanding companies.
Government assistance for tourism is provided under the Development of
Tourism Act 1969. The Act established four independent but government-
financed statutory bodies—the British Tourist Authority, which is responsible
for the overseas promotion of tourism in Britain and has a general responsi¬
bility for tourism within Great Britain, and the English, Scottish and Wales
Tourist Boards which are responsible for encouraging the development and
improvement of facilities and amenities for tourists in their respective coun¬
tries, and for tourist promotional work and publicity within them. (In Scot¬
land, however, the Highlands and Islands Development Board exercises these
responsibilities within its area—see p. 211). The Act enables the tourist
boards to give financial assistance to selected tourist projects in the develop¬
ment areas. Government policy is to encourage growth in tourism in hitherto
unexploited areas (particularly in the development areas) while sustaining
the industry in recognised tourist centres. The Northern Ireland Tourist
Board, established under separate legislation, has a function broadly similar
to that of the other British tourist boards. Financial assistance to tourism
projects is available from the Department of Commerce for Northern Ireland.
CONSUMER PROTECTION AND COMPETITION POLICY
The encouragement of fair trading, with the particular aim of helping con¬
sumers and safeguarding their rights, has become an increasingly important
part of government policy in recent years. The Government is also concerned
with competition policy and the control of restrictive trade practices. The
Department of Prices and Consumer Protection, set up in 1974, is responsible
for policy and legislation on consumer affairs and competition policy. The
Office of Fair Trading, a government agency, is concerned with the conduct of
trade and industry in Britain. Legal redress can, where necessary, be sought
by consumers in the county courts in England and Wales and the sheriff courts
in Scotland.
The most comprehensive law in this area, the Fair Trading Act 1973, provides
machinery (headed by the Director General of Fair Trading) for the continuous
review of consumer affairs and for action to meet new problems as they arise,
including powers to deal with trading practices which unfairly affect consumers’
interests, and to deal with persistent offenders under existing law. Other legis¬
lation to safeguard the consumer’s economic interests deals principally with
quantity, performance and service, price information and credit facilities.
The other major area of legislation is concerned with the prevention of the
sale of dangerous or harmful consumer goods. The principal laws here are the
Competition
Policy
European
Community
Monopolies
and Mergers
INDUSTRY 213
Consumer Protection Acts 1961 and 1971, which empower the Government to
make regulations to ensure the safety of any class of goods.
Provision of consumer information and advice is an important function of
those in local and central Government, and of several independent organisa¬
tions, concerned with consumer protection. The main outlets are the Citizens
Advice Bureaux (see p. 117) and the Consumer Advice Centres run by local
authorities, both of which receive financial assistance from central government.
The independent, non-statutory National Consumer Council (and associ¬
ated councils for Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland), which also receives
government finance, ensures that the consumer’s view is made known to those
in Government and industry whose decisions affect consumers.
Consumer councils for the energy and rail nationalised industries and for the
Post Office investigate questions of concern to the consumer, while some trade
associations in industry and commerce have established codes of practice
designed to protect the consumer. In addition several private organisations
work to further consumer interests. The largest is Consumers’ Association,
funded by the subscriptions of its membership of over 650,000. The association
conducts an extensive programme of comparative testing of goods and investi¬
gation of services; its views and test reports are published in its monthly
magazine Which? or its satellite publications. The association also provides an
advice service on subscription. Consultancy work in European legislation is
undertaken by the association on behalf of the Department of Prices and Con¬
sumer Protection. Local consumer groups, such as the National Federation of
Consumer Groups, also promote consumers’ interests and provide information
and advice.
Competition policy has led to the development of machinery for scrutinising
and regulating monopolies, mergers and restrictive trade practices and of
powers to regulate any structural changes or uncompetitive practices which
operate against the public interest. The Fair Trading Act 1973 contains all
current legislation on monopolies and mergers. The Director General of Fair
Trading has certain statutory responsibilities in respect of monopolies, mergers
and restrictive practices, in addition to his work on consumer protection.
The objective of the competition policy of the European Community is to
promote free and fair competition in trade between member countries. The
Community’s rules of competition, which are set out in the Treaty of Rome,
apply to industrial and commercial practices likely to affect trade and prevent,
restrict or distort competition in the Community. Agreements which fall
within the rules must be notified to the European Commission; the Commission
has limited powers to exempt agreements which, though restrictive of com¬
petition between member countries, benefit the Community in defined
ways.
Monopoly situations can be referred—by the Secretary of State for Prices and
Consumer Protection or by the Director General of Fair Trading—for investi¬
gation by the Monopolies and Mergers Commission. The market share by
reference to which monopoly is defined is one-quarter; local monopoly situa¬
tions and arrangements which prevent, restrict or distort competition, and
monopolies in public sector industries can also be referred to the commission.
If the commission finds that a monopoly situation operates against the public
interest, the Secretary of State for Prices and Consumer Protection has
powers to make orders and otherwise to remedy or prevent the harm which the
214
BRITAIN 1978: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
commission considers may exist. It is more usual, however, for the Director
General to be asked to negotiate undertakings to remedy the adverse effects
identified by the commission.
A merger situation (defined as occurring when two enterprises are brought
under common ownership or control) may be referred to the commission by
the Secretary of State for Prices and Consumer Protection if it results in, or
intensifies, a monopoly situation, or if the value of gross assets taken over
exceeds £5 million. There are special provisions relating to newspaper and
certain other mergers.
Restrictive The Restrictive Trade Practices Act 1976 requires the entry in a public register
Trade Practices of the particulars of a wide range of restrictive agreements which affect the
supply of goods or commercial services for the British market. Such agreements
must be notified to the Director General of Fair Trading who has a general
duty to refer registered agreements to the Restrictive Tractices Court. The
court has powers to prohibit the operation of restrictions which are held by
them to be contrary to the public interest. Registration and judicial examina¬
tion has applied to agreements relating to goods since 1956 and to services since
1976. Not all restrictive agreements are taken before the court; those containing
only insignificant restrictions may be allowed to continue without reference
to the court. The Secretary of State for Prices and Consumer Protection may
exempt from registration proposed agreements of substantial importance to
the national economy or agreements designed to keep prices down. Restrictive
agreements relating exclusively to exports are not subject to registration but
they must be notified to the Director General of Fair Trading and to the Com¬
mission of the European Community if they fall within the rules of competition
of the Treaty of Rome.
MANUFACTURING INDUSTRIES
An outline of the broad sectors of manufacturing industry is given below.
Production figures in Table 12 show the relative size of the sectors in the
most recent years for which information is available. Over a longer term
expansion has been particularly marked in those industries using advanced
technologies such as electronics, the newer branches of mechanical engineer¬
ing, instrument engineering, most sectors of the chemical industry and man¬
made fibres. In other long-established industries (for example, shipbuilding
and marine engineering and electrical engineering) extensive reorganisation,
re-equipment and modernisation have become essential to meet changing
economic conditions.
A major stimulus has been provided by the various needs of the offshore oil
and gas industries.
In the following sections, relating to individual branches of industry in 1976,
employment statistics are the latest available from the Department of Employ¬
ment Gazette and refer to numbers in Great Britain at March 1977. Sales
and output figures are taken from the latest available Business Monitor
produced by the Business Statistics Office of the Department of Industry
and compiled from returns made by firms in industry. Export figures come
from Overseas Trade Statistics of the United Kingdom published by the
Department of Trade. Unless otherwise stated, export and manufacturers’
sales figures include parts.
Some sales figures are given in metric terms, where statistics for an industry
are normally published in this form. Conversion tables can be found on p. 427.

Steel Act 1967 brought together into public ownership 14 major steel companies
and created the British Steel Corporation (BSC). BSC currently produces over
85 per cent of Britain’s crude steel and is the largest steel undertaking in
Europe. It employs some 220,000 people, of which 192,000 are involved in
iron and steel manufacturing and 28,000 in other activities, such as construc¬
tional engineering and chemicals. The remaining private sector companies are
represented by the British Independent Steel Producers’ Association whose
members employ some 68,000 people and account for over one-third of the
value of the industry’s turnover. The private sector is particularly strong in
the manufacture of alloy and stainless steels and of finished products for the
engineering industry. The main steel producing areas are Yorkshire and
Humberside (34 per cent of crude steel output in 1976), Wales (28 per cent),
the Northern region (15 per cent), Scotland (9 per cent) and the West Midlands
(7 per cent).
BSC is currently implementing a development strategy designed to moder¬
nise and expand the corporation’s production capacity to reach 30 million
tonnes a year by 1981-82. The strategy includes the replacement of open-hearth
steelmaking by basic oxygen steelmaking (for bulk production) and the electric
arc process (for more specialised tasks) and the concentration of bulk steel¬
making at five main sites (at Port Talbot and Llanwern in Wales, Ravenscraig
near Glasgow, Lackenby in Cleveland, and at Scunthorpe) which have good
access to deep water for iron ore imports. During 1974 and 1975 the Govern¬
ment, BSC and the trade unions engaged in a joint review of the plant closures
implied in this strategy; decisions on most of the plants concerned have now
been announced. About 78 per cent of production is used by home industry
and the remainder for direct export. The major export markets for steel are the
rest of the European Community, the United States, Sweden and India. A
large part of the steel used by industry in Britain is also subsequently exported
as part of other finished products. The BSC is a member of the European
Nuclear Steelmaking Club, established to define a strategy for the application
of nuclear energy to steelmaking.
In the production of iron castings, a few large firms are responsible for more
than a quarter of total output while fewer, more highly developed units are
replacing the numerous small foundries. The main users of iron castings are
the motor vehicle industry, the general engineering industry, the manufac¬
turers of pressure pipes and fittings, the building and associated industries
and the steel industry. The Government is providing financial assistance for the
modernisation of the industry.
Britain’s non-ferrous metal processing and fabricating industry is one of the
largest in Europe. Its major products are aluminium (both virgin and secondary
metal); secondary refined copper, lead and primary zinc. Tin mining in Corn¬
wall supplies about 25 per cent of Britain’s tin requirements (see p. 260) but
otherwise British metal smelting and refining industries are based on imported
ores and concentrates except for substantial secondary production from scrap
metal. Britain is also a major producer of the newer specialised metals including
uranium, zirconium and beryllium for the nuclear energy industry, niobium
for aircraft production and selenium, silicon, germanium and tantalum for
electronic apparatus. Titanium is also produced and used in aircraft produc¬
tion, power generation and North Sea oil production. Nearly half the industry
is situated in the Midlands. Other centres include south Wales, London,
Tyneside and Avonmouth, where a zinc smelter of some 100,000 tonnes
capacity operates. Three large-scale aluminium smelters provide almost 75 per

cent of Britain’s requirements for primary aluminium. The large non-ferrous
metals fabricating industry uses large quantities of imported refined metals
such as copper, lead, zinc and aluminium. A wide range of semi-manufactures
is produced in these metals and their alloys, and, particularly in aluminium,
firms are engaged in smelting, casting and fabrication by rolling, extrusion and
drawing: advanced techniques of powder metallurgy and pressure die¬
casting are also employed. In recent years considerable progress has been made
in the development of ‘superplastic’ alloys, which are more ductile and elastic
than conventional alloys. Scientific and technological research for the industry
is conducted by the Warren Spring Laboratory of the Department of Industry
and by the British Non-Ferrous (BNF) Metals Technology Centre. The main
products exported, including alloys and semi-finished products, are copper,
nickel, aluminium, lead, tin and zinc. Exports of silver, platinum and other
metals of the platinum group totalled over £227 million in 1976. The major
export markets for the whole industry are the United States and the Federal
Republic of Germany.

The mechanical engineering industry comprises a group of industries manu¬
facturing all types of machinery, machine tools, industrial engines, mechanical
handling equipment, construction equipment and industrial plant. About half
the industry’s production is for the home market. The major customers for the
heavy equipment sectors are the nationalised fuel industries, the chemical
industry and the British Steel Corporation. A wide range of equipment is
supplied to the building and construction industry. Demand for other types of
equipment comes from all the production industries in Britain.
Britain was the birthplace of the machine tool industry and many of the more
advanced types of metal-working machine tools are produced in Britain.
Almost all machine tools produced are purchased by the engineering, vehicles
and metal goods industries. Seven large groups account for about 35 per cent of
machine tool sales and exports. Government selective assistance is being given
to promote the development of new products, to rationalise existing ranges and
to improve production facilities and machinery. Dependent as it is on the
manufacturing industries and their capital investment plans, demand for the
industry’s products is highly cyclical.
2l8
BRITAIN 1978: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
The most important types of metal cutting machine tools are milling, grind¬
ing and turning machines. Manual control for many of these tools is being
replaced by automatic control and Britain is an important producer of numeri¬
cally controlled machine tools, including machining centres. In addition, a
range of different sizes and types of metal forming machine tools are manu¬
factured in Britain. The largest export markets for the industry in 1976 were
the rest of the European Community, the United States and South Korea.
The Machine Tool Trades Association represents most of the industry and is
responsible for the international machine tool exhibition held in Britain every
four years, the next being due in 1980. The Machine Tool Industry Research
Association carries out research into design and performance of tools and into
production methods.
Manufacturing
Plant and
Machinery
British industry manufactures almost every type of industrial (including
process) plant and steelwork (for nuclear power station construction see
Chapter 13). Of particular importance are fabricated products such as pressure
vessels, heat exchangers and storage tanks for chemical and oil refining (process)
plant, steam-raising boilers (including those of high capacity for power
stations), sintering plant, metallurgical furnaces and plant, lime and cement
kilns, nuclear reactors, water and sewage treatment plant and fabricated steel¬
work for bridges, buildings and industrial installations. The industrial plant
industry comprises both equipment manufacturers and contractors responsible
for the design, engineering, construction and commissioning of complete plants
for process industries. British manufacturers have contributed to major ad¬
vances in process technology: there has been a rapid expansion in the number of
plants completed for the chemical, petrochemical, oil refining and gas in¬
dustries, particularly for North Sea oil and gas operations, and British firms
are carrying out major plant projects in many overseas countries. One of the
most rapidly expanding sectors in petrochemicals is plant for ethylene pro¬
duction. Gas turbine engines for industry, in particular for power generation
in the fuel industries, are another thriving section of the industry, where
exports have done well in recent years. Three large firms are pre-eminent in
the manufacture of industrial engines, including those derived from aero¬
engines. Industrial pumps, valves and compressors are vital components
in many industrial processes, particularly in the chemicals, oil and electric
power industries: over half the production of all types of such equipment is
exported. The fluid power industry makes oil hydraulic and pneumatic
equipment for operating machinery and construction and other equipment.
There are many newr areas where these powerful and flexible systems may be
used.
Machines and accessories for the manufacture and processing of yarns and
fabrics from all types of natural and man-made fibres are produced by the
textile machinery industry in Britain, which is noted for the range, scale and
versatility of its operations. Although there have been valuable developments
elsewhere, British inventions have remained the foundation of many textile
processes in use internationally and progress has been made in developing
automation in the industry. In 1976 the industry sold 75 per cent of its output
to export markets. Research and development is carried out by the large firms
and the four research associations connected with the textile industry.
Machinery for food and drink preparation, processing and sterilisation is
another important sector.
Refrigerating machinery (excluding domestic equipment) is used for food
and drink processing, but the industry also covers plant for ships and vehicles

and equipment for conserving drinks, food and ice-cream for the distributing
and catering industries.
Almost the whole range of plant required by the construction industry is pro¬
duced, including excavating, earth-moving and road-making equipment, pile
drivers and quarry crushing and screening plant. Overseas sales of construction
equipment and of mining machinery and equipment, including coal cutting and
coal face loading machinery, are increasing. Mechanical handling equipment
is used not only for construction and related activities but throughout industry
generally. It extends from individual units and accessories to complete
operating systems, the main products being cranes and bridge transporters,
lifts, escalators, conveyors, elevators, hoists and powered industrial trucks
including forklift trucks. Electronic control and completely automated hand¬
ling systems are among the techniques now being introduced.
Britain produces a wide range of equipment for general and special use, includ¬
ing many special purpose machines such as hop-picking machines, fruit har¬
vesters and improved root harvesters (for tractors see p. 222). Mechanisation
is extensively used in the arable farming, and dairy farming sectors. Much of
the new machinery is designed for use in a variety of conditions to meet the
needs of overseas farmers. A large-scale annual exhibition of the industry’s
products is the Royal Smithfield Show and Agricultural Machinery Exhibition
held in London in December. The main trade association for the industry is the
Agricultural Engineers Association.
Sales by this industry have been expanding rapidly. Many products have an
increasingly electronic content. A large proportion of the industry is owned
by multinational companies. The industry includes non-electronic data pro¬
cessing and handling equipment, duplicators, typewriters, accounting
machines and cash registers, and electronic calculators. The demand for
machines using mini- and micro-processing techniques has increased. (For
electronic computers and data processing equipment, see p. 221).
The other major products of the mechanical engineering industry include
printing, bookbinding and paper goods machinery, space heating, ventilating
and air-conditioning equipment, packaging and bottling machinery, portable
power tools and miscellaneous non-electrical machinery, such as boot and
shoe-making machinery, laundry equipment, automatic vending machines,
plastic working machinery and other types of specialised equipment.
Alongside the firms manufacturing the products of the mechanical engineering
industry are enterprises which supply parts and components and undertake
general sub-contracting, fabricating and repair work. Particularly important
is the production of ball, roller, needle and other bearings, about 25 per cent
of which is for the motor vehicle industry, and of other components, such as
precision chains, gears and drop-forgings.

Instrument engineering is a particularly important sector of the engineering
industry. Electronic techniques are becoming widely used, particularly in the
industrial instrument sector, which comprises industrial and process measuring
and control instruments and equipment, optical instruments and appliances,
electrical measuring and testing instruments, nucleonic and ultrasonic testing
equipment, analytical instruments and a diverse group of others. About half
the market for analytical instruments is in the medical field. The chemicals,
power, petroleum and iron and steel industries account for about 80 per cent
of process control applications, the largest sector of the industry and one
which is expanding. Major advances have been made in automatic testing
equipment and analytical instruments for medical diagnosis and pollution
control. The industry is served mainly by five trade associations—the Scientific
Instrument Manufacturers Association, the Control and Automation Manu¬
facturers Association, the British Industrial Measuring and Control Apparatus
Manufacturers Association, the Electronic Engineering Association and the
British Photographic Manufacturers Association. The Sira Institute con¬
ducts research on behalf of the industry.
Photographic equipment includes photographic and cinematographic
cameras, projectors and document copying machines. Other sectors of the
instrument industry are concerned with watches, clocks and time recorders and
with surgical instruments and appliances and related products.

The electrical engineering industry is engaged in the manufacture and installa¬
tion of a wide variety of equipment, which includes all types of generating,
transmission and distribution equipment, motors, telecommunications and
broadcasting equipment and domestic electrical appliances. The electronics
industry, which makes a vital contribution to the efficiency of many branches of
the country’s economy, has become one of the most important sectors of
British industry.
Leading representative organisations are the British Electrical and Allied
Manufacturers Association, the Association of Manufacturers of Domestic
Appliances and the Electronic Engineering Association, a member of the
Conference of the Electronics Industry which brings together the six principal
trade associations for the electronics industry. Scientific and technological
research is carried out by the Electrical Research Association.
The main product categories are power equipment (generators, motors,
converters, transformers and rectifiers) and switchgear, starting and control
gear. Mergers in the industry led to the creation of the General Electric
INDUSTRY
221
Electronic
Equipment
Company, one of the leading electrical engineering groups in Europe for
producing equipment used in generating, transmitting and distributing
electric power.
The industry produces cables and wires for the distribution of electric power,
for telecommunication networks and other purposes; its products include
submarine cables and cables insulated by a great variety of materials. Four
rnajor groups are responsible for more than half the industry’s output and for
a large proportion of the world’s submarine cable requirements.
A few large firms also dominate the market for other electrical goods,
including domestic appliances. Domestic equipment includes heating and
cooking equipment, washing machines and dryers, refrigerators, vacuum
cleaners, irons and electric kettles. Other major sectors are electrical equipment
for motor vehicles and aircraft; electric lamps and light fittings, and batteries
and accumulators.
The British electronics industry is one of the largest and most comprehensive
in Europe and British scientists and companies have made important contri¬
butions to electronics technology. Because of the diversity of the range of
products, an exact definition must be arbitrary, but the sectors included are
telecommunication equipment, components, consumer goods, computers and
communication and other capital equipment, as well as electronic process
control and industrial instrumentation (see p. 219).
The dependence of the telecommunications industry on electronic techniques
is increasing as new switching systems are introduced. The main products are
telephone exchange equipment, switching equipment for telegraph and telex,
data transmission equipment, subscribers’ apparatus and long-distance
communication equipment. The Post Office is the main customer in the
home market, which is largely supplied by four companies and carries out
research and development work in co-operation with companies.
The components sector manufactures the whole range of active and passive
electronics components, including integrated circuits (in which many circuits
are accommodated on a tiny chip of semiconductor raw material), mainly for
the electronics equipment industry. The market is dominated by the United
States manufacturers and their subsidiaries.
The major consumer goods produced are radio and television sets, radio¬
grams, high-fidelity audio equipment and tape recorders. In the audio field,
British manufacturers have a reputation for high-quality goods but are less
strong in the mass market.
In the computer sector, an extensive range of computer systems, central
processors and peripheral equipment, from large computers for large-scale data
processing and scientific work to mini- and micro-computers for use in control
and automation systems, are produced. Essential to the sector is the ‘software’
industry, which produces programs and associated services and complements
the hardware industry, enabling the systems manufacturers to provide complete
solutions to meet the requirements of users.
An expanding sector of the industry is that which covers the manufacture of
radio communication equipment, radar and radio navigational aids for ships
and aircraft, alarms and signalling equipment, public broadcasting equipment
and other capital goods. An important development in this sector has been
the X-ray scanner systems for brain diagnosis and whole body examination
manufactured by Electrical and Musical Industries. British equipment is used
extensively overseas, for defence, civil aviation, shipping, health, educational
and other purposes.

The industries which manufacture transport equipment are a particularly
important source of overseas earnings, accounting for some 16 per cent of
total visible exports in 1976.
The motor vehicle industry comprises the manufacture of cars and commercial
vehicles, caravans and trailers, and parts and components. Output of cars and
commercial vehicles is dominated by four large groups (British Leyland, in
which there is a majority public shareholding, Ford, Chrysler United Kingdom
and Vauxhall) which account for over 99 per cent of car production and some
98 per cent of commercial vehicle output; the remainder is in the hands of
smaller, specialist producers of cars, heavy commercial vehicles, buses and
coaches. Although there is a balance of trade deficit in cars this is outweighed
by a surplus in commercial vehicles and component parts; in 1976 the motor
vehicle industry as a whole contributed nearly £900 million to the British
balance of payments. Car exports in 1976 were worth over £650 million, of
which the rest of the European Community and the United States each
accounted for just over 25 per cent while Australia, New Zealand and Canada
together accounted for 14 per cent. The other European Community countries
were the main market for commercial vehicles, taking 29 per cent of a total of
about £450 million while Nigeria took 13 per cent.
The principal trade association for the industry is the Society of Motor
Manufacturers and Traders which until 1976 held an annual motor show and a
biennial commercial vehicle exhibition in London. From 1978 these two shows
are being merged into a biennial motor industry show to be held at the National
Exhibition Centre in Birmingham.
Britain is the third largest producer of tractors in the world and the world’s
largest exporter. Agricultural tractors account for the bulk of wheeled tractors
produced. Production is dominated by two large firms, with three others
responsible for most of the remainder.
In recent years the motor cycle industry has contracted and the domestic
market is largely supplied by imports.
British Rail’s requirements of locomotives and rolling stock are now largely
met by their own workshops but there are several major companies in the
private sector building these for export as well as components and other
equipment such as traction and control gear, signalling, heating and ventila¬
tion systems. The private sector also builds the trains for London Transport
and other rapid transit networks and is developing a growing export trade.

Aerospace Britain s aerospace industry is the largest and most comprehensive in Western
Europe and second only to that of the United States in the Western world.
The products of the industry include civil and military aircraft, helicopters,
aero-engines, guided weapons, hovercraft, space vehicles and a comprehensive
range of aircraft and airfield equipment and systems.
The public sector, represented by the nationalised corporation British Aero¬
space (BAe, which was formed in 1976) and the publicly owned companies,
Short Brothers and Harland and Rolls-Royce, is responsible for the greater
part of aircraft, guided weapon and aero-engine manufacture in Britain. BAe,
which acquired the assets and manufacturing capacity of the British Aircraft
Corporation, Hawker Siddeley Aviation, Hawker Siddeley Dynamics and
Scottish Aviation, is the largest of the aircraft and guided weapons manu¬
facturers while Rolls-Royce (see p. 202), which is one of the world’s three
leading aero-engine manufacturers, is responsible for almost the entire output
of aero-engines.
The private sector is composed of a number of aircraft companies, including
Westland Aircraft and its subsidiary, Westland Helicopters, which specialises
in helicopter design and manufacture, together with nearly all of the aviation
equipment sector.
Current production of BAe includes such civil aircraft as the HS 748 feeder-
liner, the HS 125 business jet, the BAC One-Eleven airliner and the Anglo-
French Concorde supersonic transport, eight of which were in regular airline
service by mid-1977. Short Brothers and Harland, which is based in Belfast,
produce the Skyvan and the SD3-30 commuter airliner. The private sector
produces such successful aircraft as the Britten-Norman Islander and
Trislander light transports. Military aeroplanes include the unique Hawker
Siddeley Harrier vertical/short take-off and landing aircraft (which has
achieved substantial sales to the United States), the Hawk advanced trainer
aircraft, the Anglo-French Jaguar tactical fighter/operational trainer and the
Tornado multi-role combat aircraft, a collaborative venture by Britain, the
Federal Republic of Germany and Italy. Westland Helicopters manufacture
the successful Sea King and are the British partners in the Anglo-French col¬
laborative programmes on the Puma, Gazelle and Lynx helicopters which are
being produced for the armed forces of Britain, France and other countries.
The industry is also a major producer of guided weapons which include a
number of export successes particularly the Rapier ground-to-air missile.
Collaborative guided weapon projects between Britain and its NATO partners
are also becoming of increasing importance.
Rolls-Royce aero-engines in production include the Pegasus vectored-
thrust engine for the Harrier, the Gem engine for the Lynx helicopter, the
quiet RB 211 engine and its more powerful derivative, the RB 211-524. In¬
dustrial versions of aero-engines such as the RB 211 and the Olympus, are
being produced for use in oil and gas transmission and as stand-by power
generators while versions for marine use, in particular of the Olympus and the
Tyne, are being used to power a new generation of warships for the Royal Navy
and many overseas navies.
The aviation equipment sector provides a wide range of systems essential
to the design of engines and aircraft, including engine and flight controls,
electrical generation, mechanical and hydraulic power systems, cabin furnish¬
ings and flight deck information displays, which are sold both in domestic
and overseas markets. It also supplies equipment for ground operation includ-
ing that needed for radar and air traffic control, ground power suppliers and
flight simulators, to airports and airlines throughout the world.

The industry is extensively involved in the manufacture of space systems,
including satellites for communications and other purposes, and in scientific
research in other European collaborative programmes. An extensive pro¬
gramme of research and development on airframes, aero-engines and equip¬
ment, including avionics, is carried out by the industry while research on a
substantial scale is also undertaken by universities and Government research
establishments.
Production and exports in the industry, which are fairly evenly divided
between the three sectors of airframes, aero-engines and aviation equipment,
including avionic equipment, have made considerable progress over the past
few years and now stand at record levels. The leading markets for exports are
the United States, France and the Federal Republic of Germany.
The main trade association for the industry is the Society of British Aero¬
space Companies which organises a major international air show at Farn-
borough, Hampshire, every two years. Major suppliers of avionics equipment
are also members of the Electronic Engineering Association.
Britain has a long-established tradition of shipbuilding. Employment in the
industry has contracted in recent years as a result of the world economic
recession and an over-capacity in shipping, particularly of oil tankers. There
have been programmes of reorganisation and modernisation in some major
shipyards including construction of the world’s largest totally enclosed ship¬
yard in Sunderland. Nineteen of the larger shipbuilding companies, five
companies manufacturing slow-speed diesel marine engines and three training
companies and their subsidiaries have been taken into public ownership under
a public corporation, known as British Shipbuilders. In addition, a number of
yards in the private sector build smaller vessels, including patrol boats,
fishing and harbour craft, pleasure craft, supply vessels, tugs, cargo ships,
small tankers and ferries. About 50 per cent of the output of British yards is for
export. Some of the larger shipbuilding firms, in addition to the specialist ship
repair firms, carry out repair work. Various types of marine diesel engines,
steam turbines and gas turbines are constructed and fitted by specialist firms.
Private sector companies in the shipbuilding and ship repairing industries are
represented by the Shiprepairers and Shipbuilders Independent Association.
Co-operative research into shipbuilding and marine engineering is undertaken
by the British Ship Research Association.

of the main groups, in which small firms predominate, manufactures engineers’
small tools and gauges, which include jigs and fixtures, press tools and moulds,
hard metal-tipped tools and other metal cutting tools. Another group manu¬
factures cutlery and tableware (including safety razors and blades). Although

small firms predominate, seven relatively large concerns are responsible for
over half of output.
A wide variety of domestic utensils, such as saucepans, buckets and dustbins,
made mainly from aluminium and wrought steel, are produced by the hollow-
ware industry, together with industrial hollow-ware, such as kegs, drums and
barrels. The manufacture of hand tools, including files, saws, hammers, axes
and spades, is a long-established industry. About half of its total production is
for export. Jewellery, gold and silver ware and the refining of precious metals is
an industry in which British craftsmen are world famous: five relatively large
firms are responsible for about 60 per cent of total output. Other main groups
of metal goods are bolts, nuts and screws, cans and metal boxes, metal furniture,
metal windows, metallic closures, metal small-ware such as needles and pins,
safes, locks and keys, domestic gas appliances and drop forgings.

The chemicals industry is one of the most successful industries in Britain as
well as being its third largest industrial sector. The industry is also the
second largest in Europe and the fourth largest in the Western world and
its exports of ,£3,200 million in 1976 (accounting for 12-5 per cent of total
British exports) placed Britain among the top five chemical exporting
nations. The industry is undertaking a substantial investment programme.
The largest British chemicals group, Imperial Chemical Industries, is the fifth
largest chemicals company in the Western world, accounting for about 20 per
cent of chemical sales in Britain. A further 30 per cent is in the hands of 24
other large- and medium-sized companies. The industry as a whole is repre¬
sented by the Chemical Industries Association. Research and development
work is financed by the companies themselves. The rest of the European Com¬
munity and the United States are the major export markets.
About 21 per cent of the output of the general chemicals industry consists of a
limited number of relatively simple inorganic chemicals, such as sulphuric acid
and metallic and non-metallic oxides, serving as basic materials for industry.
Sulphuric acid is produced in larger quantities than any other chemical.
Substantial quantities of inorganic chemicals are used in the manufacture of
such products as fertilisers, detergents, paint, glass and metals.
Organic chemicals include the heavy organics produced in bulk and the
speciality intermediate products. Over 80 per cent of the output of organic
chemicals is made up of petroleum-based chemicals. The most important
products (by weight) are ethylene, propylene and benzene. The main outlets
for organic chemicals are solvents, plastics and synthetic resins, synthetic
rubber, man-made fibres and detergents.

Outside the inorganic and organic sectors is a wide range of general
chemicals formulated for specific uses. Radioisotopes are produced by the
Radiochemical Centre Ltd.; over half the centre’s production is for export.
The whole range of medicines is produced in Britain, where many of the
basic products were discovered and developed. These include antibiotics,
sulphonamides, anti-malarial drugs, anti-histamine products, anaesthetics,
vaccine sera and naturally occurring drugs. Manufacturers in Britain are
among the world’s leading producers and exporters of preparations for the
treatment of human and animal diseases. This sector is one of the major
growth areas of the chemical industry.
Many of the basic discoveries in plastics, including polyethylene, were made in
Britain. Plastics manufacture is one of the fastest growing sections of industry
and over 35 per cent of total production is exported. Expansion in recent years
has mainly been in thermoplastic materials, of which the most important are
polyethylene (used in coverings and packaging—notably for foodstuffs),
polyvinyl chloride (known as PVC and used for a wide range of industrial
purposes and consumer goods), polystyrene (a material used for toys, light
mouldings and many consumer goods) and polypropylene, (which can be
fabricated as mouldings, films and fibres). A new family of plastics materials
reinforced with carbon fibres is also in commercial production in Britain;
they have up to three times the strength but are only half the weight of steel.
High styrene rubbers for shoe soles and flooring, and nitrile rubbers for use
where oil resistance is required, are also in large-scale production, together
with neoprene rubber.
The development of chemical fertilisers owes much to the pioneer work of
British scientists. Production is dominated by three firms, together with a
number of firms marketing compound fertilisers from the principal con¬
stituents—nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium—and is almost entirely for the
domestic market. The use of ammonium nitrate, ammonium phosphate and
urea is resulting in more concentrated fertilisers. Notable discoveries by the
British crop protection industry include the insecticidal property of BHC
(benzene hexachloride), the first selective hormone weed-killer, MCPA, and
Gramoxone, a non-residual general herbicide. Herbicides are the largest
category of sales of pesticides and allied products.
Britain is a major producer of paints, varnishes and allied products. In
recent years many improved techniques have been introduced into the paint
and varnish industry, including new ranges of synthetic resins and pigments,
non-drip, quick-drying paints and paints needing only one application.
These industries include soap and detergents, toilet preparations, cosmetics
and perfumes. Many of the firms in the toiletries industry are owned or
financed by United States companies but there are a number of long-estab¬
lished British perfume and soap makers. Both sectors are significant exporters.
There is a varied group of chemical products which account for about 10
per cent of the industry’s net output. It includes formulated adhesives,
printing ink, colours and dyestuffs, photographic chemical materials and
floor and furniture polishes.

The historical branches of the industry, based on the natural fibres of cotton
and wool, linen and jute, have retained their separate identities but the
boundaries between them are becoming blurred with the increasing use of
man-made fibres. The growth of man-made fibres has stimulated the develop¬
ment of new processes and new types of yarn and cloth and has strongly
influenced the structure of the industry. A small number of large multi-fibre,
multi-process groups have emerged, although in many sectors there is still a
preponderance of small firms engaged in just one or two operations.
Research for the industry is provided by the Shirley Institute (cotton, silk
and man-made fibres), the Lambeg Industrial Research Association, the Wool
Industries Research Association, the Hosiery and Allied Trades Research
Association and the International Wool Secretariat.
Much of the early development of man-made fibres took place in Britain and
continuing extensive research has produced a wide variety of types with their
own special characteristics. The two main types are still those first developed—
the cellulosic fibres, such as rayon, and the synthetic fibres, such as nylon and
polyester, made wholly by chemical processes. Acrylic fibres, including
Courtelle (a British discovery), Acrilan and Orion are important products, as
are the elastomeric or spandex fibres which have inherent properties of stretch
and recovery, anti-static synthetic yarns embedded with carbon and various
fire-resistant yarns. More recently there has been a greater use of the poly¬
olefins (polypropylene and polyethylene) in the carpet and carpet backing
and packaging fields and still more recently in household textiles and clothing.
Output in the man-made fibre industry is concentrated in the hands of a few
large firms and has expanded rapidly in recent years.
During the nineteenth century cotton was Britain’s chief consumer goods
industry and cotton piece goods its largest export. Low-cost competition has
cut progressively into British markets and made necessary extensive re¬
organisation, modernisation and the introduction of new techniques. Pro¬
duction includes single and double cotton yarn, spun man-made fibre and
mixture yarn, woven cotton cloth and man-made fibre and mixture cloth.
The largest markets for cotton fabrics in 1976 were the rest of the European
Community, Finland and Sweden.
The linen industry is centred in Northern Ireland, where the lighter types of
fabrics for apparel, furnishings and household textiles are produced. The
heavyweight canvas for sailcloth, tents, awnings and tarpaulins is mainly
produced in Scotland.
The wool textile industry, of importance to Britain since mediaeval times, is
one of the largest in the world and includes the world’s biggest wool textile

company, Illingworth, Morris. There are two main branches, woollen and
worsted. An increasing amount of man-made fibre is now blended with wool.
West Yorkshire is the main producing area but Scotland and the West of Eng¬
land are also famous as specialised producers of high quality yarn and cloth.
Large quantities of raw wool are scoured and cleaned in Britain to prepare it for
spinning. Government assistance is being given to encourage structural
changes in the industry in terms of mergers and rationalisation and to stimulate
investment. The largest markets for woollen and worsted fabrics are Japan
and the rest of the European Community.
The hosiery and knitwear industry includes four or five large producers and a
wide variety of smaller ones. The products of the industry range from knitted
or crocheted outerwear and fabrics to socks, stockings, panti-hose and
accessories.
Carpets Some 70 per cent of the output of the carpet and rug industry is made up of
tufted carpets, in the production of which the pile, usually with a high man¬
made fibre content, is inserted into a pre-woven backing. Woven carpets, such
as Axminster and Wilton, account for most of the remainder of sales. There is
a higher wool content in woven types, although they too are making more use
of man-made fibres. The volume of tufted carpets exported is now more than
twice as large as that for woven ones, but the high quality and variety of design
of the latter make Britain the leading producer of woven carpets.
Jute Jute products are manufactured on a large scale in the Dundee area. Jute yarn
and the man-made polypropylene yarn are used in the manufacture of carpets,
cordage and ropes and woven into fabrics for a wide range of applications in the
packaging, upholstery, building and motor car industries. New uses for jute,
for example as a plastics reinforcement, have also been developed.
Other Textile British textile firms manufacture a wide variety of other goods, including lace,
Industries narrow fabrics and household textiles, such as blankets, sheets, towels and
tablecloths. Rope, twine, nets and netting are manufactured by the cordage
industry, which is one of the largest in Europe. A recent development by
British manufacturers is the production of non-woven fabric by the melded
process, in which the conventional weaving and knitting stages are omitted.
Clothing The British clothing industry is one of the largest in Europe. It has shown
considerable flexibility in adapting to the needs of new fabrics, to changing
patterns of demand and different markets and to the impact of international
fashion. The industry operates in the context of the world market and many
subsidiary companies have been established overseas. Although production has
been mechanised to a large extent, the industry remains labour intensive;
skilled, individual work being required at various stages of garment manu¬
facture. The Clothing Export Council, which represents a major part of the
industry, co-ordinates the promotional activities of the industry.

largely made up of small firms. Production in recent years has been severely
affected by the recession and an increase in imports especially in the lower
priced categories.

About two-thirds of the bread in Britain is manufactured in large mechanised
bakeries, most of which use a process developed by the industry’s principal
research organisation, the Flour Milling and Baking Research Association,
and now widely used in other countries. Three groups are predominant. In
smaller bakeries production of cakes and other flour confectionery is usually
allied to bread production. Biscuits and related products are a major sector of
the industry and have gained a world-wide reputation. Another sector is grain
milling and the production of various specialised flours and meal.
The cocoa, chocolate and sugar confectionery industry is composed of a small
number of very large manufacturers and many medium-sized and small firms.
A substantial proportion of total world exports of chocolate and sugar con¬
fectionery are supplied by Britain.
The industry comprises the curing of bacon and ham, the canning and pre¬
serving of meat and fish, the manufacture of sausages and pies and the
preparation of extracts and pastes. In addition to the output of quick-frozen
fish, small quantities are also canned.
Fruit and vegetable products include canned, frozen and dried fruit and
vegetables, jam, marmalade, pickles and sauces. Other products of the food
processing industry include sugar, sugar preparations and honey, dairy
products and eggs, vegetable and animal oils and fats, coffee, cocoa, tea and
spices and cereal preparations.
Of prime importance among the alcoholic beverages produced in Britain, and
in the food and drink industry as a whole, is whisky. Scotch whisky accounts
for almost all whisky production in Britain. About four-fifths of annual sales
are to overseas buyers; the United States imports a third of the distilled
alcoholic beverages exported from Britain. The rest of the European Com¬
munity and Japan are the other largest markets. Production of gin in Britain

has risen steadily since the early 1950s. One company accounts for a large
proportion of output. Some of the larger manufacturers also own distilleries
abroad.
In the brewing and malting industry there are seven major brewery groups
whose products are sold nationally and about 80 smaller enterprises who
mainly supply locally, or regionally. Firms have introduced new production
methods, including continuous brewing processes, and automated batch pro¬
duction plants are well established. The main raw materials used are malt,
hops and some sugar. British malt, which is made almost entirely from home¬
grown barley, is used by brewers throughout the world. In recent years the
popularity of lager has increased considerably.
Three major groups account for much of the cider and perry produced in
Britain. The industry is based in Devon, Somerset and Herefordshire. Im¬
ported grape and fruit juices are used in the production of most of the made
wine. A much smaller, though expanding viticultural industry produces wine
from grapes grown in vineyards, mostly in southern England.
The soft drinks industry has expanded markedly in the last decade. There
are some very large firms among about 20 producing brands which are marketed
on a national scale, while other firms supply regional markets. There is some
specialisation among firms in the production of various types, such as car¬
bonated drinks, cola-based drinks, squashes and cordials, tonic waters and
‘mixers’, fruit juices and health drinks.
The tobacco industry manufactures almost all the cigarettes and tobacco goods
sold in Britain. Two big manufacturing groups account for over 90 per cent of
total output. Exports, mainly of cigarettes, are shipped to a large number of
overseas markets, including Saudi Arabia, the Netherlands and Belgium.
Tobacco is imported in large amounts from the United States, Canada and
India.

Firms in the industry manufacture such items as bricks, roofing tiles, chimney
pots, fireclay ware and heat-resisting products, including furnace and kiln
linings. Brickmaking is one of Britain’s oldest industries, but most manu¬
facture is now based on highly mechanised systems. One company, the London
Brick Company, supplies about 40 per cent of total brick deliveries. Refractory
goods include firebricks, silica bricks, magnesite bricks, chrome-magnesite
bricks and alumina bricks.
The cement industry is chiefly concerned with the manufacture of Portland
cement for the home market. Invented by Joseph Aspdin and patented in 1824,
this material and the methods of its production have been the subject of
continuous technical improvement and intensive research. One new variation,
glass-reinforced cement composites, consists of ordinary Portland cement
and sand combined with an alkali-resistant glass fibre. The capacity of the
industry as a whole has been substantially expanded in recent years.

The pottery industry, centred largely in Staffordshire, supplies almost all home
needs for domestic and industrial pottery. It uses largely indigenous clay from
Cornwall and Devon. There has been considerable re-equipment in the
industry; kilns fired by gas or electricity have replaced almost all the coal-fired
kilns, and new decorating techniques and automatic and semi-automatic
machinery, such as automatic glazing machines have been introduced.
Domestic pottery, including china, earthenware, stoneware, jet and Rocking¬
ham, accounts for about half of the industry’s output; the other main divisions
are glazed tiles, sanitary ware and electrical ware, and such specialised in¬
dustrial products as acid-proof stoneware, porous ceramics and laboratory
porcelain. Production of tableware is concentrated in two major groups. Britain
is the world’s principal manufacturer of fine bone china, much of which is
exported; famous makes include Wedgwood, Spode, Royal Worcester, Royal
Doulton, Minton, Coalport and Royal Crown Derby.
Britain’s glass industry is one of the biggest in the world. The largest section
of the industry is devoted to the manufacture of flat glass in its various forms,
chiefly ‘float’ glass, a process developed in Britain and licensed to glassmakers
throughout the world. The use of glass for internal decoration and as a finish
for internal and external walls has greatly increased in recent years. Large
quantities of safety glass are produced for the motor and other industries.
Other products include tubular glass, mirrors, lamp and bulb glass, scientific
and medical glassware, glass fibres, and all types of glass containers (mostly
made automatically). A traditional product is hand-made lead crystal glassware
of very high quality. Collective research is undertaken by the British Glass
Industry Research Association, and much research work is also carried out
by the Department of Ceramics, Glasses and Polymers of Sheffield University.

The British paper and board industry is one of the largest in Europe. The larger
British groups hold considerable interests abroad, including pulp and paper
producing mills in the United States, Canada, other parts of the Common¬
wealth and Europe. In recent years paper production has concentrated on
printing and writing papers and boards and speciality grades. There has also
been a trend towards waste-based packaging grades, in order to reduce the
industry’s reliance on imported woodpulp supplies. Domestically produced
woodpulp represents only a small percentage of raw material supplies and the
use of recycled waste paper is increasing: together they currently provide some
49 per cent of the industry’s needs. There is a scheme of Government assist¬
ance aimed at developing new techniques for recycling waste paper and
encouraging the increased use of indigenous raw materials. The main types of
paper and board produced are printing and writing papers and board, packag¬
ing board, wrapping papers, newsprint, household tissues and industrial and
special purpose papers.

converted products, including cardboard boxes, cartons, fibreboard packaging

The printing and publishing industry produces a wide range of products,
including national and provincial newspapers, periodicals, books, business
stationery and greeting cards. Mergers have led to the formation of large groups
in the newspaper, magazine and book publishing sectors, but general printing,
engraving, bookbinding and a large part of publishing remain essentially
industries of small firms. Production processes being introduced include high¬
speed printing equipment, including electronic engraving, advanced pro¬
cesses of photographic reproduction and computer typesetting techniques.
The most important overseas markets for printed matter are the United States
and Australia.

Tyres and tubes represent nearly half the output of the industry, but firms
make a variety of other goods, the most important being rubber footwear,
gloves and clothing, conveyor belting, cables, hose, latex foam products and
vehicles components and accessories. New uses for rubber include inflatable
liferafts, containers for fuel and other industrial liquids and seals for storage
tanks and other products where there are problems of air exclusion and vapour
suppression. One of the largest tyre groups in Europe, Dunlop-Pirelli
Union, resulted from a merger in 1971 of Britain’s leading rubber and tyre
company and its Italian equivalent. Tyre manufacturers include several
subsidiaries of United States and other overseas companies. The industry’s
consumption of rubber includes natural, synthetic and recycled rubber.
Numerous enterprises manufacture furniture in Britain (including domestic,
office, school and other furniture) with a few large firms predominating. In
recent years the industry has experienced a sharp increase in demand from
overseas. Exports have risen from ^98-5 million in 1975 to £142*3 million in
1976. The industry comprises wooden, metal and plastic furniture, upholstery,
bedding and soft furnishings. A Development Council for the industry has
existed since 1949. Scientific research and technical and other information
services are provided by the Furniture Development Council and the Furni¬
ture Industry Research Association.
The brush industry is located throughout Britain and includes highly
mechanised establishments as well as small craft units.
Domestic production of timber has been steadily increasing but the timber
industries are mainly dependent on imported supplies. A large proportion of
timber sales are dependent on the construction industry. Chipboard is the
fastest growing sector of the industry; other important sectors are hardwood
and plywood.
In addition to the plastics components and accessories supplied to many
different industries, the plastics products industry manufactures a wide range

of building materials, such as pipes, sheeting for roofs, sanitary ware, tanks and
other products. It also supplies flexible foams, used in the vehicle, furniture
and other industries; rigid foams; packaging products, including bottles,
containers and bags; domestic and industrial hollow-ware, many kinds of
household goods, linoleum, vinyl and other floorcoverings and leathercloth.
The industry manufactures toys, games, sports equipment and children’s
carriages. There are about 600 toy and games makers in Britain but some 20
companies dominate the market. The greatest expansion has been in the field
of craft and hobby kits. British diecast toys and model construction kits are
well known overseas; about half of the output of toys and games is for export.
The Federal Republic of Germany and the United States are the major
markets for toys while the United States and Canada are the main markets for
sports equipment.
CONSTRUCTION
The construction industry, which accounts for about 7 per cent of the total
domestic income, includes firms engaged on the construction, alteration, repair
and maintenance of buildings, highways, airfields, drainage and sewerage
systems, docks, harbours and canals, sea defence works, offshore structures,
electrical wiring, heating and other installation work, open-cast coal prospect¬
ing and mining, and structural work connected with thermal and hydroelectric
power stations and telecommunications. About 17 million people are engaged
on construction, including the self-employed, and they represent some 7 per
cent of the total labour force. About 20 per cent are employed by public
authorities. Some 30 per cent of output consists of maintenance work, and
about 50 per cent of all new work is commissioned by public authorities.
Construction work is carried out both by private contractors and by public
authorities which employ their own labour. In 1976 about 88 per cent of the
work was done by private firms. Although there were 60,000 firms employing
two or more people nearly 90 per cent of them employed fewer than 25 people.
Public authorities as a whole employed about 240,000 operatives but a very
large proportion of these were engaged on repair and maintenance work for
local authorities.
Nearly 40 per cent of operatives were occupied on building maintenance,
valued at about £2,600 million annually. The total labour force included about
750,ooo skilled craftsmen (of which about 90,000 were apprentices), most of
whom had been trained under the industry’s apprenticeship schemes. The
normal apprenticeship period is four years.
Some firms are vertically integrated, owning quarries and workshops,
mechanised plant and standard builders’ equipment; some undertake respon¬
sibility for projects from initial design to finished building. All but the smallest
projects are generally carried out under professional direction, either by
architects or, in the case of the more complicated civil engineering projects, by
consulting engineers. The functions of the latter, acting on behalf of a client,
embrace advice on the feasibility of projects, the drawing up of plans and the
supervision of the construction work by the contractor.
The Property Services Agency, which is an integral part of the Department
of the Environment (see p. 45) is responsible for the construction programmes
undertaken directly by the Government, including work for the armed services,
both in Britain and overseas. The Department of the Environment is responsible
for co-ordinating research and development throughout the government

service and seeks to influence methods and techniques in the building industry
as a whole. The Construction Industry Liaison Group, a Government body,
exists to improve consultative arrangements between the Government and the
construction industry.
The value of work done in 1976 amounted to £12,681 million, of which £1,481
million represented work carried out by the labour employed directly by public
authorities. Private contractors carried out the remaining £11,200 million
(£8,638 million on new work and £2,562 million on repair work).
Some 325,810 houses and flats were started in 1976 and 314,860 were com¬
pleted, of which 152,040 were for private owners. Of the £3,487 million of new
housing carried out by private contractors, £ 1,790 million, or over half, was for
private owners and the remainder for public authorities. Industrialised build¬
ing methods employing prefabricated components are used in some of the work.
The National Building Agency is an independent advisory body, managed
by a board of directors appointed by the Secretaries of State for the Environment
and for Scotland and Wales. Its main function is to encourage the adoption of
advanced methods of house building, and to provide technical advice and
services to government departments, local authorities and other clients.
The Association of Building Centres represents the interests of the 12
building centres throughout Britain most of which provide both a compre¬
hensive permanent exhibition and information services on building materials
and products, building services and techniques.
Among important construction projects in hand in Britain in 1977 were
conventional and nuclear power stations (see p. 257), offshore production
platforms and onshore terminals for North Sea oil, hospitals, large-scale housing
developments, a scheme to extend the London underground railway system to
Heathrow Airport, London and the first stage of the new Jubilee under¬
ground line in London, and roads, tunnels and bridges.
Among important new construction projects being undertaken by British
building and civil engineering contractors in overseas countries are: an
£85 million contract for an extension to Port Rashid in Dubai; a £60 million
contract for two stations and related tunnelling on the Hong Kong Metro; a
£30 million contract for a 2 kilometres road tunnel under the Suez canal; and
a £28 million contract for a 120 kilometres road in Nigeria.
British building and civil engineering firms are active in over 100 countries.
In 1975-76 the value of new overseas contracts totalled about £1,425 million.
A substantial and growing amount of overseas business is also being done by
British architects and surveyors, as well as by other types of consultant. At the
beginning of 1976 British members of the Association of Consulting Engineers
were engaged on projects worth nearly £21,000 million which will bring in some
£190 million net in invisible earnings.
Increased opportunities for construction exports led to the setting up in 1975
of the Construction Exports Advisory Board to provide a focus for government
support. The board advises the Secretary of State for the Environment and the
Secretary of State for Trade on the selection of companies to pursue particular
construction projects overseas; and generally, on ways of harnessing additional
resources in the construction industry and professions to meet export
opportunities.
Within the Department of the Environment, the Building Research Establish¬
ment (BRE) is concerned with all aspects of construction research. In addition,

over a wide range of construction problems. An Agrement Board, tests and
certifies building products and methods.
The construction industry is served by several of the industrial research
associations, while the major construction firms have research departments
working on plant, materials and methods. Other bodies concerned with research
include the universities and colleges of technology. The larger producers of
primary building materials do some research into production methods and
new developments.
DISTRIBUTIVE AND SERVICE TRADES
Internal trade can be divided into two broad categories: trade in raw materials,
capital goods and intermediate products (for example, packaging materials)
and trade in consumer goods, involving the network of distributive trades by
which home-produced or imported goods reach the consumer. (For the pattern
of consumers’ expenditure, see p. 192.)
While some of the trade in consumer goods passes through wholesalers to
retailers, sales are also made directly to consumers through producers’ own
selling organisations (including their own retail outlets and mail order
businesses), and other sales are made directly by producers to retailers.
Closely connected with the distributive trades are those which offer a service
directly to the public, notably catering and hotel trades, laundries and dry
cleaners, garage and motor repair trades, hairdressers and shoe repairers.
There have been several major official statistical inquiries into the distri¬
butive trades. For wholesale trades, a large-scale inquiry was carried out in
respect of 1965, and more recently for 1974, while for service trades there was a
large-scale inquiry into the catering trades for 1969 and into motor trades for
1972. The 1971 Census of Distribution covered the retail and certain other
service trades. These large-scale periodic inquiries are being replaced by
smaller annual sample inquiries in Great Britain that will eventually cover most
distributive and service trades. For retailing, the first of these is being conducted
in 1977 in respect of 1976, and for catering in 1978 in respect of 1977. In
Northern Ireland a Census of Distribution has been taken in respect of 1975.
Over 2-6 million people in Great Britain were employed in wholesale and
retail distribution in 1976.
The main areas in which wholesalers are dominant are groceries and provisions,
petroleum products and ores and metals. The book value of stocks held by
wholesalers and dealers at the end of 1976 was about £4,500 million; fixed
capital expenditure by wholesale distributors amounted to about £133 million
in 1976 (valued at 1970 prices).
Methods of wholesale distribution vary according to the type of merchandise
handled. Fish, for example, is auctioned at the ports to port wholesalers (who
may sell to inland wholesalers at the main distribution centres) or, increasingly,
is sold by contract to fryers and processors, or direct to retailers. Fruit and
vegetables may be sold (or sent on a commission basis) to primary wholesalers
who dispose of the produce either to secondary wholesalers or direct to retailers;
alternatively the grower may deal direct with retailers or may sell his crop, under
contract, to a food-processing company for canning or freezing. The sale of
some agricultural products such as milk, hops and potatoes, is regulated by
statutory marketing boards.
London’s wholesale markets play a leading part in the distribution of food¬
stuffs. Every year the new Covent Garden market handles up to 1 million tons

of fruit and vegetables, and about 164,000 tons of carcase meat and 51,000 tons
of poultry pass through Smithfield market; Billingsgate is the principal
distributing centre for fish.
The co-operative movement in Britain has established its own wholesale
organisation to serve the needs of retail societies. The sales of the Co-operative
Wholesale Society (CWS), whose membership is restricted to incorporated
organisations, amounted to £1,300 million in 1976.
The number of Cash and Carry wholesale warehouses has increased in recent
years. By bulk purchasing and limiting their expenditure on premises and
credit and delivery facilities they can offer large price discounts to their
customers. There are about 550 warehouses of this type with total sales of over
£1,250 million a year. Cash and Carry wholesalers account for about 40 per
cent of all grocery warehousing by turnover.
Retail businesses in Britain may be classified under four main headings: (1)
multiple traders with ten or more branches; (2) retail co-operative societies;
(3) independent retail businesses, including for this purpose the small multiple
stores (that is, chains of stores with nine or fewer branches); and (4) department
stores. Other retail outlets include gas and electricity showrooms and mail order
businesses (see p. 238). Multiple traders have tended to bypass the wholesaler
by having their own buying and distribution organisations. In response many
wholesalers have joined with independent retailers to form voluntary organisa¬
tions. This has helped to preserve the existence of retail outlets for the whole¬
saler and has given to smaller retailers the advantages of bulk-buying and co¬
ordinated distribution without significant loss of independence. About 30,000
grocers’ shops, over a third of all independent grocers, are members of
voluntary groups.
The 1971 Census of Distribution covering retail and certain service trades
in Great Britain, recorded some 473,000 retail establishments (Table 13).

Out of this total, grocery and other food retailing groups numbered nearly
198,000 and the clothing and footwear group over 81,000.
Though the total value of retail trade in Great Britain (inclusive of electricity
and gas showrooms and mail order business) rose by about 40 per cent between
1966 and 1971, after allowing for price changes, the increase in volume of sales
was about 10 per cent. Rates of growth (measured in turnover) varied appre¬
ciably between different types of trade. The slowest growth was in confec¬
tionery, tobacconist, newsagent, clothing and ‘other food’ sectors. The fastest
growth was in department stores, mail order business, combined gas and
electricity showroom sales, household goods, groceries and provisions, and
other non-foods’. However, the growth of sales on a commodity basis has been
affected by increased diversification. The results of the 1971 Census of Distri¬
bution indicate a continuation of the trend for a larger volume of trade to be
handled by rather fewer shops, particularly in the food sector, along with the
continuing expansion of large multiple firms relative to other types of shop.
Independent shops accounted for about half of the value of Britain’s retail
trade, although they made up more than four-fifths of the number of shops.
According to the Department of Industry’s monthly retail sales inquiry, the
value of all retail sales in Great Britain in 1976 was estimated at £32,000 million
an increase of about 100 per cent on 1971- However, after allowing for increases
in retail prices, the increase in the volume of sales was about 8 per cent.
A very wide range is covered in the size of retailing establishments. Seven
shops had a turnover in 1971 exceeding £10 million. At the other extreme there
were some 6,500 shops with a turnover of less than £1,000 a year. In addition
there were market and street traders, whose volume of business may be very
small.
Fixed capital expenditure by retail distributors in 1976 amounted to about
£401 million (at 1970 prices).
According to the 1971 Census of Distribution there were over 66,700 shops
owned by multiples (including multiple department stores) in 1971 with a total
turnover of over £6,000 million; their share of total turnover was about 'iS’b per
cent.
Total sales of the retail co-operative societies in 1976 were over £2,400 million,
being about 7 per cent of all retail trade. Their share of food shops turnover
was some 11 per cent.
The retail co-operative societies are voluntary organisations controlled by
their members. Membership is open to anyone paying a small deposit on a
minimum share, which entitles the member to an equal voice with other
members in the society. Share investment by individual members is limited to
£5,000 (less in some societies) and only a low rate of interest is normally paid on
the shares. One large society has introduced a scheme of bonus shares carrying
a higher rate of interest than the ordinary shares.
Traditionally the trading surplus was paid out to members in the form of a
dividend in proportion to their purchases. A large number of societies, account¬
ing for over four-fifths of total co-operative sales, have introduced dividend
stamps redeemable for cash, other goods, or credit to a share account, at
different redemption rates.
At the end of 1976 there were 215 retail co-operative societies. Amalgama¬
tions are rapidly diminishing the number of societies (the total in 1958 was
I»0I5)- The largest single society in Britain is Co-operative Retail Services
Limited which in 1976 had 1,100 retail outlets and a turnover of £333 million.

BRITAIN 1978: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Independent shops have been giving ground gradually in the face of increased
competition from the larger undertakings, but the decline has been partly
reduced by the existence of voluntary buying groups (see p. 236) and between
1966 and 1971 the number of independent shops fell by only 3 per cent. The
1971 Census of Distribution also observed that the independent shops’ share
of trade continued to fall (to 54-3 per cent); however, they still play an important
role, often in terms of convenience, service, and range of goods stocked. The
proprietors of some smaller shops have other means of livelihood.
Department stores were defined for the purposes of the census as having 25 or
more persons engaged in selling a wide range of commodities, notably clothing
and household goods. There were 818 department stores in Britain, according
to the 1971 Census of Distribution, with a turnover of £950 million: 242 were
owned by multiples; 343 by independents; and 233, with a turnover of nearly
£160 million, by co-operative societies. Between 1966 and 1971 sales by
department stores rose by some 45-5 per cent.
The development of self-service trading has been a feature of the last two
decades. In 1971 there were over 28,000 stores operating wholly or partly on
self-service lines, compared with about 9,500 towards the end of 1961 and fewer
than 500 in 1950. This development has been accompanied by a trend to larger
shops in terms of both floor space and staff, though the number of staff per
square foot of floor space has tended to decrease.
Supermarkets are defined as self-service shops with a minimum selling area of
2,000 square feet (186 square metres). According to estimates of the Institute
of Grocery Distribution there were 5,900 supermarkets in 1976 with sales of
£4,200 million. Their share of total retail grocery sales amounted to some
49 per cent.
The number of very large stores, generally known as ‘hypermarkets’ and ‘super¬
stores’, is increasing. They generally operate a selling area of between 20,000
and 100,000 square feet (1,860 and 9,290 square metres respectively); hyper¬
markets having a minimum selling area of 50,000 square feet (4,645 square
metres). These stores operate on supermarket lines but with a much wider
range of goods including food and non-food items. They are generally associated
with exclusive car-parking facilities and situated away from established central
shopping areas.
Mail order trading, through a mail order business or direct from retailer,
wholesaler or manufacturer was one of the most rapidly growing forms of selling
in Britain between 1961 and 1966. Its growth rate slowed between 1966 and 1971,
but has since increased again. The 1971 Census of Distribution showed that
total mail order sales by retail organisations were £652 million, accounting for
nearly 4 per cent of total retail sales. The main products sold through mail order
in 1971 were clothing, textiles and soft furnishings.
Some 31,790 mobile shops and market stalls were reported in the Census of
Distribution for 1971, with sales amounting to £147 million. Co-operative
societies accounted for 39 per cent of sales through mobile food shops, against
12 per cent in ordinary food shops. Mobile shops were mainly concerned with
food sales; about two-fifths were travelling grocers, and greengrocers and
butchers each accounted for over one-fifth. Only a small proportion were shops
not selling food, and these specialised mainly in paraffin supplies and hardware.

There are about 500,000 automatic vending machines in use in Britain, many
of them installed in offices and factories. It has been estimated that sales from
vending machines in 1971 totalled some £155 million while sales from the
62,500 machines in use in the retail trade totalled some £12 million. The main
items sold in them are cigarettes, drinks, confectionery, prepared foodstuffs
and other commodities such as postage stamps.
Forms of consumer sales promotion include reduced price offers, competitions,
gift schemes, and stamp trading. Trading stamps are normally exchanged for
goods but, by law, have to be marked with a cash value and, where their aggre¬
gate value is ^0'25 or more, redeemed for cash on request.
Sales by the 24 manufacturing and importing companies which are members of
the Direct Sales and Service Association Limited and which sell all their
products directly to consumers amounted to about ^450 million in 1976.
The rapid growth of sales of household and durable consumer goods, such as
cars, furniture, washing machines, television sets, refrigerators and cookers, has
been greatly helped by instalment credit facilities including hire purchase.
Total new credit extended by finance houses and retailers in Great Britain in
1976 amounted to ,£3,606 million, 21 per cent more than in 1975; about 58 per
cent was advanced by retailers and the rest by finance companies.
Hire-purchase in Northern Ireland directly financed by the major finance
houses operating in Northern Ireland amounted in 1976 to £62-5 million.
The credit card is widely used in Britain. The cards enable users to have their
signatures accepted on bills in participating shops, hotels and restaurants. The
issuers, which include banks, then meet the bills and recover the money from
the card-holder through a single account presented periodically.
About 2'2 million people in Great Britain were employed in trades offering a
service directly to the public in 1976.
There were over 130,000 establishments concerned with catering (defined to
include public houses, canteens and fish and chip shops, as well as licensed
hotels and restaurants) in Britain in 1969. There were 203 catering contractor
organisations and over 18,000 industrial and office canteens.
The value of total turnover of all caterers in 1976 was ,£5,800 million while
that of licensed hotels and holiday camps was ,£ 1,050 million and that of public
houses ,£3,240 million.
In 1971 there were over 8,400 laundry, launderette, dry cleaning and towel,
linen and overalls hiring organisations. Turnover in 1971 amounted to some
,£212 million.
There were 46,000 businesses in the motor trades in Britain in 1972 with 55,000
establishments and a total turnover of ,£8,100 million. These trades include
motor repairers, distributors, garages and petrol stations. Sales of new vehicles
accounted for some 35 per cent of the 1976 total, and sales of second-hand
vehicles for 15 per cent. Sales of accessories, receipts from sales and servicing
and sales of petrol and oil accounted for the remaining 50 per cent.
The 1971 census recorded some 47,200 hairdressing establishments with a
total turnover of ,£166 million. About two-thirds of the number are ladies’
hairdressers.

In 1971 there were some 5,500 boot and shoe repair establishments, the number
having fallen by over a quarter since 1966; takings in 1971 were ^22-4 million,
slightly below the 1966 level.
In Britain the expansion of self-service shops, the spread of branded and
standardised products, and developments in partly prepared foods, for example,
ready-washed vegetables and ready-made cake mixes, have all been major
factors in the changes which have taken place in packaging methods. Packaging
products of paper and board remain the most extensively used (turnover of some
£1,384 million a year). Other important materials are tinplate, plastics and
glass. New uses have been found for tinplate, especially in the canning of soft
drinks and beer. The use of plastics continues to develop particularly poly¬
ethylene film and film products and low-density polyethylene bottles used as
an alternative to the traditional glass bottle.
About £1,188 million is estimated to have been spent on all forms of advertising
in 1976; as a proportion of the gross national product (1 '09 per cent) and of con¬
sumer expenditure (i-6 per cent), about the same as in 1956. About £814
million was spent on display advertising and £374 million on classified,
financial and industrial advertising. Most of the advertising is planned by
agencies, which, in some cases, also provide marketing, consumer research and
other services; their representative organisation is the Institute of Practitioners
in Advertising. The trade association for the whole industry, including agencies,
advertisers and media owners, is the Advertising Association. It was responsible
for the setting up of the Advertising Standards Authority, an independent body
whose objective is the promotion and enforcement of the highest standards of
advertising, in particular through the British Code of Advertising Practice (for
broadcasting advertisements see p. 415).
Industry and commerce pay great attention to improving public understanding
of their work and objectives. Many have their own public relations advisers and
staff, while consultancy firms provide general services and assistance for special
public relations activities. The Institute of Public Relations, founded in 1948,
is the largest professional public relations organisation in Europe, with some
2,600 members in commerce, industry, public relations consultancies, national
associations, and central and local government.
Resources
Ownership of
Mineral Rights
Over half of Britain’s energy requirement is supplied from domestic fuel
minerals (coal, oil and natural gas), and minerals in general make an important
contribution to the economy. The approximate value of minerals produced in
1975 was £2,877 million, of which coal contributed 71 per cent and natural
gas 7 per cent. The discovery and exploitation of oilfields under the British
sector of the North Sea are increasing the importance of domestically produced
fuel minerals to the economy very considerably. Over the past ten years the
production of non-fuel minerals has also increased.
Water resources are normally sufficient for domestic and industrial require¬
ments; supplies are obtained from surface sources such as mountain lakes and
from underground sources by such means as wells and boreholes.
Apart from gold, silver, oil, natural gas (which are owned by the Crown)
and coal, all minerals in Great Britain are privately owned. On Britain’s
Continental Shelf the right to exploit all minerals except coal is vested in
the Crown. The exclusive right to extract coal, or license others to do so,
both on land and under the sea, is vested in the National Coal Board.
Normally, ownership of minerals runs with the ownership of the land surface
but in some areas, particularly where mining has taken place, these rights
have become separated. Mining and quarrying, apart from coal, are usually
carried out by privately owned companies.
ENERGY
Four main primary sources of energy—petroleum, coal, natural gas and
nuclear power—are used in Britain, together with some water power; second¬
ary sources produced from these are electricity, coke and very small quantities
of town gas. Inland consumption of energy amounted to 324-7 million tons of
coal equivalent in 1976, 1-5 per cent higher than in 1975. About two-thirds of
all primary energy consumed comes from indigenous sources and the propor¬
tion is increasing as growing supplies of oil and gas are obtained from the
British sector of the North Sea. These are of major importance as they will
enable Britain to become self-sufficient in energy by 1980, and will benefit the
balance of payments through substantial import savings. The share of natural
gas in total consumption has increased substantially, supplies from the North
Sea discoveries having expanded rapidly since the first quantities were piped
ashore in 1967. Natural gas accounts for nearly all the gas consumed in
Great Britain. Reserves of coal, Britain’s richest natural resource, are sufficient
to enable production to continue for several centuries. Although coal has
accounted for a declining proportion of energy consumption, a major capital
investment programme is in progress to end the contraction of the industry.
A programme for the establishment of nuclear power stations has been in
progress since 1955 and nuclear power provides a significant share of elec¬
tricity supplies.

Britain employ in total some 600,000 people, 2-3 per cent of the working
population, and their annual turnover is about £10,000 million and capital
investment about £1,800 million. In Great Britain the Secretary of State for

Energy is responsible for these industries, except for electricity in Scotland
which is the responsibility of the Secretary of State for Scotland.
The Government wishes to ensure the best use of indigenous resources and
so reduce the dependence on imports, particularly of oil. It is continuing to
develop an integrated approach to energy policy in consultation with manage¬
ment and trade unions and through public discussions involving a wide range
of interests. Accordingly it has decided to establish an Energy Commission
to advise on major issues of energy policy. The membership will include
representatives of management and employees in the main energy industries,
and of consumers, industry, and energy conservation and environmental
interests.
Britain, which has the richest energy resources of any member State of the
European Community, is co-operating fully in the development of the
Community’s energy policy, a basic objective of which is to reduce depen¬
dence on imported energy supplies. Britain is one of the 19 members of the
International Energy Agency, an organisation attached to the Organisation
for Economic Co-operation and Development, which is engaged on a pro¬
gramme of international co-operation to deal with world energy problems.
ENERGY
CONSUMPTION
Trends in primary energy consumption are shown in Table 14 and in the
diagram on p. 242. In 1976 petroleum accounted for 40-7 per cent of primary
consumption, coal 37 per cent, natural gas 17-8 per cent, nuclear power 3*9
per cent and hydro-electric power o-6 per cent. Energy consumption by final
users in 1976 amounted to 57,329 million therms1 on a ‘heat supplied’ basis.
Industrial users consumed about 40 per cent of the total, domestic users 25
per cent, transport 22 per cent, public services 6 per cent and agriculture 1
per cent.

Id 1974 tbe Government announced a comprehensive programme of measures
designed to conserve energy and a further series of measures was introduced
in 1976. They have included the doubling of the standards of thermal insula¬
tion required in new dwellings; compulsory limits on heating levels in com¬
mercial and industrial buildings; the encouragement of energy-saving invest¬
ment in industry and commerce by the provision of financial assistance in the
form of government loans; the formation of a committee of government
ministers to encourage and co-ordinate departmental work on energy conserva¬
tion; and a major government publicity campaign to promote the efficient use
of energy. The Energy Act 1976 enables the Secretary of State for Energy to
control the use of energy, if desirable for energy conservation purposes.

Conservation measures, including the publicity campaign and increased
energy prices (part of the Government’s policy to eliminate subsidies to the
nationalised fuel and power industries), produced energy savings of around
6 per cent of primary energy consumption in 1975. Significant economies in
industry and commerce have been achieved through measures such as better
use of heating and lighting, improved operational and maintenance techniques,
and the installation of draught-proofing and additional insulation.
The Secretary of State for Energy is assisted by proposals on the promo¬
tion of energy efficiency from the Advisory Council on Energy Conservation.
Studies on energy conservation and alternative sources of energy are under¬
taken bv a number of organisations, notably the Department of Energy’s
Energy Technology Support Unit at Harwell (Oxfordshire).
Substantial oil and gas reserves have been discovered in the British sector of
the Continental Shelf under the North Sea and their total value is estimated
at about £300,000 million. It is one of the world’s most attractive offshore
areas for oil and gas, the success rate for exploration drilling being about one
in five, compared with a world offshore average of one in 20. Seismic prospect¬
ing began in the early 1960s and full-scale exploration activities in 1964,
following the enactment of the Continental Shelf Act 1964 and the subsequent
award of a first round of production licences. Further licensing rounds were
held in 1965, 1970, 1971-72, and 1976-77. The Government’s policy is to
license small areas of territory at frequent intervals to maintain activity at a
constant level. The total area covered by production licences is some 83,000
square kilometres (32,000 square miles) out of a total designated area of about
597,000 square kilometres (231,000 square miles), over which Britain has
exercised its rights to explore and exploit the seabed and subsoil.
Work on the development and production of Britain’s offshore oil and gas
is proceeding rapidly. By the end of 1976, 643 exploration or appraisal wells
and 293 production wells had been drilled or begun; of these 86 and 54
respectively were drilled in 1976.
The Department of Energy’s Offshore Supplies Office seeks to ensure that
British industry can compete effectively for orders for offshore equipment
by helping firms to identify the needs of offshore operators, assisting operators
to identify British suppliers of offshore equipment and services, and pro¬
moting new ventures to increase British involvement in the industry. British
companies increased their share of the offshore market, worth over £1,000
million in 1976, from between 25 and 30 per cent in 1973 to 57 per cent in
1976 and are increasingly involved in supplying other offshore markets.
The petroleum industry in Britain dates back to 1850, when Dr. James Young,
a Glasgow chemist, succeeded in obtaining lamp oil and lubricants from
natural mineral oil occurring in the Derbyshire coal measures. The Scottish
shale deposits, yielding similar products, were worked between 1858 and
1962. With the rapid growth of oil consumption during this century, however,
Britain has been almost totally dependent on imported supplies.
The first discovery of oil in the British sector was made in 1969 and the first
oil was brought ashore in 1975. By mid-1977 seven fields in the British sector
were producing oil: Brent and Forties, two of the largest offshore oilfields in
the world; Argyll; Auk; Beryl; Montrose; and Piper. A further eight fields
are under development while several of the 46 other significant finds may

prove to be commercial after further appraisal. Production from most large
fields is controlled from production platforms of either steel or concrete which
have been built to withstand severe weather including gusts of wind of up to
257 km/h (160 mph) and waves of 30 metres (too feet).
Production from the British sector amounted to about 12 million tonnes in
1976 and is forecast to be between 40 million and 45 million tonnes in 1977,
accounting for nearly one-half of Britain’s oil consumption. It is expected to
rise rapidly during the rest of the 1970s reaching about 100 million tonnes by
1980, and between 100 million and 150 million tonnes a year in the early
1980s, placing Britain among the world’s ten leading oil producing countries.
Proven reserves of the commercial fields amount to 1,070 million tonnes but
possible reserves from present and future finds under existing licences amount
to 3,200 million tonnes. The total reserves of the British Continental Shelf
could be as high as 4,500 million tonnes.
The Petroleum and Submarine Pipe-lines Act 1975 provided for the establish¬
ment of the British National Oil Corporation (BNOC); tighter controls over
exploration, development, installation of pipelines and refining capacity; and
control over the rate of depletion to ensure that offshore oil is used at a rate
which secures the greatest long-term benefit for Britain. The Government
considers that majority State participation in licences for commercial oilfields
provides the best means for the nation to share fully in the benefits of off¬
shore oil. Majority participation through the BNOC in existing commercial
oilfields is being achieved by negotiations with the licensees; by mid-1977
participation agreements had been concluded with six companies and out¬
line agreements with 22 others. State corporations have a majority share in
licences awarded in 1977 under the fifth round of offshore petroleum produc¬
tion licensing.
The British National Oil Corporation was set up as a public corporation on
1 st January 1976 when it took over all the offshore interests previously held
by the National Coal Board. It subsequently acquired a majority of the North
Sea interests held by the Burmah Oil Company. The corporation also holds
the Government’s participation interest in production licences. It has powers
to explore for, produce, transport and refine petroleum; store, distribute and
buy and sell petroleum; and provide advisory services and carry out research
and training. Other activities, which can be undertaken only with the Govern¬
ment’s consent, include overseas exploration and production. The BNOC’s
board consists of between eight and 20 members including two civil servants.
Production of crude oil from land-based oilfields in Britain amounted to
99,000 tonnes in 1976. Several small oilfields have been established, notably
in Nottinghamshire (Beckingham, Bothamsall and Egmantoh), in Lincoln¬
shire (Gainsborough) and in Dorset (Kimmeridge), while Britain’s largest
onshore field, at Wytch Farm (Dorset), will start production in 1978.
British and British-Dutch oil companies which participate in developing
the oil resources of many countries to mutual advantage, especially in the
Middle East, Far East, Africa and the Caribbean, account for about 6 per
cent of world oil production and operate a tanker fleet (partly on charter)
amounting to about 15 per cent of the world’s tanker tonnage.
In 1976 Britain’s imports of crude and process oils were 87-3 million tons
valued at £4,586 million, the largest single item among imported goods.

Iran supplied approximately 22 per cent by value, Saudi Arabia 21 per cent,
Kuwait 13 per cent and Iraq 6 per cent. Oil imports will decline substantially
with the growth in Britain’s offshore oil production, although heavy crude
oil will still be imported for particular uses. High quality premium oil from
the British sector is being exported in crude or refined form; exports began
in April 1976.
Deliveries of petroleum products for inland consumption (excluding refinery
consumption) in 1976 totalled 80-3 million tonnes, 2 per cent lower than
in 1975. Deliveries included 27-8 million tonnes of fuel oil, 18-6 million tonnes
of gas and diesel oil (including derv fuel used in road vehicles), 16-9 million
tonnes of motor spirit and 6-6 million tonnes of kerosene.
Electricity generation accounted for 36 per cent of fuel oil consumption
in 1976. The largest industrial users of fuel oil are the steel, chemicals and
paper-making industries.
In 1977 gross refinery capacity in Britain amounted to 146 million tonnes a
year. Of the 21 refineries in operation, 17 have a capacity of over 1 million
tonnes and are shown on the map on p. 245. Five have an annual capacity of
over 10 million tonnes: Stanlow, in Cheshire (18-3 million tonnes); Fawley,
near Southampton (18*2 million tonnes); one of the three at Milford Haven,
Dyfed (15*4 million tonnes); and Isle of Grain (icb million tonnes)
and Shell Haven (10-2 million tonnes) on the Thames Estuary. Outline
planning permission has been given for 26 million tonnes of additional
refining capacity including new refineries at Cliffe (Kent), Canvey Island
(Essex) and Nigg Bay (Highland). Projects for the construction of refineries
of over one million tons or the extension of existing refineries by more than
500,000 tons require an authorisation from the Secretary of State for Energy
under the Petroleum and Submarine Pipe-lines Act 1975.
Output of refined products (excluding refineries’ own consumption) rose by
4 per cent in 1976 to 90-3 million tonnes. There is a substantial external trade
in refined products and exports from Britain, mainly in the form of heavier
products to other European countries, were valued at ^994 million in 1976,
while imports amounted to £954 million.
Five main crude oil pipelines are in operation in Britain from harbours or
offshore moorings capable of berthing very large tankers to refineries (see
map, p. 245): from Finnart to Grangemouth; from Angle Bay, Milford
Haven, to Llandarcy; from Tranmere to Stanlow; from Amlwch (Gwynedd)
to Stanlow; and from a single buoy in the Humber estuary to Killingholme.
Submarine pipelines have been built to bring ashore oil from the North Sea.
Pipelines connect the Forties field to Cruden Bay (Grampian) and the
refinery at Grangemouth, the Piper and Claymore fields to a terminal at
Flotta (Orkney), the Ninian and Heather fields to a terminal at Sullom Voe
(Shetland), the Brent and three neighbouring fields to Sullom Voe and the
Norwegian Ekofisk field to Teesside.
Pipelines also carry refined products and petrochemical feedstocks to major
marketing areas; for example, a 300-mile (480-kilometre) pipeline runs from
Milford Haven to the Midlands and Manchester. The Pipelines Act 1962
ensures the orderly development of privately owned industrial pipelines.

on a substantial scale. Research centres are situated at Sunbury-on-Thames
(British Petroleum), Ellesmere Port in Cheshire, and Woodstock in Kent
(Shell), and Abingdon, in Oxfordshire (Esso). Work in progress includes the
evolution of new and improved fuels and lubricants and the development of
new uses for petroleum products and of new products based on petroleum,
especially chemicals. The main Government research and development
effort in offshore technology is undertaken by the Department of Energy
with the advice of the Offshore Energy Technology Board (see p. 375). In
1977-78 the Department of Energy is expected to spend some £13 million
in support of offshore technology.
Public supply of manufactured gas in Britain began in the early nineteenth
century in Westminster in central London using gas produced from coal. In
the early years of the industry gas was used almost exclusively for lighting,
but between the two world wars it was displaced from this function by
electricity. It is now used for domestic cooking and heating and for many
industrial and commercial purposes.
The Gas Act of 1948 brought the industry in Great Britain under public
ownership and control in 1949. As a result of the change from manufactured
to natural gas necessitating more centralised control of production and
transmission, the British Gas Corporation was set up in 1973 under the Gas
Act 1972 to replace the Gas Council and 12 area gas boards. The corporation’s
powers in connection with its main duty of developing and maintaining an
efficient, co-ordinated and economical system of gas supply and of satisfying
reasonable demands for gas are: to search for and extract natural gas and any
oil discovered in the course of searching for gas; to manufacture or acquire,
transmit and distribute gas; to manufacture, supply, or sell by-products; and
to manufacture, install, maintain or remove gas plant and fittings. It has about
100,000 employees.
Natural gas is not available in Northern Ireland and the industry, which is
controlled by nine municipal undertakings and four private sector companies,
uses town gas produced from oil feedstocks.
Natural gas has replaced town gas produced from coal or oil as the source of
gas for the public gas supply in Great Britain. Indigenous natural gas ac¬
counted for 98 per cent of gas supplied in 1976. Between 1971 and 1976 the
quantity of gas sent out by the public supply system in Britain increased by
79 per cent to 14,445 rnillion therms.
The first commercial gas discovery in the British sector of the North Sea
was made in 1965. Six major gasfields are now in production (Leman Bank,
Hewett, Indefatigable, Viking, West Sole and Rough) and their output
totalled 39,410 million cubic metres in 1976. The Frigg field, which straddles
the boundary between the British and Norwegian sectors, is expected to come
into production in the autumn of 1977. Gas produced in association with oil
in the Brent field is expected to be available in 1980-81 and, together with
gas from the Frigg field, should increase Britain’s gas supplies by 50 per cent
by the early 1980s. Gas has also been found in a number of smaller structures
and in association with oil in a number of other fields; exploration is con¬
tinuing. Total proven gas reserves remaining in known discoveries in the
British sector of the Continental Shelf at the end of 1976 amounted to
809,000 million cubic metres and total possible reserves amounted to i'4
million million cubic metres.

Operations
The few remaining gasworks in Great Britain making town gas are expected
to be closed by the autumn of 1977. However, some town gas manufacturing
plant has been adapted for producing substitute natural gas (SNG) from oil
feedstocks. The British Gas Corporation is undertaking various coal gasifica¬
tion projects at its Westfield Development Centre in Fife in collaboration
with groups of North American sponsors.
The pipeline system commissioned in 1964 for the delivery of liquefied
natural gas imported from Algeria has been expanded to form a national
high-pressure pipeline system (see map, p. 249) for transmission of natural
gas derived mainly from British fields in the North Sea. By March 1977
some 3,000 miles (4,828 kilometres) of pipeline were in operation. The
central transmission system is supplied by feeder mains from the four North
Sea shore terminals, and from the Canvey Island terminal for liquefied
Algerian gas. Two new pipelines have been built to carry gas from St. Fergus
(Grampian) to central Scotland and northern England and a third pipeline is
under construction. A pipeline is being laid between the Brent field and St.
Fergus, and the pipeline from the Frigg field to St. Fergus is expected to be
fully operational by the autumn of 1977. Considerable quantities of gas exist
in the North Sea in reservoirs which are too small to exploit economically on
their own. The Government has, therefore, asked a newly established com¬
pany, Gas Gathering Pipelines (North Sea) Ltd., to investigate the economic
feasibility of an integrated network of pipelines to collect gas, mainly from
oilfields and gas condensate fields.
Various methods of storage of natural gas to meet peak load conditions are
being investigated. Storage facilities for liquefied natural gas have been
installed at four sites and further facilities, including three salt cavities at
Hornsea (Humberside), are under construction.
Over half of all gas sold by the British Gas Corporation to its 14-2 million
consumers is for industrial and commercial purposes, most of the remainder
being for household use. Total consumption increased rapidly during the late
1960s and early 1970s, but is now growing at a more modest rate, with sales in
Britain rising by 6-8 per cent in 1976 to 13,997 million therms. A phased
programme of converting all gas appliances to use natural gas has been
completed in England and Wales and was completed in Scotland during
September 1977. Gas is used particularly in industries requiring the control
of temperatures to a fine degree of accuracy such as the pottery industry
and certain processes for making iron and steel products. Natural gas not
required by the fixed tariff domestic, commercial and small industrial
markets is being used in bulk fuel markets and as a chemical fee'dstock. In
I97^> 5,620 million therms of gas were sold to industry in Britain, 662
million therms to public supply power stations and 1,521 million therms to
commercial users. The domestic load includes gas for cookers, space heaters,
water heaters and refrigerators, but an increasingly large part of domestic
demand is for gas for central heating. In 1976, 6,194 million therms were sold
to domestic users, 5-1 per cent more than in 1975.
In 1976-77 the turnover of the British Gas Corporation and its subsidiary
companies amounted to £1,958 million, of which sales of gas accounted for
£1,703 million. After interest payments there was a profit of £31 "5 million.
Capital investment amounted to £244 million. The borrowing limit for the
corporation has been fixed by the Gas Act 1972 at £2,500 million, to be
raised by order if necessary up to £2,700 million.

The British Gas Corporation conducts research at four research stations into
all aspects of gas supply and use. Research is also done on behalf of the cor¬

expenditure on research and development and on technical service and testing
amounted to ^18 million in 1976-77.
Coalmining in Britain can be traced back to the thirteenth century. It played a
crucial part in the industrial revolution of the early nineteenth century and
in its peak year, 1913, the industry produced 287 million tons of coal, ex¬
ported 94 million tons and employed over a million workers. In 1947 the coal
mines passed into public ownership by means of the Coal Industry Nationali¬
sation Act 1946, which set up the National Coal Board (NCB) as a statutory
corporation to manage the industry.
The NCB has, with minor exceptions, exclusive rights over the extraction of
coal in Great Britain, but is empowered to license private operators to work
small mines and opencast sites. It has no monopoly in distribution and retail
sales remain largely in private hands, although it makes bulk sales to large
industrial consumers. Two holding companies, wholly owned by the NCB,
run most of its non-mining activities. NCB (Ancillaries) Ltd’s responsibilities
include certain retail fuel distribution operations, computer services and
engineering services. NCB (Coal Products) Ltd is responsible for solid smoke¬
less fuel manufacture and chemical and by-products plants.
At the end of March 197? there were 238 NCB collieries in operation
grouped into 12 areas, each controlled by a director responsible to the NCB.
The main coal-bearing areas are shown on the map on p. 253.
Coal accounted for 90 per cent of primary energy consumption in 1950, but
growing competition from oil and gas and the elimination of steam trains on
the railways contributed to the fall in demand from the mid-1950s. In
1976-77 internal consumption of coal was 1227 million tons, of which 63
per cent went to power stations, 16 per cent to coke ovens and 8 per cent to
domestic users.
Exports of coal in 1976-77 were 1-4 million tons, almost all of which went
to Western European countries, while imports amounted to 2-4 million
tons.
In 1976-77 output of 118-9 million tons comprised 106-7 million tons from
the NCB’s deep mines, n-2 million tons from opencast mines and 1 million
tons from licensed mines and other sources. The fall in demand during the
I95os and 1960s was accompanied by increases in productivity in the
industry and resulted in a rundown of the labour force at NCB mines from
some 700,000 in 1947 to 242,000 in March 1977. Productivity as a whole has
risen by about one-quarter since 1965-66 to 43-6cwt. per manshift in 1976-77;
at the coalface it has more than doubled over the last 20 years to 152-5 cwt. a
manshift in 1976-77.
Higher productivity has been achieved by concentrating on the more
productive collieries and coalfaces and by using advanced machinery and
techniques, including machines which cut and automatically load coal on to
conveyors, self-advancing powered roof supports and improved underground
transport and communications. Mechanisation has been extended to
nearly all coalfaces. Table 15 shows the main trends in the industry since
1966-67.

In 1976-77 the NCB’s income was £2,535 million including sales of coal of
£2,042 million and grants under the Coal Industry Acts of £54-5 million. The
operating profit was £109-8 million; after interest payments and other items
there was a net surplus of £27-2 million. Government assistance to the industry
took the form of grants towards the social costs of mine closures, contributions
towards the mineworkers’ pension scheme, and aid towards the cost of
stocking coal. In 1977 the NCB’s borrowing limit was increased from £1,100
million to £1,800 million, with provision for further increases up to £2,600
million, subject to parliamentary approval.
Capital expenditure on collieries amounted to £266 million in 1976-77. In
1974 the Government, the NCB and the coalmining trade unions carried out a
tripartite study of the policy towards the coal industry. As a result the Govern¬
ment accepted the board’s Plan for Coal as a general strategy for the follow¬
ing ten years, involving maintenance of deep-mined capacity at the annual
level of around 120 million tons and an increase in opencast production
to 15 million tons a year. The total cost of the plan is £3,150 million at March
1976 prices including £1,500 million on major projects up to the late 1980s
which will generate new deep-mined capacity of 42 million tons a year to
replace that lost by exhaustion of old collieries. By March 1977 the NCB had
approved nearly 90 major projects designed to provide more than half this
new capacity at an estimated cost of over £800 million. This included over
£400 million for a mining complex at Selby (North Yorkshire) which should
be producing 10 million tons of coal a year in the late 1980s. In September
1976 a new coalmine was opened at Royston (South Yorkshire), the first to be
opened under the Plan for Coal, and a second new mine at Betws (Dyfed)
is to start production early in 1978.
Although many good seams of coal have now been worked out due to the
early development of the industry, there are some 45,000 million tons of
proved coal deposits judged to be technically recoverable. The NCB’s
national exploration programme is proving fresh reserves of economically
workable coal at the rate of 500 million tons a year, four times the annual
consumption of coal. Major new finds have been located in the Vale of
Belvoir and East Leicestershire (with recoverable reserves of 500 million
tons), Park (Staffordshire), west of Coventry, under the Firth of Forth off
Musselburgh (Lothian), and at Margam (West Glamorgan).

In 1976-77 the NCB spent £24 million on research. It has two main research
organisations: the Coal Research Establishment, at Stoke Orchard, Glouces¬
tershire, concerned with the combustion and utilisation of coal; and the
Mining Research and Development Establishment (MRDE) at Stanhope
Bretby, Staffordshire, for research on mining methods and equipment,
including underground transport and coal preparation. A large investment
programme is in progress at the MRDE to provide additional laboratories
and testing facilities, and a training centre. Much of the work of other bodies,
such as the Safety in Mines Research Establishment (SMRE) of the Health
and Safety Executive, is closely related to the board’s problems; the range of
work at the SMRE includes explosions, fires, dust hazards, gas detection,
engineering and metallurgy.
Agreements to exchange technical information have been signed by the
NCB with several countries. Britain is responsible for formulating the coal
research and development programme on behalf of the International Energy
Agency; a programme of five coal research projects, including a ^17 million
project to develop pressurised fluidised bed combustion (a method of steam¬
raising for power generation, which uses low-quality coal and leads to lower
pollution), is being based in Britain. NCB (IEA Services) Ltd has been set
up to manage these projects.
The first public supply of electricity in Britain was in 1881, at Godaiming
(Surrey). A measure of public control has always been a feature of the industry
and in 1948 all municipal and private undertakings in Great Britain were
acquired under the Electricity Act 1947 and vested in the British Electricity
Authority and 14 regional boards, except in the north of Scotland where they
became the responsibility of the North of Scotland Hydro-Electric Board
(NSHEB), which had been set up in 1943. Two subsequent Acts (1954 and
1957) effected a measure of decentralisation and gave the industry its present
structure. Electricity supply employs about 185,000 people, including 6,800
in Northern Ireland.
In England and Wales electricity is generated and transmitted by the Central
Electricity Generating Board (CEGB), which is responsible for the operation
and maintenance of power stations and the national grid, and it is distributed
by 12 separate area electricity boards. Co-ordination is effected by the
Electricity Council, the central body of the supply industry with a general
responsibility for promoting electricity supply and for advising the Secretary
of State for Energy; it is also responsible for a number of common services,
principally capital financing, research and industrial relations. The council
consists of a chairman and two deputy chairmen, the chairman and two
designated members of the CEGB, the chairmen of the area electricity
boards and not more than three other members. The Government has
announced proposals for the reorganisation of the industry in England and
Wales under which the Electricity Council and boards will be replaced by a
new central body with responsibility for the industry as a whole.
In Scotland two boards, the NSHEB and the South of Scotland Elec¬
tricity Board (SSEB), generate, distribute and sell electricity. The boundary
separating their areas runs from Dumbarton on the Firth of Clyde to Newburgh
on the Firth of Tay. Each board comprises a chairman and between four and
eight members, one of whom is the chairman of the other board.
In Northern Ireland generation, transmission and distribution are carried
out by the Northern Ireland Electricity Service which came into operation

takings. Power stations are located in Belfast, Ballylumford and Coolkeeragh.
In 1976-77 the income of the electricity supply industry in England and
Wales was ,£4,143 million and its profit after interest payments was £207
million. In Scotland the income of the SSEB and the NSHEB was ,£356
million and £127 million respectively and their profits were ,£22-3 million and
,£5-9 million. In 1975-76 the Northern Ireland Electricity Service’s income
totalled .£97 million and it made a net loss of £32 million. Annual capital
investment amounts to £704 million in England and Wales, £142 million in
Scotland and £65 million in Northern Ireland. The statutory limit to
borrowings by the industry in England and Wales is £6,500 million, in Northern
Ireland £500 million and in Scotland £1,500 million, with provision for a
further increase up to £1,950 million.
Generation for the public supply in Britain reached 254,920 gigawatt hours
(GWh)1 in 1976; conventional steam power stations provided 85 per cent of
the total, nuclear stations 13 per cent and gas turbine, hydro-electric and
diesel plant 2 per cent. A high rate of expansion of output was a feature of the
industry in its earliest years, but the rate has slackened and the total of
electricity supplied in 1976 was only 1*5 per cent higher than in 1975.
Public supply power stations in Britain consumed 109 million tons of coal
equivalent in 1976, of which coal accounted for 70 per cent and oil 15 per cent.

Britain at the end of 1976 totalled 67,431 megawatts (MW) including 1,850
MW in Northern Ireland. An analysis of electricity generation by and output
capacity of the public supply system in Great Britain is given in Table 16.

Generation of electricity outside the public supply system is relatively small—
21,978 GWh in 1976. The major sources outside the fuel industries are the
chemical, engineering, paper, and iron and steel industries and the nuclear
power plants of the United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority (UKAEA)

and British Nuclear Fuels Ltd. (BNFL). In 1976 these nuclear plants
supplied 3,210 GWh of electricity to the public supply system.
Average thermal efficiency (the ratio of the electrical energy output to
the heat energy input of the fuel consumed) of conventional steam stations
in England and Wales rose from 20’75 per cent in 1947 to 3i-59 per cent
in 1976-77 as new plant was brought into use. The 20 most efficient stations,
containing much of the newest plant, had an average thermal efficiency of
33-87 per cent in 1976-77.
Advances have been made in the design of steam-generating plant with the
introduction of 500 MW and 660 MW single-shaft generating units. Some 49
units of 500 MW have been installed in 13 stations and seven 660 MW units
have also been installed. Station capacities have increased and there are 11
stations each with a capacity of 2,000 MW including Kingsnorth (Kent),
Europe’s largest mixed-fuel station burning either coal or oil, while Britain’s
largest power station is at Longannet (Fife), a 2,400 MW station with four
cross-compound units. About 17,000 MW of plant are under construction in
15 power stations including a 3,300 MW oil-fired station at Grain (Kent),
which will be the largest in Europe, a 1,320 MW station at Peterhead (Gram¬
pian), which will be able to burn natural gas as well as oil, and three nuclear
power stations (see below).
Large gas turbine units of 55 to 70 MW, based on aero jet engines, have
been introduced since 1965 for peak load operation. The CEGB and SSEB
have installed 916 MW of such units. Many others of 17 to 35 MW capacity
are being used in new stations to safeguard auxiliary supplies to the large
new steam units and also to provide capacity for peak operation. Two 58 MW
prototype units at Leicester are powered by industrial gas turbines.
Britain has been implementing a substantial nuclear power programme since
the mid-1950s, the primary purpose being to produce an additional energy
source for the generation of electricity. In 1956 the world’s first large-scale
nuclear power station, at Calder Hall (Cumbria), began to supply electricity
to the main transmission system (the national grid).
There are 11 nuclear power stations in operation controlled by the electricity
authorities, while a further five stations are controlled by the United Kingdom
Atomic Energy Authority (see p. 375) or British Nuclear Fuels Ltd. The
UKAEA has three experimental or prototype stations which feed electricity
into the national grid: the Advanced Gas-cooled Reactor (AGR) at Windscale,
Cumbria (32 MW); the Steam Generating Heavy Water Reactor (SGHWR)
at Winfrith, Dorset (100 MW); and the Prototype Fast Reactor (PFR) at
Dounreay, Highland (250 MW). BNFL owns and operates the two original
Magnox stations, both of 198 MW, at Calder Hall and Chapelcross (Dumfries
and Galloway).
Under the first commercial programme, nine Magnox stations with a total
design capacity of 4,800 MW were commissioned between 1962 and 1971.
They range in size from Berkeley (Gloucestershire) with a design capacity of
276 MW to the most recent, Wylfa (Gwynedd), which has a capacity of 1,180
MW. Two 1,320 MW AGR stations at Hinkley Point B (Somerset) and
Hunterston B (Strathclyde) were commissioned in 1976 and the three other
stations being built under this programme (Dungeness B, Kent, 1,200 MW;
Hartlepool, Cleveland, 1,320 MW; and Heysham, Lancashire, 1,320 MW)
should be commissioned by 1979. Commercial nuclear power stations, which

have lower operating costs than conventional stations, generated 32,420 GWh
in 1976, about 13 per cent of public supply electricity production in Britain.
A third programme using the SGHWR, which runs on uranium dioxide
fuel in zirconium alloy cans, was announced in 1974. An initial phase of 4,000
MW of nuclear capacity was planned comprising two SGHWR stations—
Sizewell B with four 660 MW reactor units and Torness (Lothian) with two.
The Government is carrying out a review of the thermal reactor programme
and is also reviewing proposals for a full-scale demonstration fast reactor,
which would use as fuel a mixture of plutonium and uranium dioxides in
stainless steel cans and be capable of releasing some 60 times as much energy
from uranium as present nuclear power stations.
BNFL provides nuclear fuel services covering the design and development of
plant, procurement and processing of uranium, uranium enrichment, fuel
element fabrication, transport and reprocessing of spent fuel, and the manu¬
facture of specialised components and preparation of radioactive materials.
All of BNFL’s shares are held by the UKAEA. BNFL is organised into three
divisions covering uranium enrichment, based at Capenhurst (Cheshire); fuel
manufacture, at Springfields (Lancashire); and reprocessing at Windscale
(Cumbria) where uranium, plutonium and radioactive wastes are separated
from irradiated fuel. It is engaged on a ten-year investment programme,
costing about £1,000 million.
Hydro-electric generation is confined almost entirely to Scotland and Wales.
Most of the water-power so utilised is drawn from high-level reservoirs with
their own natural catchment areas. In 1976-77, 2,379 GWh were sent out by
the NSHEB from 54 main and 25 small conventional hydro-electric stations
with a total installed capacity of 1,052 MW; the largest station, Sloy, has a
capacity of 130 MW. The NSHEB also operates pumped-storage schemes at
Cruachan, Strathclyde (400 MW), and Foyers, Highland (300 MW). (In
pumped-storage schemes electricity generated in off-peak periods is used to
pump water to high-level reservoirs from which it descends to drive turbines,
instantly providing a large supply of electricity at peak periods or to meet
sudden increases in demand.) Work is in progress on the construction of a
pumped-storage station at Dinorwic (Gwynedd), which will be the largest of
its type in the world when completed in 1981 and will have an average
generated output of 1,681 MW.
The British system is the largest fully interconnected power network under
unified control in the western world. By 31st March 1977 the main transmis¬
sion lines of the CEGB totalled 13,895 circuit kilometres, of which 11,385
circuit kilometres were at 400,000 volts and the remainder at 275,000 volts.
Primary distribution in England and Wales is at 132,000 volts, secondary
distribution at 33,000 volts, tertiary at 11,000 volts or below and general low
voltage distribution at 240 volts single phase. In Scotland there were 8,316
circuit kilometres of main transmission lines at the end of March 1977, of
which 254 kilometres operated at 400,000 volts, 3,020 circuit kilometres at
275,000 volts and the remainder at 132,000 volts. Primary distribution in
Scotland is at 33,000 volts. Energy movements on the national grid in England
and Wales are controlled through the seven grid control areas, each of which
has a separate control, and the operations are co-ordinated by a National
Control in London. The grid in Scotland is operated from the control centres
at Pitlochry (NSHEB) and at Kirkintilloch (SSEB).

Twin cross-Channel cables between Dungeness and Boulogne are capable
of transmitting up to 160 MW; by this means advantage is taken of the
differences between France and Britain in the timing of peak loads. The
CEGB is studying the possibility of a 2,000 MW cable link with France.
Sales of electricity in 1976 amounted to 220,840 GWh. Industry took 40 per
cent of the total, domestic users 38 per cent and commercial and other users
22 per cent. About one-third of domestic sales is for space heating, one-
quarter for water heating and one-tenth for cooking. Electricity is used in
industry almost entirely for motive power, melting, heating and lighting.
The electricity industry supplies over 22 million consumers of whom
million are in England and Wales; of the remainder I’b million are supplied by
the SSEB, 509,800 by the NSHEB and 503,000 by the Northern Ireland
Electricity Service.
The Electricity Council, in consultation with the Secretary of State for
Energy, is responsible for drawing up a general programme of research
comprising direct research carried out by the council and electricity boards
supported by co-operative research with selected industrial research associa¬
tions and by research contracts placed with universities and other organisa¬
tions. Collaboration on research between the supply industry and the plant
manufacturers is co-ordinated by the Power Engineering Research Steering
Committee. The research establishments run by the CEGB comprise the
Central Electricity Research Laboratories at Leatherhead, Surrey, the
Berkeley Nuclear Laboratories in Gloucestershire and the Marchwood
Engineering Laboratories on Southampton Water. Research on distribution
technology and electricity utilisation is undertaken at the Electricity Council
Research Centre at Capenhurst (Cheshire) and by the area boards.
Both Scottish electricity boards carry out research and experimental work
on their own and in co-operation with other electricity authorities.
Research is proceeding on alternative sources of energy (sea-wave power,
solar energy, geothermal energy, wind power and tidal power), although
little contribution to Britain’s energy supply is expected before the year 2000.
The most promising long-term alternative sources are wave-power (because
of Britain’s long coastline and favourable geographical position) and solar
heat. In 1976 the Department of Energy established a two-year research pro¬
gramme (which was enlarged in 1977) to examine the feasibility of the large-
scale extraction of power from waves and four devices are being evaluated. A
substantial expansion in government-funded research and development on
solar energy was announced in February 1977 with a four-year programme
to identify its potential contribution and to stimulate the development of
cost-effective solar technologies, particularly on water and space heating in
houses (the areas of greatest potential return). A three-year research pro¬
gramme on geothermal energy, announced by the Department of Energy in
1976, involves collection of geophysical data in the areas considered to have
the most suitable geological conditions and identification of the markets for
the relatively low-grade heat produced.
NON-FUEL MINERALS
Although much of Britain’s requirements of industrial raw materials is met
by imports, non-fuel minerals produced in Britain make an important con¬
tribution to the economy. Output of non-fuel minerals in 1975 totalled 350
million tonnes, valued at £581 million. The total number of employees in the

industry was 44,400 in 1975. The geographical locations of some of the more
important minerals produced in Britain are shown on the maps on p. 261.
The exploration for and exploitation of indigenous mineral resources to meet
the requirements of British industry are being encouraged by the Government
to minimise dependence on imports. Under the Mineral Exploration and
Investment Grants Act 1972 there is provision for financial assistance of up
to 35 per cent of the cost of searching for mineral deposits in Great Britain
and on Britain’s Continental Shelf, and evaluating them for commercial
purposes. Minerals included in the scheme are the ores of non-ferrous
metals, fluorspar, barium minerals and potash. By the end of March 1977, 38
companies had sought assistance totalling £1-8 million in respect of 138
exploration projects, mainly for non-ferrous metals. Work on 73 projects has
been completed.
The Institute of Geological Sciences, a component body of the Natural
Environment Research Council, is carrying out on behalf of the Department
of Industry a five-year programme aimed at identifying areas with the poten¬
tial for economic extraction of minerals. It also has an annual programme for
the Department of the Environment to assess resources of sand and gravel,
and limestone.
Production of non-ferrous ores in 1975 totalled 28,700 tonnes, valued at
£21 million. Tin was first worked in Cornwall over 2,000 years ago. In the
eighteenth and nineteenth centuries Britain was a leading world producer of
copper, lead and tin, but subsequently overseas competition led to the
closure of many mines and falling production. Changing world markets have
brought some recovery in production; output of tin has more than trebled
since 1970 to reach 3,300 tonnes of tin-in-ore in 1976, supplying 25 per
cent of Britain’s tin requirements. Small amounts of copper, zinc, tungsten
and silver are produced in association with the tin. Production of iron ore
(4-5 million tonnes in 1975) has fallen substantially in recent years.
Britain is a major world producer of several important industrial minerals
including china clay, ball clay, fuller’s earth, salt, fluorspar, and gypsum, and
also produces significant amounts of limestone, dolomite, chalk, industrial
sands and fireclay, mostly for consumption in Britain. China clay is used
mainly as a filler and coater for fine-quality paper, for making high-quality
pottery and also in the paint, rubber, plastics, insecticide and fertiliser
industries. Most of the output of china clay and about half the output of
ball clay are exported. Fuller’s earth is used in refining, as a bonding agent in
foundry moulding sands, for oil-well drilling muds and in civil engineering.
Fireclay is used for ceramic ware and refractory products.
Britain is virtually self-sufficient in salt, output in 1975 being 7-6 million
tonnes valued at £25 million. In 1975 production of fluorspar for the chemical
and metallurgical industries was 235,000 tonnes valued at £8 million and
of gypsum for the construction industry was 3-3 million tonnes worth £9
million. Potash, used mainly for fertiliser manufacture, is being produced by a
new mine at Boulby (Cleveland).
In 1975 production of limestone and dolomite totalled 95 million tonnes,
valued at £149 million, of which about 25 per cent was used in industry,
particularly in the iron and steel, chemicals and glassmaking industries.
Chalk production in 1975 amounted to 18 million tonnes worth £13 million, of
which some 16 million tonnes were used in industry or agriculture, mostly for

cement manufacture. Industrial sands are used primarily in the glassmaking
and foundry industries; output in 1975 was 6 million tonnes.
Britain also produces small amounts of barytes, talc, diatomite, calcspar,
chert and flint, celestite and anhydrite.
Production of sand, gravel and crushed rock as aggregates for use in construc¬
tion constituted over half of Britain’s output of minerals in 1975. Sand and
gravel, used for concrete, is the most important of these minerals and the
largest user of land. Of the total output of 125 million tonnes of common
sand and gravel in 1975, worth £164 million, 14-6 million tonnes were
marine-dredged and Britain is the world’s largest producer of marine-
dredged aggregates. Production of limestone for aggregates was 67 million
tonnes in 1975. Output of sandstone in 1975 was 13 million tonnes valued at
£26 million and of igneous rock 42 million tonnes valued at £87 million.
Small amounts of limestone, sandstone, igneous rock and slate are used as
building stone and architectural facing material.
Production of limestone, chalk and clay as raw materials for cement
manufacture was 10 million, 14 million and 4 million tonnes respectively in
1975. Some 17 million tonnes of clay and shale were produced for the manu¬
facture of bricks, pipes and tiles.
WATER SERVICES
Water services in England and Wales are being consolidated and developed
within a reorganised national industry with a substantial programme of
capital expenditure of about £400 million. The arrangements reflect the
interdependence of the different parts of the hydrological cycle by bringing
all aspects of water services within any river basin or catchment area under
one management, thus ensuring a more effective use of available resources.
This broad concept finds expression in the Water Act 1973; somewhat
different arrangements apply in Scotland (see p. 264) and Northern Ireland
(see p. 264).
Water services are defined to include the development of water resources;
water distribution and supply; the prevention of pollution (see p. 169);
sewerage and sewage treatment; river management; land drainage; sea de¬
fences; recreation; and freshwater fisheries.
Water resources are, with progressive development, normally sufficient for
domestic and industrial requirements. Supplies are obtained partly from
surface sources such as mountain lakes, streams impounded in upland
gathering grounds and river intakes (one-third comes from rivers), and partly
from underground sources by means of wells, adits and boreholes. In 1975-76
the driest period of weather since records began to be kept in 1727 led the
Government to pass the Drought Act 1976, which enabled water authorities
to restrict non-essential uses of water and, if necessary, to ration supplies.
Subsequent very heavy rainfall replenished surface and underground sources
by the spring of 1977, but the Act has been retained as providing important
reserve powers. Most householders pay for their domestic water supply and
sewerage through charges based on the rateable value of their property. The
Water Charges Equalisation Act 1977 is designed to narrow the range of
average domestic charges between the various water authorities. Most
industrial users are charged for their water supply according to actual
metered consumption.

Wales rests with the Secretaries of State for the Environment and for Wales
and the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food who, under the Water
Act 1973, are charged with responsibility for securing the conservation,
augmentation, distribution and proper use of water resources and the provi¬
sion of water supplies; the provision of sewerage and sewage disposal services;
the restoration and maintenance of the wholesomeness of rivers and other
inland waters; the use of inland waters for navigation and recreation; the
provision of land drainage; and the protection and development of fisheries.
Among bodies set up under the Water Act 1973 is the National Water Council
to advise and assist ministers and water authorities. The council consists of a
chairman appointed by the Secretaries of State, the chairmen of the water
authorities, and ten other members with special relevant knowledge, of whom
eight have been appointed by the Secretaries of State and two by the Minister
of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food.
Nine regional water authorities in England and the Welsh National Water
Development Authority in Wales were set up under the Act and duties relating
to water management in their areas were transferred to them. The board of each
water authority consists of a chairman and several members appointed by the
Secretary of State for the Environment, or, in the case of the Welsh Authority,
by the Secretary of State for Wales, a few members appointed by the Minister
of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food and a small majority, usually of only
one, of members appointed by the county and district councils within the
area of the authority. District councils usually also act as agents of water
authorities for the design, construction, operation and maintenance of public
sewers in their areas.
The Act provides for the continued supply of water by 28 statutory water
companies for the water authorities. It makes special arrangements governing
the relationship of statutory water companies to the water authorities and
for control of the latter over them.
An independent Central Water Planning Unit provides a professional water
planning capability at national level. Its principal functions are to keep
under review national and strategic aspects of water services planning and
operation.
The Water Data Unit, part of the Department of the Environment, has as
its principal functions to advise on information required for water manage¬
ment purposes, to ensure common standards and methods of data collection
and to publish such data on a national basis.
The Water Space Amenity Commission advises the Secretary of State for
the Environment, the National Water Council and the water authorities on
the discharge of their functions relating to recreational and amenity use of
water space in England. Separate arrangements apply in Wales. All regional
water authorities are pursuing active policies for the support and develop¬
ment of fishing and other water sport and amenity interests in their regions,
particularly on the reservoirs already in their possession or in process of
being built.
Public water supplies in England and Wales, reaching over 99 per cent of
the population, total some 3,320 million gallons (15-09 million cubic metres)

a day, out of a total estimated abstraction of nearly 8,217 million gallons
(37-35 million cubic metres) a day (excluding water used for cooling in
connection with electricity generation). Capital expenditure in 1976-77 on
water supply, sewerage and sewage disposal is estimated at £508 million (at
1976 prices).
The provision of piped supplies for rural areas has been assisted by grants
under the Rural Water Supplies and Sewerage Acts 1944 to 1971. By March
1977 schemes costing some £570 million had been completed or were in
progress with the aid of grants under these Acts totalling £129 million.
The Government has announced its intention of strengthening the industry
at the centre by establishing a National Water Authority (NWA) which
would absorb the National Water Council, the Water Research Centre, the
Central Water Planning Unit and part of the Water Data Unit. The NWA
would have the key role of national strategic planning for the industry as a
whole.
In Scotland responsibility for public water supply, sewerage and sewage
disposal rests with the nine regional and three islands councils set up in
May 1975 under the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1973. Additionally
the Central Scotland Water Development Board, established under the
Water (Scotland) Act 1967, is primarily responsible for developing large
water sources and supplying water in bulk to its six constituent member
authorities, the regional councils in Central Scotland.
Responsibility for the regulation of the discharges of effluents to rivers and
certain tidal waters lies with seven river purification boards and the three
islands councils.
There is in Scotland a relative abundance of unpolluted water from upland
sources. The Secretary of State for Scotland is responsible for the promotion
of the conservation of water resources and of the provision by water authori¬
ties of adequate water supplies. Over 98 per cent of the population have a
public water supply. The Secretary of State also has a duty to promote the
cleanliness of rivers and other inland waters and the tidal waters of Scotland.
The Scottish River Purification Advisory Committee advises the Secretary
of State on matters relating to the cleanliness of rivers in Scotland.
Northern Ireland has abundant potential supplies of water for both domestic
and industrial consumption. Over 90 per cent of the population has a piped
supply. Between 1945 and end-September 1973 over £100 million was
expended on water and sewerage services, about £50 million by way of
government grants. The Government, responsible for water conservation
and pollution control under the Water Act (NI) 1972, took over from local
authorities, on 1st October 1973, responsibility for water supply and sewerage
services, and these are provided by the Northern Ireland Department of the
Environment. Capital expenditure during 1976 amounted to around £19
million.
The largest source for water supply is Lough Neagh and in order to
conserve the potential and to co-ordinate the various interests and demands
on this water resource system a comprehensive water management programme
has been prepared.
Barrage projects involve dams across or within tidal estuaries to form a lake
of fresh water, and studies have been carried out for several estuaries in
Britain. A report on a study for Morecambe Bay, Lancashire, published early

in 1972, put forward several suggested schemes, including a barrage and
storage reservoirs. Reports have also been prepared for plans for the Wash and
the estuary of the Dee. A feasibility study for the River Parrett, Somerset,
barrage scheme, completed in January I975> adds land drainage, flood pre¬
vention, recreational amenity and road linkage to the wrater storage objective.
A Water Research Centre which started operating in April 1974 co-ordinates
water research in the whole of Britain (see p. 376). The Water Research
Centre s station at Medmenham and the Hydraulics Research Station of the
Department of the Environment at Wallingford carry out research into
problems of the design and calibration of gauging weirs and flumes for the
measurement of surface water, and into other hydraulic problems.
The Water Research Centre’s Laboratory at Stevenage investigates
problems connected with the treatment of polluted water, the treatment and
disposal of sewage and industrial waste water, and the effects and prevention
of pollution of surface water and underground water.
The Institute of Hydrology of the Natural Environment Research Council
at Wallingford studies the whole hydrological cycle, and the Meteorological
Office (see p. 380) is concerned with rainfall.

AGRICULTURE
Although Britain is a densely populated, industrialised country relying on
imports for nearly half its food supply, agriculture remains one of its most
important industries. It occupies 669,000 people or 27 per cent of the total
civilian working population, provides about 2-5 per cent of the gross domestic
product, and uses 19 million of the 24 million hectares (47 million of the 60
million acres) of land.
THE LAND AND The soils of the country are varied (see p. 4). Land used for farming is con-
ITS USES ventionally divided into land suitable for cultivation (crops and grass) and
rough grazing. In hill country the area of cultivated land is often small, but is
usually supplemented by grazing on a comparatively large area of hill land.
In Britain there are 12 million hectares (30 million acres) under crops and
grass. Cultivated land, rough grazing, woodland and other land on agricultural
holdings together represent 79 per cent of the land area. The rest is mountain
and forest, or put to urban and kindred uses. The area available for farming
is gradually decreasing to meet the needs of housing and industry; so far, the
loss has been offset by increasing productivity on the land being farmed.
Size and There are about 270,000 statistically significant farming units in Britain. Some
Ownership 38 per cent are very small units, mostly farmed part-time, and accounting for
of Farms less than 6 per cent of the industry’s total output. Of the 166,000 full-time farm
businesses some 39,500 are classified (by standard man-days) as large farm
businesses (capable of employing four or more men full-time); these, account¬
ing for some 15 per cent of the number of holdings, produce more than half
of the industry’s total output. There are about 51,000 medium-sized (two-
three men) and some 61,500 small farm businesses.
Amalgamation of small farms into larger, more viable units has been
encouraged by successive governments. The average size of full-time holdings is
about 101 hectares (250 acres) of crops and grass (including rough grazings).
Some 33,000 of the total of significant farming units are in Northern
Ireland; over half of these provide a full-time occupation for the owner and
produce over four-fifths of the total output. The average farm size is 23
hectares (57 acres). Other holdings, of which there are about 16,000, are
either extremely small or let in conacre (seasonal lettings for crops or grazing).
In Great Britain more than half, and in Northern Ireland almost all, farms are
owner-occupied.
Types of The increasing use of intensive methods of production both in crops and in
Farming animal husbandry has led to greater specialisation. Three-fifths of the full¬
time farms in Britain are devoted mainly to dairying or beef cattle and sheep;
one in six is a cropping farm and the remainder specialise in pigs, poultry or
horticulture, or are mixed farms. In England the farms devoted primarily to

arable crops are in the eastern part of the country. In Scotland the farms of the
east coast are also primarily arable. Large-scale potato and vegetable production
is characteristic of the Fens (south Lincolnshire and Cambridgeshire), the
alluvial areas around the rivers Thames and Humber and the peaty lands in
south Lancashire. Early potatoes are an important crop in Dyfed and south¬
west England. Elsewhere, horticultural crops are widely dispersed amongst
agricultural crops.
Dairying occurs widely, but there are concentrations in south-west Scot¬
land, the western parts of England and south-west Wales, where the wetter
climate encourages the growth of good grass. Sheep and cattle are reared in the
hill and moorland areas of Scotland, Wales and northern and south-western
England. Beef fattening takes place partly on better grassland areas and partly
in yards on arable farms.
In Northern Ireland dairying is the main occupation on 40 per cent of the
full-time farms, while a further 35 per cent concentrate on beef and sheep
production. The remainder are either specialised cropping and horticultural
holdings, intensive pig and poultry units, or mixed farms with no predominant
single enterprise.
Britain has one of the heaviest tractor densities in the world, with 526,000
tractors in 1976 or one to every 13 hectares (33 acres) of arable land. Power-
take-off implements now characterise arable farming; and some 59,000
combine harvesters were in use in 1976. A wide variety of machines for
harvesting and preservation of grass are employed. Milking machines are
installed on all except the smallest farms.
Over 90 per cent of the farms in Great Britain have an electricity supply and
accompanying equipment. Through machinery syndicates farmers have the
use of expensive equipment whose capital cost is shared among members.
Research, development and testing of farm machinery are carried out by
the National Institute of Agricultural Engineering.
The increase in production which has occurred over the past decades is a
result of the effort of individual farmers, of farmers’ organisations, of research
workers and advisers and of government action. The role of the Government
is described on pp. 273-7. Some production is carried out on a co-operative
basis (see p. 273).
The steady expansion in production and in yield per hectare of arable land
which has taken place since 1936 despite falling manpower is summarised in
Table 17, which also shows the effect of the drought during 1975—76. Total
cattle stocks reached a record of 15-2 million in 1974 but fell to 14-1 million
in 1976. Over the past decade there has been a substantial growth in the
number of beef cattle and poultry, a less marked increase in the number of
dairy cattle and pigs, and a slight fall in the sheep flock. Arable production has
shown a greater diversification since the second world war. Total cereals
production has increased greatly since i960, reaching over 16 million tonnes
in 1974-75; it: fel1 in and again in 1976-77 to about 13-5 million
tonnes, with the drought substantially reducing yields. Potato production is
susceptible to weather conditions but, on average, adequate supplies are main¬
tained from a steadily declining area. Between 1963 and 1973-74 increases in
output of pigmeat, eggs, beef and milk resulted in higher consumption of
feedingstuffs, mostly from home resources. In 1975-76 some 5-4 million
tonnes of concentrated feeds were imported; the level of imports depends,
however, on the size of the home crop of cereals.

commercially significant holdings reached 120 in 1974-75. Unfavourable
weather affected production in the two following years; the index is forecast to
fall to 97 in 1976-77.
Wheat is grown mainly in the eastern half of England. About 4-8 million
tonnes were harvested in 1976, with average yields estimated at 3*88 tonnes
per hectare (i-55 tons per acre). About one-half of the wheat crop is used for
flour milling, the remainder going mainly for animal feed.
Since i960 the area under barley has increased by about 60 per cent. The
malting and distilling market currently absorbs about one-fifth of the crop;
most of the remainder is retained by farms or sold for animal feed.
The widespread use of combine harvesters has necessitated the installation
of drying and storage facilities on many farms. Such equipment is also often
used on a co-operative basis.
The total area of fodder crops has fallen since i960 because in many cases
farmers can provide winter feed more economically by increased grass produc¬
tion and improved methods of conservation. The principal fodder crops are
turnips, swedes and kale in England, and turnips and swedes in Scotland.
Beet is grown under contract to the British Sugar Corporation Ltd. (the sole
British processor) which also provides technical advice and assistance. The
corporation contracts annually for the area from which it will buy beet; the
contracted area has risen over the past few years to about 206,000 hectares
(509>000 acres) in I977’ ^ normal yields this should produce about one million
tonnes of sugar—about 44 per cent of total British consumption. (The balance
is largely supplied, under the Lome Convention (see p. 357), by developing
countries which export raw cane sugar.)
First supplies of early potatoes normally come at the end of May, and the
lifting of maincrop varieties usually starts in September. Seed potato production
for Britain and for export is chiefly centred in Scotland and Northern Ireland.
Britain is normally self-sufficient in maincrop potatoes. As yields are
increasing, requirements can usually be met from a declining area.
The total area planted with potatoes in 1976 was 222,000 hectares (549,000
acres) and the average yield per hectare was 21-6 tonnes, compared with more
than 30 tonnes in years when weather had been more favourable. This resulted
in total supply (including imports) being well below normal. Although potato
production is becoming increasingly mechanised, much hand labour is still
needed.
Hops, which are grown for the brewing industry, occupy only about 6,000
hectares (15,000 acres) but have a very high yield per hectare and value by
weight.
The British climate suits grassland farming. Grassland is important in the
economy of most farms. Grassland production has been enhanced over recent
years by the development and application of new techniques, notably the
increased use of fertilisers, new methods of grazing control, improved herbage
conservation for winter feed and irrigation. Rough grazings are used for
extensively grazed flocks and herds, producing young animals for fattening
elsewhere.
A great number of specialised breeds of livestock have been developed over
the centuries in Britain. Substantial sales of animals and semen are made to
overseas buyers seeking to replenish and improve their herds and flocks.

British breeds have recently been joined by a number of continental breeds.
Artificial insemination plays an important part in cattle breeding, about
two-thirds of the dairy herd in England, Scotland and Wales being bred in
this way.
In England, Scotland and Wales more milk goes for liquid consumption
than for manufacture, but in Northern Ireland the greater part of the milk is
used for manufactured products. Average consumption of liquid milk per
head is 2-61 litres (about 4-6 pints) a week.
Average yields per dairy cow have increased during the last decade by about
18 per cent and now average some 4,200 litres (925 gallons) a year. Freedom
from tuberculosis has reduced herd wastage, and a campaign to eradicate
brucellosis is well advanced. Milk production has been stimulated by advances
in grassland management, intensive grazing techniques and new methods of
grass conservation.
Although there are several breeds of beef cattle, two-thirds of home-fed beef
production derives from the dairy herds, some females being mated to beef
sires. Large numbers of store cattle (including animals imported from the Irish
Republic) are moved for fattening from hill and upland areas to lowland
pastures.
Britain has a long tradition of sheep production, and more than 40 breeds and
innumerable crosses are to be found in the country. Research has provided
vaccine and sera protection against nearly all the epidemic diseases.
Draft ewes and lambs are brought every autumn from the hill areas, where
winters are usually severe, to swell the lowland flocks, usually in two stages:
first, to farms at intermediate altitudes, where they are mated with rams of a
larger and more rapidly maturing breed; then, the cross-bred progeny pass on
to the milder lowland conditions, where they become crossed again with Down
rams for fat lamb production. The hill breeds bring in hardiness, and the
lowland sires fecundity and early maturity. Store and fat lamb production
provides the main source of income for sheep farmers but wool is also of
considerable importance, especially to farmers in hill areas.
Pig production is carried on in most parts of Britain but is particularly
important in the eastern and southern counties of England and in Northern
Ireland. There is an increasing concentration into specialist units and larger
herds. Artificial insemination is available nationally.
About 25 per cent of the pigmeat is used for bacon and 75 per cent for
pork and manufacturing into sausages and other processed forms.
The British poultry industry has expanded rapidly in recent years, aided by
the application of improved husbandry and management techniques in
intensive production units and by genetic improvements in stock. Some
four-fifths of the laying birds on farms are in flocks of 5,000 or more, while
about three-quarters of the broilers are in flocks of 50,000 or more. The average
yield of eggs per bird is about 235 a year. Nearly all eggs and poultry meat
consumed in Britain are home-produced.
The horticultural industry produces a wide variety of fruit, vegetables and
flower crops which are worth nearly 10 per cent of the total value of agri¬
cultural output; in 1976-77 their value was estimated at £595 million.
At the June 1976 census the land on which these crops were grown amounted
to nearly 289,000 hectares (714,000 acres), about 2-4 per cent of the land used

for crops and grass. Fruit accounted for about 67,000 hectares (166,000
acres), vegetables, excluding potatoes, for about 206,000 hectares (509,000
acres) and flowers, bulbs and nursery stock for about 13,000 hectares (32,000
acres). Crops under glass, plastic and in sheds, including mushrooms,
occupied about 2,000 hectares (5,000 acres).
Horticultural crops are largely grown on specialised holdings but some,
particularly vegetables for processing, are produced on mixed farms. Most
horticultural enterprises are increasing output per unit area with the help of
improved planting material, new techniques of cultivation and environmental
control, and the widespread use of machinery.
Field vegetables, with half the output of horticulture and about 206,000
hectares (509,000 acres) in area (excluding potatoes), are the most important
horticultural sector. They are widely spread over the country, with intensive
concentrations in the Thames Valley and Worcestershire and extensive
production in the eastern counties. Some 15 per cent are destined for
processing.
Of the land used for fruit growing in 1976, 16,000 hectares (39,500 acres) were
devoted to soft fruit and the remainder was under orchards. The area of
apple orchards (excluding cider apples) is some 29,000 hectares (72,000
acres). Dessert apples are the most important fruit crop. England and Northern
Ireland are among the few countries which grow varieties of apples especially
suitable for cooking. There are about 5,000 hectares (12,350 acres) in the
western Midlands and the south-west of England devoted to cider apple
production.
Although pears thrive best in the warmer continental climate, in the east
and south-east of England, where the conditions are most suitable, some high-
quality varieties are produced. Cherries and plums are grown in Kent, and
plums also in the Vale of Evesham and parts of East Anglia. Around Perth in
Scotland is the largest concentration of raspberry plantations in the world.
Strawberries are the most widely grown soft fruit, accounting for some 7,000
hectares (17,300 acres), with early production in the south and west of
England. Blackcurrants are also widely grown in Britain, mainly for the
preparation of juice for the manufacture of soft drinks and flavours for
confectionery. Other fruits include gooseberries, red and white currants,
loganberries and blackberries.
Much of the glasshouse sector of the horticultural industry has been re-
equipped since the mid-1960s with the aid of grants. There are now, in many
parts of the country, units with automatic control of heating and ventilation,
and semi-automatic control of watering coupled with carbon-dioxide enrich¬
ment of the atmosphere. Tomatoes form the most important glasshouse crop,
and, together with lettuce and cucumbers, represent some 96 per cent of the
total value of glasshouse vegetable output. There is also increasing production
of new crops under glass, and the areas under sweet peppers and celery have
increased significantly. Mushrooms, whose farmgate value is forecast at over
£29 million for 1976-77, are grown in specially constructed sheds in most
parts of Britain, with concentrations in the eastern and northern counties of
England.
Bulbs occupied some 5,300 hectares (13,100 acres) and hardy nursery stock
some 7,000 hectares (17,300 acres) in June 1976; flowers in the open took
about 1,200 hectares (3,000 acres).

Agricultural products are marketed mainly through private trade channels,
through producers’ co-operatives or through marketing boards operating under
the Agricultural Marketing Act 1958 or Northern Ireland legislation. The
marketing boards are producers’ organisations with statutory powers to
regulate the marketing of particular products. The schemes under which they
are constituted and operate must be approved by Parliament and, except in
Northern Ireland, confirmed by a poll of the producers. Most board members
are elected by the producers but a minority are appointed by the minister or
ministers concerned. Further safeguards serve to protect consumers and
other interests affected by schemes and the public interest generally.
Marketing boards fall into two categories: first, those which are sole buyers
of the regulated product from all producers not specially exempted, or those
which control all contracts between producers and first buyers; and, secondly,
boards which maintain only a broad control over marketing conditions, leaving
producers free otherwise to deal individually with buyers. The boards for hops,
milk and wool, and the Northern Ireland pigs and seed potato boards fall into
the first category, and the Potato Marketing Board into the second.
For certain other commodities there are broadly based organisations
representing producer, distributor and independent interests.
The Home-Grown Cereals Authority was set up to improve the marketing
of home-grown cereals. It provides market intelligence, operates a wheat
classification scheme, and promotes research and development. It also acts
as agent for the Intervention Board for Agricultural Produce in respect of
the support buying, storage and disposal of cereals and oilseed rape.
The Meat and Livestock Commission is charged with improving the pro¬
duction, marketing and distribution of livestock and meat in Great Britain. It
has a range of executive functions extending from breeding to retail distribu¬
tion, including acting as agents for the Agricultural Departments and the
Intervention Board in administering price support schemes. In Northern
Ireland, the aim of the Livestock Marketing Commission is to improve the
structure of the livestock and meat industries, and the marketing of livestock
and livestock products.

OF THE

The Eggs Authority, which represents the industry and consumers, has the
general duty of improving the marketing of eggs. It provides market intelligence,
carries out promotional work and undertakes research and development
projects.
Under the Common Agricultural Policy of the European Community (see
p. 274) a wide range of horticultural produce is subject to common quality
standards which, with certain minor exceptions, apply at all stages of distribu¬
tion. The Community standards apply to all produce entering Britain and to
British produce sold on the domestic market. Community regulations prescribe
grades consisting of a range of up to four classes, and specify requirements
concerning colour, size, packaging, presentation and labelling. All fruit and
vegetables subject to the standards and exported from or imported into the
Community must meet the requirements of at least Class II.
The Central Council for Agricultural and Horticultural Co-operation was
established to promote and develop co-operation in agriculture and horticul¬
ture and to administer a scheme of grants. The Agricultural and Horticultural
Co-operation Scheme 1971 provides grants for co-operative production and
marketing of agricultural and horticultural produce, including capital grants.
Estimates of farm expenses and sales and the aggregate net income of agri¬
cultural producers are prepared annually by the agricultural departments.
The aggregate net income of farmers (unadjusted for inflation) rose from £455
million in 1965-66 to an estimated ^1,751 million in 1976-77. Of the total farm
output, estimated at £6,242 million in 1976-77, nearly two-thirds is in the
form of livestock and livestock products.
Feedingstuffs amount to almost one-third of agriculture’s total cost,'and
wages and machinery (including depreciation) to about one-sixth each. Since
1970 male agricultural workers’ earnings have more than doubled and their
real income has increased by about 25 per cent, but this has been offset by
the manpower economies made possible by increasing mechanisation and
larger farms. Labour productivity rose by about 4-5 per cent a year between
1965-66 and 1975-76.
It is estimated that £231 million was added to the value of buildings and
works and £448 million was invested in new plant, machinery and vehicles in
1976. Most of the capital for investment is generated from within the farm
business; however, outside capital is also important, with bank advances
providing the main source of short- and medium-term credit. Agricultural
merchants are also an important source of short-term credit. Mortgage loans
form the chief source of long-term credit and are provided by specialised
financial institutions (see p. 275) and private sources.
In 1975-76 the average net income for farms in England and Wales of different
types was generally within the range of £50 to £130 per hectare (£20 to £52 per
acre) with the exception of pig and poultry farms and horticultural holdings,
which are more intensive in their use of land. Net income per hectare on dairy
and arable farms has nearly always been higher than on stock-rearing farms,
which are generally greater in area than the other types and are situated on
poorer land.
The functions of government in relation to agriculture are mostly exercised
by the agricultural ministers: for England and Wales the Minister of Agricul¬
ture, Fisheries and Food and the Secretary of State for Wales, for Scotland
274
BRITAIN 1978: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Annual Review
Common
Agricultural
Policy
the Secretary of State for Scotland, and for Northern Ireland the Secretary of
State for Northern Ireland.1 The Advisory Council for Agriculture and Horti¬
culture in England and Wales exists to provide the minister and his depart¬
ment with independent advice on any agricultural or horticultural subjects
remitted to it.
The Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food operates through func¬
tional divisions. Its relations with individual farmers are conducted mainly
through its local offices, grouped in England in regions, with Chief Regional
Officers. Local offices in Wales are grouped under a Welsh Secretary with
similar functions and with special responsibility for Welsh affairs.
Within the machinery of the Economic Development Committees (see
p. 207) there is a committee for agriculture, comprising representatives of
farmers, workers and landowners, as well as official and independent members.
In Scotland most of the agricultural functions of the Secretary of State are
discharged through the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries. The
Secretary of State for Scotland also appoints the members of the Crofters
Commission (see p. 276) and the Red Deer Commission, which deals with the
conservation and control of red deer.
The Northern Ireland Department of Agriculture is responsible for imple¬
menting agricultural policy. It is organised on similar lines to the Ministry
of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, for which it acts as agent in the administra¬
tion in Northern Ireland of British agricultural schemes.
Since 1st February 1973 Britain has applied the European Community
system of agricultural support under the common agricultural policy (CAP)
(see below). The system is administered by the Intervention Board for Agri¬
cultural Produce; although administratively separate from the agricultural
departments, the board is responsible to the agricultural ministers, who remain
responsible for policy.
Each year, in accordance with the requirements of the 1947 Agriculture Act,
the agricultural ministers review the economic condition and prospects of the
agricultural industry in consultation with representatives of producers. The
conclusions drawn from the review contribute, together with views expressed
on behalf of agricultural workers, landowners, consumers and the food industry,
to the formulation of government agricultural policy.
For most commodities British producers rely for support on the mechanisms of
the Common Agricultural Policy of the European Community (CAP). (For
products supported by Britain’s national price guarantees, see p. 275.) Under
the CAP producers’ returns for most of the main commodities are supported
by a combination of charges on imports from outside the Community and in¬
ternal support prices which, for some of the more important products, are main¬
tained by intervention buying when necessary. In addition, export refunds
enable Community exporters to sell on world markets when world prices are
below Community price levels. There is also provision for certain direct pay¬
ments to producers, including beef premiums. By the end of 1977, following a
five-year transitional period, Britain will have adopted full Community price
levels. Community support prices and levels of aid are converted into the cur¬
rencies of the member states by means of fixed representative or ‘green’ rates in
order to avoid fluctuations in support prices as market exchange rates change.
1 The Government has proposed that from 1st April 1978, the Secretary of State for
Wales should have powers in relation to agriculture and fisheries similar to those
exercised by the Secretary of State for Scotland.

Monetary compensatory amounts (mca’s), based on the percentage difference
between the representative and market rates of each currency, are applied to
prevent distortions in trade. They operate as import subsidies and export levies
for countries whose currencies’ market rates are below the representative
rates, and in the opposite case, as import levies and export subsidies.
The level of support prices under the CAP is reviewed by the Community
each year, and the results of the British Annual Review (see p. 274) help to
shape the Government’s approach to the negotiations in Brussels on CAP
support.
Some of the grants paid to farmers under the schemes mentioned below
also come within the scope of the CAP.
In the light of the British Annual Review, agricultural ministers determine
guaranteed prices for the coming year for potatoes, fat sheep, milk and wool.
Guaranteed prices for other commodities have been terminated in accordance
with the Treaty of Accession (see p. 73). The guaranteed price of milk is
also to be terminated by the end of the transitional period; in the meantime
the level of the guarantee is subject to rules laid down under the Treaty of
Accession.
For milk and wool the Government operates the guarantee through the
appropriate marketing boards (see also p. 272) which take account of any
payments from or to the Government in deciding what to pay producers for
their produce. For wool a fixed price is guaranteed to the British Wool
Marketing Board for every pound of fleece wool it buys from producers.
For potatoes ministers fix each year a target area designed to achieve self-
sufficiency. In Great Britain the Potato Marketing Board ensures, as far as
possible, that this area is planted, and may with government agreement under¬
take support buying of any surplus, re-selling as much as possible for stock-
feed. In Northern Ireland the Department of Agriculture undertakes any
support measures. Most of the cost is met by the Government.
In addition to market support under the CAP and the British guaranteed
prices, producers also receive support through certain capital and production
grants. These include grants to help producers with the costs of capital
investment under the Farm Capital Grant Scheme and the Horticulture
Capital Grant Scheme. Grant aid is also available to producers undertaking
development plans under the Farm and Horticulture Development Scheme.
There is also a Payments to Outgoers Scheme, designed to assist in the im¬
provement of farm structure. Special financial assistance, involving headage
payments on breeding cows and ewes and higher rates of capital grant, is also
available under Community arrangements for farmers in less favoured (hill)
areas.
Estimated 1976-77 expenditure in Britain on price guarantees, grants and
subsidies is £201 million, of which £15-5 million is expected to be reimbursed
from the European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund (FEOGA).
Expenditure in Britain under CAP market regulation in 1976-77 is estimated at
about £130 million, of which some £118 million is likely to be reimbursed from
FEOGA.
In England and Wales finance for the purchase or improvement of agricultural
land and buildings is available on the security of a first mortgage from the
Agricultural Mortgage Corporation Ltd., a company which enjoys a measure of
government financial backing but raises its funds on the London capital

market. The Scottish Agricultural Securities Corporation fulfils a similar role
in Scotland.
In Northern Ireland loans are available to farmers from the Agricultural
Loans Fund, administered by the Department of Agriculture and financed out
of public funds.
Where a farmer, grower or co-operative requires a bank loan for business
purposes but cannot provide sufficient collateral, the Agricultural Credit
Corporation Ltd. may be able to provide the bank with a guarantee. The
Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food has power to make grants to the
corporation where the guarantees have to be fulfilled; and in some circumstances
the minister can also meet the guarantee charges normally paid to the corpora¬
tion by the borrower.
In England and Wales scientific, technological and management advice and
services are available through the Agricultural Development and Advisory
Service (ADAS) which operates mainly from the regional and divisional
offices of the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food. The service also
helps to identify problems requiring investigation and research, to suggest
priorities for such work, and where appropriate to contribute to possible
solutions. ADAS provides free, impartial advice to landowners, farmers and
growers, but charges are made for certain services.
In Scotland the agricultural advisory service is provided by the three
regional independent colleges of agriculture which are financed almost
entirely by public funds.
Advisory work in Northern Ireland is under the direction of the Chief
Agricultural Officer of the Department of Agriculture, and Advisory Centres
are located in the main provincial towns. The resources of the agricultural
colleges, the research centres and the specialist divisions of the department are
available to the advisory service.
In England and Wales, about 10,000 smallholdings are provided by local
authorities and about 800 lettable holdings by the Ministry of Agriculture,
Fisheries and Food. The minister and local authorities may make loans of up to
75 per cent of required working capital to their smallholding tenants.
Land settlement in Scotland has always been carried out by the central
Government, which now owns and maintains about 166,400 hectares (411,100
acres) of land settlement estates, comprising some 2,890 crofts and holdings.
Within the crofting areas of Scotland (comprising the former counties of
Argyll, Caithness, Inverness, Orkney, Ross and Cromarty, Sutherland and
Shetland) much of the land is held by crofters or tenants whose holdings are
generally either rented at a cost of not more than £100 a year or have an area
not exceeding 30 hectares (75 acres).
The Crofters Commission is responsible for the administration and regula¬
tion of crofting. It also acts as the Secretary of State for Scotland’s agent in
administering grants to crofters for cropping and land improvement.
In Great Britain more than half, and in Northern Ireland almost all, farms
are owner-occupied. With regard to rented farms, a code of landlord-tenant
relationships has been written into legislation in order to protect the respective
interests of landlords and tenants and to eliminate uncertainty as to their
rights and obligations.
Legislation provides for any tenancy of agricultural land, with the exception
of certain short-term lettings, to continue in force from year to year until ter¬
minated by a valid notice to quit. With certain exceptions the tenant can contest

it by serving a counter-notice; the notice to quit then becomes inoperative unless
the landlord obtains consent to its operation from an independent body (in
England and Wales the Agricultural Land Tribunal and in Scotland the
Scottish Land Court).
There is a code of compensation to which the tenant is entitled on termination
of the tenancy. Rent is a matter for negotiation between landlord and tenant and
may be varied by agreement or, failing agreement, by arbitration.
The Agricultural Branch of the Health and Safety Executive (see p. 326) is
responsible for the enforcement of regulations relating to the health and
safety of workers in agriculture. These regulations cover such matters as the
guarding of field and stationary machinery, farm safety, the fitting of safety
cabs to tractors, and the use of agricultural chemicals. The executive’s Agri¬
culture Industry Advisory Committee assists it in resolving problems of health
and safety in agriculture, including horticulture and forestry.
Ten regional water authorities are responsible for land drainage (including
flood protection) in England and Wales. There are no comparable authorities
in Scotland, where arterial drainage of agricultural land is the owners’
responsibility.
Most of the funds needed by the water authorities are obtained from local
authorities, but the Government pays grants toward the cost of improvement
schemes, varying from 10 per cent to 80 per cent according to the financial
position of the authority, with an additional premium for sea defence works.
Within the water authority areas, in low-lying areas where there are special
local problems of land drainage, there are 288 internal drainage districts
administered by internal drainage boards which carry out work for the special
benefit and protection of their districts. The boards finance their work from
drainage rates levied on owners and occupiers. They also receive a government
grant at a flat rate of 50 per cent for improvement schemes.
Local authorities in England and Wales also have general land drainage
powers and may receive government grants of between 20 per cent and 50 per
cent of the cost of improvement work. In Scotland 60 per cent grants (70 per
cent if for the benefit of hill land) are available to owners or occupiers of
agricultural land who carry out arterial drainage work.
In Northern Ireland the Department of Agriculture is the drainage authority
for watercourses designated by the Drainage Council as main or minor water¬
courses, and also has responsibility for urban drainage.
The day-to-day work of treating animal disease is the responsibility of the
practising veterinary surgeon. Control of animal disease in Great Britain in
accordance with the Government’s policy is the responsibility of the State
Veterinary Service, which is part of the Agricultural Development and
Advisory Service (ADAS). The Veterinary Service also deals with the welfare
of farm livestock.
The work of the Veterinary Service is backed by extensive laboratory
facilities. In addition, in England and Wales 24 investigation centres perform
work requiring specialist knowledge and give advice on disease problems to
private practitioners. In Scotland a similar service is provided by the investiga¬
tion centres of the three Scottish agricultural colleges.
For many years Great Britain has been free from many serious animal
diseases including rinderpest, contagious bovine pleuro pneumonia, sheep pox,
glanders and rabies, except for two isolated cases of rabies in imported dogs

in 1969-70. Since early 1975 the anti-rabies measures have been tightened:
non-farm animals are subject to import licence and six months’ quarantine;
and there are severe penalties for those breaking the law. Sheep scab, eradicated
in 1952, reappeared in 1973, and rigorous measures are being taken to eradicate
it again. The campaign to eradicate swine fever was successfully completed in
1966 and, although three cases of the disease occurred in 1971, the infection
was quickly eliminated. An epidemic of a previously unknown swine vesicular
disease began in December 1972; it is being combated by a stringent slaughter
policy. Foot-and-mouth disease was eradicated after the 1967-68 outbreak. In
i960 the whole of Britain became a bovine tuberculosis attested area. The
incidence of the disease is now very low; cattle (except for certain categories) are
tested at regular intervals and reactors to the test are slaughtered; compensation
is paid to the owners. Voluntary schemes for the eradication of brucellosis have
been in operation since 1967; compulsory eradication on an area basis began in
1972. At the end of March 1977, per cent of all herds in Great Britain were
declared free of the disease. Newcastle disease (fowl pest) has declined to a
low level due to the operation of a vaccination policy.
In Northern Ireland the veterinary services are organised similarly to those
in Great Britain but are administered separately by the Department of
Agriculture for Northern Ireland. Animal health control policies and the
geographical situation have kept the country free from nearly all the major
epizootic diseases, including swine vesicular disease. A Brucellosis Eradica¬
tion Scheme has been successfully carried out and in December 1971 Northern
Ireland was declared brucellosis-free. The full-time veterinary service is
supplemented by the central veterinary laboratory.
The plant health services, operated by the agricultural departments, are
responsible for statutory controls designed to limit the spread of plant pests
and diseases present in Britain and prevent the introduction of new ones from
abroad. They also issue the health certificates required by other countries to
accompany plant material imported from Britain. Certification schemes are
operated to encourage the development of healthy, vigorous and true-to-
type planting stocks. The Plant Pathology Laboratory at Harpenden, Hertford¬
shire, and the Agricultural Scientific Services Station, East Craigs, Edinburgh,
provide scientific and technical advice on which statutory controls and
certification schemes are based.
The Pest Infestation Control Laboratory at Slough, Berkshire, undertakes
research and provides advice on harmful mammals and birds and on insects,
mites and moulds associated with grain and other stored food products. The
laboratory is responsible for regional pest officers who advise farmers, local
authorities and others on control techniques. In Scotland the Agricultural
Scientific Services of the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries have a
similar function and maintain close liaison with the laboratory.
Safeguards against the dangers which could arise from uncontrolled use of
pesticides have been devised and are operating successfully. Products must be
cleared for safety under the Pesticides Safety Precautions Scheme (see p. 168),
and may be submitted through the Agricultural Chemicals Approval Scheme
for efficacy approval.
The Medicines Act 1968 provides through a system of licensing for the
control of the manufacture, sale and supply of veterinary medicinal products
(including those used in animal feedingstuffs). The licensing authority (the

agricultural ministers) is advised by the Medicines Commission, the Veterinary
Products Committee, whose functions are to advise on the safety, quality and
efficacy of veterinary medicinal products, and by other expert committees. (For
other provisions of the Act, see p. 123.)
An outline of the organisation of agricultural research and development in
Britain, including that carried out by the Agricultural Research Council and
the universities, is given on p. 370. The Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and
Food carries out research and development at its own laboratories and on the
22 experimental husbandry farms and horticulture stations operated by ADAS,
and commissions work from the Agricultural Research Council, the Natural
Environment Research Council and outside research organisations. In Scotland
the three colleges which provide the advisory services (see p. 276) also undertake
development and experimental work. In England and Wales, research in
agricultural economics is undertaken by 12 university departments of
agricultural economics.
The Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food has four economic divisions
and two statistics divisions. In Scotland, agricultural economists are on the
staff of three agricultural colleges and the Department of Agriculture and
Fisheries for Scotland.
In Northern Ireland, the Department of Agriculture has nine research
divisions.
Fifteen British universities provide degree and postgraduate courses in
agriculture or agricultural sciences. The National College of Agricultural
Engineering at Silsoe, Bedfordshire, offers degree and postgraduate courses.
Sandwich courses leading to a Higher National Diploma are available at eight
agricultural colleges in England and Wales and there are nearly 50 local
authority and other agricultural colleges providing full-time courses on
different aspects of agriculture, horticulture, forestry and farm management.
A centre for European agricultural studies is based at London University’s
Wye College at Ashford. A Centre for Agricultural Strategy, set up at the
University of Reading in 1975, provides an assessment of British agriculture
with a view to developing long-term strategies.
In Scotland the three agricultural colleges which have the advisory and
development functions are also teaching establishments. They mainly provide
sandwich courses leading to Higher and Ordinary National Diplomas, post¬
diploma courses and certain short courses. In Northern Ireland degree courses
in agriculture and food science are provided at Queen’s University, Belfast.
Courses below this level are provided at three residential colleges run by the
Department of Agriculture.
Local education authorities throughout Britain provide full-time and part-
time courses for farmers, farm workers and horticulturists, as well as an advisory
service for domestic producers.
In Great Britain the Agricultural Training Board provides a training
advisory service, organises training courses and pays training grants. In
Northern Ireland training courses are organised by the Department of
Agriculture.
FISHERIES
The industry catches demersal fish (caught on or near the bottom of the sea),
pelagic fish (caught nearer the surface) and shellfish. The major element of
the catch (nearly 62 per cent by weight) is demersal fish; the catches of

BRITAIN 1978: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
pelagic fish comprise over 29 per cent and the shellfish over 8 per cent of the
total catch. The principal demersal fish (in terms of value) are cod, haddock
and plaice. The most important pelagic species are herring and mackerel.
Shellfish include Crustacea (such as lobsters and crabs) and molluscs (such as
mussels and oysters).
On 1 st January 1977 Britain’s fishery limits were extended to 200 miles (or,
where the distance between two countries’ coasts is less than 400 miles, up to
the median line, that is, half-way between the two coastlines). This followed the
European Community member states’ agreement to adopt such limits jointly,
after similar extensions had been announced by a number of other countries.
The Community is engaged in negotiations with some non-Community
countries to establish reciprocal fishing rights within each other’s limits;
meanwhile temporary arrangements are in force which either allow these
countries to fish up to the levels of catch in 1976 or limit them by quotas
autonomously imposed by the Community. Other countries, including Iceland,
have been excluded from Community waters. British fishermen are still
excluded from the traditionally important grounds off Iceland.
Community countries have the right to fish up to 12 miles off the British
coast; they, as well as a number of other states, also enjoy limited rights to
fishing within Britain’s 6- to 12-mile belt.
With the extension of fishery limits to 200 miles, it is necessary to revise the
Community fisheries’ internal regime to allow for controlled Community
fishing in the greatly extended area. Britain has a particularly strong interest
in such control, since over half of the Community’s fish stocks within the new
limits are in British waters, while Britain catches only a very small proportion
of its needs in the waters of other member states. Strict conservation rules also
need to be enforced and during 1977 several measures were adopted by the
Community’s Council to control industrial fishing (that is, catching fish to be
processed into fish meal) and to protect endangered herring stocks.
The principal fishing ports in England and Wales are Hull, Grimsby, Fleet-
wood, North Shields, Lowestoft, Plymouth, Brixham, Newlyn and Milford
Haven. In Scotland the chief ports for demersal fish are Aberdeen, Peterhead,
Fraserburgh and Lerwick; herring landings are made mainly at the west
coast ports of Stornoway, Ullapool, Mallaig, Oban and Ayr and in the Shetland
Islands. In Northern Ireland the main fishing ports are Kilkeel, Portavogie and
Ardglass.
In the British fishing industry in 1976 there were about 17,000 fishermen
in regular employment and some 5,000 occasionally employed; about 43 per
cent of the former and 26 per cent of the latter were based on Scottish ports. In
Northern Ireland there are about 500 regular fishermen and about 300 part-
time. It is estimated that for every fisherman there are between three and five
jobs in associated trades.
Fishing is an important source of employment and income in certain areas of
Britain, in many of which unemployment is well above the national average.
Maintenance of fishing opportunities, through conservation of stocks in
British waters and through the preservation or restoration of British fishermen’s
access to their traditional distant grounds, is thus vital to Britain.
The chief methods of catching fish are by trawling on the sea bed and, in mid¬
water, seining and purse-seining. Bottom trawling is carried out in the distant

and near waters for all species of demersal fish. Seining is also used for catching
demersal fish all the year round, mainly in the North Sea, the Minches, the
Firth of Clyde and the Irish Sea. Lines and set nets are also used to catch
demersal fish. Midwater trawls and purse-seines are used to catch pelagic fish,
especially herring, mackerel and sprats.
The inshore fisheries comprise a great diversity of types of vessel and
methods of capture. They yield all sorts of fish, and shellfish are important;
there are extensive fisheries for crabs, lobsters, shrimps, mussels, escallops,
cockles and oysters, and off Scotland, north-east England and in the Irish Sea
there are valuable catches of Nephrops (Norway lobsters or Dublin Bay
prawns).
Distant water trawlers, which operate mainly from Hull, Grimsby and Fleet-
wood, number 104. They are 140 feet (42'7 metres) and over in length and
most of them operate in the Barents Sea, around Bear Island and off the coasts
of Norway and Greenland; they are excluded from the traditionally important
fishing grounds off Iceland. Freezer trawlers and factory ships have become
an important part of the distant-water fleet in recent years and number 42.
There are about 365 Scottish seiners, and about 224 operating from English
ports. Excluding seiners, there are about 217 near- and middle-water vessels
of between 80 and 139 feet (24-5 and 42-4 metres) long, and most of them work
nearer home, although some of the larger vessels fish regularly off the Faroes.
Included in the near-water group are vessels engaged in fishing for herring.
The inshore group consists of some 2,000 vessels of over 40 feet (12*2 metres)
and over 7,000 smaller vessels, many of which do not fish regularly.
In 1976 landings of all types of fish (excluding salmon and trout) by British
fishing vessels totalled 932,805 tonnes (574,538 tonnes of demersal fish,
276,244 tonnes of pelagic and 82,023 tonnes of shellfish), valued at £210
million. Cod accounted for 43 per cent of the total value of demersal and
pelagic fish landed by British vessels; haddock (19 per cent) and plaice (7 per
cent) were the other most important sources of earnings to the industry.
Imports of all fresh, frozen and cured fish and shellfish totalled 127,000
tonnes valued at £93 million. Imports of canned and preserved fish and shell¬
fish amounted to 73,000 tonnes valued at nearly £94 million. Imports of fish
meal amounted to 253,000 tonnes, worth £52 million, and those of fish oils to
215,000 tonnes worth nearly £44 million. Exports and re-exports of fish and
fish products amounted to 163,000 tonnes and their worth was valued at
nearly £84 million.
Total fish consumption was running at a level of approximately 18 lb
(8-2 kg) a head in 1976. Home production provided about 82 per cent of
supplies.
The growth of quick-frozen fish production radically altered the structure of
the processing industry. With the increase in quick-freezing, export outlets
for white fish account for about 35 per cent of the total exports of fish and
fish preparations. Experiments are being carried out in the catching and
processing, for human consumption and fish meal, of previously under¬
exploited species of fish of which large stocks are known to exist in the sea
adjacent to the British Isles.
A valuable by-product of the industry is the manufacture of fish meal for
animal food. Home production of white fish meal and herring meal, including
other pelagic fish, in 1976 was about 23,000 tonnes.

Industry Board
The most valuable freshwater fish are salmon and sea-trout. Sea fishing for
salmon is prohibited in a wide area around the British Isles outside the 12-mile
fishery limits. Within the limits drift netting and certain other methods are
prohibited off the coast of Scotland but are permitted under licence off Eng¬
land, Wales and Northern Ireland. In Scotland salmon fishing is a private
right. Water authority licences are required for coastal and estuary netting
carried out in England and Wales. In England and Wales the landed value of
the salmon catch in 1976 was approximately £385,000, in Scotland it amounted
to about £2*5 million and in Northern Ireland to some £401,000. In Northern
Ireland, eels worth £851,000 were captured in 1976.
The principal method of distribution is through wholesalers, located at the
ports, who buy fish at the auctions and sell to inland wholesalers as well as
directly to retail outlets. Fish lorries, including insulated and refrigerated
vehicles, transport the catch daily from the ports to inland centres, although
rail transport is still used from some ports. The principal inland wholesale
distributing centre for fish is Billingsgate Market in London. Trawler-owning
companies have entered into the marketing and distributive system. This
process has been encouraged by the growing popularity of quick-frozen
consumer packs.
The government departments mainly responsible for the administration of
legislation concerning the fishing industry are the Ministry of Agriculture,
Fisheries and Food, the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries for Scotland
and the Department of Agriculture for Northern Ireland.1 The safety and
welfare of crews of fishing vessels and other matters common to shipping
generally are provided for under the Merchant Shipping Acts administered by
the Department of Trade. Research is carried out by the fisheries departments
(see p. 378).
From February 1973 the provisions of the Common Fisheries Policy of the
European Community, based on the establishment of a common organisa¬
tion of the market and a common structural policy, have applied in Britain. The
common organisation of the market aims at assisting in the adaptation of
supplies to marketing requirements, while ensuring, as far as possible, a
reasonable return to producers, by means of the establishment of a common
grading and price system, and common rules on competition. Provision is
also made for the protection of the Community market against disruption by
imports from third countries. The responsibility for market organisation is
placed largely in the hands of the industry itself through producers’ organisa¬
tions. Tariff adjustments for intra-Community trade in fish and trade with
non-Community countries are following the general agricultural timetables
(see p. 274). The common structural policy aims at promoting the harmonious
and balanced development of the fishing industry and the rational exploita¬
tion of resources. It covers access to waters under the jurisdiction of member
states, and conservation in coastal waters (see p. 280), as well as common
measures for the financing of the improvement of the structure of the fishing
industry and the provision of an equitable standard of living for those
engaged in it.
The Herring Industry Board was set up to reorganise, develop and regulate
the herring industry. Its members are appointed jointly by the Minister of
1 See footnote, p. 274.
The White Fish
Authority
AGRICULTURE, FISHERIES AND FORESTRY 283
Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, and the Secretaries of State for Scotland,
Wales and Northern Ireland. The board, whose activities are financed partly
by levies and licence fees and partly by government grants and loans, is
advised by the Herring Industry Advisory Council, which represents all
sections of the industry and consumers.
The functions of the board include the promotion of sales of herring and
the application of the benefits of technical progress to the industry. The board
administers the government grant and loan schemes which provide for assis¬
tance towards the purchase of new fishing vessels and the improvement of
existing vessels. Fishermen may also obtain loans from the board towards the
purchase of second-hand vessels under 80 feet (about 24*5 metres) in length
and towards the cost of new nets and gear. Up to 31st December 1976 about
^7'1 million in loans and ^7’7 rnillion in grants had been approved by the
board.
The function of the White Fish Authority is to reorganise, develop and regulate
the white fish industry, and that of its Committee for Scotland and Northern
Ireland is to advise the authority about the exercise and performance of its
functions in Scotland and Northern Ireland. Membership is by ministerial
appointment. The White Fish Industry Advisory Council, which represents
the various interests of the fishing industry, advises the authority about the
exercise and performance of its functions.
The authority administers government grant and loan schemes for the
purchase of new fishing vessels and engines and the improvement of existing
vessels. It also administers loans to processors, co-operatives, etc., for the
acquisition, reconditioning or improvement of facilities. Up to 31st March
1977 about ^50 million in loans and £60 million in grants had been approved.
Its other activities are financed by levies on first-hand sales of most white fish,
and a government grant towards research and development. In 1973 the
Herring Industry Board and White Fish Authority formed a unified adminis¬
tration for the expected development of fisheries administration under the
Common Fisheries Policy.

(4-93 million acres), or about 87 per cent of the total land area; 45 per cent of
the area is in England, 43 per cent in Scotland, the remainder in Wales.
The area of productive forest managed by the Forestry Commission, at
0-84 million hectares (2*08 million acres), constitutes 50 per cent of this
category. The annual rate of productive forest expansion is currently 15,548
hectares (38,420 acres) by the commission mainly in Scotland, and some
7,232 hectares (17,870 acres) by private woodland owners. The commission’s
programme includes considerable planting in upland areas, and consists mainly
of conifers because of the difficult site conditions encountered.
Total employment in state and private forests was estimated at 21,000 in
i976-
Except for the period of the two world wars, when felling was abnormally
heavy, home woodlands have until recent years made only a limited contribu¬
tion to the nation’s consumption of wood and wood products, as less than half
of the commission’s woodlands are yet in production. Britain imports more
than 90 per cent of its needs, the total import cost of wood and wood products
including pulp and paper being £1,941 million in 1976.

The Forestry Commission is the national forestry authority charged with
promoting the interests of forestry, the development of afforestation and the
production and supply of timber in Great Britain. The commissioners comply
with directions given by the forestry ministers, who are the Minister of Agri¬
culture, Fisheries and Food and the Secretaries of State for Scotland and Wales.
Northern Ireland has its own separate organisation (see p. 285). In pursuing
its main objective, that is, timber production, Great Britain’s forestry policy
also takes into account amenity, environmental and employment criteria.
The commission’s total estate covers some 1 -25 million hectares (3-09 million
acres) and includes 0-94 million hectares (2-32 million acres) of forest land,
of which 0-84 million hectares (2-o8 million acres) are under trees in 237 forests
distributed throughout England, Scotland and Wales. All these forests are
covered by management plans which are concerned not only with planting
and timber production but also with facilities for public recreation, wildlife
conservation and the landscaping of plantations.
As more of its coniferous woods reach the production stage, the commission
has assumed an increasingly important role as a timber seller and has encouraged
the setting up of some 20 major new timber-using industries since the mid-
1960s.
Production of timber from the commission’s woodlands amounted to 2-02
million cubic metres in 1976-77. The timber is used in coal mines, the paper
pulp industry, sawmills and factories producing chipboard, fibreboard and
wood wool.
The expenditure of the Forestry Commissioners is paid out of the Forestry
Fund, into which are paid amounts voted annually by Parliament, together
with the commission’s receipts from sales of produce, rentals and other
sources. In the period ended 31st March 1977 drawings amounted to £27
million, and receipts were ^29*6 million.
Privately owned woods comprise 57 per cent of the total forest area in Great
Britain. About half of the private woodland area is in ownerships of under 200
hectares (500 acres) in extent.
The effective management of private woodlands is encouraged by the
provision of grants administered by the Forestry Commission in return for
which owners accept a continuing obligation to manage their woodlands in
accordance with sound forestry practice. Woodland owners are represented, in
their relations with the Forestry Commission, by the Forestry Committee of
Great Britain, which co-ordinates the work of the Timber Growers’ Organisa¬
tion (for owners in England and Wales) and the Scottish Woodland Owners’
Association.
The Home Grown Timber Advisory Committee advises the Forestry Com¬
mission on certain statutory functions, including promoting the interests of
forestry and the production and supply of timber. It includes representatives
of associations of woodland owners, timber merchants, processors, and other
major timber users and the trade unions.
The Forestry Commissioners also maintain National Committees for
England, Scotland and Wales, which act in an advisory capacity, particularly
on the social, recreational and amenity aspects of the commissioners’ activities
and relationships with other land users. The commissioners also maintain a
regional advisory committee for each conservancy and a consultative panel for
the New Forest.

Forestry education is the responsibility of the education departments. Degree
courses in forestry and associated studies are provided at four universities
and there are supervisory level courses.
The Forestry Training Council makes recommendations to the industry
for meeting requirements for training and associated further education, and
encourages co-operation between the agencies and authorities concerned.
The Furniture and Timber Industry Training Board is concerned with
training for private-sector employees in the home timber trade.
Forestry research is carried out by the Forestry Commission at the Forest
Research Station at Alice Holt Lodge in Surrey and at the Northern Research
Station at Roslin near Edinburgh. Expenditure by the commission on research
work in Great Britain amounted to ^2*5 million in 1976-77. This sum included
grants for special forestry research work to university departments and to
various institutions, including the Commonwealth Forestry Institute at
Oxford, which is also financed by the university, the Ministry of Overseas
Development and overseas governments. Research into the qualities and uses
of home-grown timber is carried out by Princes Risborough Laboratory, and
also by grant-aided associations.
The Department of Agriculture is the forest authority for Northern Ireland. It
can acquire and manage land, and give financial and technical assistance to
private planting.
The state forest area has grown steadily since the end of the second world
war. Over 67,000 hectares (166,000 acres) have been acquired, of which over
50,000 hectares (124,000 acres) have been planted.
Financial provision is made by sums voted annually by Parliament and from
receipts from forest produce and other sources. About 1,500 people are em¬
ployed in the state forests. There are also about 12,000 hectares (30,000 acres)
of privately owned forests, and private planting is assisted by schemes for the
supply of young trees from the department’s nurseries at a low cost, by grants
towards the cost of the establishment and maintenance of plantations, and by
free technical advice.
15 Transport and
Communications
The application of technological developments to Britain’s transport and
communications network is helping to make travel quicker and more con¬
venient. Major improvements in the movement of passengers and freight
within Britain or between Britain and other countries have resulted from the
construction of a network of motorways, the extension of fast inter-city rail
services (such as those operated by high speed trains, introduced in 1976), the
modernisation of many ports, the increased use of containers and other
modern methods in shipping, the use by airlines of larger or speedier aircraft
(such as the Concorde supersonic aircraft) and the expansion of facilities at
many of Britain’s airports.
Transport and communications contribute 9 per cent of Britain’s gross
national product and are responsible for a rather higher proportion of the
nation’s gross domestic fixed capital formation. These activities employed
some 1-4 million people in Great Britain in March 1977 and accounted for 6-6
per cent of the employed labour force. Of these, 429,000 employees were
engaged in road passenger transport and road haulage contracting, 213,000
in railways, 408,000 in postal services and telecommunications, 159,000 in
sea transport, port and inland water transport, 81,000 in air transport and
146,000 in other transport services and storage.
INLAND TRANSPORT
The passenger and freight traffic of Great Britain is carried mainly by road.
However, rail, coastal shipping and, to a lesser extent, pipelines and inland
waterways are important in carrying certain types of freight, particularly bulk
goods. In 1976 about 67 per cent of freight, in terms of tonne-kilometres,
travelled by road, 16 per cent by rail, 14 per cent by coastal shipping, and
3 per cent by pipeline and inland waterway. Much of the inland transport
system of Great Britain is publicly owned, although road haulage and coastal
shipping are almost entirely in the hands of private enterprise.
In the third quarter of 1976 there were 17-8 million vehicles licensed for use
on the roads of Great Britain. Of these 14 million were motor cars, i-8 million
road goods vehicles, 1 -2 million motor cycles, scooters and mopeds and 113,000
public road passenger vehicles (including taxis). Private ownership of cars
has been growing rapidly for many years and the car is now the most popular
form of travel within Great Britain.
Government
Policy
The Government’s transport policy is directed towards helping economic
growth and higher national prosperity, while ensuring a reasonable level of
personal mobility and minimising damage to the environment. Following a
major policy review the Government announced in June 1977 that priority
would be given to maintaining public transport, local authorities would be
given more responsibility for planning and integrating local transport, and a
TRANSPORT AND COMMUNICATIONS
287
Roads

Tunnels
more selective approach to roadbuilding would be adopt ed with emphasis on
specific schemes instead of a strategic network of motorways and trunk roads.
There are three main categories of road in Great Britain: trunk roads (including
most motorways which cater for high-speed traffic) on which much of the
long-distance traffic travels; classified roads; and unclassified roads. Road
mileage in Britain totalled 221,606 miles (356,640 kilometres) in mid-1976
(see Table 19). Motorways and other major roads are shown on the map at
the end of the book.

b As at April 1977.
c In addition, there were 59 miles (95 kilometres) of local authority motorway in use in
England and 9 miles (14 kilometres) in Scotland.
The Government’s programme of road construction and improvement in
England concentrates on improving the main routes between the major
centres of population and industry, ports and airports, although there are also
some local schemes on the less important trunk roads. The general aim is to
enable journey times, accidents and vehicle operating costs to be reduced,
while many towns and villages also benefit by the removal of heavy through
traffic. Priority in the programme is being given to the orbital route around
London and to other schemes of industrial importance. In Wales the Govern¬
ment’s priorities are to complete the motorway across south Wales, reconstruct
the coast road in north Wales and improve roads which are important for
industrial redevelopment. The latter is also a priority in Scotland.
Motor vehicle traffic in Great Britain has recovered from the decline in
1974, which was caused mainly by the initial impact of substantially higher
fuel costs, and in 1976 rose by 3-1 per cent above the previous peak in 1973 to
251,436 million vehicle-kilometres, of which cars and taxis accounted for
80 per cent.
and The suspension bridge across the Firth of Forth and the Severn Bridge, com¬
pleted in the mid-1960s, both incorporated major advances in suspension
bridge design. Their main spans are among the longest suspension bridge
spans, but the bridge being built across the river Humber and due to be opened
in March 1979 will have a span of 4,626 feet (1,410 metres), longer than any
existing bridge span in the world.
A few road tunnels have been built to cross major estuaries, notably the
Mersey, the Thames, the Tyne and the Clyde. A second crossing of the Thames
at Dartford (Kent) is under construction and should be completed in 1978.
288
BRITAIN 1978: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Administration
Road Safety
In England the Secretary of State for Transport, in Scotland the Secretary of
State for Scotland, and in Wales the Secretary of State for Wales are responsible
for the administration of trunk motorways and other trunk roads, and the costs
of their construction, improvement and maintenance are provided by central
Government. Work on major trunk road schemes in England, including
motorways, is controlled by regional road construction units, manned jointly
by Department of Transport and county council staff. The highway authority
for non-trunk roads in England and Wales is, in general, the county council in
whose area the roads lie. Part of the block grant to the highway authorities to¬
wards transport expenditure is attributable to their expenditure on the con¬
struction, improvement and maintenance of non-trunk roads. In Scotland the
highway authority for non-trunk roads is the regional or islands council and
the cost of maintenance and construction of these roads is eligible for grant
under an extension of the rate support grant system.
In Northern Ireland the Northern Ireland Department of the Environment
is responsible for public roads and bears the cost of maintenance and
construction.
Britain’s road accident record is considerably better than that of many other
countries, even though it has one of the highest densities of road traffic in
the world. There has been a long-term decline in road casualties and a
substantial fall in casualty rates. In 1976, 6,570 people were killed on the roads
of Great Britain, about 79,500 seriously injured and 253,600 slightly injured.
Modern roads, designed for present-day traffic and segregating pedestrians
from vehicles, have been shown to result in a marked fall in casualties. There
are three classes of national speed limit: a general limit of 30 mph (48 km/h) in
built-up areas; a limit of 70 mph (113 km/h) on motorways and other dual
carriageway roads; and a limit of 60 mph (97 km/h) on single carriageway
roads. To meet local needs the urban limit can be raised and the other limits
lowered on specific stretches of road. Other measures directed primarily
towards road safety include pedestrian crossings and the system of road
markings and traffic signs. A computer-controlled signalling system has been
installed on most busy motorways to warn motorists of advisory speed limits
in certain conditions and of lane closures.
The design of vehicles, their use on the roads, and the maintenance of their
mechanical condition are controlled by regulations which are amended when
necessary in the interests of safety or for control of pollution and noise. The
Government has introduced a ‘type approval’ scheme under which, from
1st April 1978, the use of cars manufactured after 1st October 1977 will not be
permitted unless they are of a type that has been certified as meeting the
required standards. In Great Britain private cars and light vans which are three
or more years old must be tested annually at private garages authorised as test
stations. In Northern Ireland private cars eight or more years old are tested at
official vehicle inspection centres. Heavy goods vehicles are tested annually at
government test stations. Public service vehicles must be specially approved
before being licensed to carry passengers, and are tested at regular intervals.
Any vehicle may be stopped on the road at any time by the police and examined.
Minimum ages for driving are: 16 for driving invalid carriages and mopeds;
17 for cars and other passenger vehicles with nine or fewer seats (including that
of the driver), motorcycles and goods vehicles not over 3-5 tonnes maximum
permissible weight; 18 for goods vehicles over 3-5 but not over 7-5 tonnes;
and 21 for passenger vehicles with over nine seats and goods vehicles over 7-5
tonnes. All drivers of motor vehicles, unless they have either held a full British
TRANSPORT AND COMMUNICATIONS
Traffic in Towns
289
licence or passed the driving test in the last ten years, are required to pass the
test before being granted a full licence to drive. Until they pass the test they
must hold a ‘provisional’ licence, display ‘L’ (learner) plates on their vehicle
and be accompanied while driving (except on a two-wheeled vehicle or in a
one-seat vehicle) by a qualified driver. In Northern Ireland a driver having
passed the test is required to display an ‘R’ (restricted) plate for a one-year
period during which he must not exceed 45 mph (72 km/h). There are schemes
for special licensing and testing of drivers of heavy goods vehicles and public
service vehicles. The Driver and Vehicle Licensing Centre at Swansea, which
began operating in 1973, deals with all private motor vehicle driving licences
and records in Great Britain, and in 1977 will complete the centralisation of all
vehicle records.
The Road Traffic Acts embody the law relating to road users. A person
convicted of any of the 26 most serious offences is liable to be disqualified
from driving for a specified period. The standard of conduct for all road
users and a summary of the requirements of the law are set out in the Highway
Code. A failure to observe the code does not render a person liable to criminal
proceedings but may be taken into account in such proceedings. The Road
Safety Act 1967 strengthened existing measures to discourage drinking and
driving, and set a maximum permissible blood alcohol level of 80 milligrams
of alcohol per 100 millilitres of blood. The Government intends to introduce
further measures to tighten the law on drinking and driving. Legislation will
also be drawn up requiring the wearing of seat belts where they are fitted in
the front seats of cars or vans. It is estimated that compulsory wearing will
save nearly 1,000 deaths and 11,000 serious injuries a year in Great Britain.
Riders of motor cycles, who are very vulnerable in accidents, are required
to wear safety helmets and are encouraged to wear clothes that can be easily
seen by other road users.
Campaigns to persuade people to take greater care on the roads are con¬
ducted nationally by government departments and the Royal Society for the
Prevention of Accidents and locally by local authorities. In recent years
major publicity campaigns have been undertaken to increase the wearing of
seat belts, and to reduce pedestrian casualties and the incidence of drinking
and driving.
Most cities have abandoned extensive urban roadbuilding schemes, because
of their environmental impact and high cost. Although limited urban road
improvements are continuing, their main purpose is to assist and complement
comprehensive traffic management schemes designed to improve traffic flow,
increase safety, and, in some cases, to assist the flow of certain types of
vehicle, usually buses. In using their traffic management powers many local
authorities are also able to create a better environment for residents in urban
areas. Comprehensive schemes may include ‘one-way’ systems, improved
signal control systems, pedestrian precincts and bus priority measures. Local
authorities in several of the larger towns have installed systems in which a
large number of traffic signals are controlled by computer and these systems
are expected to be extended to the smaller towns. In most town centres traffic
is restrained by permitting on-street parking for limited periods only; in
London and other large towns there are controlled zones where payment is
required for on-street parking. In several big cities new shopping precincts
specially designed to cater for pedestrians and from which motor vehicles are
excluded have been built. Many towns have areas in which streets have been
converted wholly or partly to pedestrian use.

BRITAIN 1978: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
The Transport and Road Research Laboratory (TRRL), jointly sponsored
by the Department of the Environment and the Department of Transport,
provides technical and scientific advice and information to help in formulating,
developing and implementing the Government’s transport policy. Work is
concerned with roads and structures such as bridges and tunnels; movement
of people and goods, including road layout and transport networks, control
of traffic flow, study of road accidents and methods of reducing their frequency
and severity; assessment of existing and projected passenger or freight trans¬
port systems; and investigation of technical developments and their environ¬
mental effects. The TRRL employs over 1,000 people of whom about half are
scientists and engineers.
There are some 145,500 operators in the road haulage industry. Many are
small firms, the average size of a vehicle fleet being only about four. Most of
the industry is privately owned, but the biggest operator in Great Britain is
the National Freight Corporation (NFC), a public corporation established
under the Transport Act 1968 to operate road and intermodal freight services.
Its turnover amounted to ^326 million in 1976, when it recorded a loss of
£15-3 million, and at the end of 1976 it had 41,700 employees and owned or
leased 21,300 vehicles, 16,000 trailers and 12,100 containers and demountable
bodies. The Government’s policy is to extend public ownership in the road
haulage industry. Public haulage (private road hauliers and the NFC carrying
other firms’ goods) accounts for 62 per cent of freight carried in Great Britain
in terms of tonne-kilometres. In Northern Ireland the biggest operator is
Northern Ireland Carriers Ltd., owned jointly by the Northern Ireland
Transport Holding Company and the NFC.
Under the Transport Act 1968 those operating goods vehicles of over 3^ tonnes
gross weight (with certain special exemptions) require an operator’s licence,
obtained on showing good repute and ability to maintain vehicles properly and
control loading and hours worked by drivers. It may also be necessary to
demonstrate adequate financial resources for compliance with these conditions.
From 1978 proof of professional competence will be required, except for those
carrying only their own goods who will be issued with a restricted operator’s
licence. Over 1 million goods vehicles not exceeding 3! tonnes gross laden
weight are exempt from operators’ licensing.
Regulations control the emission of smoke and noise by lorries and the
carriage of dangerous goods by road. There are limits on the hours worked by
drivers of goods vehicles. International road haulage is governed mainly by
bilateral agreements, which had been concluded with 22 other European
countries by June 1977 so as to allow British road hauliers to carry goods to or
through these countries. Permits are required in some cases and are normally
limited to a quota negotiated annually. Within the European Community
there is also a quota which authorises holders of a limited number of permits
to carry out hire and reward operations between any two member countries.
Bus and railway services in Britain are provided mainly by publicly owned
operators, coach and air services partly by publicly owned bodies, and taxis
and hire cars almost entirely by privately owned businesses. Buses and coaches
account for about 12 per cent of passenger mileage within Great Britain, rail
for 8 per cent and air 0-5 per cent.
In the metropolitan counties of Greater Manchester, Merseyside, West
Midlands, Tyne and Wear, South Yorkshire and West Yorkshire, the
metropolitan county council, acting as the passenger transport authority

(PTA), controls and co-ordinates different forms of transport, as well as
being responsible for land use policy and transport matters in general. In
Scotland the Strathclyde Regional Council is the PTA for Greater Glasgow
although the passenger transport area does not cover all of the region. The
PTAs are responsible for policy as a whole, and appoint professional passenger
transport executives (PTEs) to be responsible for day-to-day management
and operations. The PTEs operate bus services in their areas and are respon¬
sible for reaching agreements with other passenger transport operators in
their areas, including the British Railways Board, concerning the provision
of such services as are considered necessary by the PTAs. In London the
central bus and Underground rail services are operated by the London
Transport Executive which is appointed by the Greater London Council.
In the public sector in Great Britain 24,000 vehicles are operated by the
National Bus Company and the Scottish Transport Group, 11,000 by the
seven PTEs, 6,900 by the London Transport Executive and 6,000 by other
local authority undertakings. There are some 6,000 privately owned under¬
takings (of which the majority have fewer than five vehicles) comprising about
28,000 vehicles; only a small proportion of these operators are concerned with
scheduled bus services.
The National Bus Company operates in England and Wales through locally
based subsidiaries, such as the Western National Omnibus Company, Ribble
Motor Services Ltd. and Crosville Motor Services Ltd., and has a growing
network of long-distance coach services. At the end of 1976 it owned some
19,500 vehicles and employed 68,000 people. In 1976 passenger journeys
on the company s buses amounted to 1,856 million, gross revenue was
£358 million and the company made a profit of £4 million.
The Scottish Transport Group (with about 4,150 vehicles) operates all the
main bus services in Scotland outside the major cities. It also runs shipping
services to the main islands off the west coast of Scotland; modernised
vehicle ferries have been introduced on many of these services.
In Northern Ireland almost all road passenger services are provided by
subsidiaries of the Northern Ireland Transport Holding Company. Citybus
Ltd. operates services in the city of Belfast and Ulsterbus Ltd. operates most
of the services in the rest of Northern Ireland. These companies have 300
and 900 vehicles respectively.
There are 11 traffic areas in Great Britain each under the jurisdiction of an
independent body of three traffic commissioners. The commissioners are
responsible for ensuring the fitness of vehicles used to carry passengers for
hire or reward, and for licensing public road passenger services in order to
secure proper co-ordination and to avoid unnecessary competition; to this
end they may settle routes, timetables arid fares.
Improvements to bus services are being undertaken in many areas of Britain
to try to halt the substantial decline in their use due primarily to the growth
in ownership of private cars. These include express and/or limited-stop bus
services, ‘park and ride’ bus services between suburban car parks and town
centres, and ‘postbus’ services (Post Office minibuses carrying mail and
passengers) in rural areas. ‘Dial-a-bus’ services, which pick up passengers as a
result of a telephone call to a central control point, have been evaluated in a
number of areas. Many uneconomic bus services have been withdrawn,
particularly in rural areas, leaving some villages without access to public

transport. To assess ways of meeting the transport needs of rural communities,
experimental transport schemes, co-ordinated by a government steering
committee, are being introduced in four areas (north Devon, Dinefwr in
Dyfed, North Yorkshire and south Strathclyde).
There are about 34,000 taxicabs in Great Britain, mainly in urban areas,
especially London where some 11,800 taxicabs that ply for hire in the streets
are privately operated by companies or owner-drivers and are licensed annually
by the Metropolitan Police. There are about 16,000 licensed cab drivers in
London. Numerous car-hire firms are also in operation. Elsewhere taxis are
licensed by local authorities.
There are underground railway services in three British cities: London,
Glasgow and Liverpool. London Transport has 4,519 railway cars and serves
278 stations, while its trains operate over 254 miles (409 kilometres) of
railway, of which nearly 100 miles (161 kilometres) are underground.
Urban rail projects are proceeding in several areas. London Transport is
engaged on a 20-year modernisation programme for the Underground.
Improvements planned include an extension of automatic ticket issue and
control and the introduction of new signalling and train control techniques.
The extension of the Piccadilly line to Heathrow airport and the first stage of
the new Jubilee line, which is projected to link north-west and central London,
should be opened in late 1977 and early 1978 respectively. In Greater Glasgow
two major rail projects are being undertaken by the PTE to modernise the
underground system and to reopen and electrify the central low-level line,
the major part of the ‘Clyderail’ scheme which is designed to improve
access to the centre of Glasgow and integrate rail services on the north and
south banks of the Clyde. A light rapid transit system under construction on
Tyneside involves the electrification of two suburban railway lines, linked by
new tunnels under Newcastle upon Tyne and Gateshead, and a new bridge over
the Tyne. The first section should be open in 1979 and the whole system, 34
miles (55 kilometres) long with 46 stations, should be in operation by the early
1980s. The project is the largest provincial urban transport scheme to have been
undertaken in Britain in the twentieth century.
Railways were pioneered in Britain, and the Stockton to Darlington railway,
opened in 1825, was the first steam-worked public railway in the world. Under
the Transport Act 1947 the four large railway companies in Great Britain
were brought under public ownership and in 1963 the British Railways Board
was set up to manage railway affairs.
With the growth of private car ownership, the demand for rail travel has
fallen and in the I95os and 1960s the railway network was substantially
reduced, mainly by the closure of branch lines, although closures have virtually
ceased. The Government supports the rail passenger system through the
Railways Act i974> under which the Secretary of State for Transport has
directed the British Railways Board to provide a public service generally com¬
parable with that operated in December 1974.
In 1976 the railway network operated by British Rail amounted to 11,189
route-miles (18,007 kilometres) of which 2,321 miles (3,735 kilometres) were
electrified. A total of 708 million passenger journeys was made and 178 million
tonnes of freight traffic carried by rail. Total railway receipts amounted to
£924 million. Financial support for current operations totalled £364 million,
including ^319 million in respect of public service obligations for the passenger

In 1976 the board made a loss of £29-9 million following interest payments

end of 1976 it employed 243,500 people and operated 3,338 diesel and 351
electric locomotives, 42 high speed train (HST) power cars and 151 HST
passenger carriages, 3,367 diesel and 7,228 electric passenger multiple-unit
vehicles, 6,365 passenger carriages and a fleet of 187,000 freight vehicles.
British Rail Engineering Ltd. has 13 main workshops, employing about
35>500 people, mostly on the repair and construction of British locomotives,
rolling stock and containers, although some manufacturing work is done for
export. The Railway Technical Centre at Derby employs about 2,000 people
and has an annual ,£6 million research and development programme. British
Transport Hotels Ltd. runs 30 hotels and controls Travellers-Fare, responsible
for catering facilities on trains and at stations. British Rail’s Shipping and
International Services division operated a fleet of 56 vessels in 1976 providing
passenger and freight services on most of the important routes between Britain
and the Irish Republic and on the short-sea routes to the continent of Europe,
as well as on some domestic routes. British Rail Hovercraft Ltd. runs hovercraft
services (see p. 300). Transportation Systems and Market Research Ltd.
provides consultancy services overseas on railway and associated operations.
In recent years the main developments have been the improvement of inter-city
passenger services with the emphasis on speed, reliability, comfort and better
train connections; and an increase in freight trainload traffic, allowing higher
speeds and greater mechanisation in the carrying of coal, other bulk com¬
modities and containers. The standards of track and signalling are being
raised to allow faster running speeds and improved operating efficiency.
The two main functions of the passenger network are the provision of the
high-speed inter-city network, linking the main centres of Great Britain,
and of commuter services in and around the large conurbations, especially
London and the South East. British Rail introduced the world’s fastest diesel
rail service, known as Inter-City 125, in October 1976 on the route from London
to Bristol and south Wales. The service is operated by 27 high speed trains,
which travel at maximum sustained speeds of 125 mph (201 km/h). The first of
32 further HSTs will operate a similar service between London and Edinburgh
from early in 1978 and 14 HSTs are due to enter service on the route between
London and Penzance in 1979. Higher speeds will follow the introduction into
service of the advanced passenger train (APT) capable of speeds up to 155 mph
(250 km/h). Development work has involved fundamental research into the
guidance and stability of railway vehicles which will enable these higher
speeds to be attained on existing track. Three prototype electric APTs are
being built and the first set will enter service between London and Glasgow in
1978, covering the 400-mile (644-kilometre) journey in four hours.
Electrification is continuing and work will start in October 1977 on an £80
million scheme to electrify the line between London and Bedford. Proposals
for commuter services include the development of new multiple-unit trains
to replace old stock, while several urban railway projects are in progress
(see p. 292).
The most important freight commodities handled in 1976 were coal and coke
(97 million tonnes) and iron and steel (29 million tonnes). Other commodities,

such as petroleum products, cars, refuse, roadstone and construction materials,
are becoming more important and British Rail is concentrating on traffic
particularly suitable for carriage by rail, especially long-distance and bulk train¬
load traffic.
Increased efficiency is being obtained as new types of wagon are introduced
with larger capacities and capable of higher speeds; a network of regular high¬
speed freight services using these new wagons is being established. Freight
traffic is being concentrated at fewer and better equipped and sited marshalling
yards and terminals. A computer-based total operations processing system,
which monitors continuously all consignments and freight train and wagon
movements in Great Britain, has reduced costs by allowing the more intensive
use of rolling stock and the withdrawal of many obsolete freight vehicles. The
‘merry-go-round’ system, whereby trains are loaded and discharged auto¬
matically while in motion, is being used increasingly where there are heavy
flows of mineral traffic, such as the carriage of coal to power stations and
iron ore to steelworks. Express container services are operated by Freight-
liners Ltd., a company jointly owned by the National Freight Corporation
(see p. 290) and the British Railways Board (with 51 per cent and 49 per cent
of the shares respectively).
Discussions initiated by the Government are in progress between many of
Britain’s largest firms and the British Railways Board on the potential for
transferring freight to the railways. Grants of 50 per cent are available towards
the cost of construction or modernisation of privately owned railway sidings
where this leads to environmental benefits by the removal of heavy goods
vehicle traffic from the roads.
There are several small privately owned passenger-carrying railways in
Great Britain, mostly operated on a voluntary basis and providing limited
services for tourists and railway enthusiasts; the principal aim of many of
these railways is the preservation of steam traction. Some are narrow gauge
railways, while others run on former British Rail track.
The Northern Ireland Railways Company Ltd., a subsidiary of the Northern
Ireland Transport Holding Company, operates the railway service on 200
miles (322 kilometres) of track. Delivery of the last of the new rolling stock to
complete a scheme to modernise the railway network in the Belfast area is
expected early in 1978.
Inland waterways are popular for recreation (see p. 419), continue to carry
freight and are important for land drainage and water supply. Of the 2,000 miles
(3,219 kilometres) of canal and river navigations controlled by the publicly
owned British Waterways Board, some 340 miles (547 kilometres) are main¬
tained as commercial waterways for use by freight-carrying vessels. Freight
traffic of about 5 million tonnes a year is mostly on the river navigations and
broad canals in the Yorkshire-Humberside area. The board also operates
docks, warehouses and inland freight terminals, and has a freight-carrying
fleet, although most of the freight traffic on its waterways is handled by
independent carriers or by traders in their own craft. Limited improvements
are being undertaken for freight traffic. The board is operating on some of
its commercial waterways a specially designed interlocking modular barge
system.
In 1976 the board’s turnover amounted to ^9-9 million and it received
government grants of £10 million, most of which were used to maintain its
waterways to statutory standards. As part of the Government’s proposals
TRANSPORT AND COMMUNICATIONS
295

Port Traffic
to reorganise the structure of the water industry (see p. 264), the British Water¬
ways Board would be merged within a centralised structure to form the
nucleus of a national navigation authority.
PORTS
There are some 250 port authorities or public wharf operators in Britain, and
about 800 other undertakings engaged in various harbour operations, such as
stevedoring, towage, warehousing and lighterage. Port authorities are of four
main types: nationalised bodies, public trusts, local authorities and statutory
companies. The Government intends that all commercial ports and cargo¬
handling facilities should eventually be brought under public ownership and
control; this would involve the establishment of a new National Ports
Authority to exercise essential central controlling functions.
Ports run by nationalised undertakings represent over a quarter of total
capacity, the majority, including Southampton, Hull, Immingham, Newport,
Cardiff and Swansea, being owned by the British Transport Docks Board. In
1976 shipping arrivals and departures at the board’s docks totalled 138-3
million net registered tons (including fishing vessels) and total cargo handled
was 83-5 million tonnes. The board’s revenue totalled ^99-1 million and it
achieved a net surplus of j£ii-6 million. The British Railways Board controls
certain ports, including Folkestone, Holyhead, Parkeston Quay (Harwich)
and Stranraer, which are largely used for its shipping services, while the British
Waterways Board owns Sharpness (Gloucester) and Weston Point in Runcorn.
The constitutions of public trust port authorities traditionally consisted of
representatives of shipping companies, importers, exporters, local authorities
and trade unions. Recently, however, the authorities of nearly all the major
trust ports (which include London, Clyde, Forth, Medway and Tyne) have
been reconstituted with fewer members, a greater proportion of executive
members and the appointment of non-executive members by the Government.
Local authorities own about one-third of Britain’s ports, including Bristol and
Sunderland. Port undertakings owned by statutory companies include Man¬
chester and Liverpool. Many private ports deal with the traffic of individual
industrial firms in commodities such as china clay and petroleum.
Port authorities, in the main, operate with statutory powers and responsibili¬
ties set out in private Acts of Parliament. Most are members of the British
Ports Association which aims to further the common interests of port authori¬
ties in their relations with the Government, shipowners and traders.
The National Ports Council, set up under the Harbours Act 1964, is financed
principally by a levy on port authorities. It advises the Government on major
port developments and has various responsibilities in relation to research,
training, statistics and charges.
Over 335 million tonnes of cargo a year pass through the ports of Great
Britain. Coastal traffic accounts for over 92 million tonnes consisting largely
of petroleum and coal. Of some 181 million tonnes of imports from overseas,
about 99 million tonnes consist of petroleum and petroleum products.
Manufactured goods form about one-third of exports.
A large proportion of the general cargo traffic through British ports is
handled by unitised transport methods in containers and roll-on goods
vehicles, which carried over 32 million tonnes of goods in 1976. Felixstowe,
Dover, London, Southampton and Hull all handled large amounts.

BRITAIN 1978: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
London is Britain’s largest port for non-fuel traffic. In 1976, 44 million tonnes
of goods were handled, including 24 million tonnes of petroleum. South¬
ampton is the main trading port on the south coast. Medway has major traffic
in petroleum and petroleum products, while some of the other ports in the
South East and East Anglia are growing rapidly with modern facilities especially
for roll-on/roll-off and container traffic. Dover is Britain’s leading port for
passengers and roll-on/roll-off passenger and goods vehicles.
Liverpool is a very important export outlet, especially to countries outside
Europe and the Mediterranean. The inland port of Manchester, reached from
the Mersey via the 36-mile (58-kilometre) Manchester Ship Canal, exports
particularly chemicals and petroleum products.
The port of Tees and Hartlepool handles petroleum products, chemicals,
iron and steel, and iron ore. Some of the ports on the north-east coast of
England, such as Blyth and the Tyne, have an important outward trade in
coal. Grimsby and Hull are Britain’s two main fishing ports and with Imming-
ham deal in trade especially with Scandinavian and Baltic ports. Immingham
handles imports of iron ore and crude oil and exports of ferrous and petroleum
products.
Milford Haven, handling 43 million tonnes a year, is Britain’s major oil port.
Much of the traffic through the south Wales ports is connected with the local
steel industry—imports of iron ore and exports of iron and steel, and tinplate.
In Scotland the principal port facilities serving the central industrial area
are Greenock (handling particularly containers and raw sugar) and Glasgow
(iron ore and grain) on the Clyde, and Grangemouth (containers and timber)
and Leith (grain and whisky) on the Forth. The Clyde also has a major crude
oil terminal at Finnart. Aberdeen is Britain’s third largest fishing port.
Belfast is the principal port of Northern Ireland and with Larne handles
the main traffic across the Irish Sea.
Most of the oil tankers coming to Britain to discharge crude oil are berthed at
special tanker terminals owned and operated by the oil companies to serve
their refineries. Milford Haven can accommodate fully laden vessels of up to
275,ooo deadweight tons on all tides at five private oil company terminals and
Finnart on the Clyde will accept vessels of 325,000 deadweight tons. At Tetney
Haven, off the mouth of the Humber, tankers discharge oil at an offshore buoy
and it is carried by pipeline to the shore; the first oil was discharged at a similar
buoy at Amlwch (Gwynedd) in 1977.
The first purpose-built terminal for oil from the British sector of the North
Sea was completed at Hound Point on the Forth in 1975 and other terminals
have been built on the Tees and at Flotta (Orkney). Britain’s largest oil port is
planned for Sullom Voe in Shetland, which is expected to become the biggest
oil port in Europe by the 1980s. Two of the three jetties, due for completion
in 1978, will be able to serve ships of up to 300,000 deadweight tons.
Modernisation of the ports has been taking place in recent years, as a result
both of the increase in Britain’s trade, especially with other European countries,
and of technological changes affecting sea-going traffic. The growing size of
tankers and bulk carriers has necessitated more deep-water berths, while de¬
velopment of mechanical handling methods, packaging of general cargo,
containers and roll-on/roll-off services has created a demand for new types of
port facility.
Deep-sea container facilities have been constructed at several ports including
Tilbury (London); Felixstowe; Greenock on the Clyde; Liverpool, where four

container berths form part of the Royal Seaforth dock complex; Manchester;
and Southampton, where facilities to accommodate the new container service
to South Africa were completed in 1977- A. £16 million scheme to build a 64-
acre (26-hectare) container terminal at Tilbury should be completed in mid-
197%> making Tilbury the world’s largest terminal for refrigerated containers.
A major new dock complex at Bristol, with six berths and the largest entrance
lock in Britain, was opened in 1977- The port of Dover is building further
facilities for handling conventional ferries and an ^8 million terminal for cross-
Channel hovercraft. Modern ore terminals have been built at Port Talbot,
Redcar and Immingham. A terminal for handling iron ore and coal is being
built at Hunterston on the Clyde and will be able to accommodate ships of up
t-° 350>000 deadweight tons. Construction of a terminal at Peterhead (Gram-
pian), primarily to handle fuel oil for the power station which is under con¬
struction (see p. 257), began in 1976.
The exploration for, and production of, offshore oil and gas has led to other
port developments, mainly in Scotland. Supply bases for offshore vessels have
been built at a number of ports including Leith, Dundee, Montrose, Aberdeen,
Peterhead, and Lerwick in Shetland. Three new harbour authorities have been
established, partly to provide for the development of facilities for offshore
activities, for the Cromarty Firth, Orkney and Shetland.
At the end of 1976 about 65,000 people were employed in Britain’s ports
industry; of these, 30,000 dockers responsible for the physical and mechanical
handling of cargo were registered with the National Dock Labour Board
(NDLB), which administers the Dock Workers Employment Scheme. The
system of casual labour common among dock workers in the past has been
virtually eliminated. The Dock Work Regulation Act 1976 enables statutory
control of dock work to be modified to meet changing conditions in the industry.
The NDLB has been reconstituted as a statutory corporation with wider
representation and the preparation of a new dock labour scheme is in progress.
SHIPPING
Of the world’s active sea-going tonnage of 100 gross tons1 and over, 8-9 per cent
is registered in Britain, making the British merchant fleet, at 32-9 million gross
tons, the third largest in active employment after those of Liberia and Japan.
The oil tanker fleet, at 16-1 million gross tons, is the world’s third largest, and
the ore and bulk carrier fleet, at 8-2 million gross tons, the fifth largest. The
British fleet is one of the most modern in the world with almost 45 per cent
of the tonnage less than five years old.
The Department of Trade is the government department responsible for most
matters connected with merchant shipping. Under the Merchant Shipping
Acts it administers many regulations for marine safety and welfare, for
instance: certifying the load-line (or Plimsoll line) that shows that a ship is
not overloaded; ensuring that standards of safety are observed in ship con¬
struction; ensuring the provision of adequate life-saving, fire-fighting and
radio equipment; and dealing with the discipline, professional standards,
health and accommodation of seamen. The Acts also contain certain reserve
1 One gross ton = 100 cubic feet (2-83 cubic metres). One deadweight ton = 1
long ton (2,240 lb. or 1,016 kilogrammes). Gross tonnage indicates the total capacity
of the enclosed space on a ship. Deadweight tonnage denotes the maximum load which
a vessel can carry before submerging the load-line.

powers for protecting shipping and trading interests from measures adopted
or proposed by overseas governments. In the offices of the Registrar General
of Shipping and Seamen, at Cardiff, a record of all British ships is kept.
In July 1976, 30-6 million gross tons of trading vessels of 100 gross tons and
over were both owned and registered in Britain.1 These ships are usually
employed as follows: 16-2 million gross tons as foreign-going tankers; 9
million gross tons as foreign-going tramps; 4-7 million gross tons as foreign-
going passenger and cargo liners; and 694,000 gross tons in coasting and trade
with ports between the Elbe and Brest (home trades). Rapid technological
change in the merchant fleet is reflected in the current composition. Vessels
are becoming obsolete over a shorter period and as they do so are being re¬
placed by larger ships, with generally lower building costs per ton. Labour-
saving devices and faster turn-round facilities are helping to combat rising
costs, while shipowners are paying greater attention to operating vessels at
speeds of optimum fuel efficiency following increased fuel costs.
The tendency to greater size has been most marked in tankers, bulk carriers
and container vessels. Tanker size has increased from a maximum of 20,000
deadweight tons in the early 1950s to about 500,000 deadweight tons for the
largest ocean-going tankers. The largest modern container ships of up to
60,000 gross tons have a capacity of 2,800 containers of 20-foot (6-metre)
equivalent units. The growing use of container and roll-on/roll-off vessels
has resulted in the safer and quicker carriage of a wide range of goods.
Lloyd’s Register of Shipping surveys and classifies ships with particular
regard to their safety and operational efficiency.
Nearly the whole of the British merchant fleet is privately owned, apart from
some ships which are owned and/or operated by nationalised industries as
part of their normal commercial operations, one example being British Rail
(see p. 293). About two-thirds of the tanker fleet belongs to the oil companies,
although there are a few independent tanker operators. British liner tonnage
is dominated by a relatively small number of large groups. Some shipowners
have delegated the management of their fleets to specialist ship management
companies. Several companies are participating in consortia, particularly
where heavy investment in ships and facilities is required, as with container
and bulk cargo vessels. Chartering of ships of all nationalities takes place on
the Baltic Exchange, the largest market of its type in the world. The represen¬
tative body for shipowners (excluding, for the most part, owners of fishing
vessels) is the General Council of British Shipping.
Almost all Britain’s overseas trade by weight, over four-fifths by value, is
carried by sea. Ships registered in Britain carry 35 per cent by weight, 45 per
cent by value, of foreign seaborne trade. Tanker cargoes, mostly imports of
crude oil, account for over half seaborne foreign trade by weight but less than
15 per cent by value, and foodstuffs and manufactured goods account for over
three-quarters by value.
The proportion of passengers travelling to or from Britain by sea is about
one-third, compared with about one-half in the early 1960s. Sea traffic
between Britain and the continent of Europe has increased by over 300 per
cent since the early 1960s, reflecting the growing popularity of motoring
1 The remaining tonnage included fishing vessels, tugs, river and estuary craft, Ministry
of Defence vessels (mostly tankers) not usually engaged in the commercial carriage of
cargo, and shipping registered in Britain but owned in other Commonwealth countries.

holidays. However, the number travelling on routes between Britain and
countries outside Europe and the Mediterranean has fallen by over 85 per cent
with the growing competition of air travel, and the last continuous scheduled
deep-sea passenger service, between Southampton and Durban (South
Africa), was withdrawn in September 1977. Remaining long-distance passenger
ships are used for cruising and about 100,000 passengers a year embark on
pleasure cruises from British ports.
British shipping companies operating liners have associated with each other
and with the companies of other countries operating on the same routes in a
series of ‘conferences’ designed to secure standardisation and stability of rates,
and to maintain frequency and regularity of services. The essential principle
of a conference is the establishment of a common tariff of freight rates or
passenger fares from each port of departure. Each conference meets from
time to time to review and revise existing rates and practices. There are about
100 conferences dealing with trade to and from Britain.
Various qualifications are required for employment on board ship in certain
grades. Responsibility for holding examinations and issuing certificates of
competency rests with the Department of Trade, except in the case of radio
officers where this is the function of the Home Office.
There are some 50 establishments providing full-time vocational training
for seafarers. Most deck and catering junior ratings are trained at the National
Sea Training College at Gravesend (Kent), the world’s largest ratings’ estab¬
lishment which can accommodate some 2,000 ratings a year. The Merchant
Navy Training Board promotes the instruction and studies of apprentices,
cadets and ratings who are preparing for their examinations for the various
certificates of competency.
Wages and conditions of employment of most seafarers are negotiated by the
National Maritime Board, composed of equal numbers of representatives of
the General Council of British Shipping and seafarers’ trade unions. The
Merchant Navy Established Service Scheme, introduced in 1947, removed a
great deal of the uncertainty formerly associated with seafaring. Under the
latest scheme seafarers are employed either as ‘registered seafarers’ or they
may enter into a company service contract, for a minimum of one year, for
employment on the ships of a particular company. Registered seafarers receive
special benefits between voyages in addition to the normal state benefits. The
benefits paid to company service contract seafarers must be at least equivalent
to those paid to registered seafarers. The industry is studying ways of improving
seafaring conditions of work and leisure.
The Department of Trade’s responsibilities for safety include administration
of the Coastguard Service, and certain administrative functions concerning
lighthouses and pilotage. The department makes regulations to ensure safety
of navigation at sea and conducts inquiries into shipping casualties and
accidents. Britain’s merchant fleet is one of the safest in the world; it has a
consistently lower record of ship losses than the world average.
The Coastguard Service co-ordinates search and rescue action for vessels in
distress off the coasts of Britain, and gives direct assistance where appropriate.
There are some 600 regular coastguards and about 9,000 voluntary auxiliary
coastguards. Constant watch is maintained all the year round at certain main
3 00

stations and at times of casualty risk at a number of others. During 1976 life¬
saving action was taken on 4,361 occasions.
The Coastguard Service calls upon shipping, the lifeboats of the Royal
National Life-boat Institution (RNLI), and Service aircraft to assist as
necessary. It can also call upon the services of a long-range civilian helicopter
based at Aberdeen. The RNLI is supported entirely by voluntary contribu¬
tions, and depends for its operation on voluntary workers. Lifeboats were
launched 2,911 times in 1976 and rescued 1,079 people. Improvements in
Britain’s search and rescue organisation, including a reorganisation of the
Coastguard Service, are planned to meet changing commitments.
Lighthouses The general lighthouse authority for England and Wales, the Channel Islands
and Gibraltar is the Corporation of Trinity House, which is administered by a
board of Elder Brethren elected from the Royal Navy and the Merchant Navy.
Lighthouses in Scotland and Ireland are the responsibility respectively of the
Northern Lighthouse Board and the Commissioners of Irish Lights. These
authorities control about 350 lighthouses, many minor lights and buoys, and a
number of lightships, some of which are being replaced by unattended sea
marks or by light towers.
Pilotage In Britain there are 46 pilotage authorities for the 87 pilotage districts and
over 1,500 licensed pilots. Trinity House is the chief pilotage authority,
licensing some 679 pilots in 41 districts in England and Wales. In some cases
the harbour authority or local council is the pilotage authority. The Govern¬
ment intends to introduce legislation to modernise pilotage operations.
Traffic There are a number of traffic separation schemes around the shores of Britain.
Control Observance of traffic separation schemes adopted by the Inter-Governmental
Maritime Consultative Organisation (a United Nations agency with head¬
quarters in London) has been required of British shipping since 1972 and in
July 1977 it became mandatory for vessels of countries contracting to revised
international collision regulations. The most important scheme affecting
British waters is in the Dover Strait, one of the world’s busiest seaways. It
consists of traffic lanes for shipping passing through the strait and inshore
traffic zones for use by local shipping. Britain and France operate radar
surveillance services which keep watch on ships not conforming to the traffic
separation scheme and broadcast navigational information to ships in the
Dover Strait. The Anglo-French Safety of Navigation Group, comprising
representatives of British and French government departments, is responsible
for improving safety in the English Channel.
HOVERCRAFT The hovercraft, a vehicle which rides on a cushion of air over both land and
water surfaces, was invented in Britain and has been in regular public passen¬
ger service since the mid-1960s. Services are concentrated on cross-Channel
routes and on routes across the Solent between Southampton and the Isle of
Might. Two operators provide cross-Channel services: British Rail Hovercraft
Ltd. (Seaspeed) with routes between Dover and Boulogne, and Dover and
Calais; and Hoverlloyd Ltd., which has a purpose-built hoverport at Pegwell
Bay for its car and passenger ferries between Ramsgate and Calais. A hover¬
craft crossing takes about one-third of the time taken by ships and hovercraft
have accordingly gained about one-third of the short-sea traffic in this area.
Several hovercraft have had or are to have their capacity increased to meet
the growing demand.

CIVIL AVIATION
Airline services are operated by British Airways and by a number of inde¬
pendent airlines. In 1924 four small British companies merged to form
Imperial Airways Ltd. and this company pioneered the commercial develop¬
ment of intercontinental air routes. The two public corporations, the British
Overseas Airways Corporation (which took over the operations of Imperial
Airways Ltd. and British Airways Ltd. in 1940) and British European Airways
(established under the Civil Aviation Act 1946), became divisions of British
Airways under the Civil Aviation Act 1971 which created the Civil Aviation
Authority (CAA) and the British Airways Board.
The Secretary of State for Trade is responsible for international matters
(including negotiation of air service agreements with other countries, the
licensing and control of public transport operations into Britain by overseas
operators and British participation in the activities of international aviation
bodies), airports policy, amenity matters such as aircraft noise, aviation
security policy and investigation of accidents.
The Civil Aviation Authority is an independent statutory body, responsible
for the economic, technical and operational regulation of the industry; the
provision by the National Air Traffic Services, jointly with the Secretary of
State for Defence, of air navigation services and the aerodrome navigation
services at certain British airports; and the operation of eight aerodromes in
Scotland. The Secretary of State for Trade appoints the members of the CAA,
and issues a written guidance on the general policies to be followed, which
requires approval of both Houses of Parliament.
The CAA has been given the objective of recovering as soon as possible the
whole of its costs and a reasonable return on capital from the users of its
services. Meanwhile the Government is paying the CAA a grant to meet the
deficit on its revenue account; it amounted to ^44*5 million in 1976-77.
Under the CAA’s air transport licensing system, British operators apply for
licences for scheduled and charter services, or for revocation or variation of
existing licences including alterations to fares. With certain exceptions the
CAA is required to license only one British airline to provide scheduled
services on a long-haul international route. British Airways is the preferred
airline for all long-haul routes other than those to the areas in the ‘sphere of
interest’ of British Caledonian Airways, as defined in the policy guidance of
1976. For short-haul international services the CAA is required, in general,
to license only one British airline on an individual route, except on a route to
and from London. In issuing licences the CAA must also consider the appli¬
cant’s financial resources, staffing and organisation, the need for the proposed
services, and any representations made by interested parties. Appeals may be
made to the Secretary of State for Trade. The CAA also licenses air travel
organisers. The Airline Users Committee advises the CAA on the interests of
passengers and other airline users, and investigates individual complaints
against airlines.
The CAA is responsible for the regulation of the safety of civil aircraft
registered in Britain. Its Operations Division deals with the preparation and
application of safety requirements concerning airline operations, flight crew
licensing and training, aerodromes, and fire and rescue services. The Air¬
worthiness Division is responsible for functions such as the airworthiness

the publication of the British Civil Airworthiness Requirements, a code
with which all aircraft built in Britain or flown by British airlines must
comply. It has similar duties in relation to hovercraft. The CAA is advised
in these duties by the Airworthiness Requirements Board. Recent safety
measures have included a mandatory system of reporting of incidents and
structural or mechanical defects, and the requirement for fitting ground
proximity warning systems in public transport aircraft registered in Britain.
Every operator of aircraft above a certain weight used for public transport
must possess an Air Operator’s Certificate which is granted by the CAA when
it is satisfied that the operator is competent to secure the safe operation of its
aircraft. The CAA’s flight operations inspectors (who are experienced airline
pilots) check that satisfactory operating standards are maintained.
Each member of the flight crew of a British registered aircraft must hold the
appropriate official licence issued by the CAA. Applicants for professional
pilots’ licences are required to attend approved courses of training before
attempting qualifying examinations and flight tests.
Responsibility for civil and military air traffic control over Britain and the
surrounding seas rests with the National Air Traffic Services. Britain is a mem¬
ber of Eurocontrol, a European international agency which is responsible for
control at the higher flight levels for civil aircraft and for military aircraft
operating according to civil procedures.
A system of airways, introduced in 1950 and covering the main traffic routes
with control zones around the major airports, has been gradually extended.
The primary navigation aids have been the very high frequency omni¬
directional ranges (VORs) and distance measuring equipment. Re-equipment
with the more accurate Doppler VOR system began in 1974 and should be
completed before 1980. During the last few years virtually the whole of the
airspace over Britain above 5,000 feet (1,500 metres) has been brought under
surveillance by modern primary and secondary radar equipment. There are
two main air traffic control centres, located at West Drayton (Greater London)
and Prestwick (where a new centre will be brought into service in late 1977),
while there is a subsidiary centre at Manchester. Extensive use is made of
automatic data processing and other advanced electronic techniques.
The development of all-weather landing systems, on the basis of an im¬
proved version of the standard instrument landing system, was pioneered in
Britain and most of Britain’s major airports use this improved version. A
microwave landing system is being developed to replace the instrument landing
system.
The chairman and members of the board of British Airways are appointed by
the Secretary of State for Trade. Its total borrowing limit is fixed at £700
million. During 1976-77 the board’s turnover was £1,248 million (including
£1,074 million from airline operations), and it made a net profit of £35-1
million. Overseas earnings amounted to £670 million. In March 1977 British
Airways employed about 59,400 staff. Its assets of £662 million included £514
million of aircraft and spares and £95 million of land and buildings. In 1977 a
reorganisation of the airline, involving the replacement of three airline divisions
by a number of functional departments, wras implemented to create a unified
airline, with a simpler organisation, and to increase efficiency and profitability.

British Airways has the largest route network in the world, almost 400,000
miles (640,000 kilometres), covering 150 destinations in 79 countries. In
1976-77 some 14-5 million passengers were carried on scheduled services,
which are operated to the rest of Europe, the Middle East, the Far East,
Australasia, East and South Africa, North America and Guyana in South
America. Within Britain it runs 1,400 flights a week to 26 towns and cities
throughout the country. In 1976 British Airways inaugurated, jointly with Air
France, the world s first supersonic passenger services, using Concorde
aircraft. The airline s Concorde services are operated between London
(Heathrow) and Bahrain, and Heathrow and Washington. Initial experience
has exceeded expectations with high passenger load factors on the latter route.
In 1975 British Airways inaugurated Europe’s first air ‘shuttle’ service (a
regular scheduled no-reservation service with back-up aircraft to carry extra
passengers) between Heathrow and Glasgow and similar services were intro¬
duced between Heathrow and Edinburgh in 1976 and between Heathrow
and Belfast in April 1977, while joint shuttle services with national airlines
to a number of other European countries are being investigated.
British Airways Associated Companies Ltd. is responsible for the group’s
investments connected with some 13 hotel companies and 9 air companies in
different parts of the world. British Airways Helicopters Ltd. operates a
scheduled service between Penzance (Cornwall), and the Isles of Scilly,
undertakes charter work, provides links between oil rigs in the North Sea and
the mainland and operates air-sea rescue services from Aberdeen. Engine
overhaul work for British Airways and other airlines is carried out by British
Airways Engine Overhaul Ltd. International Aeradio Ltd. plans, installs,
operates and maintains airport technical services and general communications
and manufactures specialised equipment for use in these services.
British Airways operated 192 aircraft and helicopters in July 1977. Aircraft
included 25 BAC One-Elevens, 9 Boeing 707-4363, 11 Boeing 707-3365,
22 Boeing 747s> 5 Concordes, 2 HS 74^s> 5 Merchantmen (converted Vanguard
passenger aircraft), 13 Trident Ones, 15 Trident Twos, 25 Trident Threes,
9 TriStar is, 15 Super VCios, and 18 Viscounts. Major orders include three
Boeing 747s an<^ s^x TriStar 500s. Helicopters operated comprise 14 Sikorsky
6iNs, 2 Sikorsky 58TS, 1 Bell Jet Ranger and 1 Bell 212.
Since 1962 more passengers have entered or left Britain by air than by sea.
In 1976 a total of some 32*5 million passengers travelled by air (international
terminal passengers) and 16*6 million by sea. British Airways accounts for
some 93 per cent of scheduled services flown by British airlines, whereas the
charter market is dominated by independent companies. Total capacity
offered on all services by British airlines amounted to 9,728 million capacity-
tonne-kilometres in 1976.
The independent airlines carry more than 3 million passengers a year on
scheduled services and over 8 million on charter flights. The main independent
scheduled airline is British Caledonian Airways, which operates a fleet of 27
aircraft and carries over 1 million scheduled service passengers a year. Its
scheduled services are primarily to West and Central Africa and South
America. Britannia Airways, Dan-Air Services, Laker Airways and Monarch
Airlines are the leading independent airlines running charter passenger
services. Over 220 aircraft operated by some 102 public transport companies
are engaged in air-taxi operations. Helicopters are also used to transport

businessmen, but are being employed increasingly in operations connected
with the development of Britain’s offshore oil and gas resources. Light
aircraft and helicopters are also involved in other activities, such as charter
operations, search and rescue services, crop-spraying, aerial survey and
photography, and flying instruction.
The value of overseas trade by air rose by 28 per cent to ^8,564 million in
1976 and the proportions of Britain’s overseas trade carried by air amounted
to 17 per cent of the value of exports and 13 per cent of imports. Among
the main commodities exported by air are machinery, medicinal and pharma¬
ceutical products, and diamonds.
Of the 123 licensed civil aerodromes in Britain, just over one-quarter each
handles more than 100,000 passengers a year. In 1976 Britain’s civil airports
handled a total of 45-9 million passengers (447 million terminal passengers
and 1-2 million in transit), 6-6 per cent more than in 1975, and 659,000 tonnes
of freight. The two major airports in the London area (Heathrow and Gatwick)
handled most passengers, 237 million and 5*8 million respectively. Other
leading airports were Manchester 2-9 million passengers, Glasgow 2 million,
Luton, Birmingham and Belfast. While the number of air passengers has, in
general, risen in recent years, there has not been a corresponding increase in
air transport movements owing to the growing use of wide-bodied aircraft.
The Government has initiated a detailed review of airports policy to consider
the alternative ways of handling the predicted increase in traffic through
Britain’s airports. Following consultations on two documents, one dealing
with airports in the London area and the other with regional airports, the
Government intends to announce its policy later in 1977.
The British Airports Authority (BAA), an independent statutory body
operating on a commercial basis, owns and manages seven airports—Heath¬
row, Gatwick and Stansted in the south-east, and Glasgow, Edinburgh,
Prestwick and Aberdeen in Scotland—which handle 72 per cent of air passen¬
gers and 84 per cent of air cargo traffic in Britain. In 1976-77 the BAA’s
income was £103-2 million and it recorded a pre-tax profit of £i4'4 million.
Eight small aerodromes in the Highlands and Islands of Scotland are
controlled by the Civil Aviation Authority and Belfast’s airport (Aldergrove)
is managed by Northern Ireland Airports Ltd., a subsidiary of the Northern
Ireland Transport Holding Company. Most of the other public airports are
controlled by local authorities. All airports and aerodromes in Britain (apart
from those controlled by the Government or by the CAA) must be licensed
annually by the CAA. Stringent requirements, such as the provision of adequate
fire-fighting, medical and rescue services, suitable runways, and of air traffic
control services and visual aids, must be satisfied before a licence is granted.
Work is in progress to develop facilities at many of Britain’s airports. A
major modernisation programme is under way at Heathrow, the world’s
busiest centre for international travel, to improve passenger facilities and
plans are being considered for a fourth terminal to enable Heathrow to handle
between 35 million and 40 million passengers a year.
Gatwick airport, 28 miles (45 kilometres) south of London, is the second
major airport for the London area and was the first in the world to bring
together road, rail and air transport connections in one unit. Its capacity will
be increased to about 16 million passengers a year by 1978, when a £100
million redevelopment programme reaches completion. In April 1977 the

Government announced measures to ensure greater use of Gatwick so as to
relieve congestion at Heathrow.
A five-year development scheme, costing some £10 million, started in 1977
for the expansion of terminal facilities at Aldergrove. Under a ^15 million
redevelopment scheme for Edinburgh airport, a 2,560-metre runway was
opened in 1976 and a new terminal building was completed in May 1977.
Offshore oil and gas activities have stimulated a major expansion programme
at Aberdeen airport, where a new terminal was opened in June 1977, and
developments at other airports including Inverness and Sumburgh (Shetland).
THE POST OFFICE
The Post Office, founded in 1657, provides postal, telecommunications, data
processing and Giro services. It was set up as a public authority under the
Post Office Act 1969, having previously been a government department. The
chairman and members of the board are appointed by the Secretary of State
for Industry. With some 407,000 employees, it is the largest commercial
employer in Europe.
In 1976-77 the Post Office’s income, excluding internal transactions, was
£3,806 million and a profit of £291-3 million was recorded, with profits of
£264-4 million on telecommunications and £24-3 million on posts. The
Post Office is investing some £4,800 million at March 1976 prices in the period
1976-81; capital expenditure on fixed assets amounted to £868 million in
1976-77. Some £50 million a year is spent on research and development,
mostly at the Post Office’s research centre at Martlesham Heath (Suffolk),
which was officially opened in 1975.
The Post Office pioneered postal services and was the first service to issue
adhesive postage stamps as proof of advance payment for mail. It provides
deliveries each working day to 22 million addresses. In 1976-77 the Post Office
handled some 152 million parcels and 9,306 million items of other correspon¬
dence (including 8,795 million inland letters). Each year some 670 million
letters and parcels are sent overseas, of which over 530 million are carried
by air.
Postal operations are being mechanised and by 1980 there will be a national
network of 82 mechanised high-speed sorting offices. Large parcel centres,
each serving a group of counties, are gradually taking over the work of the
1,200 offices which handle parcels manually. Mechanised sorting is aided by
the use of postcodes, of which there are 1-5 million, and Britain’s postcode
system is one of the most sophisticated in the world.
Britain has 23,100 post offices, of which about 1,600 are run directly by the
Post Office and the remainder are run on an agency basis by sub-postmasters.
At a post office counter, besides making use of its postal and telegraph facilities,
a person may draw a pension or a family allowance, buy a dog licence, a tele¬
vision receiving licence, renew a motor vehicle licence, obtain a British visitor’s
passport, buy national insurance stamps, and use the facilities of the National
Savings Bank (see p. 345) and of the National Giro (see p. 343). In much of its
counter service the Post Office acts as agent for government departments and
local authorities.
Other Services The Post Office provides a range of 40 specialist services, mainly for com¬
merce. ‘Datapost’, a door-to-door overnight delivery service originally for

computer data has been expanded to include documents, medical samples
and spare parts, and handles 2-5 million packets a year. There are international
datapost links with ten countries. An ‘expresspost’ messenger service, for
rapid delivery of mail within or between cities, was started in London in 1976
and has been extended to a number of other cities. About one-third of the
Post Office’s philatelic business, which mainly involves the sale of stamps to
collectors or dealers, is conducted by the Philatelic Bureau in Edinburgh.
The British Postal Consultancy Service offers advice and assistance on all
aspects of postal business to overseas postal administrations, and over 20
countries have used its services.
Britain has the world’s third largest telecommunications system, after the
United States and Japan, with more than 22 million telephones, nearly 14
million exchange connections, 64,800 telex connections and 43,100 data
transmission terminals (more than in any country except the United States).
The Post Office’s telecommunications business employs 228,000 people, has
assets of over £5,000 million, and runs eight factories and a fleet of nearly
48,000 telecommunications vehicles.
In 1976-77 some 16,770 million telephone calls were made in Britain com¬
prising 14,200 million local calls, 2,456 million trunk calls and 114 million
international calls. Virtually all local and trunk calls can be dialled direct.
To back up its nationwide system of cables, the Post Office has built a network
of radio towers for transmitting telephone calls, television programmes and
computer data over microwave channels. At the centre is the Post Office
Tower, which stands nearly 600 feet (183 metres) high in London.
Several specialised services are available by telephone including the ‘999’
emergency dialling service enabling subscribers to be connected as quickly as
possible, and free of charge, to the police, ambulance or fire brigade. Of the 500
million calls a year made to the information services, 400 million are to the
speaking clock. Other recorded information services include weather forecasts,
motoring information, recipes, cricket scores, Financial Times Share Index
and Business News Summary, and ‘Dial a Disc’.
Over 800 electronic exchanges are in use in Britain and orders for a further
300 have been placed. They are more reliable than conventional electro¬
mechanical exchanges as they have very few moving parts and so require less
maintenance. Most electronic exchanges are of the TXE2 type, with a capacity
of up to 7,000 lines. Larger TXE4 exchanges, with a capacity of up to 40,000
lines, have been brought into service since February 1976.
Britain is linked by international direct dialling to more countries than any
other nation; about three-quarters of Britain’s telephone subscribers can dial
direct to 59 countries. About 80 per cent of all international calls are dialled
direct. The demand for international calls is doubling every four or five years
and the Post Office has substantially increased the amount of equipment in its
international exchanges and raised the number of cable and satellite circuits
linking Britain with other countries from nearly 3,000 in 1970 to over 8,000 in
mid-1977. Over 60 per cent of the international telephone traffic to or from
Britain is carried by satellite. Three aerials at the Goonhilly earth station in
Cornwall provide commercial telecommunications services via high-capacity
geostationary satellites positioned over the Atlantic and Indian Oceans.

satellite network and a second earth station is being built at Madley (Hereford
and Worcester) to cope with the growth in international traffic.
Some 243 submarine cables, covering a total of 905 nautical miles (1,677
kilometres), are part of Britain’s internal cable network, while there are 28
cables, covering a total of 4,445 nautical miles (8,237 kilometres), from Britain
to the continent of Europe, the Irish Republic, the Channel Islands and the
Faroe Islands, and five cables between Britain and North America.
The Post Office provides day-to-day communications links and radio services
for shipping of all nations through one long-range and 11 medium-range
radio stations around the coastline of Britain. At all medium-range stations a
continuous watch is maintained on the international distress frequencies, as
part of a safety of life at sea service provided on behalf of the Department of
Trade. A number of remotely controlled short-range coast radio stations are
being installed to provide radiotelephone links with ships at sea at a range of
up to 50 miles (80 kilometres).
Oil and gas production platforms in the North Sea are being linked to
Britain’s telecommunications network by transhorizon radio. New radio
stations in north-east Scotland and in south Shetland entered service in 1975
and a further station is being built in south Shetland.
Post Office Datel services provide for transmission of information for com¬
puters and other automatic processors. A wide variety of data transmission
facilities, at speeds from 50 bits a second to 50,000 bits a second are provided
using Post Office circuits. The services consist of a suitable telegraph or tele¬
phone line and, when necessary, a modem (which converts digital signals into
voice frequencies for transmission). The Post Office will introduce in 1978 a
service at 4,800 bits a second over the public telephone network. Work is
nearing completion on the development of an internationally compatible Datel
service at 2,400 bits a second.
The British telex service is fully automatic. Demand for inland and inter¬
national telex services is growing and the number of connections has nearly
doubled since 1971. Customers can dial direct to over 100 countries and 98 per
cent of all international calls are dialled direct.
International telegrams are transmitted through the Post Office’s computer-
controlled Telegram Retransmission Centre in London, the largest of its kind
in the world, which has greatly improved efficiency by reducing the average
handling time of international telegrams. It has direct access to terminals in
over 90 countries.
The Post Office is developing several new telecommunications services. Full-
scale trials of ‘Viewdata’, a telephone service providing a wide range of infor¬
mation which can be displayed on a television set, are planned to start in mid-
1978. A radiopaging service, which allows a person carrying a tiny radio
receiver to be contacted over a wide area, was started in south-east England in
1977. ‘Confravision’, the world’s first purpose-built public audio-visual
conference service, operates between studios in London, Birmingham, Bristol,
Glasgow and Manchester. It allows groups of people to conduct meetings in
sound and vision between any two or three of these cities.
Post Office engineers are studying new ways of transmitting telephone calls,

for example, optical fibres in which a batch of glass fibres (each able to carry
some 2,000 telephone channels) would be made into a continuous flexible
cable, possibly accommodating 500,000 telephone circuits. The Post Office is
proceeding with the world’s first commercial ‘waveguide’ phone project, which
will be in operation between Bristol and Reading by 1983. Waveguides, in
which very high frequency radio waves are sent through a hollow copper
tube, are designed for busy routes, and a tube of 2 inches (51 millimetres) in
diameter might carry 500,000 telephone conversations simultaneously.
The Post Office has a corporate Data Processing Service for internal services,
and a comprehensive bureau service, known as National Data Processing, for
customers in industry and commerce. It operates some of the most compre¬
hensive data processing systems in Europe and has implemented more than
300 projects.
As a major industrial country, Britain has a labour force characterised by a
high level of technical and commercial skill which has often shown its capacity
to adapt to changing economic conditions and technical progress. To ensure
as far as possible that Britain’s working population, like the country’s other
economic resources, is fully utilised, the Government intervenes in the labour
market in a number of ways: by providing public employment and training
services; by policies to promote regional development and labour mobility;
by measures to alleviate unemployment; through legislation to regulate terms
and conditions of employment and improve industrial relations; by providing
for security of employment and incomes; and through legislation relating to
health and safety at work.
THE WORKING POPULATION
d he total working population of Britain at the middle of June 1976 was 26’1
million, about 47 per cent of the total population. If the unemployed, the self-
employed, and the Armed Forces are omitted from the working population,
there remained 22-5 million employees (13-3 million men and 9-2 million
women) in employment. The percentage of women (particularly those working
part-time) in the labour force continues to rise, although at a reduced rate
compared with previous years. The great majority of the working population
work for a wage or salary, but nearly 2 million are employers or self-employed.
The working population increased slowly until 1966, then declined between
1966 and 1971, since when it has been rising again (see Table 20). One reason
for the fall after 1966 was the increased number in full-time education. During
the late 1970s the male labour force is expected to increase slowly, while the
number of females is expected to continue to increase. In June 1976 men
accounted for 59-3 per cent of all employees and women for 40,7 per cent
(including 13-4 per cent part-time).

Though successful development policies in the less-prosperous regions may
raise the working population above the levels forecast, any increasing demand
for labour must in general be met by better deployment of manpower, improved
productivity and more training. In general, non-employed married women
form the only substantial reserve.

The total working population of Northern Ireland, including employers and
self-employed, was about 607,000 in June 1976 (386,000 males and 221,000
females). The number of employees in employment was about 492,000. The
largest non-service industries are agriculture, engineering, textiles and
clothing. Most of the agricultural workers in Northern Ireland are family
workers. Farmers and small-holders working their own holdings account for
about 6 per cent of the working population.
MANPOWER POLICY
In Great Britain the Department of Employment is generally responsible for
employment policy, industrial relations and pay policy, and for the payment of
unemployment benefit, but the Manpower Services Commission (MSC)
advises the Government on manpower policy issues and, with the agreement of
EMPLOYMENT
311
EMPLOYMENT
SERVICES
Special
Services
the Government, has set itself the long-term aim of developing a comprehen¬
sive manpower policy with a dual function: to enable the country’s manpower
resources to be developed and contribute fully to economic well-being; and
to ensure that there is available to each worker the opportunities and services
he or she needs in order to lead a satisfying working life. Responsibility for the
activities of the MSC in Scotland and Wales rests with the Secretaries of State
for Scotland and Wales respectively, while, in Northern Ireland, corresponding
responsibilities are undertaken by the Department of Manpower Services.
The MSC, which is separate from the Government but accountable to the
Secretary of State for Employment, has a chairman and nine other members
appointed after consultation with employers and employees, and local govern¬
ment and educational interests; responsibility for the management and develop¬
ment of the commission’s services thus belongs directly to representatives of
those who use them. Scottish and Welsh committees of the MSC consider
special Scottish and Welsh dimensions of manpower issues, and bring these
to the attention of the respective Secretaries of State.
The MSC carries out its functions within a general policy framework
agreed with the Secretary of State, and was responsible for expenditure of about
^370 million in 1976-77. Most of its activities are financed from public funds,
and it receives an annual grant-in-aid from the Department of Employment,
which from 1978-79 will include contributions from the Scottish and Welsh
Offices. The MSC is advised by a network of district manpower committees
on which employers, employees and other local interests are represented, to
secure the full benefit of local knowledge and the co-operation of employers
and employees. The main statutory duty of the MSC is to make such arrange¬
ments as it considers appropriate for assisting people to select, train for, obtain
and retain employment, and for assisting employers to obtain suitable
employees. It exercises this duty through two agencies, the Employment
Service Agency (ESA) and the Training Services Agency (TSA), both of
which are statutory organisations headed by a chief executive. The services in
Northern Ireland are run on similar lines by the Department of Manpower
Services but there are some variations related to the much smaller area of
administration.
The main public employment services (other than the careers service) are
provided in Great Britain by the MSC’s Employment Service Agency, whose
principal aim is to provide a comprehensive service for employers needing
staff and for people, whether or not already in employment, seeking jobs.
It operates through a network of nearly 1,000 local employment offices and
jobcentres, which handle the full range of occupations and deal with full-time,
part-time and temporary vacancies.
Though use of the service by both employers and job-seekers is voluntary,
in the year to March 1977 over 5-5 million people registered for employment,
2-1 million vacancies were notified and 1-5 million were filled, representing
about 18 per cent of total adult engagements in that year.
Employment offices are being replaced by jobcentres which provide self-
service facilities in addition to other services.
Special employment services include services to the disabled, occupational
guidance, services to assist the geographical mobility of workers, Professional
and Executive Recruitment and the Careers Service.
Services to the
Disabled
The public employment service has long provided a resettlement service to
disabled people. This is provided by over 500 specialised disablement resettle-

ment officers (DROs) who also give advice on the various courses of rehabilita¬
tion or training available, and to employers on aspects of employing disabled
people and the grants available for adaptation of equipment. The DROs
administer the quota scheme which, under the Disabled Persons (Employ¬
ment) Act 1944, requires employers to include a percentage of registered
disabled people among their workforce. Employment rehabilitation is provided
at 26 centres (including one linked with a medical rehabilitation unit); in
1976-77 nearly 15,500 people attended the wide range of courses available.
The ESA also gives financial assistance to voluntary and local authority
bodies concerned with specific disabilities such as blindness, cerebral palsy
and psychiatric disorders; in 1976-77 more than 600 people passed through
these courses.
There are vocational training facilities for the disabled at skillcentres,
educational institutions and employers’ establishments. For the more seriously
disabled there are special residential training colleges run by voluntary organi¬
sations with the help of the Training Services Agency (TSA). Grants are
available to disabled people qualified to undertake study or training for pro¬
fessional or comparable employment.
In Great Britain, sheltered employment is provided for the severely disabled
by Remploy Ltd., a non-profit-making company, and by local authorities and
voluntary organisations. A similar organisation, Ulster Sheltered Employment
Ltd., exists in Northern Ireland. The ESA also works in close co-operation
with the National Advisory Council on Employment of Disabled People.
In 1976 the ESA helped with the cost of providing places for over 13,750
severely disabled people, of which approximately 2,000 were blind or partially
sighted and 130 were trainees.
Occupational Guidance is a free advisory service available to anyone seeking
advice on changing or choosing a job and operates through a national network
of 43 occupational guidance units, helping about 50,000 people a year. The
service is based on interviews with specially trained staff who can call on the
services of occupational psychologists if necessary.
In order to ease unemployment, particularly in the assisted areas, the ESA
administers various grants and allowances under the Employment Transfer
Scheme to enable the unemployed to take up jobs in other areas, the Job
Search Scheme which helps with expenses while looking for a job in an area
where work is more likely to be available, the Key Workers Scheme which
helps men and women who move temporarily or permanently to occupy key
posts in establishments set up by their employers in assisted areas, and the
Nucleus Labour Force Scheme which helps local employees in new factories
to be trained in the parent factory.
Professional and Executive Recruitment (PER) provides a specialist employ¬
ment service at managerial, professional, scientific and technical levels. It is
organised separately from the rest of the ESA and operates through a network
of 36 offices staffed by experienced consultants. PER has a computer-assisted
matching and selection system but also offers an interviewing service and an
advertising service. The service is free to candidates while employers are
charged a fee on all successful placings based on the starting salary, the type of
service and the type of candidate placed. A broadly similar service, free to
both employers and candidates, is operated in Northern Ireland.
Local education authorities have a statutory obligation to provide a vocational ^
guidance and employment service (the Careers Service) for people attending

educational institutions and in the early years of their employment. People can
also use the services of the ESA which works in co-operation with the careers
service.
In Northern Ireland the Careers Service is an integral part of the Department
of Manpower Services.
In general, people coming to Britain for employment (including Common¬
wealth citizens who do not have the right of abode, see p. 13, but excluding
nationals of European Community countries and Gibraltar) need a work
permit issued by the Department of Employment. This must be applied for
by the prospective employer for a specific person and is issued for a specific
job and for a fixed initial period not exceeding 12 months in the first instance.
People admitted as holders of work permits may change their jobs only with the
approval of the Department of Employment. Normally their stay is extended
on application to the Home Office if they remain in approved employment.
After four years’ approved employment the time limit attached to their stay
may be removed and a worker may change employment without restriction.
Permits are in general issued only for work requiring a professional qualifica¬
tion, skill or experience, where the Department of Employment is satisfied that
the worker is necessary, and where the wages and conditions are not less
favourable than those generally available in the area for similar work.
Permits for hotel and catering workers (other than those exceptionally
highly skilled), nursing auxiliaries and resident domestic workers in hospitals,
schools and similar establishments and private households are subject to
overall numerical limits decided annually. Permits for resident domestic
employment are issued only for unmarried people and for married couples if
they are to work in a joint post. They are not issued to those with children
under 16 years of age. Permits for nursing auxiliaries are issued only for un¬
married people without dependants.
Commonwealth citizens and foreign nationals (other than nationals of
European Community countries and Gibraltar) are generally eligible for
permits on the same terms. In addition, Commonwealth citizens may be
admitted for fixed periods of training ‘on the job’ arranged in advance if they
hold trainee permits issued by the Department of Employment. Foreign
nationals may also enter Britain as holders of student employee permits for
short-term employment to enable them to improve their English and widen
their business experience.
In Northern Ireland employment permits are issued by the Department of
Manpower Services and are required for non-Northern Ireland workers.
Legislation defines Northern Ireland workers and makes certain occupations
exempt.
The European Community regulations, now enforced in Great Britain,
establish the rights of workers to move freely between member States for the
purposes of employment. In Northern Ireland there is a transitional period
extending up to 31 st December 1977 before this applies. European Community
workers entering another member State are entitled to be treated in the same
way as nationals of that State as regards facilities of the national employment
services, pay and working conditions, trade union rights, vocational training
and retraining facilities, access to housing and property, and insurance and
industrial injury benefits. Workers who wish to remain in the United King¬
dom for longer than an initial period of six months are expected to apply to the
Home Office for a residence permit. If they are in permanent employment the
residence permit is valid for five years. If the employment is temporary (that is,
3H

for less than a year) the permit is valid for the expected duration of the em¬
ployment.
Race relations employment advisers, based in the Department of Employment’s
regional offices, provide advice and information to employers, trade unions, and
other organisations with the aim of improving employment opportunities for
immigrant workers.
The general unemployment rate in Britain as a whole was among the lowest in
the world during the 20 years prior to 1967—usually between 1 and 2 per cent—
and, although it has risen since then, it was still lower during 1976 and 1977
than in several other major industrial countries.
It has been relatively low in the south-east of England, and consistently
higher in those parts of the country which have the greatest dependence on
shipbuilding, coalmining, and certain branches of the heavy engineering and
metal manufacturing industries, notably parts of Scotland and Wales, and
north-east England and Merseyside. The general unemployment rate in
Great Britain in July 1977 was 5-8 per cent: the areas with the highest rates
were Wales and Scotland and the north of England.
The unemployment rate in Northern Ireland has remained higher than in
other parts of the United Kingdom. In July 1977 it was 107 per cent of all
employees.
The Government’s programme for alleviating unemployment (which rose
rapidly, as in other developed industrial countries, during 1975 and 1976 and
has since remained at a high level) has to be viewed within the context of a
succession of measures designed to assist industrial investment and help
industry generally (see p. 209). These measures have been introduced pro¬
gressively since August 1975 to check the rise in unemployment and at the
same time to safeguard and expand Britain’s industrial potential so as to
provide the base for more jobs in the medium term.
The measures include: a temporary employment subsidy for firms who agree
to defer redundancies which would otherwise have taken place; a job creation
programme providing temporary employment for those worst hit by high
unemployment—largely young people; a Youth Employment Subsidy to
assist longer-term unemployed young people; expansion of training pro¬
grammes; a ‘work experience’ programme designed to give unemployed
young people a realistic introduction to the requirements, disciplines and
satisfactions of working life; a ‘job-release’ scheme to encourage older workers,
close to pensionable age, to leave work early and thus release jobs for younger
unemployed people; expansion of the Careers Service and of the ‘Community
Industry’ scheme, which helps young people who have had particular difficulty
in settling into stable jobs; two experimental schemes—a subsidy to encourage
recruitment by small firms and a job introduction scheme for disabled people;
additional funds to encourage the movement of unemployed workers to areas
where jobs are available (see also p. 210); and assistance for industrial
investment.
Since April 1975 the Government has made available nearly £900 million
for measures to alleviate unemployment which will help an estimated 750,000
people or more. In addition, between April 1975 and March 1977, nearly
£ 1,700 million was spent or made available to encourage industrial investment
and expansion.
A new programme of opportunities for young people is being developed
along the lines of proposals put forward in a report by the MSC in May 1977.

The task of managing and developing the country’s training programme
is the responsibility of the Training Services Agency (TSA) of the Manpower
Services Commission. The main responsibility for carrying out industrial and
commercial training lies with individual employers, but in recent years the
Government, through the MSC and the TSA, has taken a number of measures
to help ensure the supply of trained manpower needed by the economy, to
provide opportunities for individuals to acquire new skills, and to improve
training efficiency and effectiveness.
There are 23 industrial training boards and one industrial training committee,
representing about half the employed population, which are responsible for
industrial training in their respective industries. They receive Exchequer
funds to cover their operating expenses, grants for certain key training activi¬
ties, and special grants to support craft and technician training during the
current economic recession. The boards’ operating plans and budgets are
agreed with the TSA over a two-year period; this is supplemented by discus¬
sions on the five-year training needs of the industries.
The TSA also promotes training for some 11 million people employed in
industries not covered by industrial training boards and maintains liaison
with all major training organisations in this sector.
The Training Opportunities Scheme (TOPS) is intended to supplement the
training given in industry and commerce by providing individuals over the age
of 19 with the opportunity to acquire new skills. Training is carried out at 63
skillcentres and at colleges and employers’ establishments. About 800 courses
are available, though skillcentre courses concentrate mainly on engineering,
construction and automotive skills and those at colleges on clerical and com¬
mercial skills. Trainees are paid allowances which vary with domestic respon¬
sibilities and may receive, among other things, an earnings-related supplement,
travelling expenses and a lodging allowance. Nearly 90,000 people were trained
under TOPS in 1976 and the number will increase to 100,000 in 1980.
The TSA also provides a number of other direct training services to employers.
The Training Within Industry (TWI) scheme is intended to develop the
skills of supervisors in job relations, instructing and communicating, im¬
proving methods and preventing accidents. Special courses are available for
supervisors employed in offices, retail distribution and hospitals. Courses in
international trade procedures (ITP) are available for staff employed in export/
import offices and (at advanced level) for customs entry clerks. Courses in
instructional techniques are available to skillcentre staff and industrial and
commercial firms at the TSA’s two instructor training colleges (one in England
and one in Scotland) and at three instructor training units attached to skill-
centres.
Training services at skillcentres, TWI courses, and courses at instructor
training colleges are available to trainees from overseas under approved
schemes (for instance, those of the International Labour Organisation or
technical assistance provided jointly by the Department of Employment and
the Ministry of Overseas Development).
In-plant courses are also available. Employers are able to sponsor their own
employees for refresher and upgrading training at skillcentres, on courses
designed specifically to meet the needs of the employer and of the employees
concerned. There is also a mobile instructor service providing training to
employees in their own workshops.

BRITAIN 1978: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
EMPLOYMENT LAW
Britain has been a pioneer in the introduction of protective legislation for the
safety, health and welfare of employees and in providing certain legal im¬
munities for trade unions. The determination by statute of minimum wages,
holidays and holiday pay was until recently confined in principle to those
trades and industries where the organisation of employers or workers, or both,
was inadequate to negotiate collective agreements and to ensure their obser¬
vance. However, recent legislation, in particular the Employment Protection
Act 1975, provides considerable safeguards for the employee in his terms of
employment as well as working conditions. This Act also provides machinery,
under certain conditions, for enforcing the observance of the relevant terms and
conditions of employment. The Contracts of Employment Act 1972 requires
an employer to give an employee written information on his terms and con¬
ditions of employment, the disciplinary rules applicable to him and the pro¬
cedure available to him where he has a grievance about his employment or is
dissatisfied with any disciplinary decision relating to him; it also lays down the
right of both employers and employees to minimum periods of notice when
employment is to be terminated. Under the Redundancy Payments Acts 1965
and 1969 employees with a minimum period of service of 104 weeks are entitled
to lump-sum redundancy payments if their jobs cease to exist (for example,
because of technological improvements or because of a fall in demand) and their
employers cannot offer suitable alternative work, the cost being partly met from
a fund subscribed to by industry. The Trade Union and Labour Relations
Acts 1974 and 1976 give protection against unfair dismissal by providing
machinery under which an employee may complain against an employer of
unfair dismissal, and obtain reinstatement, re-engagement or compensa¬
tion ; and give legal support to the right to trade union organisation by making
it unfair to dismiss a person because of his membership or participation in the
activities of an independent trade union. The Employment Protection Act
1975 improves the remedies for unfair dismissal and extends the rights of
employees regarding dismissal and penalisation short of dismissal because of
trade union membership or activities, and payment when work is not available
for reasons other than as a result of a trade dispute. It also introduces maternity
rights for women employees which include protection from dismissal because
of pregnancy, maternity pay, and the right to return to work after confinement.
The Race Relations Act 1976 (see p. 137) makes it unlawful for employers to
discriminate because of colour, race, or ethnic or national origin when recuit-
ing workers or in their treatment of employees in regard to their terms and
conditions of employment, promotion, transfer, training, and access to other
benefits, and dismissal.
The employment provisions of the Sex Discrimination Act (see p. 135)
make sex discrimination unlawful in employment, training and related
matters. An employer may not discriminate between men and women either
in recruitment or in treatment of existing employees in such matters as pro¬
motion, training, transfer, benefits and facilities and dismissal. It is also
unlawful for a married person to be treated less favourably than a single person
of the same sex.
PAY, HOURS OF WORK AND HOLIDAYS
Pay for manual occupations, and increasingly for non-manual occupations, is
normally set by collective bargaining (see p. 323). In a small number of indus¬
tries, legally enforceable minimum rates are set by wages councils.
EMPLOYMENT
317
Basic rates of pay vary widely, though in private industry local rates nor¬
mally exceed the rates specified in national agreements. Higher rates are
usually paid for overtime and shift work, and weekly earnings may be further
increased by incentive bonus schemes. Piecework, or payment-by-results, is
still common, though of declining importance as production methods in a
number of industries increasingly dictate employees’ output.
Earnings, wage rates, retail prices, wages and
salaries 1972-77
According to the latest annual survey conducted by the Department of
Employment into earnings and hours of work the average weekly earnings of
full-time male adult manual workers in April 1976 were, including overtime,
£65• 1 o; while for full-time female adult manual workers they were £39-40. The
corresponding figures for non-manual workers were £8i-6o and £48-80.
Women’s earnings are thus markedly lower than those of men, partly because
on average they work shorter hours, with less overtime paid at premium rates,
and partly because they tend to be concentrated in the less well-paid jobs. The
Equal Pay Act 1970 requires that a woman doing the same or broadly similar
work to a man qualifies for equal pay and conditions of employment.

BRITAIN 1978: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Between April 1970 and April 1976 the average weekly earnings of manual
workers before tax and national insurance deductions increased by 139 per cent
for men and by 190 per cent for women. Part of the increase has been offset by
a rise in retail prices of about 119 per cent and by larger national insurance
contributions and income tax. For trends between 1972 and 1977 in earnings,
wage rates, retail prices, wages and salaries, see the diagram on p. 317.
Remuneration in commercial, technical and professional careers is normally by
annual salary paid monthly, often on a scale carrying annual increments, and
such careers generally afford opportunities for promotion to posts with higher
remuneration. Starting salaries may be in the range of £2,000 to £2,500 (lower
for trainees from 16-18 years of age and higher for some graduates entering
industry).
Most of the senior posts in business, the professions and the Civil Service
command salaries in the range of £8,000 to £ 15,000 a year gross before tax. The
posts with salaries in the range of £15,000 to £30,000 a year include those of
Cabinet Ministers, top-ranking judicial appointments, the highest positions in
government departments and the largest municipal authorities, editors of daily
newspapers, some persons outstanding in their professions and in the higher
managerial posts in industry, commerce and banking. Salaries of chairmen of
major companies exceptionally exceed £50,000 a year gross, though highly
successful people (such as star entertainers) often receive more through fees
or fixed contracts. The range of net incomes in the country as a whole is, how¬
ever, reduced by a system of progressive taxation and by provisions for social
security.
The Royal Commission on the Distribution of Income and Wealth was set up
in 1974 to examine and report on various aspects of the distribution of personal
incomes, both earned and unearned, and wealth as are referred to it by the
Government. The commission has produced four reports both on the general
state of, and trends in, income distribution, and on specific subjects such as
higher incomes; an examination of lower incomes is being undertaken. The
Government attaches great importance to the results of the commission’s
inquiries, as a means of establishing a sound basis for policy guidance on
such matters as pay, industrial relations and social security.
The normal working week in Britain is in the range 39-40 hours for manual
work and 37-38 for non-manual work; a five-day week is usually worked.
Actual hours worked in manual occupations differ from their standard hours;
in October 1976 they were 44 for men compared with 37-4 for women. Men
and women in non-manual occupations generally work less overtime than
manual workers.
National legislation limits and defines permissible hours of work for women
and young people in a number of industries or trades—the maximum, with
limited exceptions, being 48 hours a week and 10 hours a day (9 hours a day for
6-day-week workers) in premises covered by the Factories Act for adult women
over 18 and young people between 16 and 18. The employment of women and
young people at night is prohibited in industrial undertakings, except for
young men over 16 working in some continuous-process industries (subject to
certain conditions). The Department of Employment can make exemptions
from these restrictions on grounds of public interest. In general the hours of
work of adult men, or of people not working in factories, are not restricted by
statute.

Holiday entitlements are normally determined by collective agreements.
These generally provide for at least three weeks paid holiday a year. However
about one-third of manual workers covered by agreements have entitlements
of four weeks or more. Non-manual workers generally have longer holidays
than manual workers. Additional holidays, dependent upon length of service,
are also quite common.
In addition to annual holidays, most agreements provide for bank holidays
or public holidays. In England and Wales, in addition to Christmas Day and
Good Friday, regular bank holidays take place on New Year’s Day, Easter
Monday, the last Monday in May, the last Monday in August and 26th Decem¬
ber. A new bank holiday is to be declared on Monday, 1st May 1978, and a
holiday in respect of May Day will be declared for subsequent years. In Scot¬
land public holidays are declared locally; regular bank holidays are New
Year s Day, 2nd January, Good Friday, the first Monday in May, the last
Monday in May (from 1978), the first Monday in August, Christmas Day and
26th December. The English and Welsh bank holidays apply also to Northern
Ireland, where in addition St. Patrick’s Day (17th March) and 12th July are
public holidays; the Tuesday after Easter is also a customary holiday for
industry and trade.
Provision for an alternative day to be observed is made when any bank or
public holiday falls on a Saturday or Sunday.
A variety of additional benefits exist in varying degree. It has been estimated
that at the end of 1975 11-5 million employees were covered by occupational
pension schemes. Many employees are also covered by occupational sick pay
schemes (additional or complementary to the State schemes). A smaller number
are covered by schemes for redundancy payments above the statutory mini¬
mum. Such benefits are more usual among clerical and professional employees
receiving a standard salary than among manual workers, who have a chance to
increase their pay—for example, by working overtime. Senior members of
firms may use a company car and some firms provide profit-sharing and share¬
saving schemes.
Social security benefits, which include unemployment, sickness and industrial
injury benefits, are described in the Social Welfare chapter.
INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS
The structure of industrial relations in Britain has been established mainly
on a voluntary basis. The system is based chiefly on the organisation of em¬
ployees and employers into trade unions and employers’ associations, and on
freely conducted negotiations between them at all levels. The State is ready to
provide assistance where the organisation of employees, employers, or both, is
inadequate to conduct negotiations, or where the usual methods of resolving
disagreements have failed.
For the most part, this voluntary system (supported by certain basic legal
provisions) results in good industrial relations, and the closer involvement of
the trade union movement in economic management in recent years has
resulted in a considerable reduction in the number and extent of industrial
disputes.
Over the ten years 1966-75 Britain lost fewer days per 1,000 employees
through industrial disputes than several other major industrial countries;
moreover, there was a considerable decline in strike activity in 1975 and 1976.
320
BRITAIN 1978: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
The number of man-days lost through industrial disputes fell from a peak of
nearly 24 million in 1972 to 3-28 million in 1976, the lowest since 1966.
A study carried out in the Department of Employment has shown that even
in the period 1971-73 (chosen for special study as years of relatively high
strike activity), 98 per cent of manufacturing plants in Britain were free of
strikes in any one of these three years.
TRADE UNIONS In nearly all industries and occupations some workers (and in some industries
nearly all workers) are organised into trade unions. These have grown up
gradually and independently over many years and, consequently, their form
and organisation vary considerably, as do their traditions. In the last decade or
so, trade unionism has again increased particularly among clerical, super¬
visory, technical and administrative workers. Trade unions may be organised
either by occupation (for example, they may recruit clerks or fitters wherever
employed) or by industry. Some are based on a combination of both principles.
At the end of 1975 the total membership of British trade unions was nearly
12 million. There were 488 unions, but over 77 per cent of all trade unionists
were in the 25 largest unions, each with a membership of 100,000 or over, while
only o-6 per cent were in the 258 smallest unions with under 1,000 members each.
The Certification Officer appointed under the Employment Protection Act
1975 is required to maintain a list of trade unions. To be eligible for entry on
the list a trade union must show that it consists wholly or mainly of workers
and that its principal purposes include the regulation of relations between
workers and employers, or between workers and employers’ associations.
Under the Employment Protection Act 1975 and other legislation, certain
rights and privileges are reserved for independent trade unions. A trade union
on the list may apply to the Certification Officer for a certificate that it is
independent, such a certificate being conclusive evidence of independence.
The central organisation of most large unions consists of a national executive
council, usually elected by and responsible to the annual conference of delegates
from local branches. Between conferences, councils are the highest authority of
unions, and carry out policy decisions made by conference delegates. Most
unions also have regional and district organisations. At the level of the individual
member there are local branches, covering one or more factories. Members may
attend branch meetings, make suggestions about terms and conditions of
employment, discuss the work of the union, and take part in the election of the
union’s officers. The branch takes action on certain matters considered to be
entirely, or mainly, of local interest and forwards its views on wider issues for
action by the union’s national or regional bodies. The organising of members in
individual places of work, and the negotiation of local pay agreements with
managements at the factory or plant, may be done by full-time district officials
of the union, or, increasingly, by ‘shop stewards’, who are chosen by their
fellow members in the place of work to represent them. Trade unions vary in
the degree to which shop stewards are integrated into their organisation. Where
two or more unions have members in the same workplace, shop stewards’
committees may be formed to discuss matters of common concern.
Unions often provide dispute benefit (‘strike pay’) for members involved in
official industrial action. They also provide legal advice for members who suffer
injury or contract diseases at work, and may pay members’ legal costs where a
case for compensation goes to court. Some unions pay benefits in case of illness,
accident, death and retirement (additional to those payable under the national
insurance scheme) financed out of membership contributions. Many trade
unions are affiliated to the Labour Party.

of working people. Its affiliated membership comprises 113 trade unions which
together represent over 11 million workpeople, or 92 per cent of all trade
unionists in Britain. The TUC deals with all general questions which concern
trade unions both nationally and internationally and gives assistance on
questions relating to particular trades or industries.
The annual Congress convenes in September to discuss matters of concern to
trade unionists and to employees generally. It elects a General Council which
represents it between successive Congresses and is responsible for carrying out
Congress decisions, watching economic and social developments, providing
educational and advisory services to unions, and presenting to the Government
the trade union viewpoint on economic, social and industrial issues. The council
is also empowered to mediate in inter-union disputes in certain circumstances,
and uses its authority to deal with unauthorised and unconstitutional stoppages
of work, as well as official disputes.
The TUC as well as many individual unions conduct extensive educational
services for members, mainly concerned with industrial subjects, trade
unionism and the principles and practice of industrial relations.
The TUC plays an active part in international trade union activity, through
its affiliations to the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions and the
European Trade Union Confederation. It also nominates the British workers’
delegation to the annual International Labour Conference.
There are eight TUC regional councils in England, based on the Govern¬
ment’s eight planning regions (see p. 160), with a further similar body for Wales
known as the Wales Trades Union Council. These bodies, whose function is to
make representations to the Government’s various regional bodies, co-ordinate
the activities of trade unions in the regions and keep them in touch with the
policy of the TUC at national level.
Scottish trade unionists have also their own national central body, the Scottish
Trades Union Congress (STUC), which in many respects is similar in con¬
stitution and functions to the TUC. Trade unions whose membership includes
Scottish workers may affiliate to the STUC and a number of trade unions are
in fact affiliated to both bodies. Trade unions in Northern Ireland are repre¬
sented by the Northern Ireland Committee of the Irish Congress of Trade
Unions (ICTU), though the majority of trade unionists in Northern Ireland
belong to unions based in Great Britain. Almost 90 per cent of Northern
Ireland trade unionists are members of organisations affiliated to the ICTU,
while the majority belong to unions which are also affiliated to the TUC.
The TUC-Labour Party Liaison Committee was set up in 1972 after the
general council of the TUC, the national executive committee of the Labour
Party and the parliamentary committee of the Labour Party had agreed to
establish a liaison committee to discuss policies on industrial relations and
management of the economy. In 1973 the committee reached an agreement on
the ‘social contract’ (see p. 186) which was reaffirmed in July 1976.
Many employers in Britain are members of employers’ organisations, a large
number of which are wholly or partly concerned with labour matters. The
primary aims of such organisations are to help to establish suitable terms and
conditions of employment, including a sound wage structure and proper
322

Framework
standards of safety, health and welfare; to promote good relations with em¬
ployees and the efficient use of manpower; and to provide means of settling
any disputes which may arise. They may also represent members’ points of
view as manufacturers or traders to the Government on commercial matters.
Employers’ organisations are usually organised on an industry basis rather
than a product basis. A few are purely local in character or deal with a section of
an industry; others are national in scope and are concerned with the whole of an
industry. In some of the main industries there are local or regional organisations
combined into national federations, while in others, within which different
firms are engaged in making different principal products, there is a complex
structure with national and regional federations for parts of an industry as well
as for the industry as a whole. Altogether there are some 150 national employers’
organisations, which negotiate the national collective agreements for their
industry with the trade unions concerned. Many of these national organisations
belong to the CBI.
The final authority of local or small national organisations may be a meeting
where all member firms are directly represented; but in larger organisations
some form of indirect representation is necessary, either through local organisa¬
tions or through regions or sections into which these are grouped.
The representatives thus chosen, together with a number of office holders,
form a general council or central committee, which meets perhaps once a
quarter, mainly to make major policy decisions, to elect committees and to ratify
their work. A paid staff under a director or secretary carries out the day-to-day
work of the organisation. There is usually a small working group, consisting
of senior officials and committee chairmen, which meets to deal with urgent
questions and co-ordinate the work of committees. Employers’ associations (as
defined in the Trade Union and Labour Relations Act 1974) may apply to the
Certification Officer for inclusion in the list of employers’ associations main¬
tained by the officer.
The central body of employers is the CBI which deals with all matters affecting
the interests of employers and represents them nationally to the Government
and the public and also internationally, for instance, in the International
Labour Organisation and in the various institutions of the European Com¬
munity. It is also the British member of the Union of Industries of the
European Communities (UNICE), the Business and Industry Advisory Com¬
mittee to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, and
the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC). The majority of national em¬
ployers’ organisations and nationalised industries and a large number of
individual companies, both large and small, belong to the CBI, whose repre¬
sentatives or nominees sit on various official bodies and take part in the dis¬
cussion of matters of importance to the national economy through their
membership of the NEDC (see p. 188).
The Trade Union and Labour Relations Act 1974 defines the status of trade
unions and employers’ associations and sets out certain legal requirements
which they must observe. The Act confers immunities on trade unions in
respect of actions taken in support of a trade dispute, for example, peaceful
picketing, and also provides that collective agreements shall not be legally
enforceable unless they are written agreements and specifically provide for
this.
The Employment Protection Act 1975 extends the right of employees in a
number of respects and strengthens voluntary collective bargaining. The Act

placed the ACAS on a statutory.basis, provided for the appointment of a
Certification Officer and for the setting up of the Central Arbitration Com¬
mittee; and established an Employment Appeal Tribunal to hear appeals
concerning decisions of the Certification Officer and of industrial tribunals.
(Industrial tribunals deal, in general, with complaints from employees on
infringements of individual rights under a number of Acts concerning, for
example, redundancy payments, contracts of employment, equal pay, unfair
dismissals and sex discrimination.)
Northern Ireland has a similar, but separate system of industrial relations under
which certain powers and responsibilities devolve upon the Department of
Manpower Services. Industrial relations legislation enacted in 1976 has
brought the province into line with similar legislation enacted in Great Britain
since 1974- The record of industrial stoppages and consequent working days
lost in Northern Ireland compares favourably with that in the rest of Britain.
In most industries terms and conditions of employment and procedures for
the conduct of industrial relations are settled by negotiation and agreement
between employers and trade unions. Whereas in the past the emphasis has
been on formal industry-wide agreements supplemented as necessary by
informal local agreements in firms or factories, a gradual change of attitude and
structure has led to increasing emphasis being placed on agreements at firm and
factory level (plant bargaining), though there have been some important
exceptions to this trend, for example in the motor industry. In some industries,
firms and factories, negotiations are conducted by meetings held when neces¬
sary, while in others, joint negotiating councils or committees have been
established on a permanent basis. The scope of the various joint bodies (from
the national joint industrial councils for whole industries to the works councils
and committees in individual workplaces) varies widely, and has frequently
been extended to cover such additional matters as production plans, absen¬
teeism, training, education and welfare (see below). Normally these arrange¬
ments for collective bargaining suffice to settle all questions which are raised,
but provision is sometimes made for matters not so settled to be referred
for settlement to independent conciliation or arbitration. The Employment
Protection Act 1975 makes provision for information needed for collective
bargaining purposes to be disclosed by employers to trade unions, subject to
certain safeguards.
Standing arrangements exist for consultation at national level between the
Government, the TUC, the CBI, and the nationalised industries through the
National Economic Development Council on matters in which employers and
workers have a common interest. The operation of collective bargaining has
from time to time been restricted in an attempt to control inflation (see p. 186).
The Advisory, Conciliation and Arbitration Service (ACAS) is charged with
the general duty of promoting the improvement of industrial relations, and in
particular of encouraging the extension of collective bargaining and the
development and (where necessary) reform of collective bargaining machinery.
ACAS was placed on a statutory basis under the Employment Protection Act
on 1 st January 1976, and is controlled by a council consisting of a chairman and
nine other members experienced in industrial relations, of which three are
nominated by the CBI, three by the TUC, and three are independent.
The service may offer conciliation in industrial disputes in both the public
and private sectors of industry where this is thought to be helpful, and has
BRITAIN 1978: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
324
discretion in meeting requests for conciliation subject only to the need to
pay regard to agreed procedures in the industry or area of employment con¬
cerned. Of some 3,000 disputes in which AC AS conciliated in 1976, less than a '
quarter resulted in a stoppage of work and about three-quarters were resolved
to the satisfaction of both parties.
At the joint request of the parties in dispute, and having regard to the need to
safeguard negotiating procedures, ACAS may appoint single arbitrators or
boards of arbitration to determine differences on the basis of agreed terms of
reference. Alternatively ACAS may refer cases for arbitration to the Central
Arbitration Committee (see below). Some 300 joint requests for arbitration
were made to ACAS during 1976.
Although ACAS has prime responsibility for intervention in disputes, the
Secretary of State retains powers to appoint a court of inquiry or committee of
investigation into a dispute, whether existing or foreseen.
The service gives advice on all aspects of industrial relations and personnel
management. It conducts surveys to diagnose the causes of industrial relations
problems and suggests remedial action to management and trade unions or
employee representatives. It also carries particular responsibility for attempting
conciliation on complaints of infringement of individual employee rights (such
as individual complaints of unfair dismissal, complaints under the Equal Pay
Act 1970 and complaints on employment matters under the Sex Discrimination
Act 1975).
The service is concerned with the long-term improvement of collective
bargaining and, with the consent of the parties involved, conducts detailed
inquiries in particular firms or industries. It also considers claims by in¬
dependent trade unions that they should be recognised by an employer.
The Central Arbitration Committee (CAC) is the permanent body for the
settlement of disputes by voluntary arbitration. Disputes are referred to the
CAC by ACAS at the joint request of the employers and trade unions con¬
cerned.
The committee is also called upon to arbitrate on claims made under various
Acts, including the Equal Pay Act 1970 and the Employment Protection Act
1975-
There is a growing acceptance in Britain of the need for movement towards
greater industrial democracy, that is, towards enabling workers to have a more
decisive voice in the way in which their firms are run. Some companies have
long had a system of works councils, and others are conducting experiments
in greater worker participation in one form or another.
In January 1977 a Committee of Inquiry on industrial democracy published
a report (the Bullock report, see Bibliography, p. 445) containing majority
recommendations for the introduction of legislation to give employees a right
to representation on the boards of management of companies with 2,000 or
more employees, following an application for such representation from a
recognised trade union and confirmation by a ballot of all employees. After
completing consultations on the report with the TUC and the CBI, the
Government will introduce legislative proposals on industrial democracy in
Parliament.
Public While industrial relations in government service and in the nationalised indus-
Authorities tries are, in general, organised on the same principles as in private industry,
there are some special features.

NEGOTIATING
MACHINERY
Non-industrial employees in central Government service, where salaries and
conditions of service are dealt with by the Civil Service Department, are
permitted and encouraged to join the appropriate Civil Service unions
and there is a highly developed system of negotiation and joint consultation by
means of the National and Departmental Whitley Councils. Unresolved
disputes may, subject to certain limitations, be reported to the Secretary of
State for reference to the Civil Service Arbitration Tribunal, an independent
body appointed by the Secretary of State. Government industrial employees
are similarly encouraged to belong to trade unions and machinery exists for
joint consultation. There are four Trades Joint Councils on which representa¬
tives of the Government and the trade unions sit to consider pay and conditions
of employment affecting individual grades and certain other limited matters.
A Joint Co-ordinating Committee, on which the Government and Trades
Joint Councils are represented, deals with national pay negotiations, conditions
of service and other matters of general application. In the main employing
departments there are departmental joint councils for the discussion of
domestic matters. Disputes on wages or conditions of employment that cannot
be resolved by the existing machinery can be referred to the Central Arbitration
Committee.
In local government service there are separate National Joint Councils for the
main grades of employees (such as manual, clerical and technical employees)
which deal with wages and conditions of service as well as other matters. There
are corresponding regional and district councils.
The major nationalised industries have a statutory duty to establish satisfactory
arrangements for collective bargaining and for joint consultation with their
employees. Unlike firms in the private sector, the corporations are not usually
members of employers’ associations (although the majority are ‘public sector
members’ of the CBI). In some industries they are sole or main employers, but
even where part of the industry is in private hands, as for example in road
transport, the corporations are separately and directly represented on wage¬
negotiating bodies.
Wages and conditions of service in the nationalised industries are generally
settled by negotiation between representatives of management and trade unions
at the national level; in most cases there are also regional and local bodies,
similarly representative, to deal with local implications but not normally to
negotiate separate local agreements. Most of the industries use the facilities for
arbitration offered to industry generally by the ACAS, but coalmining and
rail transport have their own special arrangements. Consultation at all levels,
including the workplace, has been arranged in all the nationalised industries.
The Office of Manpower Economics, established in 1971 as an independent
non-statutory body, acts as secretariat for the three review bodies set up to
advise on the remuneration of certain groups in the public sector for which
negotiating machinery is not appropriate, such as chairmen and members of
boards of nationalised industries, the higher judiciary, senior civil servants,
the armed forces, and doctors and dentists; it also services special inquiries
on particular pay structures and related problems.
In a number of industries and trades where the organisation of employers or
employees or both is not strong enough to provide a basis for successful
voluntary arrangements, there are statutory wage-regulating bodies, known as
wages councils. These are composed of equal numbers of representatives of
employers and employees in the respective sectors of industry, with three
326
BRITAIN 1978: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Health and
Safety
Commission
Safety
Regulations
independent members. Wages councils publish proposals for minimum
remuneration and holidays with pay and after considering any representations
make orders giving statutory force to such proposals. The Department of
Employment’s Wages Inspectorate enforces the provisions of wage regulation
orders. About 3 million workers are covered by such arrangements.
Agricultural wages boards (there are boards for England and Wales and for
Scotland) perform similar functions in relation to employment in agriculture.
In 1976 the scope of the wages councils was widened to enable them to
regulate any other terms and conditions of employment in addition to remun¬
eration and holidays, and the Government may convert a wages council into a
statutory joint industrial council (SJIC), as a half-way stage towards full volun¬
tary collective bargaining, where conditions are thought to be suitable. SJICs
function in the same way as wages councils, except that they have no inde¬
pendent members.
HEALTH AND SAFETY AT WORK
Employers have a duty at common law to take reasonable care of their em¬
ployees and provide a safe system of working, while employees have a duty of
care towards each other and also to take care for their own safety. In addition,
minimum required standards of safety in certain kinds of workplaces or work
are laid down under a number of statutes; some of these also deal with health
and welfare. The Health and Safety at Work etc. Act 1974 reorganised the
system under which safety and health at work was safeguarded and extended it
to cover everyone at work and to further the protection of the general public
from industrial hazards.
The Health and Safety Commission, appointed by the Secretary of State for
Employment after consultation with the TUC, CBI and local authorities, has
responsibility for supervising the application and enforcement of health and
safety legislation, formerly held by a number of separate government depart¬
ments. Its operational arm is the Health and Safety Executive, consisting
largely of the former government inspectorates covering factories, mines and
quarries, agriculture, explosives, nuclear installations and alkali works; the
Employment Medical Advisory Service; and the Safety in Mines Research
Establishment (see p. 254).
The basic obligations laid down in the Act are supported by ministerial
powers to make regulations dealing with a wide range of health and safety
matters. Regulations will be supplemented where appropriate by codes of
practice approved by the commission, and by guidance notes and other codes.
In particular the Act gives inspectors the power to issue improvement and
prohibition notices, which enable them to require practical improvements to
be made within a specified time or to require preventive measures immediately
without first having to obtain a court order. There are provisions for appeals
to industrial tribunals against such notices.
About 270,000 industrial premises (factories, warehouses, shipyards, docks and
construction sites) are regulated under the Factories Act 1961, which is enforced
mainly by the Factory Inspectorate, part of the Health and Safety Executive.
Likewise about 750,000 premises are subject to the Offices, Shops and Railway
Premises Act 1963, whose enforcement is shared by the Factory Inspectorate
and the Mines and Quarries Inspectorate (also part of the new Executive) and
local authorities.
EMPLOYMENT
327
The Acts and regulations made under them are designed to secure the health,
safety and welfare of employees, and deal with such matters as the fencing of
machinery; precautions against the exposure of people to toxic gases and dusts;
precautions against fire and special risks; the safe condition of premises; and
cleanliness, lighting, temperature and ventilation. Anyone intending to employ
other people in industrial or commercial premises to which either the Factories
Act or the Offices, Shops and Railway Premises Act applies has to notify the
enforcing authority of his intention and there is a statutory duty to report every
accident which is either fatal or causes more than three days’ incapacity. The
Factories Act includes provisions for the compulsory notification and investiga¬
tion of certain types of dangerous occurrence. It also contains provisions con¬
cerning the employment of women, and for precautions against dangerous
substances.
Comparable provision with appropriate variations covers mines and
quarries, agriculture and transport (including aviation and shipping,
the responsibility of the Department of Trade). As with the Factories Act
these other provisions are, with some exceptions, enforced through inspec¬
torates—the Mines and Quarries Inspectorate, the Agriculture Inspectorate,
and the Railway Employment Inspectorate of the Department of the Environ¬
ment. Safety requirements in all other places of work including hotels, places
of entertainment and educational establishments but excluding domestic
work in the home, are covered by the Flealth and Safety at Work etc. Act or (in
respect of their offices and shops) by the Offices, Shops, and Railway Premises
Act, while fire authorities are responsible for general fire precautions and
means of escape.
The Health and Safety Executive, through its Nuclear Installations Inspec¬
torate, is the authority concerned with the granting of nuclear site licences for
commercial nuclear installations. No such installation may be constructed or
operated in Britain without a licence granted by the executive under sections
of the Nuclear Installations Act 1965 which are relevant statutory provisions
under the Health and Safety at Work etc. Act. Conditions attached to such
licences in the interests of safety are imposed and enforced by the inspectorate.
The Health and Safety Commission also has responsibility under the
Mineral Workings (Offshore Installations) Act 1971 and the Petroleum and
Submarine Pipelines Act 1975 for the health and safety of all persons (in¬
cluding divers) engaged in the offshore oil and gas industry.
Other Measures Transport operators and ministries concerned with road and air travel give
high priority to safety measures affecting crews and passengers. Every effort is
made to counter the higher risks resulting from rising traffic densities by
improving the design of vehicles and transport equipment, by control of
standards of maintenance, by traffic regulations and by training crews in safety
awareness.
To minimise the hazards which may arise from the use of pesticides, a
voluntary scheme has been established under which pesticides are vetted by the
Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food’s Advisory Committee on
Pesticides and Other Toxic Chemicals (see p. 169) before being marketed. The
committee gives clearance for specific uses, subject to its recommendations on
such matters as safety precautions and labelling being agreed to.
There is also a Safety in Mines Research Establishment (see p. 254) which is
concerned with research into safety aspects of mining and other industries.
Promotion of The Health and Safety Commission encourages the development of voluntary
Safety Measures central organisation within each industry at national level for the consideration
328
BRITAIN 1978: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK

of safety matters and the formulation of policy and accident prevention. Its
Factory Inspectorate, besides inquiring into notified accidents and safety
aspects of machine design and specification, circulates expert advice and en¬
courages the appointment of safety officers and the formation of works safety
committees, and maintains an industrial health and safety centre in London,
at which various types of machinery demonstrating the effectiveness of guards
are displayed, as well as a wide range of protective clothing and equipment.
Organisations in industry participate also in joint standing and advisory
committees appointed by the Secretary of State for Employment, but these
arrangements are being superseded. The Health and Safety Commission has
appointed four major advisory committees in addition to the Committee on
Major Hazards set up in 1975; these include one on asbestos, one on toxic
substances, one on dangerous substances and one on medical matters. Pro¬
posals have also been made for the appointment of 18 industry-based com¬
mittees, the first of which, the Agriculture Industry Advisory Committee,
has already been set up. The Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents
(RoSPA) and the British Safety Council are national bodies concerned with
accident prevention and sponsor a number of local accident prevention groups.
Training is important in accident prevention and the Training Services Agency
provides a course in job safety for supervisors in its TWI scheme. The
industrial training boards include specific provisions for safety training in
their training recommendations.
RoSPA provides a variety of safety courses for special needs, mainly at its
Industrial Safety Training Centre in Birmingham, and also helps the accident
prevention movement by providing publicity and organising conferences; its
regional industrial safety officers work to promote safety activity among top-
level managers. The British Safety Council also offers safety training courses.
Other courses are organised by local accident prevention groups and organisa¬
tions such as the Federation of Civil Engineering Contractors.
A substantial amount of research is being done by industry, universities and
other academic bodies, and government research organisations into problems of
guarding machines, ergonomics, safe handling, electrical hazards, nuclear
safety, protective personal equipment, construction methods, fires and ex¬
plosions, psychological factors and causes of accidents, both generally and in
particular sectors of industry. A register of research into industrial health and
safety matters has been compiled by the Department of Employment to give
an indication of the scale and nature of research being undertaken. Industrial
research associations include among their more purely economic research pro¬
jects the improvement of working conditions and the reduction of hazards.
The National Coal Board conducts courses of safety training for workmen
and officials. Its research programme includes a number of projects with a direct
bearing on safety. In addition, the Health and Safety Executive has a statutory
responsibility for research concerning the safety and health of coal miners,
largely exercised through its Safety in Mines Research Establishment.
The University of Aston in Birmingham helps to meet the need for academic¬
ally trained safety officers and engineers whose careers will be concerned with
the technical aspects of insurance and forensic work.
Great importance is attached to preventing health hazards at work and previous
legislation relating to factories, mines and quarries and offices has been strength¬
ened and reinforced by the Health and Safety at Work etc. Act. General
requirements within the Act relate to the manufacture, safe handling and

storage of substances which present a health risk, the maintenance of a healthy
environment, and the provision of adequate arrangements for welfare at work.
More detailed requirements are also prescribed (for example, in the Factories
Act) and relate to matters such as heating, lighting, ventilation, general clean¬
liness, dust and fume control, sanitary accommodation, washing facilities and
first aid. Specific regulations also make detailed requirements for certain
processes associated with health risks (for example, dust in foundries and
mines, and lead processes). Many industrial firms and organisations, as well as
the Health and Safety Executive, supported by extensive laboratory facilities,
monitor health hazards to which their employees may be exposed.
Legislation forbids any employment of children under 14 years of age, and
employment in any industrial undertaking of children who have not reached
the statutory minimum school-leaving age (now 16); of women and young
people underground in mines and in certain other dangerous occupations (for
example, certain processes connected with lead manufacture); and of women in
factories and workshops within four weeks after childbirth. It also limits and
defines the permissible hours of employment for women and young people.
The Employment Medical Advisory Service (EMAS), set up under the Employ¬
ment Medical Advisory Service Act 1972 and now part of the Health and Safety
Executive, provides a nation-wide service of advice on the medical aspects of
employment problems to employers, employees, trade unions, doctors and
others. It carries out medical examinations of workers in hazardous occupa¬
tions and surveys of employment hazards, advises the staff of the Manpower
Services Commission on medical aspects of job placement, rehabilitation and
industrial training and co-operates with school medical officers and careers
officers in helping to solve the employment problems of handicapped school
leavers. The service, headed by the Health and Safety Executive’s Director of
Medical Services, has over 100 employment medical advisers based in the
country’s main industrial centres. The TUC, the CBI and other interested
organisations are associated with the work of the service through advisory
committees.
The Occupational Medicine and Hygiene Laboratories of the Health and Safety
Executive at Cricklewood, north London, provide laboratory services and
undertake research in the field of occupational health. Among other things
these laboratories assist EMAS in the analysis of blood and urine samples;
while the Factory Inspectorate also looks to the laboratories as a main source of
laboratory assistance.
Research facilities are provided by government agencies such as the Medical
Research Council; by university faculties of industrial health and social
medicine; and by the research departments of various industries and large
industrial concerns. Field investigations are carried out by the Factory
Inspectorate, which has specialised technical branches, and by the EMAS.
Many employers voluntarily maintain medical services for their employees
over and above the statutory requirements. The big employers, including the
State and the boards of nationalised industries, have taken the lead but a
number of smaller factories also provide medical services and in a few cases
have joined together in group medical services.
An increasing number of firms pay part or all of the cost of recreational facilities.
Some have their own rehabilitation centres or support convalescent homes.
The provision of low-priced meals at the place of employment has become

usual in large undertakings and quite common in smaller ones. Many offices and
shops which are unable to provide canteen facilities for their staff have adopted
luncheon voucher schemes.
Both official and voluntary organisations are concerned with promoting better
human relationships in industry. The Government has sought to extend by
research the available knowledge of the factors influencing human relations in
industry and human efficiency. Such research is sponsored or conducted by the
Social Science Research Council (see p. 373) and the Medical Research
Council (see p. 371). In addition, the Department of Employment’s Work
Research Unit provides information on how particular jobs can be redesigned
to create greater satisfaction, helps industry and others in initiating and
evaluating changes in the content of work, and administers a research pro¬
gramme. Voluntary organisations include bodies which deal with management
problems and provide a service to subscribing firms; professional associations,
linking individuals with a common interest in particular functions of manage¬
ment; and bodies providing specialist services, usually on a fee-paying basis.
The safety, health and welfare of employees in Northern Ireland have been the
subject of legislation which is embodied in the Factories Act (Northern Ireland)
1965 and the Office and Shop Premises Act (Northern Ireland) 1966. A number
of firms voluntarily employ safety officers, and industrial safety groups,
supported by representatives of industry, insurance companies and public
authorities, make a valuable contribution to accident prevention.
Legislative proposals for Northern Ireland comparable to the Health and
Safety at Work etc. Act 1974 (see p. 326) are under consideration.

THE PUBLIC SECTOR
Public expenditure comprises the current and capital expenditure of central
government and local authorities, excluding expenditure charged to the
operating account of trading bodies; central government finance in the form
of grants, loans or public dividend capital provided towards the cost of capital
investment by the nationalised industries; the capital expenditure of other
public corporations; the contingency reserve; and debt interest payments
which constitute a charge on taxation. Public expenditure, excluding debt
interest, in i97^_77 amounted to about ^51,900 million (at 1976 Survey
prices) of which 68 per cent was undertaken by the central Government;
and 29 per cent by local authorities, the remaining 3 per cent representing the
capital expenditure of public corporations other than the nationalised in¬
dustries.
The wide range of functions and purposes of this expenditure and its
distribution is shown in Table 22.
The social services programmes accounted for nearly 49 per cent of the
total programmes, whereas defence expenditure accounted for about 11 per
cent.
Out of the total public expenditure of ^53,698 million in 1976-77 some
£29,677 million or 55 per cent was spent by the public sector directly on goods
and services (wages and salaries, other current expenditure on goods and
services, gross domestic fixed capital formation and stocks). Transfer pay¬
ments to individuals, companies and other institutions in the private sector
(for example, social security payments, capital grants, subsidies, and debt
interest) made up the balance. Unlike public authorities’ direct purchases of
goods and services, transfer payments do not represent a direct demand on
the nation’s resources. The gross sums transferred create a proportionately
lower indirect demand for goods and services because of taxes paid and savings
made by the recipients.
Between 1970-71 and 1976-77 total public expenditure programmes grew
in real terms by about 27 per cent. However, measures designed to prevent the
public sector absorbing resources needed for exports and investment were
taken in 1976 to reduce, in real terms, planned spending on programmes for
1977-78 and 1978-79 to levels lower than those in 1975-76 and 1976-77.
Major importance is attached to adequate planning and control of public
expenditure. There are three principal and interdependent ways in which
this is done. First, the annual public expenditure survey, which leads to the
publication of a report describing the Government’s medium-term expendi¬
ture plans on a constant price basis; secondly, the Supply Estimates by means
of which Parliament votes the cash required to run certain central government
services in the coming financial year; and thirdly, the system of cash limits
under which, for the financial year immediately ahead, the volume of expendi¬
ture at constant prices shown in the survey plans is translated into cash pro¬
vision which will not normally be exceeded. These arrangements are described
in more detail below.

Public
Expenditure
Surveys
Each year a survey is made of the whole range of projected public expenditure.
The survey, which covers the period five years ahead, is carried out by
officials in the Treasury and other government departments, under the
direction of the Public Expenditure Survey Committee.
The primary purpose of the survey is to present to ministers an up-to-date
assessment of the cost of their existing policies as a basis for decisions about
the total and the composition of public expenditure. The five-year period
gives the Government the opportunity to plan ahead any necessary changes
without causing wasteful disruption in existing services, and to have regard
to the overall economic outlook when taking decisions.
A report on the survey is prepared in the first half of the year. This is
followed by ministerial consideration of the report and then by the publication
of the Government’s public expenditure plans (see Bibliography, p. 446).
They provide the basis for an annual public expenditure debate in the House
of Commons. The plans contain a contingency reserve to provide for additions
to the programmes set out. This has been developed into a more operational
instrument, as one of the means of securing that actual expenditure is kept
within the plan. The object is, as far as possible, to limit claims on the reserve
by meeting the cost of new measures, or increased estimates for existing
measures, within existing departmental totals. Recourse to the reserve to meet
additional expenditure is subject to the approval of Treasury ministers, who

may refer the larger or more difficult claims for consideration by the Cabinet
as a whole.
The House of Commons has a Select Committee on Expenditure to consider
public expenditure and its reports provide further information on which
debates on public expenditure can be based. The committee has a number
of sub-committees, one to consider general Government financial control and
the presentation of information about public expenditure, and others con¬
sidering public expenditure in particular areas: defence and external affairs,
education and the arts, social services and employment, trade and industry
and environment. These committees take oral and written evidence from
departmental ministers as well as their officials and can take evidence from
witnesses outside Government.
Each department submits its estimates of cash requirements to the Treasury
in the December before the financial year beginning on the following ist
April. Estimates cover central Government’s own expenditure. (Not all
this expenditure is classified as public expenditure—for example, payments to
local authorities. Only when the money is spent by the local authorities is public
expenditure recorded.) After they have been approved by the Treasury, the
Supply Estimates are presented to Parliament shortly before the Budget (see
p. 334) and are approved by Parliament for one year ahead, by means of an
annual Appropriation Act, in July (expenditure to this date from ist April is
covered by a Vote on Account approved by Parliament before the beginning of
the financial year). There are 29 allotted days (known as supply days) in each
session on which the choice of subject for debate rests with the Opposition
and on which estimates can be debated. Broad issues of policy are normally
discussed.
Certain expenditures are not approved annually, but are covered by Acts
of Parliament allowing payments to continue from one year to another and are
paid direct from the Consolidated Fund. These include the financial provision
for members of the royal family, and salaries and pensions of judges. The
Consolidated Fund, into which tax revenue and other receipts are paid,
finances most of the Government’s expenditure; its balance is held in the
Exchequer account at the Bank of England. The National Loans Fund covers
most of the Government’s domestic lending and borrowing, and is operated
as an official account at the Bank of England. The two funds deal only with
sterling receipts and payments; official dealings in foreign exchange are carried
out by the Exchange Equalisation Account (see p. 341).
Cash limits, first introduced on an extensive scale in 1976-77, have been
applied to public spending wherever they can make a useful contribution to
financial discipline. They also contribute to the Government’s policy for
reducing inflation and help in forecasting the Government’s maximum
financing requirements. About half of public expenditure is covered by cash
limits. Certain services such as social security payments are excluded because,
once policy and rates of payment have been determined, cash spending in the
short term depends on factors outside the Government’s direct control. Cash
limits are also placed on the financial assistance given to local authorities by
central Government and on local authority capital expenditure. The estimates
of the financing requirements of the nationalised industries are also treated
as a form of cash limit.
Spending departments and authorities are required to provide within their
cash limits for any increase in costs due to pay and price changes. The cash
limits for 1977-78 were published in March 1977 (see Bibliography, p. 446).

Government departments are required to make detailed monthly returns of
their expenditure to the Treasury. These returns are then compared with
profiles of expected expenditure prepared at the beginning of the financial
year in accordance with the approved Public Expenditure Survey, Supply
Estimate and cash limit provisions.
The Comptroller and Auditor General is appointed by the Crown and his
independence of the Executive is secured by specific statutory provisions.
Since 1866 he has had two functions: as Comptroller he ensures that all
revenues and other public money payable to the Consolidated Fund and the
National Loans Fund are duly paid over and that all issues from these funds
are authorised by statute; and as Auditor General he audits departmental and
other accounts and, as required by statute, submits his reports on Appro¬
priation Accounts and other accounts to Parliament. For many years and with
the encouragement of the Public Accounts Committee (see below) his
statutory audit functions have been extended to include general financial
administration, cost-effectiveness and cases of apparent waste or extravagance.
The accounts of each department and the reports of the Comptroller and
Auditor General upon them are considered by a House of Commons select
committee called the Public Accounts Committee. This was established in
1861 to ensure that expenditure was properly incurred in accordance with
the purposes for which it was voted and with the relevant Acts of Parliament.
The committee’s terms of reference are simply that it must examine the
accounts and these terms are widely interpreted. Successive committees have
investigated whether full value has been obtained for the sums spent by
departments and have examined cases in which the administration appears to
have been faulty or negligent. The committee has become a powerful instru¬
ment for the exposure of waste or inefficiency. It embodies its findings in
regular reports and its recommendations are considered by departments and
put into effect, so far as they are accepted, by Treasury instructions. The
Government’s reply to each report is submitted to Parliament in the form
of a Treasury Minute and both documents are debated at the beginning of
the following Parliamentary session.
The Budget (an old word which meant a bag containing papers or accounts)
is a set of proposals made usually once a year in either March or April, for
financing government expenditure. Supplementary budgetary measures may
also be introduced at other times of the year. The proposals are described by
the Chancellor of the Exchequer in the Budget speech, against the background
of a statement of the Government’s past and prospective revenue and expendi¬
ture, and his assessment of the position and prospects of the economy.
The Budget speech is followed by the moving of a set of Ways and Means
resolutions, in which the proposals are embodied. These resolutions, when
passed by the House, become the foundation of the Finance Act, which
expresses the proposals in statutory form.
A major function of the Budget is to act as an instrument of economic
management, and the Budget speech is normally the main occasion for a
review of general economic policy. The scale of public expenditure and taxa¬
tion has an important influence on the general level of output and distribution
of resources. The Budget judgment is therefore concerned with the balance
between the total of goods and services which are likely to be available to the
nation and the total claims which are likely to be made on them. Through taxa¬
tion the Government can exert a considerable influence on the pressure of
FINANCE
Public Sector
Accounts
335
demand; its measures can also have a broader influence on the pattern of
demand and the long-term performance of the economy.
The Budget deals with the means of financing expenditure and particularly
with changes in taxation and not primarily with expenditure itself. On occa¬
sions, changes affecting expenditure, such as increases in pensions and family
allowances, have been announced in the Budget speech as have financial and
monetary measures not related to the Finance Act, such as changes in exchange
control policies. Such measures, however, are not reflected in the resolutions
or the Finance Act but are applied by the appropriate procedure, that is,
separate legislation, statutory instruments or administrative action.
The scope of the Budget and that of the Finance Act which follows it are
different although they are closely interrelated. The Budget is essentially
concerned with the measures that give effect to the Chancellor’s decision to
increase or reduce to an appropriate extent the predicted level of demand on
economic resources by use of the instruments at the Chancellor’s disposal, and
especially by increasing or reducing the yield of central Government taxes.
The tax changes made necessary by the Budget judgment are enacted in the
Finance Act. But the Finance Act also provides the annual opportunity for
non-Budgetary changes in the tax system and for certain other financial
matters, such as provisions relating to Government borrowing.
The bulk of the taxation proposals in the Budget are concerned with changes
in the rates or coverage of existing taxes, the introduction of new taxes or the
abolition of existing ones, and changes in the administrative machinery relating
to taxation. In two cases however (income tax and corporation tax) annual
Ways and Means resolutions followed by a Finance Act clause are necessary
to maintain the taxes in existence at all, since they are annual taxes. Thus a
Budget at or about the beginning of each financial year is a necessity.
New taxes and changes in certain existing taxes, like other changes in statute
laws, do not come into effect until the appropriate Bill—in this case the
Finance Bill—has received Royal Assent (in the case of the spring Budget,
normally at the end of July) or at some other date laid down in the Bill.
Some changes, however, come into effect earlier, usually from Budget Day or
from the start of the tax year, under the Provisional Collection of Taxes Act.
This enables the Government to collect certain taxes provisionally, income
tax for example, either at the rates previously in operation or at new rates
following the passing of the appropriate Ways and Means resolutions. Tax
proposals may be made at any time to meet changes in economic circumstances.
The economic background to the spring Budget and the transactions of the
central Government and the public sector as a whole are presented in the
Financial Statement and Budget Report (see Bibliography, p. 446) which is laid
before the House of Commons by the Chancellor of the Exchequer when
he presents the Budget. The report is in three parts: the economic context
of the Budget; the accounts of the public sector for the past financial year
and the one immediately ahead; and the accounts of the central Government
for the same two years. The accounts are designed to assist in assessing the
impact of changes in revenue and public expenditure on the economy.
The accounts of the public sector show the transactions of the central
Government, local authorities, nationalised industries and other public cor¬
porations combined into a consolidated account covering the whole of the
public sector. The transactions within the public sector cancel out on consoli¬
dation and the net balance on the consolidated account represents therefore the
borrowing required by the public sector from the private and overseas sectors.

The accounts of the central Government show transactions both on the
conventional cash basis of Exchequer accounting and in accordance with the
framework of the national income accounts.
To raise the money it requires the Government offers a great variety of
claims on itself designed to attract different types of lender. Broadly there is
marketable debt, and non-marketable debt. Marketable debt is made up of
short-term floating debt consisting of Treasury Bills, and funded or longer-
term debt made up of government securities which are of varying maturities
and publicly quoted on the Stock Exchange. Non-marketable debt comprises
the various forms of national savings designed to attract the small saver;
certificates of tax deposits; and ways and means advances, which basically is
very short-term internal government borrowing. The bulk of public cor¬
porations’ borrowing is met by central Government through the National
Loans Fund, although public corporations’ temporary borrowing needs are
met largely from the market under Treasury guarantee. That part of local
authority borrowing met by central Government is dealt with through the
Public Works Loan Board which has recourse to the National Loans Fund.
The local authorities also borrow directly from the market, both short-term
and long-term, through a range of different investments. Some public cor¬
porations also borrow, under special statutory power and with Treasury con¬
sent, in foreign currencies.
After allowing for the changes introduced by the Budget of March 1977 the
central Government’s borrowing requirement for 1977-78 was expected to be
£6,859 million, compared with £5,830 million in 1976-77 and that for the
public sector as a whole £8,471 million compared with £8,820 million in
1976-77.
Fable 23 shows total revenue from taxation and other sources in 1976-77
and the forecasts for 1977-78 together with the effects of the Budget changes
(for the measures introduced by the 1977 Budget, see p. 186).
The three principal sources of tax revenue are first, taxes on income, which
include income tax and corporation tax; second, taxes on capital, which in¬
clude capital transfer tax and capital gains tax; and third, taxes on expenditure
(including taxes on the ownership or use of certain assets)—these include
protective and revenue duties, value added tax (VAT), the National Insurance
Surcharge, local rates (see p. 67), stamp duties and licence duties (for example,
on motor vehicles). Taxes on individual (but not corporate) incomes are
progressive in that larger incomes bear a proportionately higher rate of tax.
The Board of Inland Revenue assesses and collects the taxes on income and
capital and the stamp duties; the Board of Customs and Excise collects the
most important taxes on expenditure (the customs and excise duties and VAT)
while a variety of authorities is responsible for the collection of the remainder.
Income tax is imposed for the year of assessment beginning on 6th April. The
rates of tax introduced in the Finance Act 1977 are as follows: the basic rate
°f 34 Per cent applies to the first £6,000 of taxable income (that is, total
income less deductions and personal allowances), a rate of 40 per cent is
charged on the £6,ooi-£7,ooo band of taxable income, and the rate for
successive bands rises generally in steps of 5 per cent until a maximum rate of
83 per cent is reached at a level of over £20,000 of taxable income. These
rates are charged on both earned and investment incomes. Investment in¬
comes are also liable to a surcharge on the amount by which they exceed
£i,50° (£2,000 for the elderly); the surcharge is 10 per cent on the first
FINANCE
337
£500 of investment income above the relevant threshold and 15 per cent on
the remainder. The tax imposed on an individual is graduated by means of
personal allowances and reliefs. In general, married couples receive higher
allowances than a single person. Husband and wife may choose to have the
wife’s earnings charged separately for tax on condition that the former receives
the single instead of the married personal allowance. But even then the married
couple are taxed jointly on their investment income.
For 1977-78 a single person earning £4,000 a year pays £1,072-70 in income
tax, while a married man with the same earned income pays £919-70; if he has
two children under the age of 11 and his earnings plus child benefits total
£4,000 his tax falls to £795-26. The amount of tax payable by a single person

varies from, for example, £392-70 on an earned income of £2,000 a year to
£10,206-25 on an earned income of £20,000.
Most wage and salary earners pay their income tax under a PAYE (‘Pay as
You Earn’) system whereby tax is deducted (and accounted for to the Inland
Revenue) by the employer, thus enabling them to keep as up to date as possible
with their tax payments.
In general, income tax is charged on all income which originates in the
United Kingdom and on all income arising abroad of persons resident in the
United Kingdom. Interest on certain United Kingdom government securities
belonging to persons not ordinarily resident in the United Kingdom is exempt.
The United Kingdom has entered into agreements with many countries pro¬
viding for relief from double taxation; where such agreements are not in force
unilateral relief is allowed.
Companies pay corporation tax at a single rate on all their profits, whether
distributed or not. Only a proportion of any capital gains is included in total
profits, with the result that chargeable gains as a whole are subject to a
lower effective rate of tax. Income tax is not deducted from dividends but a
company which distributes profits to its shareholders is required to make to
the Inland Revenue an advance payment of corporation tax. In general, this
payment is set against a company’s corporation tax bill and the recipient of the
distribution in respect of which the advance payment was made is entitled to a
tax credit, which satisfies the liability to income tax at the basic rate.
The rate of corporation tax is fixed retrospectively in the Budget for the past
financial year; for the financial year 1976 (1st April 1976-3151 March 1977)
it is 52 per cent with a reduced rate of 42 per cent for small companies (as
defined in the Finance Acts i972> I974> an<^ I977)- The tax assessed on the
profits of accounting periods, the rate of tax being the rate for the financial
year in which the accounting period falls. Where an accounting period
straddles 31st March the profits are apportioned on a time basis. Relief for
the effect of inflation on the value of stocks was given in the November 1974
Budget and further extended in those of April 1975, and March 1977.
Under the Oil Taxation Act 1975 a petroleum revenue tax of 45 per cent
(deducted in computing profits for corporation tax) is charged on profits from
the winning, as opposed to refining or other form of processing, of hydro¬
carbons under licence in Britain and on its continental shelf. Each licensee
of an oilfield is to be charged on the profits for that field, computed for half-
yearly periods.
A comprehensive tax, capital transfer tax, applies to transfer of personal
wealth in three main areas: lifetime gifts; transfers on death; and transfers
relating to settled property (that is, any property held in trust). The tax is
chargeable in respect of a person’s lifetime transfers as they occur and on a
cumulative basis. The final stage of cumulation is the inclusion of the property
passing on an assumed transfer of the whole of the deceased’s estate immedi¬
ately before the death. The rates of tax applicable are progressively higher on
successive slices of the cumulative total of chargeable transfers, with a lower
scale of tax for lifetime transfers than for transfers on death. Under both scales
the first £15,000 of transfers is exempt; the rates on the remainder rise from
5 per cent on the slice between £15,000 and £20,000 to 75 per cent on the
excess over £2 million for lifetime transfers and from 10 per cent on the
slice between £15,000 and £20,000 to 75 Per cent on the excess over £2
million for transfers on death.

Capital gains accruing on the disposal of assets are liable to capital gains tax
or, in the case of companies, to corporation tax. The rate of tax is normally 30
per cent, but in the case of individuals may be less, depending on their circum¬
stances. Certain assets may be exempt from tax, including the principal
private residence, chattels worth less than £1,000 (and any chattels, except
those used for the purpose of a trade, with a predictable life of less than 50
years), private motor cars, and National Savings Certificates. An individual
is exempt from capital gains tax where the total proceeds of disposals do not
exceed £1,000 in any year. In addition gains on gilt-edged securities are
exempt from the tax if the securities were held for more than 12 months.
The Development Land Tax Act 1976 introduced a development land tax
(DLT) on development value in place of the charge on development gains
and on first letting introduced in the Finance Act 1974. The rate of DLT is
80 per cent but the first £10,000 of development value realised in any financial
year is completely exempt and for a transitional period up to 31st March 1979
the next £150,000 in any financial year will be liable at a rate of 66-6 per cent.
Exemptions from DLT include the sale or development of owner-occupied
residences.
The largest group of taxes on expenditure are those administered by the
Customs and Excise Department, namely VAT, car tax and the duties on
tobacco, hydrocarbon oil and alcoholic drinks, protective duties, betting and
gaming and other revenue duties of customs and excise. These taxes are
usually referred to as indirect taxes since they are normally paid by the
importer, manufacturer, or wholesaler, who adjusts the prices charged to
customers accordingly. On 1st January 1976 customs revenue duties were
converted into internal taxes (except in the case of tobacco, which is to be
converted by 1st January 1978). Prior to this it had been the practice in
Britain that a commodity taxed to provide revenue bore a customs duty if
it was imported and an excise duty if it was domestically produced. How¬
ever, under the Treaty of Accession to the European Community Britain
undertook gradually to convert revenue duties into internal taxes chargeable
alike on imported and home-produced goods. Following the conversion
fiscal charges, known as excise duties, are charged on imported goods at the
same rates as the duties on similar home-produced goods and any protective
charges are levied as Community customs duty (see below). From 1st July
1977 for most goods, protective import duties have been chargeable as Com¬
munity customs duty in accordance with the EEC Common Customs Tariff;
from 1st January 1978 this will be the case for all goods. No such duties are
chargeable on goods which qualify as EEC goods.
All the revenue duty goods (other than hydrocarbon oil) are subject to the
standard rate of VAT. The Chancellor of the Exchequer has power to vary
between Budgets the VAT rates by up to 25 per cent, and the rate of any of the
other main groups of customs and excise duties (that is, tobacco, alcoholic
drinks, oil and the minor revenue duties) by up to 10 per cent. This power,
known as the ‘regulator’, requires annual renewal. The March 1977 Budget
increased the duties on tobacco products, motor vehicles, and some hydro¬
carbon oils. It also consolidated the 10 per cent surcharge on the duties on
tobacco products and alcoholic drinks announced in December, 1976.
Value Added Tax Value added tax (VAT) is collected at each stage in the production and distri¬
bution process. The final tax is borne by the consumer. A taxable person

BRITAIN 1978: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
(generally, a trader carrying on a business with a turnover of more than
£7,500 a year) is charged by suppliers of goods and services with VAT
(‘input’ tax). The trader then charges the customer with VAT on goods and
services supplied (‘output’ tax). The trader pays to Customs and Excise the
difference between output and input tax. Although VAT falls on imported
goods, most exports are zero-rated and VAT entering directly into export
costs can be reclaimed.
VAT is a broadly based tax falling on final consumers’ expenditure except
where there are strong social or economic reasons for giving relief. There are
two basic methods by which supplies of goods and services may get relief
from VAT: zero-rating, when a trader does not have to charge tax to a
customer, but can reclaim any input tax paid to suppliers, and exemption,
when a trader does not have to charge a customer any output tax but is not
entitled to deduct or reclaim any input tax relating to the goods or services
which he sells. The most important supplies to which zero-rating applies are
most types of food (except in the course of catering); books, newspapers and
periodicals; fuel (except for petrol and other fuels for road use); construction
of buildings; exports (goods and most services); public transport fares; young
children’s clothing and footwear; and drugs and medicines supplied on
prescription. Exemption applies to land (including rents), insurance, postal
services, betting, gaming other than by means of a gaming machine and
lotteries, finance, education, health and burial and cremation.
VAT is chargeable at a standard rate of 8 per cent except for certain goods
which are charged at a higher rate of 12-5 per cent. These include petrol, most
domestic electric appliances (excluding cookers, space heaters and fitted
water heaters), radios, televisions, hi-fi equipment, boats, aircraft, caravans,
cameras, binoculars, furs and jewellery.
New cars and motor caravans, whether British made or imported, are charge¬
able with car tax at 10 per cent on the wholesale value. VAT falls on the
price including car tax.
The principal betting duties are: the pool betting duty (which applies to
football pools and betting by coupon at fixed odds) charged at a rate of 40 per
cent of the stake money; and the general betting duty, which is charged at the
rate of 7-5 per cent of stake money except for on-course betting which is
charged at 4 per cent. Gaming is taxed at different rates mainly by licence fees.
The annual tax on motor vehicles is collected by the Department of the
Environment; the proceeds are paid into the Consolidated Fund. The licence
duty on a private motor car is £50 a year; motor cycles and three-wheel
vehicles, etc., pay £5, £10 or £20 a year according to engine capacity. Goods
vehicles are taxed by unladen weight, and taxis and buses by seating capacity.
The national insurance surcharge (NIS) is a new tax which took effect from
the start of the 1977-78 financial year. It takes the form of a levy paid by
employers, along with their national insurance contributions, in respect of
their employees and is equal to 2 per cent of employees’ earnings up to £105
per week (earnings of less than £15 per week are exempt). Generally it is
anticipated that the incidence of this tax will be passed forward into prices, so
that it ranks as a tax on expenditure.
The National Debt increased rapidly during and immediately after the first
and second world wars. It rose from £650 million in 1914 to £7,435 million at
the end of the first world war, and from £7,131 million in 1939 to £23,647

million in 1946. On 31st March 1977 the total National Debt was estimated at
j£63>794 million, of which £4,352 million (valued at the rate of £i = $i*720i)
was repayable in currencies other than sterling, mainly to the United States
and Canadian Governments. Of the £59,442 million of internal debt, £12,333
million was short-term debt, mainly in the form of 91-day Treasury bills,
while the long-term loans included a variety of stocks, bonds, loans and cer¬
tificates carrying fixed rates of interest (ranging from 21 to 150 per cent) and
with fixed or indeterminate dates of repayment.
The general system of public finance in Northern Ireland is, in its main
features, similar to that operating in the United Kingdom as a whole. The
major sources of revenue are the main national taxes imposed by the United
Kingdom Parliament over the whole country. The Northern Ireland share of
the yield of United Kingdom taxes is paid out of the Consolidated Fund of
the United Kingdom into that of Northern Ireland. Revenue also accrues
from local resources such as the regional rate and from certain non-tax
revenue. This revenue is supplemented by an annual grant-in-aid voted by
Parliament. Loans from the United Kingdom National Loans Fund are
available (up to a limit of £1,000 million) to finance capital expenditure
programmes in Northern Ireland.
Various funds have been established in Northern Ireland, in addition to
statutory Reserve and Sinking Funds, for specific purposes. In general, these
funds follow the United Kingdom pattern, the principal funds being those
relating to national insurance and government loans. The latter constitutes a
pool of money available mainly for local and public authority borrowings; on
31st March 1977 a sum of approximately £521 million was outstanding
against such borrowers.
FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS
The British banking system comprises a central bank; deposit banks which
perform the usual main banking services; the British offices of domestic and
overseas banks whose main business is in other countries; merchant banks
and other specialised institutions.
The Bank of England was established in 1694 by Act of Parliament and Royal
Charter as a corporate body; the entire capital stock was acquired by the
Government under the Bank of England Act 1946. As the central bank, the
Bank acts as banker to the Government, to overseas central banks and to
deposit banks and is the lender of last resort to the banking system; it is the
note-issuing authority and the registrar for some 200 government, nationalised
industry, local authority, public board and Commonwealth government
stocks. As agent for the Government the Bank administers exchange control.
On behalf of the Treasury it manages the Exchange Equalisation Account
(EEA), which holds Britain’s official reserves of gold, foreign exchange and
Special Drawing Rights (SDRs) on the International Monetary Fund. Using
the resources of the EEA the Bank may intervene in the foreign exchange
market both to prevent undue fluctuations in the exchange value of sterling
and to conserve the means of making payments abroad.
As banker to the Government the Bank examines and seeks to anticipate
banking and financial problems and undertakes the appropriate operations
in the money, capital and the foreign exchange markets; consequently the
342

The Deposit
Banks
Bank has a major responsibility for advising the Government on the formula¬
tion of monetary policy and for its subsequent execution.
The Bank’s implementation of monetary policy is carried out through
market operations and its arrangements to call for or release special deposits
from or to banks and the larger finance houses. The techniques for controlling
credit involve reliance among other things on changes in interest rates which
the Bank can influence by buying or selling Treasury and other bills in the
market and by similar operations in the market for government stocks. An
important indication of its intentions is the minimum lending rate (known as
‘Bank rate’ until 1972), which is the minimum rate at which the Bank will
normally lend to the members of the London Discount Market and closely
reflects short-term market rates, being normally | per cent above the average
rate of discount for Treasury bills. Calls for special deposits can also influence
interest rates and restrict the growth of money supply by reducing the banks’
lending base. In order to facilitate the regulation of monetary policy the Bank
requires banks to maintain a minimum reserve asset ratio of 12-5 per cent of
eligible liabilities (basically sterling deposits of two years or less from outside
the banking system together with any foreign currency changed into sterling).
The Bank is the main channel of communication between the deposit banks
and other financial institutions of the City of London on the one hand, and the
Government on the other.
The Bank of England has the sole right in England and Wales of issuing
bank notes. The note issue is fiduciary, that is to say, it is no longer backed by
gold but by government and other securities. The Scottish clearing and
Northern Ireland banks have limited rights to issue notes; these issues, apart
from an amount specified by legislation for each bank, must be fully covered
by holdings of Bank of England notes. The provision of coin for circulation
is the responsibility of the Royal Mint, a government department.
The primary business of the deposit banks is the receipt, transfer and encash¬
ment of deposits. The principal deposit banks are the six London clearing
banks, three Scottish clearing banks and two Northern Ireland banks. Mergers
have resulted in the formation of six banking groups, four based in London
and two in Scotland. The two Northern Ireland banks are owned by London
clearing banks, but two groups of banks based in the Irish Republic also
operate in Northern Ireland.
In April 1977 sterling sight and time deposits with these banks from non¬
bank customers amounted to £26,334 million and accounted for over 70
per cent of the total of such deposits with all banks in Britain, that is including
the accepting houses, overseas banks and other British banks. The deposit
banks provide full banking services throughout Britain, and operate through
some 14,000 branches. Several of them have interests in British overseas and
Commonwealth banks, and in other banks which have been formed specially
to compete in international markets. They have also acquired substantial
interests in hire-purchase finance houses, and some have set up their own
unit trusts.
Membership of the London Bankers’ Clearing House, which had consisted
of the London clearing banks together with the Bank of England, was
extended towards the end of 1975 when the Co-operative Bank and the
Central Trustee Savings Bank also became members. In 1976 cheques,
drafts, bills and bankers’ effects passing through the interbank debit clearing
system averaged in value nearly £183,780 million monthly, while the average
monthly value of the credit transfer clearing was over £2,245 million.

343
National Giro
Overseas Banks
The Merchant
Banks
Sight accounts with the deposit banks are repayable on demand and no
interest is generally paid on them, but on time deposits interest is paid at a
rate below individual banks’ base rates. The deposit banks’ reserve assets
consist of balances at the Bank of England, money at call (mainly loans to
discount houses), their holdings of Treasury and some other bills and short-
dated British Government securities. The banks also hold a proportion of
their assets as portfolio (mainly longer-dated British Government securities)
or trade investments.
The banks’ profits are largely earned through their advances to customers
partly in the form of overdrafts and partly in the form of loans (with or without
collateral security). In April 1977 sterling advances by the London clearing
banks amounted to about 65 per cent of their total deposits.
The bank giro, a credit transfer scheme, and the direct debiting system, by
which a creditor with the prior approval of the debtor may claim money due
to him direct from the latter’s banking account, have helped to improve the
money transmission services. Some banks have automatic cash dispensing
machines in operation. Credit cards are in widespread use for the settlement
of accounts in retail shops; and cheque cards enable the card holder to cash
a cheque up to £50 at any office of the major British and Irish banks, and at
offices of many banks overseas.
The Post Office National Giro, which was introduced in 1968 to provide a
low-cost current account banking and money transfer service, is operated
through most post offices in Britain. All accounts and transactions are main¬
tained by means of a computer complex at the National Giro Centre near
Liverpool. In March 1977, Giro had 550,000 accounts with deposits of over
^180 million. The number of yearly transactions had risen from 80 million in
March 1969 to 215 million by March 1977 when the annual value of transactions
was 3^37,000 million. In addition to its services to individuals Giro’s services to
commerce, industry and the public utilities include a facility whereby organi¬
sations with dispersed branches, depots and representatives can rapidly
channel receipts into their central accounting system. Over 130 local authori¬
ties as well as voluntary housing associations use Giro’s rent collection
services. Giro’s international services also provide money transfer facilities in
Europe linking over 16 million account holders in the European Com¬
munity and other countries in Western Europe. Following the granting of
powers to Giro in 1976 to provide a wider range of banking services,
personal loans, a guarantee card, limited overdrawing for personal customers
and overdrafts for corporate customers have been introduced. Other new
services are planned and will be introduced on a phased basis.
Altogether over 300 overseas banks are represented in London, through
branches, subsidiaries, representative offices and consortia. There are 273
banks directly represented in London, while some 30 consortia banks indirectly
represent the interests of approximately 138 shareholders, many of whom also
have direct representation; of those directly represented, 65 are from the
United States and Canada, 23 from Japan and 94 from Europe, of which 50
are from the European Community. They provide a comprehensive banking
service in many parts of the world and engage in the financing of trade not
only between Britain and other countries but also between third countries.
The merchant banks have an influence on Britain’s financial affairs which is
much greater than their size in relation to other financial institutions might
suggest. Traditionally merchant banks have been primarily concerned with

acceptance credits1 and with the sponsoring of capital issues on behalf of their
customers. Today they have a widely diversified and complex range of activi¬
ties with an important role in international finance and the short-term capital
markets, the provision of expert advice and financial services to British
industrial companies especially where mergers, takeovers and other forms of
corporate reorganisation are involved, and in the management of investment
holdings, including trusts, pensions and other funds.
The Discount Market is an institution which is unique to the City of London.
Its function in the monetary system is to provide a financial mechanism
designed to promote an orderly flow of short-term funds. The market consists
of 11 discount houses, five money traders and two discount brokers, all of
which borrow money ‘at call’ or short notice and lend for somewhat longer
periods. The discount houses have recourse to the Bank of England as lender
of last resort. The Bank lends to them generally overnight or for seven days
at minimum lending rate, although it may charge a higher rate. Most of the
market’s borrowed funds come from the banks, which are thus provided
with a flexible means of earning a yield on surplus funds which they have at
any given time.
The assets of the discount houses mainly consist of Treasury and commer¬
cial bills, government and local authority securities and negotiable certificates
of deposit denominated in both sterling and US dollars. The discount houses
accept as a formal responsibility that they should cover the Government’s
need to borrow on Treasury bills which are offered on tender each week.
The National Savings Movement started in 1916 to help finance the war by
promoting savings. The present movement encourages the widespread invest¬
ment of savings in Trustee Savings Banks and the National Savings Bank
(see p. 345) and in National Savings securities. The movement is led by the
National Savings Committee for England and Wales and similar committees
for Scotland and Northern Ireland. The committees consist of representatives
of the voluntary savings movement in the regions and of various national
institutions connected with finance, industry and education. Voluntary local
savings committees, often supported by local authorities, co-ordinate the work
of voluntary local savings groups. (The organisational structure of the
voluntary movement is under revision.) The administration of the National
Savings Bank and other National Savings schemes is carried out by the
Department for National Savings. At the end of June 1977 National Savings
totalled 13,523 million, including deposits held in the Trustee Savings Bank.
Four forms of National Savings securities are on sale: National Savings Certifi¬
cates, British Savings Bonds, Premium Savings Bonds, and Gift Tokens.
National Savings Certificates, in units of £1, are encashable at par at any
time; interest, which is free of income tax and capital gains tax, is paid only
on encashment; the limit on individual holdings is 1,000 units of the current
Fourteenth Issue and the minimum purchase is five units. Index-linked
National Savings Certificates Retirement Issue, introduced in 1975, are
available only to men aged 65 and over and women aged 60 and over at £10 for
one unit certificate. Interest does not accrue periodically but instead, subject
1 Acceptance credits are usually short-term (90 days) arrangements to finance exports
from, and imports to, Britain and other markets. The expression is derived from the
method of financing trade by which commercial bills are ‘accepted’ or guaranteed by
a merchant bank against documents, after which they may be discounted for cash by
a discount house.

to the certificate being held for one year, the repayment value is related to the
movement of the general index of retail prices. If held for five years a bonus of
4 per cent of the purchase price will be added to the repayment value. Any
gain is free of income tax or capital gains tax. The maximum holding is 50 units
(j£50°). British Savings Bonds, 8-5 per cent, sold in units of ^5, are repayable
at par on one month’s notice. If the bonds are held to maturity (five years from
the date of purchase) they are repaid with a bonus of 4 per cent tax free.
Maximum holding is £10,000. Premium Savings Bonds are in units of ^1
(minimum purchase is £5) and individual holdings are limited to £2,000.
After a qualifying period of three months the bonds give investors a chance
to win tax-free prizes instead of receiving interest. There is a weekly draw
for a prize of £50,000 and 25 prizes of £1,000 and a monthly draw for prizes
ranging from £25 to £100,000. At the end of June 1977, £1,222 million was
invested in this form of savings. A selection of British Government securities
is held on the National Savings Stock Register.
Northern Ireland issues separately Ulster Savings Certificates and Ulster
Development Bonds on similar terms to the corresponding National Savings
Certificates and British Savings Bonds.
An index-linked contractual savings scheme was introduced in 1975 under
the terms of the Third Issue of the Save as You Earn (SAYE) scheme. The
scheme enables savings to be made in fixed regular monthly amounts over
five years with a minimum of £4 and a maximum of £20 in deposits with the
Department for National Savings, by means of deductions from pay or by other
regular payments. Indexation only applies to completed savings contracts,
except where the saver dies before completing the contract. At the end of five
years, the repayment value will be the total contributions plus any increase due
to index-linking of monthly contributions. Completed savings which are not
withdrawn will qualify for fresh index-linking and a bonus equal to two
monthly contributions at the end of seven years. Savers who wish to stop
payments will be able to withdraw the total sum saved (but there cannot be
partial withdrawals). Tax-free compound interest will then be paid at the
rate of six per cent a year on amounts withdrawn after the first year.
The National Savings Bank provides a countrywide system for depositing and
withdrawing small savings and has about 21 million active accounts. Ordinary
Accounts bear interest at 5 per cent and the first £70 of annual interest is tax
free. Up to £30 can be withdrawn on demand at any savings bank post office,
but a few days’ notice is required for larger amounts. The money is lodged
with the National Debt Commissioners and is invested in government
securities. Deposits bearing a higher rate of interest may be made in Investment
Accounts. All deposits carry a government guarantee. At the end of June 1977
the sum of the two accounts totalled £2,440 million.
The Trustee Savings Banks, most of which were founded in the nineteenth
century, operate under their own trustees but are subject, under the Trustee
Savings Banks Acts 1969 and 1976, to the supervision of the Trustee Savings
Banks Central Board and the Registrar of Friendly Societies. Following a
planned programme of amalgamations, there were 19 individual banks in June
1977 (compared with 67 in 1975) with 1,658 offices, 14 million accounts and
total deposits in excess of £4,500 million. The 1976 Act empowered Trustee
Savings Banks to provide a full banking service including credit services and
removed the requirement that deposits be invested with the National Debt
Commissioners. The Trustee Savings Banks also operate their own unit trust.

OTHER
FINANCIAL
INSTITUTIONS
Many special financial facilities, which are supplementary to the credit
facilities of the banks, are provided through institutions outside the banking
system. These include finance corporations, hire-purchase finance com¬
panies, the stock exchange, investment trust companies, unit trusts, building
societies and the insurance market. The firms engaged in such activities are in
the main highly specialised, for example, finance houses, stockbrokers,
insurers and insurance underwriters and brokers.
Finance
Houses
Finance
Corporations
There are about 1,690 firms engaged in the financing of hire-purchase and
other instalment credit transactions, and of these 38 constitute the Finance
Houses Association which accounts for about 90 per cent of all finance house
business. At the end of March 1977 the value of instalment credit debt
outstanding to finance houses, including those recognised as banks, amounted
t° £i>7°9 million, compared with about £845 million at the end of 1970.
Hire-purchase agreements and other instalment credit comprise about 50
per cent of the total selected assets of finance houses (that is excluding fixed
assets). About two-thirds of new credit extended by finance houses relates to
cars and commercial vehicles including motorcycles and caravans, the
remainder relating to industrial and building equipment and other goods.
Since 1965 the leading finance houses have complied with the authorities’
policies on lending similar to those applied to banks, and all finance houses
are required to observe term controls affecting the minimum deposit and
maximum repayment period for specific goods financed by certain forms of
lending. Finance houses with total eligible liabilities exceeding ^5 million, are
subject to the same system of credit control as that applied to banks (see p. 342).
Finance for Industry Ltd. (FFI) was formed in 1973 when the Finance
Corporation for Industry (FCI) and the Industrial and Commercial Finance
Corporation (ICFC) were merged as operating subsidiaries. It makes available
financial advice, management consultancy, seed capital and assistance with
capital transfer tax. The FCI provides medium-term funds at fixed and
variable interest rates for large companies in excess of £2 million. At the
end of March 1977 it had approved ^241 million in 40 companies plus ^23
million which had been committed but not drawn. The ICFC provides
medium- and long-term funds at fixed interest rates for the small and
medium sectors of industry. The ICFC has investments of over £222 million
in 2,312 companies and its normal lending limits range from ^5,000 to
£2 million for periods between seven and 20 years.
Equity Capital for Industry Ltd. (ECI) was formed in mid-1976 as a new
specialist long-term institution whose primary purpose is to provide equity
or equity-type capital for industry in Britain which cannot appropriately
be provided through the normal market mechanism. Its authorised capital is
£5° million and the shares are largely held by insurance companies and life
offices, investment trust companies, unit trusts and FFI. There is an
unauthorised unit trust associated with ECI whose units are held by pension
funds so as to enable them to participate in the provision of capital.
The Commonwealth Development Finance Company (CDFC) is no longer
confined to the Commonwealth in its activities. It supports business enterprise
overseas by providing finance in the form of share capital and loans on
mutually acceptable terms. Its authorised share capital is ^30 million, of which
about iqj million ‘A’ ordinary shares of (^o-io paid) are held by industrial,
shipping, mining and banking interests in Britain, and n| million ‘B’ ordinary
shares of (^o^o paid) are held by the Bank of England and certain central

banks in the Commonwealth. At 31st March 1977 the CDFC held investments
of about ^32 million spread over a wide range of industries in 40 countries.
I he Agricultural Mortgage Corporation was established in 1928 for the
purpose of making loans to farmers. Its authorised share capital is £1-5 million
and at 31st March 1977 loans and investments amounted to £328 million.
The Commonwealth Development Corporation (CDC) was set up in 1948
and undertakes projects for the promotion and expansion of a wide range of
enterprises within and outside of the Commonwealth. At the end of 1976
CDC had a total capital commitment of £299 million.
Investment trust companies and unit trusts enable investors to spread their
risks and obtain the benefit of skilled management.
The usual type of investment trust company is constituted as a public com¬
pany registered under the Companies Acts with limited liability; its business
is to invest its capital in a range of stocks and shares. Like other companies, it
may issue several types of stocks or shares and may retain part of its profits to
build up reserves. Investment trust companies grew to importance in the latter
half of the nineteenth century and have been prominent in directing capital
towards overseas investment. At the end of 1976, such companies held assets
worth £5,958 million, of which over one-third were in overseas securities.
Unit trusts are constituted by trust deed between a management company
and a trustee company which holds the assets. Normally, the managers sell
units to the public and must invest the proceeds in a fairly wide range of stock
exchange securities. The costs of running the trust are defrayed partly by an
initial charge which forms part of the price of a unit and partly by a half-
yearly service charge which is usually taken out of the income of the trust.
The level of both charges is controlled by the Department of Trade, whose
authorisation is required before units can be offered to the public; this is
only granted if the trust deed meets the Department’s requirements.
The first British unit trust was formed in 1931 and by 1939 there were
98 trusts, with assets estimated at £80 million. At the end of 1976 there were
2' 1 million unit holdings. The value of the funds invested in authorised
trusts depends on the value of the underlying securities; from only £60
million at the end of 1958 they had risen to £2,543 million at the end of
I97^- There is a wide variety of trusts, both in the range of investments
covered and in the ways of catering for the differing needs of investors.
The principal function of building societies is to supply long-term loans on
the security of private dwelling-houses purchased for owner-occupation,
though loans are occasionally made on the security of commercial and indus¬
trial premises and farms. The funds of building societies are derived mainly
from the general public who invest in shares or deposits. The amount of
share capital is not fixed; shares are not dealt in on the stock exchange but
may be withdrawn at par in cash if notice is given. The Building Societies Act
1962, which consolidated all earlier legislation, prescribes the general way in
which societies must conduct their business. The Chief Registrar of Friendly
Societies has discretionary powers to stop a society either advertising or
accepting money from investors if he considers that the way in which the
society’s business is conducted is jeopardising investors’ money. The rapid
expansion of building society activity in the twentieth century has been
accompanied by a concentration of most of the business in the hands of a few
large societies. At the end of 1976, 364 societies were registered, with total
assets of about £28,000 million; just over half of this amount is accounted for

by the five largest societies. The amount advanced on mortgage in 1976 was
£6,114 million, 23 per cent more than in 1975.
The stock exchanges of the United Kingdom and Irish Republic amalgamated
in 1973. Dealings with the public remain unchanged, but brokers may open
offices nationally and firms wherever situated trade on equal terms. The main
exchange and central administration are in London. There are also trading
floors in Glasgow, Liverpool, Manchester, Birmingham, Bristol, Cardiff,
Belfast and Dublin.
The number and variety of securities officially listed on the Stock Exchange
are greater than in any other market in the world and its turnover of company
securities is roughly equivalent to that of all the European bourses combined.
Some 8,400 securities are quoted on the Stock Exchange; at the end of
March 1977 these had a total market value of £293,228 million. About
6,900 securities of companies were quoted, including a number of leading
overseas companies. Company issues represented more than four-fifths of the
securities at market valuation, the remainder being United Kingdom, Irish
Republic and other overseas government and corporation stocks.
The Stock Exchange does not fix dealing prices; the terms on which bar¬
gains are made between members reflect the interaction of supply and demand
for the securities concerned.
The market consists of about 250 authorised banks and several firms of foreign
exchange brokers which act as intermediaries between the banks. It provides
those engaged in international trade with foreign currencies for their trans¬
actions. The foreign exchange banks are in close contact with financial
centres abroad and are able to quote buying and selling rates for both spot and
future delivery. An important function of the market is to engage in arbitrage
transactions which serve to eliminate differentials in exchange rates between
different centres. The forward market enables traders, who at a given date in
the future are due to receive or make a specific foreign currency payment, to
determine in advance the precise sterling equivalent of the foreign currency.
All authorised banks may deal in gold but, in practice, dealings are largely
concentrated in the hands of the five members of the London gold market.
The five members meet twice daily to fix a price for all transactions which
customers ask to have executed at the fixing. Although much interest centres
upon the fixings, active dealing takes place throughout the day. The London
fixing price remains the basis on which most of the world’s non-monetary gold
is traded. Forward prices may also be quoted on request.
Although a certain amount of insurance is provided by friendly societies and
trade unions, most insurance services in Britain are in the hands of mutual or
joint stock insurance companies or Lloyd’s underwriters.
There are about 800 insurance companies authorised to carry on one or more
classes of insurance business in Britain of which about 170 are overseas
companies. A number of other overseas insurance companies are represented
by agents in Britain although they do not write business here.
Some 300 companies belong to the British Insurance Association and these
account for about 95 per cent of the world-wide business of the British
insurance companies market.

Lloyd’s is an incorporated society of private insurers in London. The name
‘Lloyd’s’ is derived from Edward Lloyd’s coffee house, established in the late
seventeenth century, where merchants with maritime and other interests
gathered to transact business. Although in its earlier history the activities of
Lloyd’s were confined to the conduct of marine insurance business, there
has also been built up at Lloyd’s a very considerable world-wide market for
the transaction of other classes of insurance business in non-marine, aviation
and motor markets.
Lloyd’s is regulated by a series of special Acts of Parliament starting in 1871.
The affairs of the Society of Lloyd’s in its corporate capacity are administered
by the Committee of Lloyd’s. The society does not accept insurance itself.
Lloyd’s is not a company but a market for insurance, where business is
transacted by individual underwriters for their own account and risk and in
competition with each other. Insurance may only be placed through Lloyd’s
brokers, who negotiate with Lloyd’s underwriters on behalf of the insured.
Only elected underwriting members of Lloyd’s, who must transact insurance
with unlimited liability and who have met the most stringent financial regula¬
tions laid down by the Committee of Lloyd’s, are permitted to transact
business at Lloyd’s; these financial safeguards give security to the Lloyd’s
policy. Since 1969 non-Commonwealth underwriters have been admitted to
membership of Lloyd’s if they satisfy the requirements.
There are some 8,500 underwriting members of Lloyd’s grouped into
about 320 syndicates and represented at Lloyd’s by underwriting agents who
accept risks on behalf of the members of their syndicates.
Alongside its marine insurance business Lloyd’s has built up a world-wide
organisation for the collection and diffusion of shipping intelligence.
The insurance market is completed by the insurance brokers, acting on behalf
of the insured; brokers are an essential part of the Lloyd’s market and a
valuable part of the company market. Many brokers specialise in re-insurance
business, acting as intermediaries in the exchange of contracts between
companies, both British and overseas, and often acting as London representa¬
tives of the latter. The Insurance Brokers (Registration) Act 1977 provides
for the registration of insurance brokers by a Registration Council.
Over 60 per cent of the general (that is, non-life) business of members of the
British Insurance Association is carried on overseas, partly by re-insurance
on the London market and partly through branches and agencies established
in over 100 countries. The basic principle of this international business is
that resources capable of meeting any potential loss are instantly available
for use in any part of the world.
Behind this large and international volume of business stand the very
substantial assets of the companies, in addition to substantial reserves of
uncalled capital, and the deposits, underwriting trust funds and other re¬
sources of Lloyd’s underwriters.
In accordance with the Treaty of Rome, insurance and re-insurance in the
European Community are regulated by directives addressed to the govern¬
ments of member states. The purpose of the directives is to harmonise the
legislation of the various member countries, thus providing a ‘common
market’, which would avoid distortion of competition. Directives abolishing
restrictions on freedom of establishment and freedom to provide services in
respect of reinsurance, and on compulsory motor insurance were in force
when Britain joined the Community and have since been accepted. A directive

relating to freedom of establishment in non-life insurance came into force in
1976 while one relating to insurance intermediaries comes into force in June
1978. Draft directives relating to other classes of insurance are under con¬
sideration or in preparation.
Britain remains the principal international centre for transactions in a large
number of commodities, although most of the sales negotiated in London
relate to consignments which never pass through the ports of Britain. The
need for close links with sources of finance and with shipping and insurance
services often determined the location of these physical markets in the City
of London. There are also futures markets in cocoa, coffee, grains (wheat and
barley), rubber, soya bean meal, sugar, wool and non-ferrous metals (copper,
lead, silver, tin and zinc).
The Crown Agents for Oversea Governments and Administrations provide
financial, professional and commercial services for some 100 governments,
mostly of independent countries, and over 200 overseas public authorities
and international bodies. The individual Crown Agents are appointed by
the Minister for Overseas Development, but the office is not a government
department. It is a non-profit-making public service which is responsible
to its principals for business operation. In April 1976 the Government
announced its intention to incorporate the Crown Agents.
18 Trade and Payments
PATTERN OF
TRADE
Value and
Volume
Although small in area and accounting for only about i -4 per cent of the world’s
population, Britain is the fifth largest trading nation in the world—and, as a
member of the European Community, part of the world’s largest trading area
which accounts for 35 per cent of all trade (see also p. 356).
For hundreds of years, and especially since the mid-nineteenth century,
when the rapid growth of Britain’s industry, commerce and shipping was
accompanied by its development as an international trading centre, overseas
trade has been of vital importance to the country’s economy. Britain’s exports
of goods represent more than one-fifth of the gross domestic product. It is
a major supplier of machinery, vehicles, aircraft, metal manufactures, electrical
apparatus, chemicals and textiles. Britain relies upon imports for almost half
of its total consumption of foodstuffs, and for most of the raw materials needed
for its industries. It is among the world’s largest importers of foodstuffs,
timber and paper, metals and ores, and other raw materials, petroleum and
many other products. Invisible trade is also of great significance to the economy,
Britain having the largest share of world invisible trade after the United
States.
A sound commercial banking system and a wide range of financial institutions
ensure that commercial needs are met for both short- and long-term finance
for international trade. The facilities provided by merchant banks and accepting
houses, for example, have long been used to finance shipments of goods not
only to and from Britain, but also between overseas countries.
This chapter describes the pattern of British overseas trade including its
commodity and area distribution, outlines British commercial policies and
government services to overseas trade, summarises the balance of payments and
gives an account of government aid to developing countries.
OVERSEAS TRADE
Changes in the value, volume, composition and geographical distribution of
imports and exports are outlined in the following paragraphs.
In 1976 Britain’s exports of goods were valued at about £25,400 million f.o.b.
and its imports of goods at about £29,000 million f.o.b. on a balance of pay¬
ments basis (as distinct from an overseas trade statistics basis, which for
imports includes the costs of insurance and freight, and for both imports and
exports includes returned goods). Between 1975 and 1976 the value of exports
rose by 31 per cent while that of imports increased by 28 per cent. Over the
same period the volume index of exports increased by 8 per cent and of imports
by 6 per cent; but the unit value index of exports rose by 21 per cent and of
imports by 22 per cent. The main reason for the improvement in export
volume in 1976 was the return to growth in world trade; while the rise in
import volume resulted from some increase in domestic activity after a fall in
1975 and an end to the destocking which was a marked feature of 1975, with
some evidence, late in 1976, of stockbuilding.
The value and volume of imports and exports, together with the terms of
trade index, from 1970 to 1976, are shown in Table 24.

9 On an overseas trade statistics basis.
Although Britain is still the largest importer of food in the world the value of its
imported food supplies has been growing less rapidly than the value of total
imports and the ratio of imported foodstuffs to total imports, on an overseas
trade statistics basis, has fallen from 36 per cent in 1954 to 14 per cent in 1976.
There has been a similar downward trend in the proportion accounted for by
basic materials—from 30 per cent in 1954 to about 10 per cent in 1976.
Imports of petroleum and petroleum products amounted to about 18 per
cent of the total value of imports during 1976, when their value was £5,126
million on a balance of payments basis. This was 31 per cent higher than in
1975, increased prices more than offsetting a slight fall in volume, itself the
result of increasing production of North Sea oil.
In recent years there has been a significant rise, in Britain as in other in¬
dustrial countries, in the proportion of imports of finished manufactures.
Such imports rose from about 6 per cent of the total imports in 1957 to 28 per
cent in 1976, when they were valued at £8,860 million. Imports of semi¬
manufactures have also been increasing and since 1962 have formed a larger
part of the total import bill than basic materials, partly the result of a shift of
the early stages of the manufacturing processes to the supplying countries.
Imports of semi-manufactured goods (including chemicals) totalled £8,073
million in 1976 and accounted for 26 per cent of total imports.
About 83 per cent of Britain’s exports consist of manufactured goods both
finished and semi-manufactured. By far the most important group of goods
is machinery and transport equipment, although exports of these dropped
slightly in 1976 to account for 39 per cent of total exports. Exports of machinery
alone accounted for 27 per cent of total exports in 1976. The share of chemicals
has grown fairly steadily, to reach nearly 12 per cent in 1976 after a slight drop

Although Britain’s trade has, in general, grown fastest in recent years with the
rest of the European Community, there was a marked change in the pattern
of British exports following the oil price rise at the end of 1973. As a result of
this rise, which generated large reserves for the oil-exporting countries,
British exports to these countries rose in value by 51 per cent between 1973 and
1974, accounting for nearly one-tenth of the total growth in exports over this
period. On the other hand, the slowdown in activity in most of the developed
economies during 1974 had similar consequences for British exports to these
economies. A similar pattern obtained in 1975, when the value of exports to
the oil-exporting countries grew by 88 per cent, compared with a growth of
16 per cent to other member countries of the European Community and of only
3 per cent to North America (implying a substantial fall in volume). In 1976,
there was a return to growth in world trade and exports to the developed
industrial countries continued the recovery which began in the latter part of
1975 as economic conditions in the European Community and the United

As far back as estimates have been made (for nearly two centuries) Britain has
usually earned a surplus from its invisible transactions. These fall into three
main groups: services (receipts and payments arising from services, as distinct
from goods, supplied to and received from overseas residents); interest, profits
and dividends (income arising from outward and inward investment); and
transfers between Britain and other countries (see below). Table 28 shows the
breakdown of the figures from 1970 to 1976. The transactions in each of these
groups involving central government and local authorities are shown separately.
Services of the private sector (and public corporations) include sea transport
and civil aviation, travel, financial services and ‘other services’ which include
commissions on imports, royalties, services between related companies, con¬
struction work overseas, agency expenses and many other services.

The balance on invisibles in 1976 was £2,166 million. Gross earnings of
£13,838 million from invisible exports were more than half of the total of
£25,416 million from visible exports. Earnings from private sector services were
particularly buoyant in 1975 and 1976, with rapid growth in both travel and
financial services. There has also been a substantial surplus on interest, profits
and dividends in recent years.
The deficits on government services have related predominantly to military
services overseas which have remained fairly steady in recent years, though
currency changes (see p. 194) have caused the sterling value to rise. Substantial
government transfer payments relate to economic grants to developing countries
and subscriptions to international organisations including, since 1973, Britain’s
contribution to the common budget for the financing of European Community
expenditure.
Britain has long been an advocate of the removal of artificial barriers to trade,
and to this end has taken a leading part in the activities of such organisations as
the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), the International
Monetary Fund (IMF), the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and
Development (OECD) and the United Nations Conference on Trade and
Development (UNCTAD). As a member of the European Community

Britain participates in the development of the Community’s commercial
policy. The Community’s Common Customs Tariff (CCT) is, on average, at a
similar level to the tariffs of other major industrial countries.

General Agree¬
ment on Tariffs
and Trade
Protective tariffs have been considerably modified in recent years as a result
of negotiations held under the auspices of GATT which also seek to reduce
tariffs and other barriers to trade, and to eliminate discrimination in inter¬
national commerce.
As a result of the ‘Kennedy Round’ (1964-67), a series of GATT tariff
negotiations, average reductions of over 30 per cent were made by the major
trading countries, including Britain, in their tariffs on industrial goods. A new
series of negotiations was formally launched in Tokyo in 1973 and substantive
discussions began in Geneva in 1975. The negotiations cover a wide range of
both tariff and non-tariff barriers to trade. (The European Community
operates as a single unit both in these negotiations and in GATT generally.)
Anti-Dumping The GATT Anti-Dumping Code, to which Britain is a party, together with
the Customs Duties (Dumping and Subsidies) Act 1969 and a European
Economic Community regulation, control the anti-dumping action that may
be taken to protect British industry against unfair competition and the criteria
by which allegations of dumping are judged.
Community All tariffs on trade in industrial products between Britain and the other
Preference European Community countries have been eliminated. Britain applies the
common customs tariff to all countries neither belonging to, nor having any
special arrangement with, the Community, subject to special arrangements for
some industrial materials. Virtually all industrial tariff barriers between the

European Community and the remaining member countries of the European
Free Trade Association (EFTA), to which Britain belonged between i960 and
1972, have been dismantled.
Reciprocal preferential tariff treatment for trade between Britain and other
independent Commonwealth countries dates from the Ottawa Conference of
1932.
The special trading relations between Britain and 22 developing Common¬
wealth countries in Africa, the Caribbean and the Pacific (ACP) were replaced
by the Convention of Lome, the trade provisions of which came into effect on
1st July 1975. This established new trade, aid and co-operation links between
the European Community and a total of 46 developing ACP countries. In 1977
six newly independent countries acceded to the Convention, bringing the
total number of members to 52 (24 Commonwealth and 28 non-Common-
wealth).1 The Convention safeguards the interests of Commonwealth and
other countries dependent on the export of particular agricultural products,
including sugar for which access to Community markets has been guaranteed
for an indefinite period at prices related to those in the Community and in
quantities which the producing countries have undertaken to supply.
All British dependent territories (with the exception of Gibraltar, Hong Kong
and Bermuda), together with the Overseas Countries and Territories (OCT) of
other Community members, were formally linked with the Community as a
whole in 1976 under arrangements similar to those embodied in the Con¬
vention of Lome. (The trade arrangements that will operate under this new
association were brought into effect on an interim basis in August 1975.) The
phasing out of the preference for imports from Commonwealth countries began
on 1st July 1977.
Other special arrangements have been agreed relating to continued access
into the Community for New Zealand dairy products.
The Community has stated its continuing objective of expanding and re¬
inforcing existing trade relations with the Commonwealth countries of Asia,
taking into account the scope of the generalised system of preferences (see
below) from which they derive considerable benefit. A commercial co-operation
agreement between the Community and India came into effect in 1974, one
with Sri Lanka in 1975, and one with Bangladesh in 1976. An agreement with
Pakistan was signed in 1976.
The establishment of a generalised system of preferences for manufactures and
semi-manufactures exported by developing countries was agreed in principle
at the second UNCTAD Conference in New Delhi in 1968. Britain’s scheme
started early in 1972, but, as a member of the European Community, Britain
adopted in 1974 the scheme of the enlarged Community. The Community’s
scheme has been considerably improved since the enlargement by the establish¬
ment of more liberal access into the Community for imports of manufactured
and processed agricultural products from developing countries. Continued
improvement of the scheme is to be made with the interests of the poorest

developing countries (particularly those of Asian members of the Common¬
wealth) in mind.
There are now very few restrictions imposed by Britain on the movement of
goods and services.
Under the Import, Export and Customs Powers (Defence) Act 1939 the
Department of Trade is empowered to prohibit or regulate the import or export
of goods. Several other departments have separate powers to control imports
and exports for specific purposes.
In accordance with its international obligations under the GATT, and to the
IMF and the European Community, Britain has progressively removed
quantitative restrictions from almost all its imports from the market economies;
those controls that remain predominantly affect textile goods. There are
comparatively few quantitative restrictions on imports from centrally planned
economies, and progress towards liberalisation continues to be made wherever
possible. In accordance with its obligations to the European Community,
Britain has also removed all quantitative restrictions on imports of goods of
Community origin, with the exception of potatoes and certain internationally
recognised restrictions. In 1975 the importation of gold coins, gold medals
and similar articles, minted or made after 1837, was made subject to individual
licensing; the remaining controls include those recognised internationally on a
few goods such as arms, ammunition and radioactive materials. Controlled
goods require a specific import licence. Some further restrictions or pro¬
hibitions are applied under separate legislation for the protection of health or
public safety, in the interest of conservation, and for other non-econornic
reasons (for example, on animals, drugs and explosives). There is also a general
import restriction on goods from Rhodesia as part of the Government’s
sanctions policy against the illegal regime.
Except for the control necessary to ensure that exports to destinations outside
the scheduled territories are paid for in the proper manner most British exports
are not subject to any government control or direction. (The scheduled
territories comprise the United Kingdom, the Channel Islands, the Isle of
Man, the Irish Republic and Gibraltar.) The few controls that are in operation
are imposed to supervise exports of military and strategic significance; on
diamonds and diamond jewellery, to assist exchange control operations (see
below) in preventing the export of capital in that form; on cattle, sheep and
pigs, horses, asses and mules, for humanitarian purposes; on cocoa and cocoa
products and on endangered species of animals and plants, in accordance with
international agreements; on antiques over 100 years old and documentary
and photographic material over 70 years old, to restrict the export of items of
national importance; on salmon and trout, to inhibit out-of-season fishing; on
controlled (dangerous) drugs; on currency notes, gold coin and gold bullion;
on British spirits (beverages) in casks of less than nine gallons; and on EEC
Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) products. All exports to Rhodesia are
subject to control.
Britain applies exchange control principally in order to conserve its reserves of
gold and foreign exchange. The powers under the Exchange Control Act 1947
are conferred mainly on the Treasury which has delegated the administration
of most parts of the Act to the Bank of England and to HM Customs and Excise.
TRADE AND PAYMENTS
359
The Bank has in turn authorised most commercial banks in Britain to execute a
wide range of transactions.
The general effect of exchange control regulations is to control transactions
between residents of the scheduled territories and non-residents. Payments in
sterling may in general be made freely between residents, but the acquisition of
other currencies by them is subject to control.
The aim of exchange control policy is not to discourage investment abroad
but to regulate the manner in which investment outside the scheduled terri¬
tories is financed. Official exchange is usually available only for projects which
promise early and continuing benefits to the balance of payments. Where the
use of official exchange is not permitted investors can finance their approved
projects in other ways, for example, by borrowing foreign currency or pur¬
chasing investment currency (which, because it is drawn from a limited pool
of currency, normally changes hands at a premium).
In November 1976 alterations became effective in exchange control rules
relating to the provision of sterling finance by banks in Britain where one
overseas sterling area (OSA) country is trading with another, and for trade
between such countries and other non-scheduled territories. These altera¬
tions are designed to end the provision of such finance and, at the same time,
to terminate the use by British merchants of official exchange to finance
trade between any of the non-scheduled territories (which include the
OSA). In line with this restriction, a British merchant is normally allowed to
pay non-residents for goods which he sells to other non-residents only with
foreign currency borrowed for this purpose, which should be repaid with
foreign currency proceeds of sale. Sterling credit provided by British banks
for foreign trade is therefore restricted to the financing of trade between the
scheduled territories and the rest of the world. Payments for goods exported
from the scheduled territories must be received in foreign currency or in
sterling from non-resident sources—normally within six months of export
unless they are covered by an approved export credit arrangement. Control is
also exercised over imports to ensure that currency authorised for their
payment is used for that purpose.
There are certain restrictions on dealings in gold bullion and on the use of
gold for manufacturing and industrial purposes. Purchases of gold coins
minted after 1837 by United Kingdom residents other than authorised dealers
in gold are allowed only if the coins are in Britain and are being sold by a resident
who is not selling on behalf of a non-resident.
Residents are entitled to purchase up to £300 in foreign currency for their
travel expenditure on each journey outside the scheduled territories, other than
to Rhodesia, irrespective of the purpose of the journey. Further travel funds
may be obtained for business, professional or other reasons. Non-residents may
be permitted by the Bank of England to hold an external account in a British
bank and are entitled to change their sterling on external account for other
currencies and to make and receive payments in any currency to and from non¬
residents in any other part of the world. Special restrictions apply to transactions
with residents of Rhodesia.
People living outside the scheduled territories who visit Britain temporarily
are regarded as non-resident and not subject to most of the exchange control
provisions. On the other hand, people coming to Britain from outside the
scheduled territories and intending to take up permanent residence in Britain
are normally regarded as resident, though they may be eligible for certain
exemptions from their obligations under the Exchange Control Act I947*
Visitors to Britain may import notes in any currency, travellers’ cheques and

letters of credit without limit. On departure, visitors may take with them
sterling or scheduled territory notes up to a value of £25, foreign currency
notes up to a value of ^3°° and, as a concession, any foreign currency notes
which they brought in with them.
The Government assists exporters by its efforts to create conditions favourable
to the export trade and by providing credit insurance facilities and information
and advice about opportunities for trade in other countries. Export promotion
is also assisted by the Scottish Council (Development and Industry), the
Development Corporation for Wales and in Northern Ireland by the Depart¬
ment of Commerce.
The British Overseas Trade Board (BOTB) directs Britain’s official export
promotion services, which include the provision of export intelligence, assis¬
tance to British exporters in appointing agents and locating potential importers,
help to exporters at trade fairs and other promotional events overseas, and
support for firms participating in missions overseas and for inward commercial
visits to Britain. It includes representatives of commerce and industry, the
Trades Union Congress, the Department of Trade and the Foreign and Com¬
monwealth Office and operates under the general authority of the Secretary of
State for Trade who is the President.
Exporters wanting assistance and advice can consult the offices of the BOTB
throughout Britain and, through these offices, the commercial posts of the
British Diplomatic Service overseas.
Overseas officers work closely with the BOTB in the provision of services for 1
exporters. They regularly report on local economic and commercial conditions
and generally assist the exporter to overcome any difficulties he encounters
in trade with the country in question, particularly those arising out of govern¬
mental regulations.
The Export Credits Guarantee Department (ECGD) provides credit insurance
for more than a third of the country’s export trade and for much of the external
trade of British merchants.
The main risks covered include insolvency or protracted default of the
buyer, governmental action which stops the British exporter receiving payment,
new import restrictions, war, or civil disturbance in the buyer’s country. Cover
may commence from the date of contract or (at lower premiums) from the date
of shipment.
This insurance may be supplemented by unconditional guarantees of repay¬
ment given direct to banks financing the exporter. Alternatively, for contracts
over £l million ECGD will guarantee loans direct to overseas buyers enabling
them to pay on cash terms, or ‘lines of credit’ similarly covering an agreed
buying programme of an overseas country. The banks provide finance against
these guarantees.
In order to facilitate a switch from sterling to foreign currency financing of
exports, ECGD will in future underwrite larger projects only where these
are financed in foreign currency.
Since 1975 ECGD has offered a measure of cover against high and unpre¬
dictable cost escalation to exporters with capital goods contracts worth over
£2 million which involve a manufacturing period of over two years. ECGD is
also prepared to support the issue of performance bonds in the commercial
market in respect of cash or near-cash contracts worth over £1 million.
Investment insurance is also provided for new British investment against
expropriation, war damage and restrictions on remittances.
Trade Fairs
TRADE AND PAYMENTS 361
Britain stages many exhibitions and trade fairs and British products are shown
at most of the large international trade fairs throughout the world.
Participation in trade fairs and store promotions overseas are forms of export
promotion for which the Government provides information and financial
assistance to exporters. In 1973 a British Export Marketing Centre was opened
in Tokyo to provide exhibitions and other marketing facilities for individual
British firms or organisations.
BALANCE OF PAYMENTS
Britain’s balance of payments has usually been characterised by a deficit on
visible trade partially offset by a surplus on invisible earnings. Estimates of
the balance of payments and its main constituent items from 197° t° I97^
are given in summary in Table 29 and in greater detail since 1974 Tables 30
and 31. The balance of payments statistics contain two indicators of particular
importance. The first is the balance on current account, covering both visible
(exports and imports of goods) and invisible (trade in services, investment
income and transfers) transactions. This, together with capital transfers,
provides a measure of how far Britain is paying its way abroad and thus adding
to or using up overseas assets. The second indicator is the balance for official
financing. This is the net result of all external transactions, that is, the current
account, capital transfers, investment and other capital transactions (including
official long-term capital transactions, investment flows, trade credit, and

and in overseas currencies) and other flows including unidentified transactions
reflected in the balancing item. The balance for official financing shows the
impact of all external transactions on the reserves and official debt position, that
is, how much is available to add to the reserves and repay any official borrowing
in the case of a net surplus, or how much must be financed by drawing on the
reserves or by borrowing if there is a net deficit. Table 30 gives details of the
current account since 1974. The increase in oil prices (see p. 186) was the main
cause of a substantial rise in the visible deficit in 1974 to £5,194 million, offset
to some extent by a surplus on invisibles of £1,629 million. In 1975, the low

level of domestic activity and substantial de-stocking reduced the volume of
imports, more than offsetting the decline in the volume of exports resulting
from the setback in world trade. The visible trade deficit consequently declined
to ^3,203 million while that on non-oil goods was almost eliminated. After a
slight worsening in the terms of trade in 1976, the visible deficit stood at £3,571
million and the total current deficit at £1,405 million. The deficit for official
financing of £3,628 million was met by drawings of £1,018 million from the
International Monetary Fund (IMF), by public sector borrowing of £1,791
million under the exchange cover scheme and by drawings of £853 million
from the official reserves.
There was a net outflow in 1976 on identified investment and other capital
transactions of some £2,814 million. Overseas investment in the private sector
rose in 1976 to about £2,051 million. Private investment overseas, at about
£2,100 million, was higher than in 1974 and 1975 when sizeable net disinvest¬
ment from portfolio holdings of foreign securities took place. Direct investment
overseas includes a substantial element of reinvested profits.1

Britain participates in the Special Drawing Rights (SDRs) scheme which
came into effect in 1970 in order to supplement world reserves. SDRs are
reserve assets created and distributed by decision of the members of the IMF.
Any member of the IMF may join the scheme, and its share is based on its IMF
quota. Participants in the scheme accept an obligation to provide convertible
currency, when designated by the IMF to do so, to another participant in
exchange for SDRs up to a total amount equal to twice the net amount of their
own allocation of SDRs. Only those countries with a sufficiently strong balance
of payments are so designated by the IMF. SDRs may also be used in certain
direct payments between participants in the scheme and for payments of
various kinds to the IMF. The role of SDRs as a central standard of value in
international transactions (see p. 194) is being enhanced.
The significance of any inventory of Britain’s aggregate external assets and
liabilities2 is limited because a variety of claims and obligations are included that
are very dissimilar in kind, in degree of liquidity and in method of valuation.
1 Direct investment refers mainly to the establishment of subsidiary companies and
banks, while portfolio investment refers to investment in company securities.

The inventory for the end of 1976 shows that Britain had a net debtor position
estimated at some ^1,600 million, due to heavy official financing of balance

usual and this is likely to be quickly restored as North Sea oil allows for
repayment of external debt.

million of the total figure for end-1976, the balance consisting of £8,150
million of portfolio investment.
United Kingdom banking and commercial claims at the end of 1976 totalled
£7,650 million. Within this total banking claims were £3,824 million; sup¬
pliers’ export credit to unrelated firms was £3,137 million. Official external
assets, including re-financed export credit, amounted at the end of 1976 to
£4,270 million, which included outstanding inter-government loans by
Britain of £1,244 niillion. These assets, together with official reserves of
£2,485 million, £j,6$o million in banking and commercial claims and private
investment overseas of £27,020 million, resulted in aggregate identified
external assets at the end of 1976 of some £41,425 million.
Approval is readily obtained for financing direct investment projects by
borrowing abroad on appropriate terms, and there is also scope for the invest¬
ment of retained profits of subsidiary companies overseas. In recent years a
considerable proportion of net direct investment outflow has been financed in
this way. Foreign currency finance out of the official reserves is available for
direct investment only when projects promise early and substantial benefits
to Britain’s balance of payments, such as are provided by the returns to direct
investment overseas, which take the form of interest, profits and dividends.
Examination of these returns in conjunction with the methods of financing
direct investment overseas (such as the use of unremitted profits and foreign
currency borrowing) indicated that, overall, British direct investment overseas
has a beneficial effect on the official reserves and the balance of payments.
Direct investment outflow, excluding oil, was £1,874 million in 1976 com¬
pared with £1,094 million in 1975- (The latest available area analysis indicates
that of the 1975 figure £297 million was placed in developing countries, £151
million in other member countries of the European Community and £308
million in I\orth America.) With the inclusion of oil, portfolio and other invest¬
ment, aggregate private investment outflows totalled £2,100 million in 1976,
compared with £1,383 million in 1975, while portfolio investment of £49
million in 1975 changed, in 1976, to net disinvestment of £165 million.
Identified external liabilities at the end of 1976 are estimated to have been some
£43>oi5 million. Drawings on the IMF oil facility and on the first credit
tranche (see p. 187) accounted for £1,160 million of this sum and foreign
currency borrowing by the Government in its own name since late in 1974 for a
further £1,469 million. Foreign currency borrowing by the rest of the public
sector under the exchange cover scheme totalled £5,867 million. Inter¬
governmental loans to Britain and other official liabilities, mainly a consequence
of the second world war and its aftermath, totalled £2,390 million at the end
of 1976 of which £1,843 million was owed to the United States and £471
million to Canada. Other public sector liabilities of £3,715 million comprised
overseas holdings of British government and public corporations’ sterling
securities, holdings of Treasury bills and notes, local authorities’ securities
and mortgages and borrowings by British public corporations and local
authorities other than under the exchange cover scheme. British banking and
commercial liabilities, including liabilities in sterling and in foreign currencies,
totalled £10,469 million.1 Liabilities in the form of overseas investment in
Britain’s private sector totalled £17,945 million.
This sector covers the London banks’ operations in the Euro-currency markets in
which very large non-sterling currency liabilities are broadly matched by non-sterling
assets. Only net liabilities of £2,607 million (the difference between assets of £81,076
million and liabilities of £83,683 million) are included in the external liabilities figure.
TRADE AND PAYMENTS
365
Inward Private
Investment
The ‘sterling balances’, or foreign holdings in Britain of sterling in the form
of British government securities, bank deposits, deposits with local authorities
and hire purchase companies, and Treasury bills totalled £6,512 million at the
end of March 1977. Of this, £1,975 mdlion was held by residents of oil-export¬
ing countries, £1,158 million by residents of other member countries of the
European Community and £3,379 million by other holders. About 43 per cent
of the balances were official holdings (mostly those of central monetary in¬
stitutions) and 57 per cent were private holdings used by overseas residents to
finance their international transactions. The total of these liabilities (excluding
the counterpart of borrowing) remained broadly constant between the end of
1945 and 1970, then rose sharply in the early 1970s to a peak in 1975, but fell in
1976, mainly as a result of reductions in the amounts held by central monetary
institutions.
As trade and payments arrangements have become more diversified in
recent years the relative importance of sterling as a reserve currency has
declined. Nevertheless, following the increase in oil prices the official sterling
balances grew rapidly as a number of oil-producing countries deposited part
of their financial surpluses in Britain. During 1976, however, they fell sharply
as official holdings were reduced because of fears about Britain’s relatively high
inflation rate and trade deficit which undermined the sterling exchange rate,
and this depressed the exchange rate further. The facility for the sterling
balances, set up for two years early in 1977 (see p. 188), aims to ensure that
sterling and the exchange markets cease to be affected by pressures associated
with any run down of the official sterling holdings and to achieve greater inter¬
national monetary stability. It also enables the Government to achieve an
orderly reduction in the role of sterling as a reserve currency. The Government
offered official holders the option to convert part of their holdings into negotiable
medium-term foreign currency bonds issued on market-related terms; some
£395 million of the official balances were converted in this way.
Overseas liabilities arising from investment in the private sector of the British
economy rose from £3,385 million in 1970 to £17,945 million at the end of 1976.
Overseas investors in Britain are free to repatriate the proceeds of the sale of
their investments, including any capital gains that may have accrued. Earnings
and dividends are transferable irrespective of their size. In 1976 the inflow of
direct, portfolio and other private investment, including oil, amounted to
£2,051 million.1
The value of overseas investment in the private sector at the end of 1976
comprised: the book value of direct investment in Britain by companies in¬
corporated abroad (excluding oil and banking)—£7,650 million (this figure has
been extrapolated from the book value at the end of 1974, taking account of
subsequent annual transactions); portfolio holdings of British securities—
£3,265 million; the book value of the net assets in Britain of overseas oil com¬
panies—£4,700 million; and borrowing by British companies overseas—£2,330
million.
Of the £525 million inflow of direct investment into Britain in 1975 (the
latest year for which detailed figures are available) £201 million originated in
North America and £114 million in other member countries of the European
Community. Foreign investment inflow brings a number of benefits to British
industry, including technological development which in turn will strengthen
the economy and its balance of payments position.

BRITISH
GOVERNMENT
AID TO
DEVELOPING
COUNTRIES
Bilateral
Financial Aid
Britain’s aid programme to the developing countries, which is the responsibility
of the Ministry of Overseas Development, consists of grants and loans for
economic and social development, technical co-operation, budget support and
contributions to multilateral aid giving agencies. To complement the official
programme private investment is encouraged by the provision of government
insurance to private investors by the ECGD. In addition an important con¬
tribution is made to economic development by private voluntary organisations
engaged in relief, development and educational work.
Since 1945 total official aid disbursements have amounted to nearly £5,301
million. The average gross annual disbursement over the four years 1973-76
was about £421 million. In 1976 official aid flows totalled some £540 million,
of which £522 million represented official development assistance (see Table
32) and £18 million other official flows. Of the overall total, bilateral aid
accounted for £399-3 million including technical co-operation funds of £127-4
million; assistance provided through multilateral agencies was £140-8 million.
Repayments of capital and payments of interest during the year on loans made
previously came to £46-3 million and £41-3 million respectively.
In recognition of the special importance of the role of official development
assistance, the strategy for the Second UN Development Decade, adopted in
1970, included a recommendation that each developed country should pro¬
gressively increase its official development assistance to the developing coun¬
tries and exert its best efforts to contribute a minimum net amount of 0-7 per
cent of its gross national product (GNP) to them by the middle of the decade.
Britain has accepted in principle the 0-7 per cent GNP target and is seeking
in the years ahead to move towards it. The speed at which it can do so, however,
must be subject to the pace of Britain’s own economic recovery and to other
calls on its resources. In 1976, net disbursements of official development
assistance amounted to £462-2 million, 0-38 per cent of GNP (the net official
flow figure was £479 million, 0-39 per cent of GNP). Britain has also accepted
the UN target of 1 per cent of GNP for total net financial flows (that is, includ¬
ing private and official flows) to developing countries.
In I975> in a major policy statement, contained in a report entitled The
Changing Emphasis in British Aid Policies—More Help for the Poorest (see
P- 447)) British Government outlined its intention to adapt its aid policies
to meet the needs of the poorest countries and the poorest communities within
these countries, with particular emphasis being placed on rural development.
Bilateral financial aid in 1976 totalled £271-9 million; over 70 per cent was in
grants and the rest in loans. Budgetary aid, £7-68 million in 1976, is provided in
the form of grants. Development aid is in grants or loans, depending on the
economic and constitutional circumstances of the recipient countries. The
greater part of it is provided in grants following the decision in June 1975 to
provide future aid to the poorest developing countries (which include India,
Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and many African countries) in grant form only. The
terms of new development loans from Britain have been progressively softened
since 1958 and a policy of making interest-free loans to lighten the repayment
burdens of the poorer developing countries was introduced in 1965. In 1976
the total value of bilateral loan commitments entered into by the British
Government, excluding investments by the Commonwealth Development
Corporation (see p. 367), was £23 million and of this over 47 per cent was on
interest-free terms. Where loans bear interest it is at fixed concessionary rates
ranging from 3 per cent to 6 per cent, and both kinds of loan carry from three
to seven years’ grace periods during which repayments of capital are not made.

Of all loans committed in 1976 the average maturity was 25 years. Britain has
more than fulfilled the 1972 recommendations of the Development Assistance
Committee of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development
(OECD) on easing the terms of financial aid.

Discrepancies between totals and their constituent parts are due to rounding.
Loans and grants are tied to the purchase of goods, equipment and services
from Britain, although there may be a limited element for local costs and a
foreign content not exceeding 20 per cent in contracts financed from tied aid
in appropriate cases. Since 1st October 1975, new loan commitments can be
untied, if the recipient agrees, to the extent that goods can be purchased from
the poorest developing countries as well as from Britain.
Historically, Britain’s aid programme began as part of the discharge of its
responsibilities towards dependent territories, and the main emphasis remains
on the Commonwealth which includes among its members some of the
world’s poorest countries. In 1976 ^311*9 million (83 per cent) of the bilateral
programme was disbursed to Commonwealth countries. Of this, £37 million
went to Britain’s remaining dependencies, which are a first charge on the aid
programme, and ^8 million to the Associated States in the Caribbean.
An important role in development assistance is played by the Common¬
wealth Development Corporation (CDC), set up by the British Government
in 1948, to assist the economic development of the then dependent territories.
Subsequent legislation extended its area of operations to independent Com¬
monwealth countries and, with the approval of the Minister of Overseas
Development, to other countries. By the end of 1976 some £2347 million had
been invested out of a total commitment of ^299’5 million. Of the latter, £S7'9
million was in East Asia and the Pacific Islands, ^52’3 million in the Caribbean
and virtually all of the remainder in Africa. New commitments approved in
1976 totalled over £38 million.

Technical
Co-operation
Multilateral
Contributions
BRITAIN 1978: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Expenditure on bilateral technical co-operation (the provision of skilled
personnel, advice and training) has increased in recent years and was £127-4
million, 32 per cent of total bilateral aid, in 1976. The largest component of
expenditure (£58 million in 1976) was on sending or maintaining experts
overseas, including volunteers; the next largest was for students and trainees
in Britain (£18 million).
During 1976, of the 9,287 British persons other than volunteers who were
working in developing countries and financed by the British Government,
some 4,279 were engaged in the field of education, 1,100 in public works and
communications, 1,385 in public administration, 1,034 in agriculture and
allied fields, 499 in health services, and 961 in industrial posts.
In addition, under the British Volunteer Programme in 1976 there were
1.933 volunteers, mainly graduates or otherwise qualified, working in develop¬
ing countries, the majority of them teaching. Recruitment, training and placing
overseas is undertaken by four voluntary bodies; 80 per cent of the British
costs (£1 million in 1976) were met by the British Government.
Britain receives large numbers of students and trainees from developing
countries. Over 12,600 were financed in Britain in 1976 under regional pro¬
grammes of technical co-operation, by awards under the Commonwealth Edu¬
cation Co-operation Scholarships and Education Fellowship Schemes, and
under the various schemes of the British Council.
Britain is the second largest subscriber (after the United States) to the World
Bank group of institutions—the International Bank for Reconstruction and
Development, the International Development Association (IDA) and the Inter¬
national Finance Corporation. The British commitment to the IDA’s Fourth
Replenishment, covering 1975-77, was over j£2°6 million, while that to the
Fifth Replenishment, which became effective in July 1977, is £474 million.
Britain has contributed, or has agreed to contribute, to the Asian Develop¬
ment Bank, the Inter-American Development Bank, the Caribbean Develop¬
ment Bank and the African Development Bank. Since its inception in 1950
Britain has contributed £113 million to the United Nations Development Pro¬
gramme and has provided more experts and training places under multilateral
schemes than any other country. Other contributions include those to the
United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA),
the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), the World
Food Programme and the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF).
An increasing proportion of British development assistance is being chan¬
nelled through the European Community’s aid programme. Community
financial aid takes the form principally of assistance from the European
Development Fund (EDF) to those countries which have a special relationship
with the Community under the Convention of Lome (see p. 357). The EDF for
i975-8° amounts to some £2,000 million, including expenditure on a new
export-earnings stabilisation scheme. Assistance to a number of Mediterranean
countries linked to the Community by trade agreements is being extended.
Britain also contributes fully to the Community’s food aid programme.
Britain is playing a leading part in urging the Community to adopt a new
aid and development policy based on the criterion of need and applicable on a
world-wide basis. This, which would involve all the instruments of Community
development policy, would place greater emphasis on giving help to those
developing countries—many of which are among the world’s poorest—not
covered by the Lome Convention or having any other special relationship
with the Community.
19 Promotion of the Sciences
Britain has for centuries provided an atmosphere of learning congenial to its
scientists, whose record of achievements in relation to size of population is in
many respects unsurpassed. A feature of the present century has been the
increased allocation of national resources by the Government to assist in
research and development, partly because of the benefits of science to society
and partly because of the increasing cost of the equipment and facilities needed.
This has led to the development of means for determining priorities in allo¬
cating resources and for accounting for their uses. The resulting organisational
structure, as described in this chapter, is, however, less centralised than it
appears and allows flexibility in maintaining much of the freedom which
scientists in Britain have traditionally enjoyed.
The Government keeps under review facilities for training scientists and
ensures that adequate research is devoted to matters of national interest, which
include defence (see Chapter 5), industrial innovation, health, environ¬
mental protection, use and conservation of natural resources, the provision
of good food, shelter and energy and of efficient transport and communica¬
tions. Though the Government finances just over half the research and
development in Britain it carries out only one-fifth in its own establishments
(compared with a quarter in the 1960s). Funds are also provided by private
and public corporations, and by private endowments and trusts. Research
is carried on in a wide range of institutions—private firms, research associa¬
tions, contract research institutions, government research laboratories,
universities, polytechnics, schools and hospitals.
The Pattern of Total expenditure in Britain on scientific research and development in 1972-73
Expenditure (the latest year for which complete estimates are available) was £1,310 million,
or 2-45 per cent of gross national product. Between 1966-67 and 1972-73 the
proportionate share devoted to defence fell by about 20 per cent compared with
a fall of 6 per cent in total spending for civil purposes and a rise of 4 per cent in
Government spending for civil research and development. The share of non-
Government sources in financing research and development for civil purposes
fell by 12 per cent over the period.
Total net Government expenditure on research and development rose from
£776 million in 1972-73 to an estimated £1,353 million in 1975-76, of which
£21 million was for the social sciences. Private industry spent £743 million in
1972-73 which increased to £1,185 million in 1975-76. The Government
funded £403 million of this compared with £782 million which was privately
funded.
THE GOVERN¬
MENT AND
SCIENTIFIC
RESEARCH
Central responsibility for basic civil science rests with the Secretary of State
for Education and Science, who is advised by the Advisory Board for the
Research Councils (see p. 370). Responsibility for technology rests mainly
with the Secretary of State for Industry. Other government departments are
responsible for research and development related to their executive responsi¬
bilities. In 1972 the Government extended the customer-contractor approach
to all its applied research and development, whereby each department as
customer, with advice from its Chief Scientist, defines requirements and the

work is undertaken by contractors (government laboratories, research coun¬
cils, research associations, industry and the universities).
The Lord Privy Seal is responsible for ensuring that there is adequate co¬
operation and co-ordination between departments in science and technology.
An Advisory Council for Applied Research and Development has been
established under the Lord Privy Seal’s chairmanship to provide a central
forum of external advice to ministers and on the deployment of applied research
and development in both public and private sectors and on the role of Britain
in international collaboration in such activities. Reports will be published.
One of the specialist select committees of the House of Commons (see p. 34),
the Select Committee on Science and Technology, with not more than 15 mem¬
bers, has published reports on such subjects as energy conservation, univer¬
sity-industry relations, advanced ground transport and nuclear reactors which
have raised the level of public debate and influenced ministers. The Parlia¬
mentary and Scientific Committee provides for a regular exchange of informa¬
tion between Members of Parliament and scientists. Membership is open to
Members of Parliament of any party in both Houses, and also to nominated
representatives of such non-profit-making scientific and technological organi¬
sations as may be affiliated under its constitution.
The Department of Education and Science (see also p. 44) discharges its
responsibilities for basic and applied civil science mainly through the five
research councils: the Agricultural Research Council, the Medical Research
Council, the Natural Environment Research Council, the Science Research
Council and the Social Science Research Council; it also provides financial
grants to the British Museum (Natural History) and to the Royal Society
(see p. 381). On all these the department spent about £215 million in 1976-77.
In addition the research councils received commissions of about ^44*6 million
from other departments under the customer-contractor principle. The depart¬
ment is also responsible for some aspects of international scientific relations
(see p. 385) and helps to co-ordinate government policy regarding scientific
and technical information.
The Advisory Board for the Research Councils advises the Secretary of State
on responsibilities for civil science with special reference to the research
council system, the support of postgraduate students and the proper balance
between national and international scientific activities, and on the allocation
of the science budget between research councils and other bodies; and pro¬
motes close liaison between the councils and users of their research. Its
membership includes the chairman or secretary of each of the five research
councils, the chairman of the University Grants Committee, senior scientists
from departments with a major interest in the work of the research councils,
and independent members drawn from the universities, industry and the
Royal Society of London.
The Agricultural Research Council (ARC), established in 1931 under Royal
Charter (since amended), consists of a chairman and 18-21 other members. It
is supported in part by grant-in-aid provided by Parliament through the
Secretary of State for Education and Science; over half its expenditure is for
work commissioned by the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food.

The ARC is responsible for 15 independent state-aided agricultural research
institutes and also has eight institutes under its direct control and 9 units
which it has established under distinguished scientists associated with uni¬
versities. Also there are eight independent institutes in Scotland financed by
the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries for Scotland with advice from
the ARC on their scientific programmes, staffing and equipment.
The ARC also makes special research grants to support promising new lines
of work in university departments. It makes a limited number of post¬
graduate training awards.
The Medical Research Council (MRC) was established under Royal Charter
in 1920, as successor to a Medical Research Committee first appointed in 1913.
The council, which consists of a chairman and 14-18 other members, was
granted a new Charter in 1966 (since further amended). It is supported mainly
by a grant-in-aid provided by Parliament through the Secretary of State for
Education and Science and also receives funds from the health departments
and Department of Employment for the support of commissioned research.
The council is assisted by four advisory boards: the Neurobiology and
Mental Health Board; the Cell Biology and Disorders Board; the Physio¬
logical Systems and Disorders Board; and the Tropical Medicine Research
Board. The Council is also advised by an Environmental Medicine (Research
Policy) Committee on policy for the support of research on environmental,
occupational problems and problems of social medicine that often extends
beyond the responsibility of its advisory boards. In addition, the MRC is
advised by committees concerned with particular aspects of its work and with
research grants. The MRC’s arrangements for the support of research fall under
four main headings: investigations by members of its scientific staff, mostly
working in its own establishments; short-term (‘project’) grants to workers in
universities and elsewhere; long-term grants in support of specific research
programmes in university departments (‘programme grants’ and ‘research
grants’); and research training awards (fellowships and studentships) tenable
both at home and overseas.
The MRC’s main research establishments are the National Institute for
Medical Research at Mill Hill, London, and the Clinical Research Centre at
Northwick Park, London, which forms an integral part of Northwick Park
Hospital. In addition the council has over 60 research units, which are
mostly located in university departments, medical schools and hospitals in
Britain.
The MRC also undertakes work overseas and, with additional support from
the Ministry of Overseas Development (see p. 385), maintains laboratories in
The Gambia and in Jamaica.
Besides financing the Medical Research Council, the Government also
supports medical research through block grants to universities distributed
through the Department of Education and Science and the University Grants
Committee, and through the research and development programme of the
Department of Health and Social Security (see p. 379). Certain government-
financed research for defence purposes has civil applications related to medical
science.
Important contributions to the support of research in particular subjects
are made by industry, especially the pharmaceutical industry, and by the many
private charities or voluntary organisations which raise money for particular
branches of research.

Council
The Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) was established by
Royal Charter in 1965 with responsibility to encourage, plan and execute
research in sciences, physical and biological, relating to man’s natural environ¬
ment and its resources. These researches are broadly grouped and defined as:
the Solid Earth—its physical properties and mineral resources; Seas and
Oceans—their behaviour and living and mineral resources; Inland Waters—
their behaviour and living resources; Terrestrial Environments—wild-life
communities and their resources; Atmosphere—its structure and interactions;
and a number of interdisciplinary studies including pollution and the physical
and biological properties of the Antarctic environment.
The council carries out research and training through its own institutes,
grant-aided institutes, and by grants, fellowships and other postgraduate
awards to universities and other institutes of higher education.
The council’s research institutes are: the British Antarctic Survey, the
Institute of Geological Sciences, the Institute of Hydrology, the Institute of
Marine Biochemistry, the Institute for Marine Environmental Research, the
Institute of Oceanographic Sciences, the Institute of Terrestrial Ecology, and
the Unit of Invertebrate Virology. The council also maintains central service
units which include the Research Vessel Base and the Experimental Carto¬
graphy Unit.
Research institutes aided by council grants are: the Freshwater Biological
Association, the Marine Biological Association of the United Kingdom, the
Scottish Marine Biological Association, the Unit of Marine Invertebrate
Biology, the Unit of Comparative Plant Ecology and other units attached to
universities.
The statutory council consists of a chairman and up to 18 members. The
council is financed by a grant-in-aid from Parliament, received through the
Department of Education and Science, and by commissioned research under
the customer-contractor principle (see p. 369).
The Science Research Council (SRC), comprising a chairman and 14-18 other
members, was established under Royal Charter in 1965 and is supported by
parliamentary grants-in-aid through the Secretary of State for Education and
Science. The council supports basic research in astronomy, the biological
sciences, chemistry, engineering, mathematics and physics in furthering its
primary purpose of sustaining standards of education and research in the
universities. The council devotes most of its resources to: helping university
staff to carry out basic research either in their university or in one of the
council’s research establishments, or elsewhere; and enabling suitable
graduates to receive further training in methods of research or a specialised
branch of science or engineering of importance to British industry.
The council maintains five research establishments: the Appleton Labora¬
tory, Daresbury Laboratory, Royal Greenwich Observatory, The Royal
Observatory, Edinburgh, and Rutherford Laboratory. These establishments
are each centres of specialised research but are also used for the development of
new research equipment beyond the resources of a university (for example, the
high-power laser facility at the Rutherford Laboratory). They provide support
for university scientists whose research needs access to facilities run by inter¬
national research organisations, such as the powerful particle accelerators at
the European Organisation for Nuclear Research (CERN), the 150-inch
Anglo-Australian Telescope, and the high-flux neutron source at the Institut
Laue-Langevin (ILL).
The council provides national contributions to the CERN, the civil science

programme of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO), the European
Incoherent Scatter Project (EISCAT) and part of the European Space Agency
(ESA) contribution. It also contributes to, and shares with its French and
German partners, the control of the ILL reactor at Grenoble. The council
awards studentships for training in methods of research or advanced courses
of study; and fellowships to promising young scientists or engineers to enable
them to carry out an independent research programme that they themselves
have put forward.
The provision of facilities for research in high energy physics is the function
of the SRC. The SRC establishments concerned are the Rutherford Labora¬
tory, Chilton, with a 7 GeV (thousand million electron volt) proton synchro¬
tron (particle accelerator), and the Daresbury Laboratory, Warrington.
The future of the Rutherford Laboratory accelerator is being considered
in the light of the SRC’s reduced budget, though a new central laser facility
has been opened and construction of an ^11 million neutron source has been
approved. Experiments at higher energies are carried out at the European
Organisation for Nuclear Research (CERN) to which Britain contributes
through the SRC.
Astronomy uses both ground-based techniques, such as optical and radio
telescopes, and space-based methods (see p. 387). Optical astronomy is
carried out in university departments and in the Royal Greenwich Observa¬
tory and the Royal Observatory, Edinburgh, under the SRC. The 98-in (2-5-111)
Isaac Newton Telescope at the Royal Greenwich Observatory is operated as a
national facility. A 150-in (3-8-111) telescope has been inaugurated at Siding
Spring Mountain in Australia as a joint Anglo-Australian project, while a
British 48-in (i-2-m) Schmidt Telescope is working on the same site. Optical
telescopes operated by the South African Astronomical Observatory, to which
the SRC contributes, are available for use by British astronomers.
Cambridge and Manchester Universities are the main centres for research
in radio astronomy with substantial support from SRC. The fully steerable
250-ft (76-2-01) telescope at Jodrell Bank (University of Manchester) has been
modernised. The Cambridge University group at Lord’s Bridge has developed
and made substantial use of the aperture synthesis technique; two arrays of
telescopes with i-mile (i-6-km) and o-5-mile (o-8-km) baseline have been
complemented by a 5-kilometre (3-i-mile) array.
The Social Science Research Council (SSRC) was established under Royal
Charter in 1965 to encourage, support and carry out research in, and to
disseminate knowledge about, the social sciences. The council consists of a
chairman and 13-19 other members, and is supported by grant-in-aid provided
by Parliament through the Secretary of State for Education and Science. It
initiates research into such topics as health policy, energy policy, population
studies, pollution policy, pre-school education, transmitted deprivation, and
the social impact of North Sea oil. It provides grants for research projects at
universities and other institutions, and makes training awards to postgraduate
students. It has also four research units: the Industrial Relations Unit, the
Cambridge Population Unit and the Ethnic Relations Unit, and the Socio-
legal Studies Centre. The SSRC’s fields of interest include economics;
political science; psychology; social anthropology; social and economic
statistics; sociology and social administration; social science and government;
education; management and industrial relations; human geography; lin¬
guistics ; planning and various aspects of a wide range of other disciplines.

Several government departments have funds allocated for social research
related to their responsibilities, including the Home Office, which has a large
research unit carrying out a wide variety of sociological studies. The Social
Survey conducts sample survey inquiries at the request of government depart¬
ments and from time to time also carries out studies in collaboration with uni¬
versities and other independent research organisations. Assessments of trends
based on departmental data are published by the Central Statistical Office in
its publication Social Trends.
Of total estimated university expenditure on scientific research in the academic
year 1975-76 (over £207 million), the largest government contribution (over
£125 million) was through the University Grants Committee (UGC).
Scientific research in the universities (and other institutions of higher
education) is also supported through the research councils. This support takes
two forms. First, about half the postgraduate students in science and tech¬
nology in the universities and other institutions receive maintenance awards
from the research councils, through postgraduate studentships. These awards
are in some cases for periods of up to three years of training in research work
and in others for shorter periods for advanced studies. The cost of these
awards is about £30 million a year. Second, grants and contracts are given
to the universities and other institutions by the research councils for specified
projects, particularly in new or developing areas of research. These total
about £50 million a year. The ARC, MRC and SSRC maintain a number of
research units within universities. In addition, the research councils provide
central facilities in their own establishments for use by university research
workers.
The other main channels of support for scientific research in the universities
are various government departments, the Royal Society, industry and the
independent foundations. The contributions from sources other than the
UGC amount to about a third of the total university expenditure on research.
Universities in industrial centres have tended to acquire outstanding
reputations in studies relating to their local industries, and on a national scale
close relationships are fostered between the universities, industries and the
Government in numerous joint projects.
According to data derived from the Census of Population 1971 there were in
1971 some 448,870 persons with qualifications in engineering, technology and
science in Great Britain, of whom about one-half were qualified in science and
one-half in engineering and technology. Of those economically active (387,440),
47 per cent (185,470) held engineering qualifications, i-8 per cent (7,300) were
out of employment, and 40 per cent employed in manufacturing. Education
employed over 21 per cent and over the years 1959 to 1971 there was an increase
in the service sectors (commerce and consultancy).
The Department of Energy (see p. 45) is responsible for the United Kingdom
Atomic Energy Authority; research in support of the exploitation of North
Sea oil and gas; research into alternative sources of energy and conservation of
energy; co-ordination of energy research within government departments;
strategic oversight of the research programmes of the coal, gas and electricity
supply industries; and co-ordination of British contributions to energy research
and development programmes sponsored by international organisations.
The department has an Energy Technology Support Unit at Harwell to
assist in assessing the technological strategy options available to Britain in
energy policy. An Advisory Council on Research and Development for Fuel

of research and development of the nationalised energy industries and on
other matters related to energy research and development.
An Offshore Energy Technology Board advises the Secretary of State for
Energy on research and development in offshore oil and gas technology and
is responsible for programmes designed to ensure the safety and efficiency of
offshore operations and improve the competitive efficiency of the offshore
equipment industry in Britain.
The Secretary of State for Energy is responsible for promoting and controlling
the development of nuclear energy and ensuring that the proper degrees of
importance are attached to its various applications. The United Kingdom
Atomic Energy Authority (UKAEA) is the main body carrying out relevant
research and development. Under an Act of 1971 > the UKAEA’s fuel cycle
and radiochemical manufacturing activities were given full commercial
form by the establishment of two statutory companies: British Nuclear Fuels
Ltd., Risley (see p. 258), and the Radiochemical Centre Ltd., Amersham,
Bucks, (see p. 225): under an Act of 1973 the Atomic Weapons Research
Establishment was transferred to the Ministry of Defence.
The UKAEA carries out research and development in support of the
Government’s nuclear power programme, and has built and operates experi- -
mental and prototype reactors (see p. 257). The authority also carries out
research and development work outside the nuclear field. The headquarters
of the UKAEA are in London. Its research and development work is carried
out at the Atomic Energy Research Establishment at Harwell and at the
Culham Laboratory, both in Oxfordshire; at the Atomic Energy Establish¬
ment at Winfrith, in Dorset; and at establishments of the authority’s northern
division, which is directed from the Risley Nuclear Power Development
Establishment, near Warrington, Cheshire: the Risley Nuclear Power Deve¬
lopment Laboratories, the Dounreay Nuclear Power Development Establish¬
ment, Highland, the Springfields Nuclear Power Development Laboratories,
Lancashire, and Windscale Nuclear Power Development Laboratories,
Cumbria. The Safety and Reliability Directorate at Culcheth, Cheshire, is
the focal point of the UKAEA’s work in relation to the safety of nuclear
reactors and related plants and processes.
Co-operation in nuclear energy between Britain and other countries takes
place within a framework of intergovernmental agreements and membership
of bodies such as the International Atomic Energy Agency (which operates
under the aegis of the United Nations) and the Nuclear Energy Agency of the
OECD, and through direct research links between the UKAEA and counter¬
part organisations in other countries.
Britain became a full member of the European Atomic Energy Community
(Euratom) in 1973, under the Treaty of Accession by which it agreed to accept
the Treaty of Rome of 1957, and takes part in co-operative research programmes
including that concerned with establishing the feasibility of achieving con¬
trolled thermonuclear fusion.
The Department of the Environment1 is concerned with research and develop¬
ment for a whole range of functions which affect the environment (see p. 45)-
The department’s research programme is the responsibility of the Director

requirements are formulated. External advice on research programmes is '
received by the department from the Planning and Transport Research
Advisory Council, the Construction and Housing Research Advisory Council
and a special sub-committee of the Royal Commission on Environmental
Pollution.
About half the department’s programme is carried out at the Building
Research Establishment (see p. 234), the Transport and Road Research
Laboratory (see p. 290), and the Hydraulics Research Station whose function
is to predict the performance of hydraulic civil engineering works and also
their effects on the environment. The other half is the subject of contracts
placed with a wide range of organisations, either by the research establish¬
ments, or by the department’s headquarters.
The department gives grants-in-aid to a number of research organisations
which include: the Centre for Environmental Studies (see p. 163); the
Operational Research Unit of the Royal Institute of Public Administration;
and the Retail Planning Institute. The Construction Industry Research and
Information Association, the Building Services Research and Information
Association, the Timber Research and Development Association and the
Water Research Centre receive grants to support their co-operative research
and related activities. The Royal Society receives a grant to meet costs it incurs
as British representative on the International Institute of Applied Systems
Analysis.
The Nature Conservancy Council (see p. 167), funded by the Secretary of
State for the Environment, may give grants to anyone (including voluntary
bodies) to carry out research projects relevant to its functions. The council
also commissions research mainly from the Institute of Terrestrial Ecology,
a component body of the Natural Environment Research Council (see p.
372). The council also carries out certain research.
The Department of Industry (see also p. 47) is responsible for the sponsorship
of manufacturing industries and for technical services to industry, and for six
Government laboratories. Of these, the National Physical Laboratory has 1
responsibilities for the national system of measurement, for technical aspects
of standards (including the British Calibration Service) and for research in
computing, numerical analysis, chemical standards and materials applications.
The National Engineering Laboratory carries out research in mechanical
engineering aimed at helping industry improve designs and production pro¬
cesses by the application of improved technology. The Warren Spring Labora¬
tory undertakes research in catalysis, control engineering, materials handling,
metals extraction, mineral processing, waste materials processing and environ¬
mental technology. The National Maritime Institute has special facilities and
expertise relating to the characteristics and performance of ships and offshore
structures, marine traffic and navigation safety, wind and water forces on struc¬
tures and in conducting marine trials and measurements at sea. The Computer
Aided Design Centre is concerned with increasing and optimising the use of
computer aided design by industry. The Laboratory of the Government
Chemist offers analytical services and scientific advice to all government
departments. All these laboratories undertake contract research for British
industry and overseas firms.
The department sponsors research by extra-mural contracts with industry,
universities and research associations. In accordance with the Government’s

customer-contractor principle, the department administers a number of re¬
quirements boards to determine the objectives and balance of the relevant
research and development programmes, to further the practical application of
technology and to advise on science and technology matters in their fields.
They cover ship and marine technology; mechanical engineering and machine
tools; engineering materials; computers, systems and electronics; chemicals
and minerals; metrology and standards; garment and allied industries. They
are responsible to the Secretary of State for Industry and include representa¬
tives from other departments, industry and bodies in the public sector. The
Chief Scientist’s Board covers other relevant branches of technology.
Within the total expenditure of £1,178 million on research and development
carried out within or financed by private industry in 1975-76 (see p. 369) ex¬
penditure in individual industries, including funds from government sources,
was as follows (in £ million): aerospace 291; electronics (including computers)
251; other electrical engineering 64; petroleum products 18; other chemical
products 221; mechanical engineering 63; motor vehicles 87; scientific instru¬
ments 21; food, drink and tobacco 48; textiles 25. Firms in science-based
industries commit large private funds to research and development in the
course of business.
A number of institutes for sponsored research have been established to
extend the facilities for private research for industrial firms by studying
problems which are not within the scope of the average industrial laboratory.
A scheme by which the Government helped firms with similar interests to
form organisations known as research associations, to carry out industrial
research co-operatively, was started in 1917. Encouragement by government
grants, related to the contributions made by the industries concerned, has
lately been phased out in favour of extra-mural contract support, such as that
offered by the Department of Industry’s Requirements Boards (see above).
About 30 of these research associations operate in areas of interest to the
Department of Industry. In addition there are four (buildings services; con¬
struction industry; timber; and water) linked with the Department of the En¬
vironment and five (Flour Milling and Baking; Campden Food Preservation,
British Food Manufacturing Industries; British Industrial Biological Re¬
search ; and Processors’ and Growers’) linked with the Ministry of Agriculture,
Fisheries and Food. Among the largest of the industrial research associations
are those dealing with production engineering, ships, welding, electrical
manufacturing, cotton and man-made fibres, non-ferrous metals and motor
manufacturing. (See also Chapter 12.) The Textile Research Council serves
as a focal point for the collective interests of the various textile research
associations.
Some of the public corporations which run the nationalised industries have
their own research organisations (see Chapter 13), in particular those con¬
cerned with energy, steel and transport. These organisations also give support
to other organisations concerned with research on matters of interest to them.
The Department of Prices and Consumer Protection (see p. 50) has responsi¬
bility for standards and weights and measures, for government support for
the British Standards Institution (see p. 206) and for the Metrication Board
set up to facilitate the transition to the metric system of weights and measures
in Britain.

Agricultural research is carried out by the Agricultural Research Council (see
p. 370), the government agricultural departments and by private industry.
Fisheries research is conducted by the government fisheries departments, i
the White Fish Authority, and the Natural Environment Research Council!
Expenditure on research and development by the Ministry of Agriculture,
Fisheries and Food was estimated to be ^42'4 million in 1977-78.
Advice is given to the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food,
Agricultural Research Council, and the Department of Agriculture and
Fisheries, Scotland, on priorities for all state-aided research and development
in agriculture and food in England, Wales and Scotland, by the Joint Con¬
sultative Organisation (JCO). The JCO comprises members of the farming
and food industries, scientists, economists and members of the departments’
professional, technical and administrative services and consists of five
advisory boards concerned with animals; arable crops and forage; horti¬
culture; food science and technology; and engineering and buildings.
The Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food does both applied and basic
research. At its Central Veterinary Laboratory at Weybridge, research and
laboratory investigations are carried out into the causes, pathology, epi-
zootiology and control of diseases of farm livestock, including poultry; the
diagnosis of animal and poultry diseases (other than foot-and-mouth disease); j
and the making and supplying of certain biological products. The laboratory
is, by appointment of the World Health Organisation (WHO), the third
international laboratory for biological standards. In discharging its responsi¬
bilities in regard to plant health services the Plant Pathology Laboratory at
Harpenden, Herts, provides the scientific basis for essential legislation against
plant pests and diseases, and acts as a liaison centre for the collection and dis¬
semination of information on pests and diseases of crops and plants and on the
uses and toxic hazards of pesticides used in agriculture and horticulture. It
carries out research and development on plant health problems, and also on the
detection of pesticides residues in treated crops and crop products, and on the
formulation of pesticides. The Pest Infestation Control Laboratory at Slough,
Berkshire (with stations at Tolworth and Worplesdon, Surrey), engages in
research work on insects, mites and fungi affecting food storage and on harmful
mammals and birds. It provides the scientific basis for advisory work on their
detection and control and acts as an instruction and liaison centre for home and
some overseas work, and is concerned with the clearance of pesticides for
safety including hazards to wild life.
With the guidance of the Chief Scientific Adviser (Food), the Food Science
Division provides advice on scientific and technical aspects of food. Particular
attention is paid to the safety, quality and nutritive value of food, including
consideration of food additives and contaminants. Close liaison is maintained
with the Department of Health and Social Security, which has responsibilities
for public health, and with other government departments. The division has
a Food Science Laboratory in Norwich concerned with storage of certain
foods, interaction of food additives and food components, heavy metal con¬
tamination and studies arising from food legislation and safety. There is an
increasing demand for advice in connection with international work, including
the European Community food legislation, and also regarding the new
government policies for the support of research at the four food research
associations and elsewhere.
In Scotland research work at East Craigs, Edinburgh, by the Agricultural
Scientific Services of the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries is mainly

concerned with the problem of cultivar taxonomy, seed testing, healthy seed
potato production, plant pathology, and the ecology of birds, mammals and
insects harmful to agriculture and stored products. In Northern Ireland the
Ministry of Agriculture is responsible for promotion of research in food pro¬
duced by agriculture and in veterinary sciences with the aim of improving
efficiency of production, marketability of foods and the health of plants and
animals. The ministry is also responsible for work on forest science, ecology of
freshwater and marine fish as well as on the biology of freshwater resources.
The Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food maintains five laboratories
for marine fisheries and shellfish research, one for salmon and freshwater
fisheries research, two concerned with handling and preservation of the fish
catch and with studies of fish as food and one specialising in research into fish
diseases. There are four sea-going research ships including the newly com¬
missioned research vessel G. A. Reay and several smaller vessels for inshore
and estuarine work. The Department of Agriculture and Fisheries for Scotland
maintains a marine research laboratory and six research ships at Aberdeen,
and a freshwater fisheries research laboratory at Pitlochry.
A Fisheries Research and Development Board representative of govern¬
ment departments and the industry advises fisheries ministers on research
programmes, objectives and priorities. A Controller of Fisheries Research and
Development, responsible jointly to the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and
Food and the Secretary of State for Scotland, co-ordinates the programmes of
the research laboratories.
The Forestry Commission undertakes experimental work relating to silvi¬
cultural and allied problems (see p. 285). By means of grants, it also aids forest
research work undertaken by various universities and other institutions,
including the Commonwealth Forestry Institute, Oxford.
The Commission’s research and development activities are conducted within
a research and development division. The study of hardwood trees is empha¬
sised with the concentration of work on lowland forests, amenity and landscape
at Alice Holt Lodge near Farnham, Surrey, and the replacement of the Soils
Research Branch by two Site Studies Branches.
Under the auspices of the Forestry Commission, research is in progress into
the fungus and its beetle carrier of the disease (commonly known as ‘Dutch’
elm disease) which attacks and kills elm trees, and, on an international level,
into the possibility of breeding resistant strains of elm. Since the early 1960s
the disease has killed about 6-5 million of the 30 million English elm trees,
mainly in an area south of Chester and the Wash.
The Procurement Executive, Ministry of Defence, engages in research for
defence purposes at its research and development establishments and through
contracts placed with industry and universities (see p. 113). It also undertakes
certain research for civil purposes, including meteorology (see p. 380), civil
aviation (see p. 381), medical research and space research.
The Department of Health and Social Security spent over £26 million on
research and development in 1976-77 of which over £9 million was on bio¬
chemical research through the Medical Research Council. The department is
advised by a Chief Scientist supported by a group of independent advisers
covering a wide range of scientific disciplines.
The Department of Employment has a Research and Planning Division to
conduct and advise on its programme of research on socio-economic problems.

Assistance is given to the department in social research by the Office of
Population Censuses and Surveys and close contact is maintained with the
Social Science Research Council.
The Health and Safety Executive carries out research into matters affecting the
health and safety of people at work, such as explosion risks, fires, respiratory
apparatus, methods for monitoring and measuring airborne contaminants,
the safety of engineering systems, fluid mechanics, and the analysis of accidents.
The executive also places research contracts with outside organisations.
The Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew (founded in 1759), together with its 400-
acre estate at Wakehurst Place, Ardingly, Sussex, is administered by the
Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food and has the largest collection
of living plants in the world. The Herbarium (also the largest in the wrorld with
nearly 5 million specimens) is concerned primarily with research into the classi¬
fication and accurate determination of plants, as well as producing several
major descriptions of flora in various parts of the world. The Jodrell Laboratory !
undertakes the study of plant anatomy and plant physiology, biochemistry, j
cytology and genetics. There is also a seed bank and seed testing unit. There is
a Conservation Unit concerned with various aspects of plant conservation, and
in particular the threatened plants of the world. The Museums Division is
concerned with public exhibitions and the care of reference collections of !
economic plant products. The Library, founded in 1852, consists of more than
100,000 botanical books, about 140,000 reprints and separately issued items
and a collection of over 170,000 drawings and paintings of plants.
The Royal Botanic Garden, Edinburgh (founded in 1670), has, since 1969,
been administered by the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries for Scot¬
land. Together with the associated Logan Botanic Garden at Ardwell, near
Stranraer, and the Younger Botanic Garden at Benmore, near Dunoon, it
maintains large collections of living plants (both temperate and tropical) used
for taxonomic research (into classification of plants), including tropical plants.
The herbarium and library (the finest outside London) are used for taxonomy, 1
cytology, anatomy, mycology and other subjects. An exhibition hall was
opened on the occasion of the tercentenary of the garden in 1970. The Scottish
National Gallery of Modern Art is situated within the garden.
The Post Office, responsible to the Department of Industry, undertakes
research and development on many aspects of the science and engineering of
communications (see pp. 307-8).
Research into the effects of pollutants on the natural environment and on
methods of controlling them is spread throughout research establishments of
all kinds, sponsored by research councils and central government depart¬
ments with control responsibilities (see p. 167). The Royal Commission on
Environmental Pollution (see p. 167) advises on the adequacy of such
research.
A National Radiological Protection Board (see p. 171) carries out research,
makes public and occupational health assessments and provides services in
connection with radiological protection. The board is financed by Parliament
through the Secretary of State for Social Services; by grants from the Atomic
Energy Authority and the Medical Research Council; and by income from
services.
The Ministry of Defence finances the Meteorological Office, which is respon- ^
sible for research in meteorology and some aspects of geophysics, mainly for

civil purposes. The headquarters of the Office and most of its research
sections are at Bracknell, Berkshire. The Ministry of Defence also makes
grants for fundamental meteorological research carried out under the auspices
of the Royal Society or in university departments.
Britain’s aerospace industry (see p. 223) carries out from its own resources a
substantial programme of research and development. Supplementary govern¬
ment assistance is given by the Ministry of Defence and the Department of
Industry. Their work is, wherever possible, integrated into a single programme
managed by the Procurement Executive of the Ministry of Defence and carried
out in government establishments such as the Royal Aircraft Establishment,
the National Gas Turbine Establishment and the Royal Signals and Radar
Establishment as well as in industry, in research associations and in universi¬
ties. The work is subject to the oversight of the Aeronautical Research Council
and the Joint Research Committee, which bring together the research interests
with the aircraft manufacturing and operating industries and with eminent
academics.
Similar methods are used by the Civil Aviation Authority for research needed
to support their statutory responsibilities in aircraft operation; in this case,
advice is obtained on research and development work from the Civil Aviation
Research and Development Programme Board.
Although today most research is conducted under other auspices, the learned
societies, of which there are more than 300, have retained their traditional
function of facilitating the spread of knowledge. The most eminent of those
concerned with science in its broadest aspects (as distinct from those societies
with specialised interests and activities) are the Royal Society, Royal Society
of Arts, Royal Institution and British Association.
The Royal Society, or, more fully, the Royal Society of London for Improving
Natural Knowledge, founded in 1660, occupies a unique place in the country’s
scientific affairs and is equivalent to national academies of sciences in other
countries. It is the oldest such academy in the world to have enjoyed continuous
existence. Election to it is regarded by scientists as a high honour. The Queen
is Patron. There are today three main categories of Fellowship: Royal Fellows,
Foreign Members, of whom there are about 80, and the main body of Fellows
numbering about 850. Election to the Fellowship, which is for life, is restricted
to 40 persons a year. The Royal Society is governed by a council of 21 members.
Its activities include the holding of scientific meetings; publication of
research work, mainly in the Philosophical Transactions and the Proceedings,
the presentation of medals; the giving of endowed lectures; and the award of
research appointments and grants. Among its research appointments are the
Foulerton, Wolfson, Henry Dale and Napier Research Professorships and 14
other research professorships supported by a parliamentary grant-in-aid.
Research fellowships in human nutrition supported by the J. Sainsbury
Centenary Grant were inaugurated in 1974. The highest medal awarded is the
Copley Medal, for which scientists from all countries are eligible; there are
also three Royal Medals, and the Rumford, Davy, Darwin, Buchanan, Sylvester,
Hughes, Leverhulme and Mullard Medals, and the Esso Award for the con¬
servation of energy. There are seven lectureships: the Croonian (biology);
the Bakerian (physical sciences); the Ferrier (nervous system); the Wilkins
(history of science); the Leeuwenhoek (microbiology); the Bernal (social
functions of science); and the Clifford Paterson (established 1975 for electrical
science and technology). There are also the Rutherford Memorial, the Blackett
382

Memorial and the Isaac Newton Lectures which are given overseas. The
council has set up committees, some of them jointly with other bodies, to
promote improvements in education in science and to emphasise the importance
of applied sciences, especially engineering.
Although an independent private corporation, the society has always had
a special relationship with the Government, which makes grants for certain of
its activities. The President of the Society is consulted on scientific appoint¬
ments to research councils and Fellows serve on most governmental advisory
councils and committees concerned with research.
The international relations of the Royal Society are extensive. It represents
Britain in the international unions comprising the International Council of
Scientific Unions and appoints national committees for each of them. The
society represents Britain on the Council of the International Institute for
Applied Systems Analysis, and is a member of the European Science Foun¬
dation and certain other organisations. It also plays a leading part in inter¬
national scientific programmes and promotes exchange visits of scientists
with many academies throughout the world. Its international fellowship
scheme to foster relations with scientists of Western Europe receives financial
support from the Government and other sources.
The Royal Society of Arts (properly, the Royal Society for the Encouragement
of Arts, Manufactures and Commerce) has a character at once scientific,
artistic, technical, industrial and commercial. Since its foundation in 1754, one
of the society’s principal objects has been to promote the progress and appli¬
cation to useful ends of all departments of science. Today it fulfils this purpose
chiefly by disseminating new scientific knowledge. The society regularly holds
lectures, and publishes a monthly Journal, thus providing effective media for
the exposition and assessment by leading authorities of developments which
have a public as well as a specialist interest.
The Royal Institution was founded in 1799 as a public body for facilitating
the introduction of useful mechanical inventions and improvements, and for
teaching the application of science to everyday life. Later it undertook the
‘promotion of chemical science by experiments and lectures for improving
arts and manufactures’, and ‘the diffusion and extension of useful knowledge’.
Its character, however, was largely determined by the work of Sir Humphry
Davy and Michael Faraday, who established a tradition of research. Today,
the Royal Institution has extensive research laboratories, and lectures are
given on recent developments in science and other branches of knowledge.
The British Association for the Advancement of Science was founded in 1831
to promote general interest in science and its applications. One of its chief
activities is the annual meeting, attended by many young students as well as
by eminent scientists. In addition the association plans special lectures,
exhibitions and discussions (some designed for young audiences), the publica¬
tion of pamphlets, the organisation of conferences, the appointment of study
groups and liaison with the Press and with sound and television broadcasting
services. The association has area committees and three lectureships for
young scientists (the Kelvin, the Darwin and the Lister lectureships, dealing
respectively with the physical, biological and sociological sciences) to en¬
courage scientists to make their activities known to wider audiences. The
British Association has made an important contribution to the development of
science by taking or recommending action to remove obstacles to the dis¬
covery and application of scientific knowledge.

There are numerous technical institutions and professional associations, many
of which are playing a distinguished part in promoting their own disciplines
or are interested in the education and professional well-being of their members.
The Council of Engineering Institutions, the federal body for the chartered
engineering institutions, promotes the co-ordination of the engineering
profession. The Council of Science and Technology Institutes is a federal
body with five member institutes representing biologists, chemists, mathema¬
ticians, metallurgists and physicists.
A Fellowship of Engineering, envisaged as complementary to the Royal
Society and forming an independent and authoritative forum of eminent
engineering opinion, was formed in 1976. The founder members were
Fellows of the Royal Society, together with a number of other distinguished
engineers who were selected by the chairman of the Council of Engineering
Institutions and the Presidents of the individual engineering institutions.
Further Fellows, up to a total of 1,000, but not more than 60 in one year, are
being elected by the Fellowship.
MacRobert Awards of £25,000 and a gold medal have been presented since
1969 by the Council of Engineering Institutions on behalf of MacRoberts
Trusts, for successful technological innovations contributing to the national
prestige and prosperity of Britain. A fund was endowed in 1972
Lord Rank to be used to reward outstanding contributions to human nutrition
and crop husbandry, and to opto-electronics and nearly related phenomena.
The first Rank prizes were announced in 1976. In giving awards for techno¬
logical innovation, the Queen’s Award to Industry scheme concentrates on
the potential application in industry of outstanding achievements in advanced
technology in the form of processes or products.
There are at least two bodies concerned with the relationship between science
and society: the British Society for Social Responsibility in Science; and the
Council for Science and Society, formed by specialists in the natural and
social sciences, the law, and medicine to support and stimulate research into
the social effects of scientific and technological development.
Zoological research is among the many activities of The Zoological Society of
London. The society also runs the world-famous London Zoo which occupies
36 acres of Regent’s Park, London, and which was opened in 1828. In 1931, the
Society opened Whipsnade Park Zoo in Bedfordshire, where hundreds of
animals roam a 500-acre park. Other well-known zoos are those at Edinburgh,
Bristol, Chester, Dudley, Chessington and Jersey (a small collection of some
of the rarest animals in the world). There are also a number of ‘safari parks’
containing reservations of wild animals through which the public can pass in
closed motor cars.
The British Museum (Natural History) is the principal centre in the Common¬
wealth for the general study of natural history, particularly for research into
classification (taxonomy); it has extensive collections of extant and fossil
animals and plants and of minerals, rocks and meteorites. The Science
Museum illustrates the development of pure and applied science in all
countries, but chiefly in Britain, which has always held a leading place in
engineering, agriculture, navigation, mining, aeronautics, and in the develop¬
ment of industrial machinery and processes. The geology of Britain is probably
known in more exact detail than that of any other country in the world, and
the Institute of Geological Sciences has an outstanding collection of exhibits

in its Geological Museum. These three museums are in South Kensington,
London. Other important collections are those of the Museum of Science and
Industry, in Birmingham, and the Museum of the History of Science, at
Oxford.
The dissemination of the results of research to other research workers and
to ultimate users has become a major problem as the volume of information
has grown. The traditional method of scientific publication, in which results
are written up into papers and published in journals or are presented at
scientific meetings, is still the main means of communication among scientists.
The leading learned societies have for long been important agencies for com¬
municating scientific information.
A description of general library services which also cater for scientific needs is
given on p. 400. Two constituents of the British Library are concerned with
science and technology—the Lending Division, and the Science Reference
Library.
The Lending Division collects for loan purposes all literature which is
likely to be of interest to the practising scientist and technologist, covering all
branches of science and technology (including agriculture and medicine) and
the social sciences.
The Science Reference Library is divided between the Holborn Division,
formerly the Patent Office Library, and the Bayswater Branch which has
substantial collections, especially in the life sciences and scientific literature
written in Slavonic and oriental languages.
The rehousing in a new London headquarters of the world’s largest library
devoted to the social sciences, the British Library of Political and Economic
Science, part of the London School of Economics, is planned for completion
by the end of the present decade.
Aslib, representing special libraries and information units in industry,
government departments, universities, colleges and other institutions, carries
out research into the collection, utilisation and dissemination of information,
provides consultancy and advisory services and training courses and offers
members an inquiry and reference service covering all subjects.
The Department of Industry and the AEA devote considerable sums to
advisory and information services. The former has nine regional offices which
make contacts with local industries to promote greater use of existing scientific
and technical knowledge. Its Technology Reports Centre is a national clearing
house for unpublished technical reports made available by various bodies in
Britain and overseas. The industrial research associations circulate research
reports and provide information services to members. Besides information
services provided by its various groups, which include the Ceramics Centre
and the Non-destructive Testing Centre at Harwell, the AEA has an informa¬
tion centre in London and a network of regional advisers on the use of
radioisotopes.
In agriculture, the Commonwealth Agricultural Institutes and Bureaux (see
p. 386) provide abstracts and an information service in various branches of
agricultural science. The ARC publishes an Index of Agricultural Research in
Progress, and gives an account of current developments in its annual reports.
The advisory services of the agricultural departments bring research results
directly to the farmer.
Medical research results are communicated mainly through journals and
periodicals; but the MRC issues special reports and includes special articles
in its annual reports.

The National Research Development Corporation (NRDC) is an independent
public corporation supported as necessary by government loans through the
Department of Industry. The NRDC’s functions are to promote the manu¬
facture by industry, under NRDC licence, of new products and processes
invented in government laboratories, universities and elsewhere, advancing
money where necessary to bring them to a commercially viable stage, and to
speed up technological advance by investing money with British industrial
firms, on a joint venture basis, for the development of their own inventions and
projects. Its borrowing power for government advances is £50 million.
Outstanding advances total ^18-8 million but the corporation is currently
funding its annual investment in research and development from its income
from licences and levies. Projects so far sponsored include the Cephalosporin C
antibiotic, hovercraft, computers, advanced types of electric motor, diving and
other oceanological equipment, packaging equipment, insecticides, micro¬
electronics and plastics.
Britain is represented on the Scientific and Technical Research Committee
(CREST) of the European Economic Community, the object of which is to
co-ordinate national policies on these matters and to implement joint projects
of interest to the Community. Other intergovernmental organisations involved
in scientific co-operation with which Britain is concerned include: European
Co-operation in Science and Technology (COST); specialised agencies of the
United Nations such as the United Nations Educational, Scientific and
Cultural Organisation (UNESCO), the World Health Organisation (WHO),
the Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO), the International Atomic
Energy Agency (IAEA), the Committee for Scientific and Technology Policy,
the Nuclear Energy Agency (NEA) and the International Energy Agency (IEA)
of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD);
the European Organisation for Nuclear Research (CERN); the European
Space Agency (ESA); the European Molecular Biology Conference (EMBC);
the European Molecular Biology Laboratory (EMBL); the International
Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) and the North Atlantic Treaty Orga¬
nisation (NATO) Science Committee. Among non-governmental organisa¬
tions Britain is represented in the international unions comprising the Inter¬
national Council of Scientific Unions (see p. 382). The five research councils,
the Royal Society and the British Academy became founding members of the
European Science Foundation (ESF) set up in 1974. In nuclear energy Britain
also co-operates within the framework of international agreements; through
direct links between the AEA and its counterparts; and through joint com¬
panies in, for example, nuclear fuel and radioisotope manufacture.
There are scientific counsellors in the British Embassies in France, the
Federal Republic of Germany, Japan, the United States, and the Soviet
Union who among other things promote contacts in science and technology
between Britain and the countries to which they are accredited. These coun¬
sellors serve all central government departments concerned in overseas
scientific affairs, as well as the research councils and the Royal Society, which
is the main representative of Britain in areas of non-governmental collabora¬
tion. Administrative support for the counsellors is provided in Britain by the
Department of Industry’s Overseas Technical Information Unit.
The Ministry of Overseas Development promotes scientific activities in the
interests of developing countries. These include research covering a wide
range of disciplines, specialist advice from Britain, advisory visits, conferences
for exchange of information, training scientists from overseas in universities

and research institutions in Britain, recruiting scientific staff from Britain, and
providing support for existing research services and research projects overseas.
Equipment is sometimes provided for research purposes and to encourage
scientific training. There are three organisations forming part of the ministry,
which are wholly engaged on scientific work to assist developing countries.
They are the Tropical Products Institute, which specialises in the post¬
harvest aspects of agricultural, fish and animal products; the Centre for
Overseas Pest Research, which is concerned with the development and
application of pest control techniques relevant to tropical agriculture; and
the Land Resources Division, which is concerned with all aspects of land
resource appraisal. The ministry also supports the International Agricultural
Research Centres under the aegis of the Consultative Group for International
Agricultural Research. The ministry provides over £16 million a year for
scientific activities including research for the benefit of developing countries.
The Commonwealth Science Council (CSC) consists of administrators and
scientists nominated by the Governments of Commonwealth member countries
and has been brought into close association with the Commonwealth Secre¬
tariat. The council concentrates on the organisation of collaborative projects in
science and technology to be undertaken by member countries. An executive
committee of members from various geographical groups which make up
membership of CSC reviews the progress of the programme of its activities
between the organisation’s plenary meetings which take place every two years.
The Commonwealth Agricultural Bureaux, financed by contributions from
the governments of 25 Commonwealth countries comprise four institutes and
ten bureaux, all of which except one institute are in Britain and each of which
is concerned with a particular branch of agricultural science. They act as
clearing houses for the interchange of information of value to research and
other workers in agricultural science throughout the Commonwealth and
increasingly throughout the world.
Three of the institutes undertake taxonomic services for all countries of the
Commonwealth and many countries outside it.
The principal aims of the British Council (see p. 153) in the sciences (including
agriculture, medicine and technology) are to foster co-operation between
British scientists and scientists of other countries, to promote among overseas
specialists a better understanding and knowledge of Britain and its scientific
achievements, and, in the developing countries, to assist in curriculum reform
at school level and in the training of teachers of science and mathematics.
Overseas, 70 staff with science or science teaching qualifications assist in
scientific and educational development and in scientific collaboration. Empha¬
sis is placed on facilitating the interchange of scientists and teachers and on the
provision of library and information services related to advances in science and
science education in Britain. Overseas tours are arranged for British specialists
to advise, run courses or discuss matters of common interest, and scientists
are recruited or seconded to posts in overseas universities, teacher-training
colleges, education authorities, schools or curriculum reform centres. The
council invites senior overseas specialists to Britain, and makes awards to
postgraduate students; it also administers the programmes of a large number
of senior specialists and students who travel to Britain under the auspices of
the UN specialised agencies, or under various bilateral technical assistance
schemes, or as private individuals. The council is responsible for administer¬
ing grants awarded under the Academic Interchange with Europe Scheme,
SPACE

PROMOTION OF THE SCIENCES 3^7
the European Academic Links Scheme, the Younger Research Workers
Interchange Scheme and the Commonwealth University Interchange Scheme.
In Britain, advisory and information facilities are provided by specialist
departments (and libraries) for education, medicine and science including
science education.
Government responsibility for space activities is undertaken by the Secretary
of State for Education and Science, the Secretary of State for Defence and the
Secretary of State for Industry, according to the nature of the project, while
the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs is concerned
with international aspects. Expenditure on space activities in 1976 was about
£36 million.
The United Kingdom is a member of the European Space Agency (ESA)
together with Belgium, Denmark, France, Federal Republic of Germany,
Italy, the Netherlands, Spain, Sweden and Switzerland; the Irish Republic,
Austria, Norway and Canada have observer status. The United Kingdom
actively participates in the agency’s science programme in its four applications
development satellites and in Spacelab—a manned laboratory (for general
communication; meteorology; air and maritime communications). Among its
main responsibilities is the fostering of a single co-ordinated European space
programme with a corresponding decrease in purely national activity.
Scientific research, notably in astronomy and geophysics, using space tech¬
niques, is supported by the SRC (see p. 372). Through the programmes of the
European Space Agency, the Commonwealth Collaborative Space programme
and through bilateral arrangements with other countries Britain is co-operating
with the United States in a programme which includes American launching of
the British Ariel series of scientific satellites, the incorporation of British ex¬
periments in American satellites, the analyses of lunar surface samples and re¬
ception of signals from the US Viking mission to Mars. The Appleton
Laboratory provides support and services for the universities’ space-based
experiments and also operates the United States National Aeronautics
and Space Administration (NASA) Spaceflight Tracking and Data Network
(STDN) station at Winkfield. Optical tracking of satellites is undertaken by
many individual observers in Britain; the prediction and co-ordination centre
is at the Appleton Laboratory, which is also the home of one of the three
World Data Centres for space research. The Space Department of the
Royal Aircraft Establishment at Farnborough also undertakes long-term
research and development intended to assist industry.
The Royal Society represents Britain in non-governmental international
scientific groups such as the Committee on Space Research (COSPAR) of the
International Council of Scientific Unions (ICSU).
The Department of Industry is responsible for leading the British delegation
to the European Space Agency and for industrial sponsorship of Britain’s
space industry. It participates in a joint departmental industry technology
programme designed to improve the United Kingdom’s industrial capability
in space applications systems; the programme is supervised on behalf of the
department by the Procurement Executive of the Ministry of Defence. The
Space Department of the Royal Aircraft Establishment at Farnborough also
undertakes long-term research and development to assist industry.
The Department of Industry, through the Post Office, is responsible for
the use of satellites for civil communications purposes and undertakes research
work in connection with communications systems using satellites, including
those of Intelsat.
20 The Arts
Arts Councils
There is a wealth of artistic and cultural activity in Britain, ranging from the
highest standards of professional performance to the enthusiastic support and
participation of amateurs. London is one of the leading world centres for
music, drama, opera and dance; and festivals held in Bath, Cheltenham,
Edinburgh and other centres are also well known. Many British playwrights,
composers, sculptors, painters, writers, actors, actresses, singers, choreo¬
graphers and dancers enjoy international reputations. At an amateur level,
activities take many forms, of which a common characteristic is the use of
local talent, resources and themes. Amateur choral, orchestral, operatic,
dramatic and other societies for the arts abound; and increasing numbers of
people take an interest in crafts such as pottery, weaving and woodwork.
Promotion and patronage of the arts are the concern of both official and
unofficial bodies. The Government and local authorities take an active part,
and an increasing amount of help also comes from private sources, including
trusts and commercial concerns. Policies towards support for the arts are
broadly similar, however, and there are two main aims. One is to maintain
and improve the traditional arts and cultural heritage, and to make them
more accessible to greater numbers of people. The other is to provide financial
aid to working artists and craftsmen, and to encourage more ordinary men
and women to take part in creative leisure pursuits.
Ministerial responsibility for general arts policy is borne by a Minister of
State at the Department of Education and Science; the Secretaries of State
for Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland are also concerned with cultural
matters. In addition, the Government is responsible through the Department
of the Environment and the Scottish, Welsh and Northern Ireland Offices for
the upkeep of ancient monuments and historic buildings, and grants are made
towards the maintenance of privately owned historic buildings.
The main educational functions concerning the arts are carried out through
the central Government education departments. They are concerned, in
partnership with local education authorities and voluntary bodies, with arts
education in schools, further education colleges, polytechnics, evening
institutes and community centres, and with the public library service.
Estimated government expenditure on the arts in Great Britain is £98
million in 1977-78. Direct allocations include £41-7 million for the Arts Council
of Great Britain, about ^30 million for museums and galleries and some
^19 million for the maintenance of historic buildings and ancient monuments
in the care of government departments. The Government also finances the
British Library (see p. 400), the National Library of Scotland and the National
Library of Wales.
Most government support for the arts takes the form of grants to independent
agencies. The most important of these is the Arts Council of Great Britain,
established by Royal Charter in 1946, whose main objects are to develop
and improve the knowledge, understanding and practice of the arts, to
increase their accessibility to the public, and to advise and co-operate with
government departments, local authorities and other organisations. The council
gives financial help and advice to over 1,200 organisations, from the major
opera, dance and drama companies, orchestras and festivals, to the smallest

touring theatres and experimental groups. It encourages such diverse interests
as contemporary dance, photography and art films, and helps professional
creative writers, choreographers, composers, artists and photographers by
means of bursary and award schemes. It promotes art exhibitions and tours
of opera, dance and drama companies. Funds are provided for specialist
training courses in the arts and the council also assists projects for the con¬
struction of new buildings or improvements to existing theatres, concert halls
and other arts buildings under its ‘Housing the Arts’ scheme.
Members of the council are appointed by the minister responsible for the
arts. Advised by panels responsible for different aspects of the arts, the council
itself allocates subsidies to the main professional arts promoting organisations.
Organisations in Scotland and Wales receive their subsidies from the Scottish
and Welsh Arts Councils which are committees of the Arts Council of
Great Britain having a large measure of autonomy. A growing proportion of
the council’s funds is channelled to regional arts associations, which are
independent bodies set up to develop the arts in the regions.
In Northern Ireland there is an independent Arts Council with similar
aims and functions to those of the Arts Council of Great Britain. It receives
an annual grant from the Northern Ireland Department of Education.
British Council The Government promotes knowledge of English literature and culture over¬
seas mainly through the British Council (see p. i53)» which maintains libraries
in the countries in which it is represented. The council also sponsors overseas
tours by leading British actors, producers, theatre companies, musicians,
orchestras and opera and dance companies. It promotes exhibitions and
lectures overseas on the fine arts in Britain; organises British participation
in international exhibitions; and distributes overseas a wide range of specialised
films, many of them on the arts.
Broadcasting A major contribution to the arts (particularly music and drama) is made by the
Organisations
country’s full-time professional musicians, and each week it broadcasts
some 90 hours of serious music (both live and recorded) on its Radio 3
channel. It regularly commissions new music, particularly by British composers,
and sponsors concerts, competitions and festivals. Independent television com¬
panies make grants for the promotion of the arts in their regions, particularly
to regional arts associations, and transmit general magazine programmes on
the arts. Both the BBC and IBA broadcast a wide range of new drama together
with adaptations of novels and stage plays. They also screen a variety of feature
films incuding British and overseas productions.
Local Support Local authorities support the arts in many ways. In addition to their responsi¬
bilities for education (including specialised art education) and the public
library service, many provide and maintain local museums and art galleries. In
Great Britain the authorities have power to incur expenditure on entertainment
in all its forms (including cultural activities). Many authorities make contribu¬
tions to regional arts associations (see p. 390) and towards the expenses of
professional symphony orchestras and local theatre companies. Grants are
often made towards the capital cost of new arts buildings, especially theatres;
the Greater London Council, for example, has made a substantial contribution
towards the cost of the new National Theatre.
British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) and, to a lesser extent, by tne in¬
dependent television programme companies and the Independent Broadcasting
Authority (IBA). The BBC has orchestras employing about a third of the

Valuable support for the arts comes from many voluntary sources including
charitable trusts and foundations, and supporters’ organisations of the major
national institutions. Industrial and commercial concerns provide a certain
amount of patronage, and an Association for Business Sponsorship of the Arts
has been formed to advise interested companies. Sponsorship may take the
form of grants to regional arts associations, local arts festivals and orchestras;
and donations towards individual cultural events. Tax advantages and exemp¬
tions are available to encourage such support.
The Government encourages regional co-operation in arts patronage through
regional arts associations whose aim it is to ensure that the whole range of the
arts is more widely available to people throughout their areas. There are 15 of
these covering most of England and Wales and they channel financial assistance
to local arts organisations and offer an advisory and promotional service for all
sorts of local arts activities. They are financed by a combination of local
authority, Arts Council and private funds; local authorities and a wide range of
other interests are represented on the associations’ committees. Examples of
co-operative patronage are the orchestra boards which support symphony
and chamber orchestras and the societies formed to present some of the many
arts festivals in Britain.
Considerable interest and enthusiasm is shown for more than 200 professional
arts festivals which take place each year. Most are subsidised by a combination
of local authority, regional arts association and private funds, with Arts
Council assistance for the major ones. Some festivals concentrate particularly
on music. These include: the Three Choirs Festival which has taken place
annually for about 250 years in Gloucester, Worcester or Hereford, the
Cheltenham Festival which is largely devoted to contemporary British music,
and the Aldeburgh, Bath and Harrogate festivals. Others cater for a number
of art forms, and among the better known of these are the Edinburgh Inter¬
national Festival, the Royal National Eisteddfod of Wales, and those held in
the City of London, Brighton, Windsor and York.
There are more than 150 arts centres which provide opportunities for enjoy¬
ment and participation in the arts. The centres are supported mainly by
regional arts associations and local authorities with some help from the Arts
Council and other organisations. They may be small centres for amateur
activities or they may offer a professional programme. A growing number of
theatres and art galleries also provide a focal point for the community by
offering facilities for other arts.
Britain is one of the world’s major theatre centres. In London during the
summer season, theatres are packed with overseas visitors, while in the
provinces there is growing support for the work of regional theatres. From
what was once called the ‘fringe’ theatre, and was based on London, a net¬
work of informal touring companies has developed, which visit many of the
new arts centres and community festivals.
Support for much of this development in British drama comes jointly from
the Government, through the Arts Councils of Great Britain and Northern
Ireland, from local authorities and regional arts associations, and from some
private sponsorship. In particular the Arts Council assists developments in
new drama by encouraging co-operation between theatres and playwrights by
means of bursaries, commissions and guaranteed royalties. Schemes are also
in operation to train stage designers, directors, technicians, actors and actresses
and those wishing to take up theatre administration.

There are over 250 theatres in professional use in Britain that can accommo¬
date more than 200 people. Some are owned or rented by non-profit-distribut¬
ing companies, the majority of which are receiving Arts Council subsidies,
while the remainder are operated commercially or are owned by local
authorities.
The centre of theatrical activity is in London where there are some 4°
principal theatres in or near the West End and another eight in the suburbs.
Most of the theatres are let to producing managements on a commercial basis
but four are occupied by major subsidised companies, including the National
Theatre and Royal Shakespeare companies. The former, in its new building
on the south bank of the Thames, stages classical and modern plays from all
countries; the latter presents Shakespearean plays in Stratford-upon-Avon
and a mixed repertoire in London.
Outside London there are a number of theatres which accommodate pre-
and post-West End tours of the major London productions and performances
by companies specially formed for touring. (Both the National Theatre and
Roval Shakespeare companies have toured in Britain and overseas.) A decline
in the number of these theatres has been stemmed in response to the demand
by audiences outside London for the larger opera, ballet and drama companies.
Some theatres have been purchased by local authorities. Many non-repertory
theatres outside London present all kinds of drama and many also put on
variety shows and other entertainments. There has, however, been a growth
in the activities of over 60 repertory companies which receive financial support
from the Arts Council and the local authorities. The repertory companies
employ many leading producers, designers and actors, and standards are high.
Some companies have their own theatres, while others rent from local
authorities. Some 25 new repertory theatres have been built in the past 20
years.
All plays produced in Great Britain are subject to the provisions of the
Theatres Act 1968. There is no censorship, but the Act makes it a criminal
offence to present or direct an obscene performance of a play in public or in
private (including theatre clubs), an obscene performance being defined as one
which tends to ‘deprave and corrupt persons who are likely ... to attend it.
Provision is made in the Act for a defence against a charge of obscenity on the
grounds that the performance is for the public good in the interests of, for
example, drama, opera or literature.
There are several thousand amateur dramatic societies in Britain; they are
encouraged by local education authorities, by other public bodies, and by four
special organisations—the British Theatre Association, the National Drama
Conference, the Scottish Community Drama Association and the Association
of Ulster Drama Festivals. Most universities have active amateur drama clubs
and societies; an International Festival of University Theatre is held annually.
Training for the theatre is provided mainly in drama schools. Among the most
important are the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art, the Central School of
Speech and Drama, the London Academy of Music and Dramatic Art, and the
Guildhall School of Music and Drama, all of which are in London; and the Old
Vic School in Bristol. There is the Royal Scottish Academy of Music and
Drama in Glasgow; and in Cardiff, the Welsh College of Music and Drama.
Nine universities offer major courses in drama.
Theatre for young people has increasing importance and annual audience
attendances are estimated at about 3 million. In 1970 the Young Vic was

opened as a theatre for young people and the National Youth Theatre has a
base in London. There are some ten specialist companies, including the
Unicorn Theatre for Young People, Theatre Centre and the Polka Company,
some of which are supported by the Arts Council. Outside London about 25
repertory companies provide programmes and engage in other types of
theatre activity for young people. In Northern Ireland a company called
Interplay Theatre, which is sponsored and administered by the Arts Council
of Northern Ireland, works mainly in schools.
In addition it is estimated that there are some 200 amateur youth theatres in
Britain, most of which are supported by local authorities. Many schools and
youth clubs put on plays and provide some education in drama. The London
education service provides special drama centres for young people.
Music plays an important role in British cultural life. Pop music, folk music,
jazz, light music and brass bands all have substantial followings while the
widespread interest in classical music is reflected in the large audiences at
choral and orchestral concerts and at performances of opera, ballet and
chamber music.
The Arts Councils provide subsidies for orchestras, opera and dance
companies, music societies and festivals. They also provide bursaries and
commissions for composers, musicians, designers and choreographers. The
title Master of the Queen’s (or King’s) Music is an office within the Royal
Household.
Seasons of orchestral concerts are promoted every year in many of the large
towns and cities. In central London the principal concert halls are the Royal
Festival Hall, adjacent to which are the Queen Elizabeth Hall and the Purcell
Room which accommodate smaller-scale performances; the Royal Albert
Hall, where the annual summer season of Promenade Concerts is given; the
YVigmore Hall, a recital centre; and St. John’s Church, Smith Square.
The leading symphony orchestras are the London Philharmonic, the London
Symphony, the Philharmonia, the Royal Philharmonic, the Royal Liverpool
Philharmonic, the Halle (Manchester), the City of Birmingham Symphony,
the Bournemouth Symphony, the Ulster Orchestra and the Scottish National.
The BBC runs a number of orchestras, including four symphony orchestras,
providing broadcast concerts which are often open to the public. There are also
specialised string and chamber orchestras such as the English Chamber
Orchestra, the Academy of St. Martin-in-the-Fields, the London Mozart
Players, the Philomusica of London, the Bournemouth Sinfonietta, the
Northern Sinfonia (Newcastle upon Tyne) and the Scottish Philharmonic.
Most orchestras (other than those of the BBC) receive financial aid from the
Arts Councils, local authorities and industrial sources.
Among the principal choral societies are the Bach Choir, the Swansea
Philharmonic Choir, the Edinburgh Royal Choral Union and the Belfast
Philharmonic Society, Almost all the leading orchestras have their own
choirs, but they also combine with others in major choral works. The majority
of choral societies are affiliated to the National Federation of Music Societies.
Interest in amateur music-making is encouraged by the work of County
Music Committees (some of which are voluntary and some sub-committees of
local education authorities), which are aided by the Carnegie United Kingdom
Trust and united in the Standing Conference for Amateur Music. The

National Federation of Music Societies, the organisation for chamber music

which advises them on concert planning and promotion. The Welsh Amateur
Music Federation, funded by the Welsh Arts Council, assists amateur music-
making activities in Wales.
Regular seasons of opera and ballet are given at the Royal Opera House,
Covent Garden, London, which receives financial assistance from the Arts
Council and from private and business sponsorship. The Royal Opera House
has a permanent orchestra which plays for the Royal Opera and the Royal
Ballet. Both companies have a high international reputation and make overseas
tours. Seasons of opera and operetta in English are given by the English
National Opera which plays in the London Coliseum, and makes provincial
tours. Its former home, Sadler’s Wells Theatre, provides a London stage for
visiting opera and dance companies from the provinces and from abroad.
At Glyndebourne, in Sussex, an opera season, for which an international cast is
specially assembled, is held every summer. Other opera companies include the
English Music Theatre Company which specialises in the performance of
works by British composers, the New Opera Company which is associated
with the English National Opera, Scottish Opera and the Welsh National
Opera Company. Opera in Northern Ireland is promoted by the Northern
Ireland Opera Trust and the Studio Opera Group.
Britain’s dance companies also include the London Festival Ballet, the Ballet
Rambert (Britain’s oldest ballet company, which since 1966 has also become a
leading modern dance company), Scottish Ballet, the London Contemporary
Dance Theatre (which provides regular seasons of contemporary dance in
London besides touring extensively) and the Northern Ballet Theatre (which
concentrates its activities in the north of England, although it makes periodic
tours elsewhere). The work of the Irish Ballet Company in Northern Ireland
combines traditional music, dancing and mime.
Professional training in music is given at colleges of music, of which the Royal
Academy of Music, the Royal College of Music and Trinity College of Music in
London, and the Royal Scottish Academy of Music and Drama in Glasgow are
grant-aided. Other leading colleges include the Guidhall School of Music and
Drama in London, the Royal Northern College of Music in Manchester and the
Birmingham School of Music. The London Opera Centre provides advanced
training courses for student singers. The leading dance schools are the Royal
Ballet School, the Rambert School of Ballet and the London School of
Contemporary Dance which, with many private schools, have helped in
raising British dance to its present high standard.
A Youth and Music organisation, affiliated to the international Jemesses
Musicales, encourages attendances by young people at opera, dance and
concert performances. The Royal Ballet’s work includes a small group,
Ballet for All, to give an introduction to ballet to the public and to schools.
Educational Dance Drama Theatre and Dance for Everyone receive financial
support for their work with young people.
Many children learn to play musical instruments at school; and some
250,000 candidates a year (children and other students) take the examinations
of the Associated Board of the Royal Schools of Music. The National Youth

Orchestra of Great Britain, the National Youth Orchestra of Wales and
other youth orchestras are noted for their high standard of performance.
There are about 1,560 cinemas in Great Britain and estimated attendance in
1976 amounted to 107 million. British films, actors and creative and technical
talent have received much recognition both at home and abroad, and achieve
success at international film festivals and other events. A committee has been
set up by the Government to consider the proposals contained in a report
published in 1976 which recommended the establishment of a British Film
Authority and the provision of financial assistance for the industry (see
Bibliography, p. 449).
The feature film industry is based in the London area where all the main film
studios are centred. Cinema and television films are exported to most countries
in the world.
The Government does not invest directly in films but the National Film
Finance Corporation lends money for feature film production from capital
advanced by the Government and from private interests. The corporation also
administers the National Film Development Fund which provides loans for
script-writing and other pre-production costs.
There is a levy on cinema admissions which provides a fund, administered by
the British Film Fund Agency, to benefit the makers of eligible British films.
Subject to the approval of the Department of Trade, grants from the levy can
be made to the Children’s Film Foundation, to the British Film Institute for
the production of films, to the National Film School, and to the National Film
Finance Corporation. The remainder of the fund is distributed in proportion
to a film’s takings.
Under legislation dating from 1927 a specified proportion of British films must
be shown in British cinemas each year. For main feature films the quota has
remained at 30 per cent since 1950 and for supporting programmes at 25 per
cent since 1948.
Local authorities are the only public authorities with powers to license
cinemas and censor films. They have a legal duty to prohibit the admission
of children under the age of 16 to unsuitable films, and may also exercise >
censorship in respect of films for adults. In considering the suitability of
films the authorities normally rely on the judgment of an independent body,
the British Board of Film Censors, to which most films for public showing
(other than newsreels) are submitted.
The British Board of Film Censors was set up in 1912 on the initiative of the
cinema industry, to ensure that a proper standard was maintained in the films
offered to the public. The board, Which does not use any written code of censor¬
ship, may require cuts to be made before granting a certificate to a film; very
rarely, it refuses a certificate. Films passed by the board are placed into one of
four categories: ‘U’ (for general exhibition); ‘A’ (for general exhibition but
parents are advised that the film contains material which they may not wish
children under the age of 14 years to see); ‘AA’ (for persons of not less than 14
years of age); and ‘X’ (for persons of not less than 18 years of age).
The documentary tradition in short film production in Britain goes back to 1929, 1
when a group of directors began making factual films of a distinctive and '
imaginative kind on behalf of the Government, and later for commercial i

organisations. The war years saw a big expansion in this field and, since then,
British documentary technicians have continued to produce, for both cinema
and television, high quality factual films which have won numerous inter¬
national awards. The British Industrial and Scientific Film Association
promotes the use of films in industry, science and commerce. The Federation
of Specialised Film Associations is the trade association of documentary,
short, industrial, advertising and cartoon film makers. The National Panel for
Film Festivals assists in the selection of short films for British entries to
international short film festivals.
The Government sponsors a wide range of films for use in Britain and
overseas, including documentary films, television programmes and newsreels.
They are produced through the Central Office of Information (COI), which
commissions their production by private companies.
A large number of films are sponsored by industrial concerns and other
organisations, such as the British Tourist Authority and the British Pro¬
ductivity Council. The best of these are available through the COI s Central
Film Library and other agencies. The Films of Scotland Committee promotes
the production of Scottish films covering the industries and cultural traditions
of Scotland.
Cinemas which give children’s shows require a special licence from local
authorities which may impose conditions. There are about 470 children s
cinema clubs which provide special programmes on Saturday mornings. An
important contribution to these programmes is made by the Children’s Film
Foundation, which, with the aid of grants from the British Film Fund Agency,
produces and distributes entertainment films specially designed for children.
The development of the film as an art is promoted by the British Film Institute,
founded in 1933, which is financed mainly by an Exchequer grant, and by the
Scottish Council for Educational Technology which also receives a government
grant. The institute offers financial and technical assistance both to new and
experienced film makers who cannot find support elsewhere.
The institute administers the National Film Theatre in London and the
National Film Archive and maintains a film library from which films may be
hired, a library of scripts and books on the film, a British National Film
Catalogue recording all non-fiction and short films available in Britain, and an
information service. It makes grants to the Federation of Film Societies, the
British Universities Film Council and the Society for Education in Film and
Television.
The National Film Archive contains about 25,000 films, including newsreels
and other miscellaneous items, besides art designs, posters and over 1 million
photographic stills, selected to illustrate the history and the art of the film
and as significant social and historical records.
The National Film Theatre has two cinemas showing films of outstanding
historical, artistic or technical interest. It is unique as a cinema offering
regular programmes unrestricted by commercial considerations or by the
age or nationality of the films shown. Each year it organises a London Film
Festival. The British Film Institute has promoted the development of some
50 regional film theatres on the lines of the National Film ’Theatre and may
make grants towards their costs. In Scotland the Scottish Film Council, as a
committee of the Scottish Council for Educational Technology, is responsible
for regional film theatres and administers the Scottish Central Film Library.
Grants in Northern Ireland are made by the Arts Council of Northern Ireland.

An independent National Film School offers three-year courses for writers,
directors, producers and cameramen. The school, which is financed by grants
from the Government and the British Film Fund Agency, has about 75
students. Training in film production is also given at the London International
Film School which has some 150 students, and at some polytechnics and other
institutions of further education.
A number of modern British painters and sculptors have a high international
reputation, and have received many international prizes and commissions for
major works in foreign cities. The growth of interest in the visual arts at home
has been stimulated by improved methods of display by museums and galleries,
and by the activities of many institutions, societies, and private galleries and
the growing number of local art centres.
State support for painting and sculpture mainly takes the form of maintenance
and purchase grants for the national museums and galleries, purchase grants for
municipal museums and galleries, and grants towards the cost of local education
authority art education. The Government also encourages high standards of
industrial design and craftsmanship through grants to the Design Council.
In addition to direct state assistance, the Arts Council runs the Hayward
Gallery in London, where major loan exhibitions are shown, and the Serpentine
Gallery, which mainly presents the work of young artists. The council also
maintains its own collection of contemporary British art, and organises or offers
grants or guarantees towards a variety of touring and other exhibitions. It
also supports art societies and independent galleries, and provides commis¬
sions and awards for artists. The Scottish and Welsh Arts Councils maintain
galleries in Edinburgh, Glasgow, and Cardiff respectively, and the Northern
Ireland Arts Council owns a gallery in Belfast.
London is a major centre for the international art market and regular sales of
works of art take place in the main auction houses. Certain items are covered by
export control: these are works of art and other antiques over 100 years old and
worth more than £4,000; documentary and photographic material over 70
years old; and British archaeological material over 100 years old. A licence is
required before such items can be exported but this is granted automatically in
the case of objects imported into Britain within the last 50 years. In other cases
the application for a licence is considered by the Department of Trade, and if
the department’s expert advisers recommend the withholding of a licence, the
matter is referred to the Reviewing Committee on the Export of Works of Art.
If the committee regards a work to be of national importance it can advise the
Government to withhold the export licence for a specified time to enable a
public museum or art gallery to purchase the object at a fair price.
Over 950 museums and art galleries are open to the public including the major
national collections and a wide variety of municipally and independently
owned institutions.
Of the national museums and art galleries, those in London contain between
them one of the most comprehensive collections of objects of artistic, archaeo¬
logical, scientific, historical and general interest ever to exist within one city.
They are the British Museum, the Victoria and Albert Museum, the National
Gallery, the Tate Gallery, the National Portrait Gallery, the Imperial War
Museum, the National Army Museum, the Royal Air Force Museum, the
National Maritime Museum, the Museum of London, the Wallace Collection,
the British Museum (Natural History), the Geological Museum and the
Science Museum.

There are three national museums and art galleries in Edinburgh: the
National Museum of Antiquities of Scotland, the Royal Scottish Museum
(including the Scottish United Services Museum), and the National Galleries
of Scotland (comprising the National Gallery of Scotland, the Scottish
National Portrait Gallery, and the Scottish National Gallery of Modern Art).
The National Museum of Wales, in Cardiff, has a branch at St. Fagan s Castle
where the Welsh Folk Museum is housed and has recently opened an
Industrial and Maritime Museum in Cardiff’s dockland. In Northern Ireland
there are two national museums: the Ulster Museum in Belfast and the
Ulster Folk and Transport Museum, County Down.
Some national museums have also opened branches outside the capital
cities, a recent example being the National Railway Museum at York which is
administered by the Science Museum.
Most of the national collections are administered by trustee bodies, but the
Victoria and Albert and Science Museums are the responsibility of the
Department of Education and Science, and the Royal Scottish Museum has a
similar relationship with the Scottish Education Department.
Other important collections in London include the Armouries (Tower of
London), the Public Record Office and the Sir John Soane’s Museum. In
Buckingham Palace the Queen’s Gallery has exhibitions of pictures from the
extensive royal collections.
Most cities and towns have a museum devoted to art, archaeology and
natural history, usually owned by the local authority but sometimes by a
local learned society or by individuals or trustees. Both Oxford and Cambridge
are rich in museums, many of them associated with the universities (for
example, the Ashmolean Museum in Oxford, founded in 1683, the oldest in
the country, and the Fitzwilliam Museum in Cambridge). There are important
museums and art galleries in Aberdeen, Belfast, Birmingham, Bristol, Cardiff,
Dundee, Glasgow, Leeds, Leicester, Liverpool, Manchester, Norwich,
Reading, Sheffield, Southampton and York. Many private art collections
housed in historic family mansions, including those owned by the National
Trust, are open to the public. An increasing number of open air museums
depict the regional life of an area or preserve early industrial remains (for
example, the Weald and Downland Museum in Sussex, the Ironbridge Gorge
Museum in Salop and the North of England Open Air Museum in Durham).
All national collections are financed chiefly from government funds. Besides
meeting administrative and maintenance costs, the Government provides
annual purchase grants (£3-7 million in 1977-78). It also provides special
purchase grants. Pre-eminent works of art accepted by the Government in
place of capital transfer tax are allocated to public collections.
Local museums and art galleries, which are maintained from rates or endow¬
ments, can be helped in building up their collections through the annual
government grant administered by the Victoria and Albert, Science and Royal
Scottish Museums. Financial and practical assistance is also given to museums
and galleries by trusts and voluntary bodies, including the Calouste Gulben-
kian Foundation, the National Art Collections Fund, the Contemporary Art
Society and the Association for Business Sponsorship of the Arts.
The Government is advised on policy matters by the Standing Commission
on Museums and Galleries, which also promotes co-operation between
national and provincial institutions. Eight area museum councils, grant-aided

by the Government, provide technical services and advice on conservation,
display, documentation, publicity and other matters.
The Museums Association, to which museums and art galleries and their
staffs throughout the country belong and which also has many overseas
members, is an independent organisation. It serves as a central body for the
collection of information and discussion of matters relating to museum adminis¬
tration, and as a training and examining body for professional qualifications.
Temporary exhibitions provided by the Arts Councils, the Victoria and Albert
Museum, the Science Museum, the Art Exhibitions Bureau and the area
museum councils are a regular feature of many museums. In London the
Hayward Gallery, the Tate Gallery, the British Museum, the Victoria and
Albert Museum and the Royal Academy are the main centres for loan
exhibitions; these are also held at the Whitechapel Art Gallery, the Camden
Arts Centre and the Institute of Contemporary Arts. Commercial exhibitions
of works by old masters and living artists are held in the galleries of the
London dealers.
There are a number of national art exhibiting societies, some of which,
notably the Royal Academy at Burlington House, have their own galleries in
London. The Royal Scottish Academy holds annual exhibitions in Edinburgh.
An increasing number of amateur art societies throughout Britain hold local
exhibitions and encourage local interest in the fine arts. There are also
children’s exhibitions, including the National Exhibition of Children’s Art.
Art and design education is provided in maintained colleges of art, further
education colleges and polytechnics, which are administered by local education
authorities. Other institutions offering art and design courses include univer¬
sities, the Royal Academy Schools and some private art schools. At post¬
graduate level there is the Royal College of Art which awards its own degrees.
Art is also taught at an advanced level at the four Scottish Central (Art)
Institutions administered by the Scottish Education Department.
The leading academic institutions for the study of the history of art are the
Courtauld Institute of the University of London, the Department of Classical
Art and Archaeology in University College, London, and the Warburg
Institute, also a part of London University.
Art has a place in all school curricula, and the Society for Education through
Art encourages, among other activities, the purchase by schools of original
works of art by organising an annual Pictures for Schools exhibition. Pictures
may also be borrowed from many public libraries.
Government grants for the crafts, amounting to some £770,000 in 1977-78,
are administered in England and Wales by the Crafts Advisory Committee.
Set up in 1971 to advise the minister responsible for the arts on the needs of
artist-craftsmen, the committee also promotes exhibitions of work and gives
financial assistance to enable craftsmen to be trained and to establish or
expand their businesses. Its activities include crafts associated with conserva¬
tion and renovation. Scotland receives a separate government grant which is
similarly administered by the Joint Crafts Committee.
Official responsibility towards the nation’s architecture is concerned mainly
with encouraging the best in new building and conserving the best that has
been inherited from the past (for conservation, see p. 163).
Several government departments provide advice on building and architec¬
ture to local authorities, and the Department of the Environment makes
annual awards in conjunction with the Royal Institute of British Architects

for good housing design in both the public and private sectors. Royal Fine
Arts Commissions for England and Wales and for Scotland advise the
departments, planning authorities and other public bodies on questions of
public amenity or artistic importance. .
The Royal Institute of British Architects is the leading professional
institution with a membership of over 21,000 in Britain and more than 5,000
overseas. It exercises control over standards in architectural education, and
maintains one of the largest architectural libraries in the world. The Royal
Incorporation of Architects in Scotland is allied to it and has about 2,000
professional members.
Other bodies with an interest in architecture include the Civic Trust (see
p. 172) which seeks to promote high standards in civic building and planning,
and the National Trust (see p. 171) which acquires land and buildings in order
to protect them from harmful development for the benefit of the public.
The study of literature is included in the curricula of all schools, colleges and
universities. There are free public libraries throughout the country, private
libraries and a large number of private literary societies. Book reviews are
featured in the press and on television and radio and there are numerous
periodicals concerned with literature. Recognition of outstanding literary
merit is provided by a number of awards, including the Booker, W. H. Smith
& Son, and Whitbread prizes. Awards to encourage young writers are made,
for instance, by the Somerset Maugham Trust Fund and the E. C. Gregory
Trust Fund. .
Government help is given through the Arts Councils which support
literature in a number of ways, including grants for writers, translators,
publishers, little presses and magazines. The title, Poet Laureate, is conferred
on a poet who receives a stipend as an officer of the Royal Household.
Societies for the promotion of literature include the English Association and the
Royal Society of Literature. The British Academy for the Promotion of His¬
torical, Philosophical and Philological Studies (known as the British Academy)
is the leading society of humanistic studies and receives a government grant.
Other specialist societies include the Early English Text Society, the
Bibliographical Society, the Harleian Society, the Saltire Society, and several
societies devoted to particular authors of which the largest is the Dickens
Fellowship. A number of societies sponsor poetry readings and recitals,
among which the Poetry Society and the Apollo Society are the best known.
There are also a number of clubs and societies, such as the New Fiction
Society and the Poetry Book Society, which exist to distribute selected new
books to their members.
In 1976 British publishers issued 34,434 separate titles: 26,207 new ones, and
8,227 reprints and new editions. An increasing proportion of books—including
a wide range of specialised non-fiction—is now sold in paper-back form. Book
clubs make available hard-backed books at a lower price.
Leading organisations representing the interests of those concerned with
book production and distribution are the Publishers Association and the
Booksellers’ Association. The British Council also publicises British books and
periodicals through its libraries in over 60 countries, its programme of book
exhibitions (233 exhibitions were mounted in 1976-77) and its bibliographical
publications including the monthly British Book News. The Book Development
Council promotes British books overseas. (For sales and exports of books in
1976, see p. 231). The National Book League has a membership including

authors, publishers, booksellers, librarians and readers. It encourages an
interest in books and arranges exhibitions in Britain and overseas.
The British Library, created in 1973 from a merger of the British Museum
Library with other libraries and institutions, is organised in three divisions.
The Reference Division includes the Department of Printed Books holding
nearly 10 million titles, the Department of Manuscripts, the Department of
Oriental Manuscripts and Printed Books, and the Science Reference Library.
The Lending Division at Boston Spa, West Yorkshire, has over 2-4 million
volumes including some 47,000 current periodicals available on loan to other
libraries in Britain; it also has access to many millions of books in other
libraries and is the national centre for inter-library lending within Britain and
between Britain and foreign countries. The Bibliographic Services Division
processes the acquisitions of the British Library for inclusion in its catalogues
and other bibliographic services; it publishes the British National Bibliography
which lists in a classified order (with indexes) all new books and new editions,
excluding reprints, published in Britain. The British Library automatically
receives a copy of each new book published in Britain. In addition the National
Library of Scotland, the National Library of Wales, the Bodleian Library of
Oxford University and the Cambridge University Library are entitled to
claim copies.
The Victoria and Albert Museum and the British Museum (Natural History)
in London also have large libraries and many government departments have
old-established libraries of considerable size and importance. The Public
Record Office contains the records of the superior courts of law and of most
government departments, as well as such famous historical documents as
Domesday Book. In Scotland, the Scottish Record Office serves the same pur¬
poses. The National Register of Archives (maintained by the Historical
Manuscripts Commission) contains particulars of local and private records.
Besides the few great private collections, such as those of the Signet Library,
Edinburgh, and the London Library, there are the rich resources of the learned
societies and institutions (for scientific societies and institutions, see p. 381).
Examples are the libraries of the Royal Institute of International Affairs, the
Royal Commonwealth Society, the Royal Geographical Society, the Royal
Society of Edinburgh, the British Theatre Association, the Royal Academy of
Music, the National Library for the Blind and the National Book League.
Many libraries have collections of records and musical scores for loan to
the public. The City of Westminster houses the Central Music Library
which lends to other libraries and to individuals. Another well-known collec¬
tion is the Henry Watson Music Library at the Manchester Central Library.
The ancient university libraries of Oxford and Cambridge are not matched by
any of the more recent foundations, although the combined library resources of
the colleges and institutions of the University of London total some 5-5 million
volumes, the John Rylands University Library in Manchester contains some
2 million volumes, and the university libraries of Edinburgh and Glasgow
have over one million volumes each, while Birmingham, Leeds, Liverpool and
St. Andrews each has over 750,000 volumes. Many universities have suc¬
ceeded in building up large and important research collections in special
subjects; for example, the Barnes Medical Library at Birmingham, and the
British Library of Political and Economic Science at the London School of
Economics. Other universities are also building collections as are the poly¬
technics.
The importance of good libraries is recognised at all levels of the education

system. School libraries, most of which are maintained by local education
authorities, often receive important support services from the public library
service, including loans of books.
Britain is served by a network of public libraries, administered by local
public library authorities. These libraries have a total stock of some 123
million books (not including the libraries in publicly maintained schools).
Qualified and specialist staff are available for consultation in all but the
smallest service points. About one-third of the total population are members of
public libraries. The Secretary of State for Education and Science is responsible
for the supervision of the public library service in England and in Wales, and is
advised by two library advisory councils. Public library authorities in England
and Wales have a duty to provide an efficient and (with some limitations) free
lending and reference library service of books and periodicals. They maintain
nearly 5,000 public library service points; some areas may be served by
mobile libraries, of which almost 600 are in service, and domiciliary services
exist for people who are unable to visit a library. In Scotland local authorities
have a duty to provide library facilities, and similar duties are imposed on edu¬
cation and library boards in Northern Ireland.
In addition to lending books, about half of the library authorities now lend
gramophone records of various kinds and a number also lend from collections
of works of art, either originals or reproductions. Nearly all libraries provide
children’s departments, while reference sections and art, music, commercial
and technical departments meet the growing and more specific demands in
these fields. Most libraries possess a significant collection of books and
documents on the history of their localities.
The public library is often a centre for local cultural activities. Film shows,
lectures, adult education classes, book-week exhibitions, drama groups, gramo¬
phone recitals and children’s story hours are among the many activities pro¬
vided by or based upon the local library.
A voluntary system of library co-operation in England and Wales has grown up
since the first quarter of this century. The eight regional library bureaux in
England and Wales (consisting mainly of public libraries in each area) aim to be
largely self-sufficient in the interlending of current British books, achieved in
some regions by a system of co-operative subject specialisation. The British
Library is responsible for national and international inter-library lending.
There is a number of local schemes for the exchange of specialist books,
periodicals and information. These involve industrial, commercial and some¬
times university libraries and are normally centred on a major public or
technical college library.
The National Library of Scotland and the National Library of Wales carry
out functions similar to those of the regional bureaux and the lending division
of the British Library. In Northern Ireland access to the stocks of all co¬
operating libraries is available on application to the libraries under the control
of the five education and library boards and to the Queen’s University and
New University of Ulster libraries.
The principal professional organisation is the Library Association, which has a
membership of over 24,000 including nearly 2,500 from overseas. It maintains
a Register of Chartered Librarians, publishes books, pamphlets and official
journals, and holds regular conferences. There are also associations of libraries,
for example, the Association of Special Libraries and Information Bureaux
(see p. 384) and the Standing Conference of National and University Libraries.
21 The Press
Ownership
More daily newspapers, national and regional, are sold per person in Britain
than in almost any other European country. Despite a slight long-term decline
in national newspaper sales, some papers have circulations comparable with
the largest in the world. National papers have a total circulation of about
14 million on weekdays and 20 million on Sundays, and a total readership
nearly three times greater.
The press caters for a variety of political views, interests and levels of
education. It is subject neither to state control nor to censorship.
Although pronounced views may be expressed in some newspapers and
their political leanings may be obvious, they are almost always financially
independent of any political party and are not obliged to follow any specific
party line. An exception is the Morning Star which is owned by a co-operative
society and expresses the views of the Communist Party of Great Britain. In
order to preserve their character and traditions, a few newspapers and periodi¬
cals are governed by arrangements which vest ownership of the undertaking in
trustees, or operate it in accordance with a deed of trust, or provide that the
transfer of shares be controlled by trustees. Others have management arrange¬
ments intended to ensure the authority and independence of editors.
About 130 daily (Monday to Saturday) and Sunday newspapers and over
1,000 weekly newspapers are published. These figures include certain special¬
ised papers with circulations limited not by region but by interest; for
instance business newspapers, sporting newspapers, newspapers in foreign
languages for people of other countries resident in Britain and religious
newspapers.
Newsprint forms very approximately a third of average national newspaper
costs. Three-quarters of Britain’s requirements are imported.
A Royal Commission on the Press which reported in 1977 (see Biblio¬
graphy, p. 449) recommended both measures to strengthen the monopoly
laws affecting newspapers (see below), and changes in the composition and
procedures of the Press Council (see p. 408). It was, however, against subsidies
for the press and any form of Government assistance.
Newspaper ownership, as it affects the national, London-evening and regional
daily newspapers, is concentrated mainly in the hands of a comparatively small
number of large press publishing groups (see for example, the details of the
groups controlling the national press which are given in Table 33).
Although most enterprises are organised as limited liability companies,
individual and partner proprietorship survives. The large national newspaper
and periodical publishers are major corporations with diversified interests
over the whole field of publishing and communications; some have shares in
independent television and radio contracting companies; and some are
involved in industrial and commercial activities which have no connection
with publishing or the mass media.
The law provides safeguards against the risks inherent in undue concentra¬
tion of the means of communication. For instance, if it appears that newspaper
shareholdings in television programme companies have led or are leading to
results which are contrary to the public interest, the Independent Broadcasting
Authority may, with the consent of the Home Secretary, notify the companies

that their programmes may cease to be transmitted. There is a similar stipula¬
tion for local independent radio; if a local newspaper has a monopoly in the
area, it is not allowed to have a controlling interest in the local radio station.
In addition, it is unlawful to transfer a newspaper or newspaper assets to a
newspaper proprietor whose newspapers have an average daily circulation
amounting, with that of the newspaper to be taken over, to 500,000 or more
copies unless the Secretary of State for Prices and Consumer Protection gives
written consent. Except in certain limited cases, which include transfers of
very small newspapers, consent may be given only after the Secretary of State
has referred the matter to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission and
received its report.
Nine morning daily papers and seven Sunday papers (see Table 33) circulate
throughout the country, and are known as national newspapers. All are pro¬
duced in London (where Fleet Street is the traditional centre for the press),
but five of the dailies and four of the Sundays also print northern editions in
Manchester (accounting for about a quarter of the total production of the
national press). Prices of the national newspapers vary from 6p to 15P for the
dailies and icp to zzp for the Sundays.
The leading Scottish papers, The Scotsman and the Glasgow Herald, have a
considerable circulation outside Scotland. Each of London’s two evening
papers has a distinctive style and draws its readership from a wide area around
the capital, but both have ownership affiliations with a national daily (see
Table 33).
National newspapers are often divided into ‘quality’ and ‘popular’ papers on
the basis of differences in format (broadsheet or tabloid, though this is not a
rigid distinction), style and content. Four dailies and three Sundays are usually
described as quality newspapers. The three Sunday qualities produce colour
supplements which are distributed as part of the paper.
The slight long-term decline in newspaper circulations conceals the different
experiences of individual papers and the fact that, while the circulation of the
popular press as a whole has declined fairly steadily over the years, that of the
quality press has generally increased.
The regional newspapers of England (outside London, 78 morning or evening
dailies and Sundays and some 700 newspapers appearing once or twice a week)
provide mainly regional and local news. The daily newspapers also give
coverage to national affairs, and a number co-operate to provide their own
foreign news service. The leading regional newspapers have wide regional
circulations; a few have nation-wide reputations.
Generally speaking, regional evening newspapers are non-political, while
the morning newspapers adopt a more positive political stance and tend to be
independent or conservative in outlook.
The total circulation of the regional morning and evening papers is esti¬
mated at over 6 million. Of the morning papers the Yorkshire Post (Leeds)
and the Northern Echo (Darlington) have circulations of over 100,000 and
two provincial Sunday papers—the Sunday Sun (Newcastle upon Tyne) and
the Sunday Mercury (Birmingham)—have circulations of over 150,000.
Individual circulation figures of regional evening papers start at about 18,000;
most are in the 30,000-100,000 range, although the Manchester Evening News
and the Birmingham Evening Mail have circulations of over 300,000. Weekly
papers are mainly of local appeal; they are also a valuable medium for local
advertising. Most have circulations in the 5,000-40,000 range.

A number of evening newspapers, using the latest production technology,
are published in the outer metropolitan area on the fringe of the circulation
areas of the two London evening newspapers.
Wales has one daily morning newspaper, the Western Mail, published in
Cardiff; its circulation of 97,000 is mainly in south Wales. In north Wales the
Liverpool Daily Post gives wide coverage to events in the area. Evening papers
published in Wales are the South Wales Echo, Cardiff; the South Wales Argus,
Newport; the South Wales Evening Post, Swansea; and the Evening Leader,
Wrexham. Their circulation range is between 19,000 and 123,000. North Wales
is also served by the Liverpool Echo, the Shropshire Star covers parts of mid
and north Wales and there is coverage to a smaller extent by the Manchester
Evening News.
The weekly press (over 70 papers) includes English language papers, some
of which carry articles in Welsh, bilingual papers, and Welsh language papers.
Scotland has six morning, six evening and three Sunday newspapers. The
morning papers, with circulations of between 89,000 and 690,000, are The
Scotsman published in Edinburgh; the Glasgow Herald', the Daily Record
(sister paper to the national Daily Mirror)', the Dundee Courier and Adver¬
tiser', the Aberdeen Press and Journal', and the Scottish Daily Express (pub¬
lished in Manchester). The evening papers have circulations in the range of
16,000 to 212,000 and are the Evening News of Edinburgh, Glasgow’s
Evening Times, Dundee’s Evening Telegraph and Post, Aberdeen’s Evening
Express, the Paisley Daily Express and the Greenock Telegraph. The Sunday
papers are the Sunday Mail, the Sunday Post and the Scottish Sunday
Express.
Weekly and local newspapers published in Scotland number about 130,
of which the Hamilton Advertiser and the Falkirk Herald have the largest
circulations.
Northern Ireland has two morning newspapers, one evening paper and one
Sunday paper, all published in Belfast with circulations ranging from 50,000to
170,000. They are The News-Letter (Unionist) and the Irish News (Nationalist),
the evening Belfast Telegraph and the Sunday News.
There are 42 weekly newspapers.
The 4,300 periodical publications are classified as ‘general’, ‘specialised’,
‘trade’, ‘technical’ and ‘professional’. There are also about 635 ‘house maga¬
zines’ produced by industrial undertakings, business houses or public services
for the benefit of their employees and/or clients. The ‘alternative’ press
probably includes a further 500 titles, most of which are devoted to radical
politics, religion, the occult, science or ecology.
General and specialised periodicals include magazines of general interest;
women’s magazines; publications for children; religious periodicals for all
denominations; fiction magazines; magazines dealing with sport, gardening,
hobbies and humour; journals specialising in various subjects such as politics,
finance and economics, science, agriculture, medicine and the arts; and the
publications of learned societies, trade unions, regiments, universities and
other organisations.
The weekly periodicals with the highest sales are: Radio Times', TV Times',
Woman's Weekly, Woman’s Own\ Woman-, Weekend', and Woman’s Realm.
The leading journals of opinion are The Economist, a politically independent
publication covering topics from a wider angle than its title implies; the New
406
BRITAIN 1978: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Statesman, which is a review of politics, literature and the arts with an inde¬
pendent socialist political tendency; the Spectator, which covers much the
same subjects from an independent conservative standpoint; Tribune, which
represents the views of the left-wing of the Labour Party; New Society,
covering the sociological aspects of current affairs; and New Scientist, which
reports on science and technology in terms which the non-specialist can
understand. Punch, traditionally the leading humourous periodical and
Private Eye, a satirical fortnightly, also devote attention to public affairs.
Literary and political journals and those specialising in international and
Commonwealth affairs, published monthly or quarterly, appeal generally
speaking to the more serious type of reader.
The publication of trade, technical, business, scientific and professional
journals (covering hundreds of subjects, many of them in considerable depth)
has become one of the more important aspects of the British publishing
industry. In addition to circulating in Britain, these journals have a con¬
siderable circulation overseas and are an important medium for selling British
goods. Their publication ranges in frequency from weekly to quarterly.
Periodicals published in England circulate throughout Britain. In Wales
there are also several monthly and quarterly journals published in both
Welsh and English; in Scotland there are three monthly illustrated periodicals,
a weekly paper devoted to farming interests, a number of literary journals
(of which the most famous is probably Blackwood’s), and numerous popular
magazines; and Northern Ireland has weekly, monthly and quarterly publica¬
tions covering farming, the linen industry, building, motoring, politics and
social work.
New Technology New techniques are continually being introduced into all the stages of news¬
paper production, but the national newspapers are generally concentrating
investment in the composing and plate-making processes. The introduction
of new technology in these departments involves computerised photocom¬
position in place of linotype machine composition, and substitutes electronic
and chemical methods of plate-making for manual. These methods allow
savings to be made with newspapers’ labour costs and have been adopted
particularly by the provincial press where composing represents a very high
proportion of total costs.
News Agencies There are three principal British news agencies: Reuters Ltd.; the Press
Association Ltd.; and the Exchange Telegraph Company Ltd.
Reuters Ltd. is a world news organisation. It has four shareholders—the
Newspaper Publishers Association, the Press Association, the Australian
Associated Press and the New Zealand Press Association, which are parties
to a trust agreement to safeguard the independence and integrity of the news
service. Founded in Aachen in 1850 and transferred to London in 1851,
Reuters now has about 1,150 correspondents in 183 countries and territories,
and links with 120 national or private news agencies, which give it access to
coverage by many thousands of local reporters. Some 700,000 words of
general news, sports, and economic reports are received in London every day
and are retransmitted to 154 countries and territories over a global network
of leased teleprinter lines, satellite links and cable and radio circuits. These
news services are specially tailored to the needs of recipients in Britain and
overseas, and are distributed to information media, either direct or through
national news agencies. Reuters Economic Services, one of the world’s
largest financial and business news services, supplies information to business

houses throughout the world by means of computer-based video display
units, teleprinters and bulletins.
The Press Association Ltd., the British national news agency founded in
1868, is co-operatively owned by the principal newspapers of the United
Kingdom outside London, and of the Irish Republic. It provides newspapers,
the broadcasting organisations, Reuters (of which it is a major joint owner)
and other international agencies with a complete service of home news, includ¬
ing general and parliamentary news, legal reports, and all branches of financial,
commercial and sports news; and includes in its services to regional papers the
world news of Reuters and the Associated Press. News is teleprinted 24 hours
a day from head office in London over a network of lines leased from the
Post Office—certain items being available in teletypesetting form. Through
its photographic department the Press Association serves London and
regional newspapers with a daily picture service from home and overseas;
these are wired to the regional press. Its Special Reporting Service supplies
reports of local or special interest to daily and weekly papers and periodicals.
The Exchange Telegraph Company Ltd. (Extel), an independent news
agency founded in 1872, is a wholly owned subsidiary of The Exchange Tele¬
graphy Company (Holdings) Ltd., a public company. It supplies financial
and sporting news to newspapers and broadcasting organisations. In con¬
junction with the Press Association Ltd., racing services are also supplied
by teleprinter and telephone to subscribers in London and the provinces from
offices in all important cities and towns.
The British press and broadcasting organisations are also served by Asso¬
ciated Press Ltd., and by United Press International, which are British
subsidiaries of United States news agencies.
A number of other British, Commonwealth and foreign agencies and news
services have offices in London, and there are minor agencies in other cities,
mostly specialising in various aspects of newspaper and periodical require¬
ments. Syndication of features is not as common in Britain as in some countries,
but a few agencies specialise in this type of work.
The National Council for the Training of Journalists (NCTJ), which repre¬
sents the principal press organisations, sets and conducts examinations, and
organises short training courses for journalists.
The two methods of entry into newspaper journalism are selection for a
one-year NCTJ pre-entry course or direct recruitment by a regional or local
newspaper. Both categories of entrant take part in an apprenticeship scheme
consisting of‘on-the-job’ training, and block release courses for those who have
not attended a pre-entry course. A number of centres provide courses for
reporters. Other training facilities include a one-year postgraduate course in
journalism at the University College of South Wales in Cardiff, and courses
provided by the Newspaper Society Training Service for regional newspapers
in such subjects as circulation, advertising, industrial relations and management.
The NCTJ co-operates closely with the Printing and Publishing Industry
Training Board which is responsible for training in printing, publishing and
professional photography.
Under the Commonwealth Press Union Harry Brittain Memorial Fellow¬
ship Scheme several young Commonwealth journalists each year spend three
months working and studying in Britain. The Thomson Foundation holds
training courses for journalists from all parts of the world at its studies
centre in Cardiff, and provides consultants and tutors for courses in journalism
held overseas.

The most important organisations to which employers in the industry belong
are the Newspaper Publishers Association, whose members publish national
newspapers in London and Manchester; the Newspaper Society, which repre¬
sents the regional, local and London suburban press; the Scottish Daily
Newspaper Society, which represents the interests of daily and Sunday news¬
papers in Scotland; the Scottish Newspaper Proprietors Association, which
represents the owners of weekly newspapers in Scotland; Associated Northern
Ireland Newspapers, whose members are the proprietors of weekly news¬
papers in Northern Ireland; and the Periodical Publishers Association, whose
membership embraces the independent publishers of trade and technical
publications and general magazines.
On the journalists’ side there are the Institute of Journalists (IOJ), with
some 2,300 members, and the National Union of Journalists (NUJ), with
29,500 members. All practising journalists (including those engaged in radio,
television, public relations and freelance journalism) are eligible for member¬
ship of either. Four main printing unions are concerned with the press.
The Guild of British Newspaper Editors with about 400 members aims to
maintain the professional status and independence of editors, defend the
freedom of the press, and improve the education and training of journalists.
The British Association of Industrial Editors is the professional organisation
to which most editors of house journals belong.
The Press Council, established in 1953 and reconstituted in 1963, has a lay
chairman and 30 members. Its aims are: to preserve the established freedom
of the press; to maintain the character of the press in accordance with the
highest professional and commercial standards; to keep under review any
developments likely to restrict the supply of information of public interest and
importance; to deal with complaints about the conduct of the press or the
conduct of persons and organisations towards the press (the council’s com¬
plaints committee comprises equal numbers of press and non-press members);
to report on developments in the press which may tend towards greater con¬
centration or monopoly; to make representation on appropriate occasions to
the Government, to organs of the United Nations and to press organisations
abroad; to publish its adjudications and periodic reports recording its work,
and to review from time to time developments in the press and the factors
affecting them. The council publishes annual reports, which include statistics
of the newspaper and periodical press and a series of articles examining the
structure of the leading press groups.
The press has generally the same freedom as the individual to comment on
matters of public interest.
Apart from enactments relating directly to such matters as the registration
of newspapers for postal purposes, there are no specific press laws but certain
statutes include sections which apply to the press. These relate to such matters
as the extent of newspaper ownership in television and radio companies; the
transfer of newspaper assets; the drawing up between employers and unions
of ‘closed shop’ membership agreements1; restrictions on the reporting of
preliminary hearings of indictable offences (in England, Wales and Northern
1 In order to safeguard the interests of journalists, contributors and others involved in
writing newspaper articles, the Trade Union and Labour Relations (Amendment) Act
1976 provides for the drawing up of a charter containing practical guidance on matters
affecting the freedom of the press. Following talks within the industry the Secretary
of State for Employment is holding consultations about provisions for a charter.
The Royal Commission on the Press recommended a number of safeguards it considered
essential, together with voluntary methods for securing them.

Ireland); the right of press representatives to be admitted to meetings of local
authorities; restrictions on the publication of (a) certain details of divorce,
domestic and rape proceedings in courts of law, (b) legal proceedings involving
children, (c) advertisement and investment circulars, which are governed by
Acts dealing with the publication of false or misleading descriptions of goods
and services and with fraud, and (d) advertisements of remedies for certain
diseases, which are covered by public health legislation; agreements between
the Post Office and newspaper proprietors on telegraphic communications,
which must comply with telegraphs legislation; restrictions on certain types
of prize competition; and copyrights, which come under copyright laws.
Of particular relevance to the press are the laws on libel and contempt of
court. A newspaper may not publish comments on the conduct of judicial
proceedings which are likely to prejudice their reputation for fairness before
or during the actual proceedings nor may it publish before or during a trial
anything which might tend to influence the result. The obtaining and publica¬
tion of information from state and official sources of a confidential or security
nature is affected by the Official Secrets Acts. Newspapers are also liable to
proceedings for seditious libel and incitement to disaffection.
Legal proceedings against the press are comparatively infrequent, the
majority are libel actions brought by private individuals. In such cases, the
editor, proprietor, publisher, printer and distributor of the newspaper, as well
as the author of the article, may all be held responsible.
All British broadcasting is based on the tradition that it is a public service
accountable to the people through Parliament. Television and radio are the
responsibility of two broadcasting authorities, the British Broadcasting
Corporation (BBC) and the Independent Broadcasting Authority (IBA),
which work to broad requirements and objectives placed on them by Parlia¬
ment, but are quite independent in the day-to-day conduct of business.
The BBC operates two national television channels, four national radio
services and 20 local radio stations. It also broadcasts to countries overseas
through its External Services division. The IBA supervises the operation of a
single television channel (Independent Television, ITV) and 19 local radio
stations. The Home Secretary regulates broadcasting generally under the
Wireless Telegraphy Acts 1949 and 1967 which prohibit the sending or
receiving of wireless communications except under licence. He is answerable
to Parliament on broad policy questions, and may issue directions on a
number of technical and other matters.
Television viewing is by far the most popular leisure pastime in Britain,
and some 96 per cent of the population have television in their homes. It is
estimated that about 10 per cent of households have two or more sets. Average
viewing time per person is over 17 hours a week. Practically every home also
has a radio set, and car radios and portable sets have made radio, national and
local, one of the country’s major day-time diversions.
Households with television sets must buy a licence each year—£9 for black
and white sets, £21 for colour. Of about 18 million licences current in April
1977 approximately 10 million were for colour and 8 million for black and
white television. The revenue from licences meets most of the cost of the
BBC’s domestic services. Independent television and independent local radio
are self-supporting, with revenue drawn from the sale of advertising time.
The structure of television and radio is being discussed in the light of the
report of the Annan Committee on the future of domestic broadcasting,
published in March 1977 (see Bibliography, p. 450). Among the committee’s
main recommendations were proposals that responsibility for all local radio
should be transferred from the BBC and the IBA to a new Local Broadcasting
Authority, and that, when the national economy permitted, a fourth television
channel should be allocated to an Open Broadcasting Authority and devoted
more to minority interests than are the existing channels.
The British The constitution and finances of the BBC are governed by the Royal Charter
Broadcasting granted in 1964 (the BBC was first established by Royal Charter in 1927) and
Corporation by the Licence and Agreement of 1969. Both were extended in 1976 for a
further three years. The Corporation consists of 12 governors (including a
chairman, a vice-chairman and separate national governors for Scotland,
Wales and Northern Ireland), each appointed by the Queen on the advice of
the Government. The governors are responsible for the whole broadcasting
operation, including television and radio programmes and installations and
equipment. Committees advise them on such matters as the social effects of
television, religious broadcasting, music, agriculture, schools broadcasting,
further education, programmes for immigrants, science and engineering and
charitable appeals. There is also a programme complaints commission. The

governors appoint the chief executive officer (the Director General) with
whom they discuss major matters of policy and finance. He is chairman of the
BBC’s board of management, which also includes the managing directors for
television, radio and external broadcasting, and the directors of personnel,
finance, public affairs and engineering.
The National Broadcasting Councils for Scotland and Wales control the
policy and content of television and radio programmes intended primarily for
reception in their respective countries. Local radio councils, representative of
the local community, are appointed by the BBC to advise on the development
and operation of local radio stations.
The domestic services of the BBC are financed principally by the income
from the sale of television licences less certain deductions for collection and
other expenses. This is supplemented by profits from trading activities, in¬
cluding television programme exports, the sale of records and publications
connected with BBC programmes, the hire and sale of educational films, film
library sales and exhibitions based on programmes and other BBC activities.
Nearly three-quarters of the BBC’s expenditure on domestic services relates
to television. The BBC meets the cost of local radio stations but some local
education authorities help to make educational programmes.
The BBC’s External Services are financed by a grant determined each year
by the Government; in 1976-77 this amounted to just over £30 million.
The IBA’s constitution and finances are governed by the Independent
Broadcasting Authority Acts 1973 and 1974 and its 1973 Licence (which was
extended in 1976). It consists of a chairman, a deputy chairman and nine other
members (three of whom have responsibility for Scotland, Wales and Northern
Ireland) appointed by the Home Secretary. The IBA does not itself produce
radio or television programmes; these are provided by commercial programme
companies. The authority’s main functions are to appoint the companies, to
supervise programme arrangements, to control advertising and to build, own
and operate transmitting stations.
The IBA is advised by a General Advisory Council, by Scottish, Northern
Ireland and Welsh committees, and by committees on educational broad¬
casting, religious broadcasting, charitable appeals and advertising. A specialist
panel advises on medical and allied advertisements. A Complaints Review
Board reviews reports of complaints received and investigated by the IBA’s
staff. Local advisory committees provide advice on local radio services.
The chief executive officer of the IBA, the Director General, is supported
by a headquarters and regional office staff covering all technical and admini¬
strative services.
The IBA’s finance comes from annual rental payments made by the tele¬
vision and radio programme companies—about £15’6 million in 1975-76.
The television programme companies also pay to the IBA, for transfer to the
Government, a levy related to their profits.
Fifteen television programme companies hold contracts to provide television
programmes in the 14 independent television regions (two companies share
the contract for London, one providing programmes during the week and
the other at the weekend). The companies operate on a commercial basis,
deriving their revenue from the sale of advertising time. The financial resources,
advertising revenue and programme production of the companies vary
considerably, depending largely on the size of population in their areas.
Although newspapers can acquire an interest in programme companies there
412
BRITAIN 1978: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Television
are safeguards to prevent their shareholdings leading to results contrary to the
public interest. In certain circumstances local newspapers have a right to a
share in the control of local radio companies.
In consultation with the IBA, each company plans the content of the pro¬
grammes to be broadcast in its area. These consist partly of material produced
by the company itself, partly of that produced by the other programme com¬
panies, and partly of that purchased from elsewhere. The five largest companies
(Thames, ATV, Granada, Yorkshire and London Weekend) produce a larger
proportion of their own programmes and provide more programmes for
broadcast elsewhere on the national network than do the smaller ones. A common
news service is provided by Independent Television News Ltd., a non-profit-
making company in which all the programme companies are shareholders. The
negotiations concerning the supply, exchange and purchase of programmes and
their co-ordinated transmission through the independent television network
take place largely on the Network Planning Committee which consists of
representatives of all the programme companies and of the IBA.
Local radio is broadcast by independent stations on the same principles.
The companies providing programmes are under contract to the IBA,
operate under its control and are financed by advertising revenue. News
coverage is supplied as a common service by Independent Radio News.
When a company, on the basis of negotiations with the other companies, has
decided on a programme schedule for its area, it is required to submit this to the
IBA for approval. The IBA has wide-ranging powers to regulate the content
and quality of programmes; for example, it ensures that a ‘proper balance’ of
views is expressed and has drawn up a code on violence which includes
special precautions to be taken when children are likely to be viewing.
There are three television channels: BBC-i and ITV which broadcast on
both 405 lines very high frequency (vhf) and 625 lines ultra high frequency
(uhf), and BBC-2 which broadcasts on 625 lines uhf only. Some 99 per cent
of the population live within range of vhf, and 98 per cent within range of uhf
transmissions. A majority of people possess uhf receivers, and when most of
the old vhf-only receivers have been replaced the 405-line broadcasts of
BBC-1 and ITV will cease. A high proportion of programmes on the three
uhf services is transmitted in colour, though they can also be received in
black and white.
The Government has accepted the principle that, as soon as finance is
available to cover the necessary expenditure, a fourth television channel in
Wales should be used to increase the number of Welsh-language programmes.
Apart from a break during the war years the BBC has been providing
regular television broadcasts since 1936. All BBC-2 programmes and the
majority of those on BBC-i are broadcast on the national network. Of the
BBC’s 1975-76 television output over 42 per cent was produced in London
and more than 36 per cent elsewhere in Britain, 12 per cent comprised feature
films and series, and 9 per cent Open University programmes. Current
affairs, features, documentary, news, schools, further education, Open
University and religious programmes comprised some 45 per cent of the
total.
Through co-ordinated planning of programmes on its two services the BBC
is able to cater simultaneously for people of differing interests. While both
services cover the whole range of television output, BBC-i presents a higher
proportion of programmes of general interest, such as light entertainment,
sport, current affairs, children’s programmes and outside broadcasts, while

BBC-2 places greater emphasis on minority interests, providing a larger
element of documentaries, travel programmes, serious drama, music, pro¬
grammes on pastimes and international films.
The first regular independent television broadcasts began in London in 1955.
ITV transmissions are provided on a regional basis by the programme com¬
panies. On average every ITV company transmitted some 93 hours of tele¬
vision each week in 1976 nearly two-fifths of which comprised ‘informative’
programmes—including news, documentaries, current affairs, education and
religion. Nearly three-quarters of the programmes seen on ITV are produced
by the programme companies themselves. There are about three short
advertising intervals an hour, during and between programmes.
British television programmes have won many international awards, and the
country is one of the world’s foremost exporters of television productions.
In 1976-77 the sale of BBC programmes overseas amounted to 8,000 hours
of programming in 82 countries. Covering television, educational and film
library markets, they realised some £7 million. The export of ITV programmes
totalled nearly £13 million.
Over 14 per cent of households with television rely on cable systems for the
reception of programmes. The systems are usually used to improve reception
quality, to avoid ‘screening’ by buildings or the local topography, or because
external aerials are not allowed in some residential buildings. There are cable
networks in almost every urban area; some cover a whole town, some homes
scattered throughout an area, and others particular housing estates. Of some
2-5 million subscribers to cable networks in 1977 nearly 1-7 million subscribed
to commercial systems, 815,000 to systems operated by local authorities and
other non-commercial bodies, and nearly 75,000 to housing associations’
systems. Commercial relay operators are represented by The Cable Tele¬
vision Association of Great Britain. All operators of cable systems are licensed
by the Home Secretary and the Post Office.
In the past few years several experiments have been authorised for local
stations to distribute locally-originated material by wire to subscribers. Three
stations are still in operation. At Greenwich in London funds are provided by
the local commercial cable television company, while at Swindon they are
provided by a number of non-commercial bodies. At Milton Keynes the new
town development corporation is using public funds to provide locally-
originated programmes over the Post Office cable system. All the experiments
enable people not only to see programmes about local activities but also to
record material to express their own views.
BBC Radio’s four national channels each have a distinct character. Radio 1
provides a programme of pop music, while Radio 2 provides light music as
well as being the principal channel for the coverage of sport. Radio 3 provides
mainly classical music (much of which is in stereo) and in the evening offers,
in addition, adult education programmes and works of artistic and intellectual
interest. Radio 4 is the main speech programme, providing the principal
news and information service as well as a wide range of drama, music, talks,
entertainment and schools broadcasts.
Many radio programmes are transmitted in stereo, and a series of quadra¬
phonic broadcasts began in 1977-
Local radio is provided by 20 BBC stations in England and by 19 indepen¬
dent stations distributed throughout Britain. Local broadcasts provide a

comprehensive service of local news and information, music and other
entertainment, education, consumer advice and coverage of local events, and
offer residents a chance to air their views, often by using the phone-in
technique. The BBC stations usually transmit programmes from the national
radio network for part of the day.
Five experiments in locally-initiated sound programmes over cable
distribution systems were licensed in 1977.
The BBC broadcasts to most countries overseas (in 39 languages, including
English) for a total of some 705 hours a week. The main objectives are to give
unbiased news, to reflect British opinion and to project British life and
culture. News bulletins, current affairs programmes, political commentaries
and topical magazine programmes form the main part of the output. A full
sports service, all kinds of music, drama, and a wide range of general enter¬
tainment are also included.
The languages in which the External Services broadcast and the length of
time each language is on the air are prescribed by the Government. Apart from
this the BBC has full responsibility and it is completely independent in deter¬
mining the content of news and other programmes.
The foreign language services are divided into areas: the African, Arabic,
Eastern, Far Eastern, Latin American, French (to Europe and Africa),
Central European, South European, German and East European Services.
Broadcasts range from 45 hours a week in Arabic to 35 minutes in Maltese. The
BBC’s English by Radio and Television Service is the most extensive language
teaching undertaking in the world. English lessons are broadcast weekly by
radio with explanations in 26 other languages, and recorded lessons are supplied
to some 280 stations in 90 countries. English by Television programmes are
shown in more than 60 countries.
The BBC World Service broadcasts for 24 hours a day in English and is
supplemented at peak listening times by additional series of programmes
designed to be of special interest to Africa.
BBC news bulletins and other programmes are rebroadcast by the domestic
radio services of many countries. Rebroadcasting involves direct relays from
BBC transmissions and the use of recorded programmes supplied through the
BBC tape and disc transcription service. There are some 3,000 rebroadcasts
weekly of World Service programmes in about 50 countries. The Transcription
Service offers programmes to some no countries.
Another part of the External Services is the Monitoring Service which listens
to and reports on foreign broadcasts, supplying a daily flow of significant news
and comment from overseas to the BBC, the press, and the Government.
The BBC External Services are complemented by the radio services of the
Central Office of Information (COI) which produce a range of material for
transmission by radio stations overseas. In addition, COI television services
provide material such as documentary and magazine programmes for distri¬
bution to overseas television stations.
The BBC’s domestic television and radio services operate from over 1,000
transmitters, and its external services from some 47 transmitters in Britain and
32 overseas. Most of the circuits used to link studios and transmitters are
rented from the Post Office. For its domestic radio, the BBC uses 101 studios
in London and the regions, and for its external services 52 in London. In
addition, there are semi-automatic studios which can be operated by pro¬
gramme officials without engineering staff. Each BBC local radio station has

at least two studios. BBC television productions come from main studios at
the Television Centre in west Condon and other studios in various parts of
London, and six fully-equipped regional studio centres and eight television
studios in other towns. Outside broadcasting is covered by a number of
mobile units.
The IBA is responsible for a total of more than 350 television and sound
radio transmitting stations throughout Britain, programme links being rented
from the Post Office. Independent television programmes are produced at
18 studio centres throughout the country. These studios reflect the IBA’s
policy of encouraging regional television, and the programmes are designed
for either local broadcasting or for national transmission. All companies have
facilities for colour transmission.
The BBC avoids giving publicity to any individual firm or organised interest by
mentioning its name or branded products, except when it is necessary in order
to provide effective and informative programmes. Under the terms of its
licence and agreement it must not broadcast sponsored programmes nor,
without the consent of the Home Secretary, broadcast any matter for payment.
Advertisements are broadcast on independent television but there is no
sponsoring of programmes by advertisers. Advertisements must be clearly
distinguishable and separate from programmes, and the amount of time
given to advertising must not be so great as to detract from the value of the
programmes as a medium of information, education and entertainment. In
any one hour of broadcasting the amount of advertising time on independent
television is normally limited to seven minutes. Averaged over the day’s
programmes it must not exceed six minutes per hour. The independent local
radio stations are normally limited to up to nine minutes of advertising each
hour. The IBA has drawn up a code governing standards and practice in
advertising on television and radio and giving guidance about the types and
methods of advertisement that may not be used. Some types of advertising are
prohibited, notably those with a political or religious object or on behalf of
cigarettes or betting. Advertisements may not be inserted in certain types of
programme, for example, in broadcasts to schools.
Government publicity material designed to support non-political cam¬
paigns may be broadcast on independent radio and television. It is prepared
through the COI and is broadcast and paid for on a normal commercial basis.
The Government has no general access to radio or television. Short public
service features on safety, health and welfare schemes are also produced for
free transmission by the BBC and ITV.
Broadcasts on political issues include a daily factual and impartial account of
proceedings in Parliament, transmitted on BBC’s Radio 4 when Parliament is in
session, and there is frequent coverage of political subjects in news bulletins and
current affairs programmes on both radio and television. Ministerial and party
political broadcasts are transmitted periodically under rules agreed between
the major political parties, the BBC and the IBA. Regular radio broadcasting
of proceedings in Parliament is expected to start early in 1978.
Research into technical problems is carried out by the scientific and engineering
staffs of the BBC, the IBA, the Home Office, the Post Office, the Government,
and the radio industry. Advances by the BBC have included the electronic
conversion of monochrome and colour television pictures between the Euro¬
pean and the American systems, and the development of a sound-and-vision
system known as ‘sound-in-syncs’ which enables the television sound and
416

Relations
picture to be carried over a single 625-line vision circuit, and thus eliminates the
operational complexity and expense of a separate circuit for the sound. IBA
engineers were the first in the world to introduce a fully digital field rate stand¬
ards converter (DICE) to improve the interchange of programmes between
areas using the 525-lines system (for example, North America) and those using
the 625-lines system (for example, Europe).
Both the BBC and IBA have produced ‘teletext’ systems, known respec¬
tively as CEEFAX and ORACLE, which allow the broadcasting of written
and simple graphical information to television receivers fitted with special
adaptors. Both systems enable viewers to select a display of ‘pages’ of written
information on the television screen.
The BBC and the IBA (together with the Independent Television Companies
Association) are active members of the European Broadcasting Union (EBU),
which was established to advance international broadcasting projects. The
union manages Eurovision, is responsible for the technical and administrative
arrangements for co-ordinating the exchange of programmes over that network
and for intercontinental satellite links, and maintains a technical monitoring
station where frequency measurements and other observations on broad¬
casting stations are carried out.
The BBC belongs to the Commonwealth Broadcasting Association whose
members extend to each other such facilities as the use of studios, recording
channels, and programme contributions. The BBC also provides technical aid,
particularly in training the staff of other broadcasting organisations throughout
the world; members of the BBC’s staff are seconded for service overseas.
The BBC is a partner in Visnews, which supplies a service of world news-
film to some 134 television organisations in 94 countries and is the most widely
used newsfilm agency in the world. The BBC is also a member of the Inter¬
national Television Federation (Intertel), which produces high-quality
information programmes which are exchanged overseas. United Press Inter¬
national, Paramount Pictures and Independent Television News jointly
provide an international newsfilm service to more than 100 overseas
television organisations via the Eurovision network and by satellite.
The Government spends a considerable amount each year on broadcasting
training for overseas students and largely finances the British Council (see
p. 153), which includes in its activities training in educational television and
radio for members of broadcasting organisations overseas. Training in tele¬
vision work is also provided for overseas trainees at the Thomson Television
College in Glasgow, run by the Thomson Foundation, a charitable trust.
The BBC and the IBA participate in the work of the International Tele¬
communication Union (ITU), the United Nations specialised agency respon¬
sible for the regulation and control of all international telecommunication
services (including radio and television), for the allocation and registration of
all radio frequencies and, through its international consultative committees,
for the promotion and co-ordination of the international study of technical
problems in broadcasting. The BBC is also represented on the United King¬
dom Committee of the International Special Committee on Radio Interference.
23 Sport and Recreation
There is widespread interest in sport in Britain. Large crowds attend such
occasions as the association football ‘Cup Final’ at Wembley Stadium, the
international rugby matches at Twickenham, Murrayfield and Cardiff Arms
Park, the Wimbledon lawn tennis championships, the classic horse races,
Grand Prix motor racing and the cricket Test Matches; millions also
watch them on television. It is, however, the enthusiasm for active participa¬
tion in sport and recreation that has grown considerably in recent decades and
there is now a large variety of opportunities and facilities available. Physical
recreation (as distinct from other leisure pursuits such as reading, theatre¬
going or w’atching television) tends to be of an informal and non-competitive
nature and may include, for example, climbing, rambling, riding, boating,
angling and other water-based activities.
An important feature of British sport and recreation is its amateur element
(the people who devote time and energy to the organising, teaching and training
of individual activities). Although the Government is not directly concerned
with the organisation of sport and recreation, a Minister of State in the Depart¬
ment of the Environment has responsibility for the co-ordination of policies
and the promotion of research in the field of active recreation. The Secretaries
of State for Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland exercise similar responsi¬
bilities in their countries.
The Government’s policy is to stimulate the provision of facilities and
encourage their full use. It provides financial and other assistance through a
number of official bodies. Some of these, such as the Sports Councils (see
below) and the Countryside Commissions (see p. 165), have specific responsi¬
bilities relating to sport and recreation, and assist other public and private
bodies in the provision of facilities. Others, for example, the Forestry Com¬
mission (see p. 166), the British Waterways Board (see p. 419), the Nature
Conservancy Council (see p. 167) and the regional water authorities (see
p. 263), provide recreational amenities in addition to their main functions.
Sports Councils The main responsibility for the general development of sport in Great Britain
rests with three independent bodies—the Sports Council (for England and
for general matters affecting Britain as a whole), the Sports Council for Wales
and the Scottish Sports Council. Members of the councils are appointed by
the Government. The councils have the task, subject only to general ministerial
directives, of allocating funds made available by the Government (in 1977-78
amounting to some ^14-7 million). They award grants for sports develop¬
ment, coaching and administration to the governing bodies of sport and to
other national organisations; they make grants and loans to voluntary organisa¬
tions and local authorities to assist in the provision of sports facilities; they assist
British representatives at international sports meetings; they encourage links
with international and overseas organisations; and they administer national
sports centres. The Sports Council consults with the Central Council of Physical
Recreation, comprising members of the national governing and representative
bodies of sport and physical recreation in England. The Sports Council is
linked with nine regional councils for sport and recreation in England on
which are represented local authorities and sport and countryside interests

in each region. The Scottish Sports Council consults with the Scottish
Standing Conference of Sport which comprises representatives of the national
governing bodies of sport in Scotland; and the Sports Council for Wales
maintains, through a standing committee, a close liaison with the governing
bodies of sport in Wales.
In Northern Ireland the Department of Education provides financial
assistance to local authorities and voluntary bodies for the provision of
facilities. A Sports Council for Northern Ireland acts in an advisory capacity
and can assist voluntary clubs with the cost of equipment, coaching and
administration.
A bibliographic service about sport is provided by the National Documenta¬
tion Centre which has been set up by the Sports Council and is based at the
University of Birmingham. The council also has an information centre pro¬
viding data on a wide range of sports topics; similar services are provided
by the Sports Council for Wales and the Scottish Sports Council.
There are a number of voluntary organisations whose activities are concerned
with recreation. Some, such as the Ramblers’ Association, safeguard the
interests of particular leisure pursuits; others, such as the National Trust
(see p. 171), provide for recreation in addition to their main responsibilities.
Most, however, exist to provide recreational opportunities for young people.
A description of the youth service and an outline of the work of individual
organisations is contained in Chapter 7.
The British Olympic Association, founded in 1905, organises the participation
of British teams in the Olympic Games. The association’s committee consists
of representatives of the 26 sports in the programme of the Olympic Games
(summer and winter). It determines the size of the British team (which com¬
petes under the name of ‘Great Britain’); raises funds; makes all the arrange¬
ments for the team’s travel and comfort at the games; organises the provision
and transport of clothing and equipment; and provides a headquarters staff for
the management of the team. A total of 368 British competitors and officials
went to the 1976 Montreal Olympics.
The National Playing Fields Association aims to stimulate the provision of
playing fields, playgrounds and local recreation centres by publicity and
technical and financial assistance. Since its inception in 1925 it has distributed
over ^2‘25 million in the form of grants for such centres, and over fi million
in the form of loans. It assists about 400 schemes a year. The association gives
advice on the provision, layout and construction of sports facilities, on matters
relating to the recreational needs of children, including the handicapped, and
on the establishment of playgrounds and play leadership schemes. It is a
national charity established by royal charter and derives its funds mainly from
voluntary contributions (although it also receives a small Sports Council
grant towards administrative costs). It has branches in Scotland and Northern
Ireland and associations in nearly every English and Welsh county.
The British Sports Association for the Disabled, founded in 1961, encourages
sporting activities for the physically handicapped. The association, which
receives an annual Sports Council grant, provides advice on physical recrea¬
tion for the disabled, arranges sports meetings and encourages the provision
of facilities (including sports clubs) for disabled people. Regional and branch
committees of the association organise local and regional games throughout

the country. At Stoke Mandeville Hospital the first sports stadium in the world
designed for disabled people was opened in 1969, and annual games are
arranged there by the British Paraplegic Sports Society.
Increasing numbers of sports receive financial sponsorship from commercial
concerns. Sponsorship may take the form of financing specific events, or it
may be granted to individual sports organisations, for example, to provide
better accommodation for spectators or to encourage more people to partici¬
pate in the sport.
A Sports Aid Foundation has responsibility for raising and distributing
funds from industry, commerce and private sponsors in order to assist the
training of talented individual sportsmen and sportswomen. The foundation
makes grants on the recommendation of the governing bodies of sport. The
Sports Council also runs a sponsorship advisory service which links potential
sponsors with suitable sports.
Local authorities are the main providers of land and large-scale facilities for
community recreation and their total capital expenditure on sport and outdoor
recreation in England and Wales amounted to some ^354 milli°n in I975_7^-
In Scotland and Northern Ireland, total capital investment in sports and
recreation facilities by local authorities in i975—7^ was about j£io million and
£5 million respectively. The facilities provided include parks, playing fields,
sports halls, tennis courts, golf courses, lakes, swimming baths and sports
centres catering for a wide range of indoor and outdoor activities. The
sports councils in Great Britain can support local authority projects and in
1975-76 they made grants towards capital expenditure totalling nearly £6
million.
All publicly maintained schools are required to provide for the physical
education (for example, gymnastics, games, athletics, dancing and swim¬
ming) of their pupils. All (except those solely for infants) must have a playing
field, or the use of one, and most secondary schools have a gymnasium.
Some have other amenities such as swimming pools, sports halls and halls
designed for dance and movement. In an increasing number of areas,
physical education facilities in schools are available to the whole community
outside school hours. Sport and recreation facilities are likewise provided at
universities (some of which have departments of physical education), and a
government working party is concerned with the setting up of ‘centres of
sporting excellence’ at universities and other colleges which will enable
selected young athletes to develop their talents and provide for their educa¬
tional needs.
Opportunities for outdoor recreation in national parks, nature reserves,
forest parks and country parks are provided by public bodies (see p. 165).
Water-based activities on canals, rivers, lakes and reservoirs are increasingly
popular. The British Waterways Board, for example, maintains about 1,760
kilometres (1,100 miles) of cruising waterways for navigation, about 960 kilo¬
metres (600 miles) of other waterways and some 90 reservoirs. An Inland
Waterways Amenity Advisory Council advises the board on the use of its
waterways for pleasure purposes, and a Water Space Amenity Commission
provides advice on the recreational use of water in England generally.
In addition to the recreational facilities provided by public authorities,
many facilities are made available by local voluntary clubs. Some of these
cater for indoor recreation, but more common are those providing sports
grounds, particularly for games such as cricket, association and rugby football,
420
BRITAIN 1978: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Sports
Centres
hockey, tennis and golf. Clubs linked to industrial business firms often cater
for a wide range of activities, and in many cases make their facilities available
to members of the public. Commercial facilities, provided as profit-making
businesses, include tenpin bowling centres, ice and roller skating rinks,
squash courts, golf driving ranges and riding stables.
The policy of establishing sports centres, bringing together people of all ages
and different recreational interests, is an important part of the provision for
physical recreation.
National centres, some of which were initially financed by funds from
voluntary sources, are maintained by the sports councils and provide facili¬
ties and a wide range of courses for instructors and performers in many
recreational activities. As well as making residential courses available for
enthusiasts from all over Britain, the national sports centres are used exten¬
sively by local clubs and the community generally.
There are seven national centres in England and Wales. Combined facilities
for ranges of sports are provided at three centres: the Crystal Palace National
Sports Centre in London and the Bisham Abbey and Lilleshall National
Sports Centres in Buckinghamshire and Salop respectively. The centre at
Crystal Palace has a main stadium seating 17,000 spectators, a sports hall
seating 2,000 spectators, a swimming hall with pools meeting Olympic require¬
ments and seating 2,000, two teaching pools, ten squash courts, an indoor
cricket school, practice rooms for most indoor sports and a hostel for 132
residents. These facilities are available for international competitions as well
as for training purposes, and are supported by a grant from the Greater
London Council in addition to the Sports Council grant. The other four are
specialist centres: the Plas-y-Brenin National Centre for Mountain Activities
in north Wales, the National Sailing Centre in the Isle of Wight, the Holme
Pierrepont National Water Sports Centre in Nottinghamshire, and Harrison’s
Rocks, a small rock-climbing centre in Sussex. In addition there is a National
Sports Centre for Wales in Cardiff which is supported by local authorities,
as well as by grants from the Welsh Sports Council.
The Scottish Sports Council operates three national sports training centres:
Glenmore Lodge near Aviemore for outdoor activities, Inverclyde at Largs
for general sports activities, and a national water sports training centre in
Cumbrae Isle on the Firth of Clyde.
As well as the national sports centres, other centres (such as the Meadow-
bank Sports Centre administered by Edinburgh Council) cater for a wide
range of recreational activities and often attract more than purely local
interest. Over 300 indoor sports centres serve local rather than national
needs; more are planned, some as ‘dual’ projects on school sites. There are
also several national centres catering for specialised interests and generally
administered by the sponsoring organisations. These include the National
Equestrian Centre, run by the British Equestrian Federation, and the Stoke
Mandeville Sports Stadium for the Paralysed and Other Disabled, run by
the British Paraplegic Sports Society, which was the first sports centre of its
kind in the world.
In Northern Ireland there are five indoor sports centres provided by district
councils and a Mountain Centre at Tollymore, County Down, provided by
the Sports Council for Northern Ireland.
POPULAR SPORTS Some of the major sports in Britain are described below. Sportsmen may be
professionals (paid players) or amateurs. Some sports, for example rugby union
SPORT AND RECREATION
421
Association
Football
Athletics
The Highland
Games
Boxing
football, hockey and rowing, are entirely amateur but in others the distinction
between amateur and professional status is less strictly defined.
Probably the most popular spectator sport is association football, dating as an
organised game from the nineteenth century, and controlled by separate foot¬
ball associations in England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. In
England over 400 clubs are registered with the English Football Association
(FA) and some 37,000 clubs are affiliated to regional or district associations.
The principal games are controlled in England and Wales by the Football
League which comprises 92 professional clubs, and in Scotland by the Scottish
Football League (38 clubs); the clubs play in four divisions in England and
Wales and three in Scotland. During the season attendances at Football
League matches total about 25 million.
The annual competitions for the FA Challenge Cup, the Football League
Cup, the Scottish FA Cup and the Scottish League Cup are organised on a
knock-out basis, and the finals (four of the most important matches of the
year) are played at Wembley Stadium, London, and at Hampden Park,
Glasgow.
National teams representing England, Wales, Scotland and Northern
Ireland compete against each other annually and take part in European com¬
petitions, the World Cup competition and other international matches.
In England amateur athletics (including track, road and cross-country running,
relay racing, jumping, vaulting, hurdling, steeplechasing, throwing and race
walking) are governed, for men, by the Amateur Athletic Association and, for
women, by the Women’s Amateur Athletic Association. Scotland, Wales and
Northern Ireland have their own associations and, as in England, there are
separate women’s associations. The various organisations encourage the
development of the sport, establish uniform rules and regulations and promote
regional and national championships. Hundreds of clubs are affiliated to the
various national associations.
International athletics and the selection of British teams are the concern of
the British Amateur Athletic Board which is composed of representatives of
the national associations. British teams compete in the Olympic Games and in
other international matches, and separate teams representing England, Wales,
Scotland and Northern Ireland compete in the Commonwealth Games. The
board also administers coaching schemes.
The Highland Games, traditional gatherings of local people in the Highlands
of Scotland, at which sports (including tossing the caber, putting the weight
and throwing the hammer) and dancing and piping competitions take place,
are unique spectacles which attract large numbers of spectators from all over
the world. Among better-known Highland Games are the annual Braemar
Gathering (traditionally attended by the Royal Family), the Argyllshire and
Cowal Gatherings and the meeting at Aboyne.
Boxing as a British sport is one of the oldest, probably originating in Saxon
times. Its modern form, also adopted in many overseas countries, dates from
1865 when the Marquess of Queensberry drew up a set of rules eliminating
much of the brutality that had characterised prize fighting and making skill the
basis of the sport. Boxing is both amateur and professional.
The Amateur Boxing Association controls all amateur boxing in England
including schoolboy, club and association boxing, and boxing in the armed
services. There are separate associations in Scotland, Wales and Northern
Ireland. The associations organise various amateur boxing competitions, and
422
Cricket
Field Sports
BRITAIN 1978: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
teams from England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland take part in
international competitions.
Professional boxing is controlled by the British Boxing Board of Control,
founded in 1929. The board has strict medical regulations which provide for
an examination of boxers before and after each contest, and for an extensive
annual medical examination. In addition the board appoints inspectors,
medical officers and representatives to ensure that the regulations are observed
and to guard against over-matching and exploitation.
Amateur and professional boxing championships are decided at various
weights—11 in amateur and 10 in professional boxing.
Cricket is among the most popular of summer sports and is sometimes called
the English national game. It is known to have been played as early as the
1550s. Among the many clubs founded in the eighteenth century was the
Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) which was founded in London and which
reframed the laws of the game. Cricket in Britain is now governed by the
Cricket Council which consists of representatives of the MCC, the Test and
County Cricket Board (representing first class cricket) and the National
Cricket Association (representing club and junior cricket).
The game is played in schools, colleges and universities, and in most towns
and villages there are amateur teams which play weekly games from late April
to the end of September. In the Midlands and the north of England there is a
network of League cricket contested by teams of Saturday afternoon players
reinforced by professionals, some of whom come from overseas.
Some of the best supported games are the annual series of five-day Test
Matches played between England and a touring team from Australia, New
Zealand, India, Pakistan or the West Indies. A team representing England
tours one or more of these countries in December-March. There is also a
sponsored First Class County Championship of three-day games played
by 17 county teams who also take part in three one-day sponsored competi¬
tions—two of these are knock-out competitions and the other is a Sunday
League.
Cricket is also played by women and girls, the governing body being the
Women’s Cricket Association, founded in 1926.
The British Field Sports Society looks after the interests of all field sports
(including hunting, game shooting and fishing) which have a long history and |
play a considerable part in the life of the countryside.
Fox hunting on horseback with a pack of hounds is the most important
British hunting sport but there is also stag hunting, hunting the hare, and |
otter hunting along river banks. The fox hunting season lasts from early
November to April and is preceded by the hunting of young foxes when young
hounds are trained. There are about 200 packs of hounds in Britain and hunts
are financed mainly by members’ subscriptions and by the proceeds of such
events as steeplechase point-to-points.
Game shooting as an organised country sport probably originated in the
early part of the nineteenth century. Game consists of grouse, partridge,
pheasant, snipe and woodcock, and these species are protected by law during a
close season when they are allowed to breed in security on numerous estates
supervised by privately employed game-keepers. It is necessary to have a
licence to kill game, and a certificate must be obtained from the local police by '
anyone who possesses, purchases or acquires a shot gun. The Game Conser- |
vancy, formed by landowners, farmers and others interested in game conser¬
vation, collects information and studies factors controlling game population.

Racing
Other shooting sports are wild-fowling which takes place on marshes and
fenlands, and deer stalking.
The most popular country sport is fishing, there being about 3 million
anglers in Britain. Many fish for salmon and trout particularly in the rivers
and lochs of Scotland, but in England and Wales the most widely practised
form of fishing is for coarse fish such as pike, perch, carp, roach, dace, tench,
chub and bream. Angling clubs affiliate to the National Federation of Anglers
and many clubs organise angling competitions. National championships are
organised by the federation which also enters a team in the World Angling
Championship. Freshwater fishing usually has to be paid for; most coarse
fishing is let to angling clubs by private owners while trout and salmon
fishermen either rent a stretch of river, join a club, or pay for the right to fish
by the day, week or month. Coastal and deep sea fishing are free to all (apart
from salmon and sea trout fishing which is by licence only). In Northern Ire¬
land the Ulster Provincial Council of the Irish Federation of Sea Anglers and
the Ulster Angling Federation look after the interests of the sport.
Oolf originated in Scotland where it has for centuries borne the title of the
Royal and Ancient Game, the headquarters of the Royal and Ancient Golf
Club being situated at St. Andrews on the east coast. The sport is now played
throughout Britain and there are golf courses in the vicinity of most towns,
some of which are owned by local authorities. The main event of the golfing
year is the Open Golf Championship; other important events include the
Walker Cup match for amateurs and the Ryder Cup match for professionals,
both of which are played between Britain and the United States.
The modern game of lawn tennis was first played in England in 1872 and the
first championships at Wimbledon in 1877. The controlling body, the Lawn
Tennis Association, was founded in 1888. The main event of the season is the
annual Wimbledon fortnight for players from all over the world; these draw
large crowds, the grounds at the All-England Club accommodating over 30,000
spectators. There are also county championships and national competitions
for boys’ and girls’ schools. International events include the Davis Cup for
men and the Federation Cup for women. Women from Britain and the United
States compete for the Wightman Cup.
Among the most popular spectator sports is motor racing, of which the
governing body is the Royal Automobile Club (RAC). The RAC issues
competition licences to motor clubs registered with it covering all events from
hill climbs to full international race meetings. In addition it organises the
British Grand Prix which counts towards the Formula One World Motor
Racing Championship, and the RAC Rally which counts towards the World
Rally Championship.
Motor cycle racing is governed by the Auto Cycle Union and the most
important events of the year are the Isle of Man Tourist Trophy races, the
British Grand Prix, and the Formula 750 World Championship. Motor cycle
speedway racing is governed by the Speedway Control Board.
Horse racing takes two forms—flat racing (from late March to early Novem¬
ber) and steeplechasing and hurdle racing (from August to June). The Derby,
run at Epsom, is the outstanding event in the flat racing calendar. Other classic
races are: the Two Thousand Guineas and the One Thousand Guineas, both
run at Newmarket; the Oaks, run at Epsom; and the St. Leger, run at

Doncaster. The most important steeplechase and hurdle race meeting is the
National Hunt Festival Meeting at Cheltenham. The Grand National, run at
Aintree near Liverpool, is the best known single steeplechase.
The Jockey Club controls all horse racing in Britain. Its rules are the basis of
turf procedure and it also licenses racecourses.
Over 900 days’ racing are held each year and about 11,000 horses are in
training.
The racing of greyhounds after a mechanical hare (now considered to be
among Britain’s most popular spectator sports) takes place at no tracks
licensed by local authorities. Meetings are usually held two or three times a
week at each track, up to a maximum of 130 days a year. Rules for the sport
are drawn up by the National Greyhound Racing Club, but its overall
administration and organisation is the responsibility of the British Greyhound
Racing Federation.
The authority responsible for equestrian activities (other than racing) is the
British Equestrian Federation which co-ordinates the work of the British
Horse Society and the British Show Jumping Association at international
level and runs the National Equestrian Centre at Stoneleigh, Warwickshire.
The British Horse Society promotes the interests of horse and pony breed¬
ing and of riding. It provides lectures, publications, a film library, courses and
examinations and, together with riding schools approved by it, helps to
promote horsemastership. W ith over 100,000 members the society is also the
parent body of the Pony Club and the Riding Club movement. These hold
their own rallies, meetings and competitions, culminating in annual national
championships at the National Equestrian Centre.
Horse trials are held during the spring and summer under the auspices of
the society. The three-day events held each year (in April at Badminton,
Avon, in May at Tidworth, Hampshire, and in September at Burghley House,
Lincolnshire) include dressage, cross-country riding and show jumping.
Show jumping is promoted by the British Show Jumping Association
which draws up competition rules and prescribes the general standards and
height of obstacles. The association keeps a register of horses and ponies
taking part in shows and seeks to improve the standard of jumping and to
provide for British representation in international competitions. It has over
15,000 members and 950 shows are affiliated to it. The two major show
jumping events each year are the Royal International Horse Show and the
Horse of the Year Show.
Rugby football is played according to two different sets of rules: Rugby Union
(a 15-a-side game) is played by amateurs while Rugby League (a 13-a-side
game) is played by professionals as well as amateurs.
Rugby Union is played throughout Britain under the auspices of the Rugby
Football Union (in England), the Welsh Rugby Union, the Scottish Rugby
Union and the Irish Rugby Football Union. International matches between
England, Scotland, Wales, Ireland and France are played each year and there
are tours by international teams.
Rugby League is played mostly in the north of England. The governing body
of the professional game is the Rugby Football League which sends touring
teams to Australia and New Zealand. Annual matches are also played against
France. The Rugby League Challenge Cup Final is the major match of the
season and is played at Wembley Stadium in London. The amateur game is
governed by the British Amateur Rugby League Association.
SPORT AND RECREATION
425
Sailing
Swimming
Sailing has always been popular on Britain s inland and coastal waters. The
Royal Yachting Association has over 1,5°° clubs and about 53,000 members.
There are about 450 teaching establishments recognised by the association
including the National Sailing Centre at Cowes in the Isle of Wight where
instructors are coached and tested. One of the world’s principal regattas takes
place each year at Cowes and major events are held at other British sailing
centres.
Swimming is enjoyed by millions of people in Britain, many of whom learn
to swim at public baths, schools or swimming clubs. Instruction and coaching
is provided by qualified teachers who hold certificates awarded by the Amateur
Swimming Association, to which over 1,700 clubs are affiliated. The associa¬
tion also draws up and enforces regulations for amateur swimming, diving and
water polo championships and competitions in England.
Underwater swimming (sub-aqua) is governed nationally by the British
Sub-Aqua Club which promotes underwater exploration, science and sport.
Formed in 1953, the club has become the largest in the world with some 24,000
members and more than yoo branches in Britain and overseas.
Other Sports
The governing bodies of some other sports played in Britain are given below.
Most of these are organised on the basis of clubs and regional organisations
linked to a national body. The governing bodies functions are broadly similar
and usually include drawing up the rules of the sport, organising regional and
national competitions and maintaining relations with sporting bodies overseas.
Many of the sports listed below have separate national bodies for Scotland,
Wales and Northern Ireland.

Various forms of betting and commercial gaming are permitted under strict
regulations, and estimated total turnover in Great Britain in 1976 was about
.€3>500 million (although consumer expenditure represented only a small
proportion of this figure).
The gaming turnover of some £1,100 million included that at casinos, on
gaming machines and on licensed bingo which is thought to be played by about
5-5 million people on a fairly regular basis. Betting takes place mainly on horse
and greyhound racing, and on football matches (especially through football
pools). The turnover on such betting in 1976 was about £2,400 million. Racing
bets may be made at racecourses and greyhound tracks, or through some
14,000 licensed off-course betting offices (which take about 90 per cent of the
turnover). A form of pool betting (totalisator betting) is organised on, and off,
course by the Horserace Totalisator Board (HTB). Bookmakers and the HTB
have to contribute a ‘betting levy’ to the Horserace Betting Levy Board which
promotes the advancement of veterinary science and the improvement of
horseracing and breeds of horses.
There is no national lottery in Britain, although recent legislation permits
local authorities and certain bodies to hold lotteries.
A Royal Commission on Gambling is inquiring into the law relating to
betting, gaming, lotteries and prize competitions.
Currency
The unit of currency is the pound sterling divided into 100 new pence (p). There are
six denominations: 50p; lOp; 5p; 2p; Ip; and ^p.
Bank of England notes are issued for sums of £1, £5, £10 and £20.

Index
Bold type in a sequence of figures indicates main references.
As the main purpose of this book is to inform readers overseas about Britain,
organisations and societies are generally indexed under their subject matter
rather than under Association of, British, National, Royal, etc. {that is, Accidents,
Royal Society for the Prevention of; Archives, National Register of). In cases
where the first word is not separable, however {for example, Royal Air Force,
Royal Society), entries will be found appropriately.
Items are indexed under England, Northern Ireland, Scotland or Wales only
where they are matters peculiar to these countries; otherwise they are indexed
under the relevant subject headings.
