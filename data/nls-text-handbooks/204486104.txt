Introduction
Britain 1976 is the twenty-seventh official handbook in the series prepared
and revised each year by Reference Division of the Central Office of
Information with the co-operation of other government departments and
of many national organisations. The handbook is widely known as an
established work of reference and is the mainstay of the reference facilities
provided by the British Information Services in many countries. It is avail¬
able overseas in a limited free edition and is on sale throughout the world.
This 1976 edition, which covers events up to September 1975, gives a
factual account of the administration and the national economy of Britain.
It describes the activities of many of the national institutions, both official
and unofficial, and shows the part played by the Government in the life of
the community.
The handbook does not claim to be comprehensive, nor does it attempt
to cover Britain's participation in Commonwealth or world affairs. The
factual and statistical information it contains is compiled from official and
other authoritative sources, and, while most sections of the book relate to
Britain as a whole, facts and figures for England, Wales, Scotland, and
Northern Ireland are also given separately when relevant.
Readers who require more detailed information should consult the
Annual Abstract of Statistics and the Monthly Digest of Statistics, issued
by the Central Statistical Office, and also other government publications
and standard works of reference, some of which are listed in the biblio¬
graphy towards the end of the handbook.

1 The Land and the
THE PHYSICAL BACKGROUND
Britain, formally known as the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern
Ireland, constitutes the greater part of the British Isles, a group of islands
lying off the north-west coast of Europe. The largest islands are Great Britain
(comprising the mainlands of England, Wales and Scotland) and Ireland (com¬
prising Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic). Off the southern coast of
England is the Isle of Wight and off the extreme south-west are the Isles of
Scilly; off north Wales is Anglesey. Western Scotland is fringed by numerous
islands and to the far north are the important groups of the Orkneys and
Shetlands. All these have administrative ties with the mainland, but the Isle
of Man in the Irish Sea and the Channel Islands between Great Britain and
France have a large measure of administrative autonomy and are not part of
England, Wales, Scotland or Northern Ireland.
England has a total area (including inland water) of 50,335 square miles
(130,367 sq. km.); Wales has a total area of 8,016 square miles (20,763 sq. km.);
Scotland, including its inhabited islands has a total area of 30,414 square
miles (78,773 sq. km.); Northern Ireland has a total area of 5,452 square
miles (14,120 sq. km.). Together, these countries constitute the United King¬
dom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland (or Britain), with a total area of
94,217 square miles (244,021 sq. km.). The total land area of the United King¬
dom (excluding inland water) is 93,026 square miles (240,936 sq. km.):
England, 50,053 (129,637); Wales, 7,968 (20,638); Scotland, 29,799 (77,179);
and Northern Ireland, 5,206 (13,483).
When studying British statistics it should be noted whether they refer to
England as defined above, to England and Wales (considered together for
many administrative and other purposes), to Great Britain, which comprises
England, Wales and Scotland, or to Britain (the United Kingdom) as a whole.
United Kingdom statistics and other data sometimes include the Isle of Man,
227 square miles (588 sq. km.), and the Channel Islands, 75 square miles
(194 sq. km.), which strictly are not part of the United Kingdom but are
dependencies of the Crown.
The latitude of 50° North cuts across the southernmost part of the British
mainland (the Lizard Peninsula) and latitude 6o° North passes through the
Shetland Islands. The northernmost point of the Scottish mainland, Dunnet
Head, near John o’ Groats, is in latitude 58° 40'. The prime meridian of o°
passes through the old observatory at Greenwich (London), while the
easternmost point of England is nearly i° 45' East and the westernmost point
of Northern Ireland is 8° 10' West. It is just under 600 miles (966 km.) in a
straight line from the south coast to the extreme north of mainland Britain and
about 300 miles (483 km.) across in the widest part. Owing to the numerous
bays and inlets no point in Britain is as much as 75 miles (121 km.) from tidal
water.
The seas surrounding the British Isles are everywhere shallow—usually
2

Topography

less than 50 fathoms (300 feet or 91 metres)—because the islands he on the
continental shelf. To the north-west along the edge of the shelf the sea floor
plunges abruptly from 600 feet (183 metres) to 3,000 feet (914 metres). These
shallow waters are important because they provide excellent fishing grounds
as well as breeding grounds for fish. The North Atlantic Current, the drift
of warm water which reaches the islands from across the Atlantic, spreads out
over the shelf and its ameliorating effect on the air is thus magnified. 1 he
effect of tidal movement is also increased by the shallowness of the water.
Despite their small area, the British Isles contain rocks of all the main
geological periods. In Great Britain the newer rocks, which are less resistant
to weather and have thus been worn down to form low land, lie to the south
and east, and the island can therefore be divided roughly into two mam
regions, lowland Britain and highland Britain.
In lowland Britain the newer and softer rocks of southern and eastern
England have been eroded into a rich plain, more often rolling than flat and
rising to chalk and limestone hills, but hardly ever reaching a thousand feet
(305 metres) above sea level. Its boundaries run roughly from the mouth of
the Tyne in the north-east to the mouth of the Exe in the south-west.
Highland Britain comprises the whole of Scotland (including the hills and
moors of southern Scotland as well as the mountains of the Scottish Highlands,
which extend from the Forth-Clyde valley to the extreme north-west), the
Lake District in north-west England, the broad central upland known as the
Pennines, almost the whole of Wales, and the south-western peninsula of
England coinciding approximately with the counties of Devon and Cornwall.
Highland Britain contains all the mountainous parts1 of Great Britain and
extensive uplands lying above one thousand feet (305 metres). This high
ground, however, is not continuous but is interspersed with valleys and plains.
Geologically the mountains and hills consist mainly of outcrops of very old
rocks (archaean and palaeozoic), while the upper strata in the valleys and plains
are mainly more recent (carboniferous age) and similar to those in the northern
and western parts of lowland Britain.
These carboniferous strata are rich in minerals and include the coal measures
which were the foundation of Britain’s industrial expansion. The outcrops
and shallow seams of coal which have now largely been exhausted were found
on the edge of the plains and up the valleys leading to the high land. Most of
the present deep coal workings underlie the fertile lowlands.
Towards the end of Britain’s long geological history, when the ancestors
of present-day man had already settled in the country, came the great Ice Age
during which, at one period or another, ice caps and ice sheets extended
approximately as far south as the Bristol Channel and the Thames valley. The
ice naturally accumulated on the higher ground and swept from the mountains
of Scotland, northern England and Wales any loose rock or soil which had
previously been formed, so that, when the ice eventually disappeared, the hills
stood out as barren rocky areas, while a thick mantle of glacial debris boulders,
boulder-clay, sands and gravels—lay distributed widely over the lower ground.
The ice had blocked up previous drainage channels and left large lakes, which
have since gradually dried up, leaving deposits of sand, silt and mud, often
affording soils of great fertility.
In Ireland, where the solid rocks are covered deeply by the debris left by

Snowdon, 3,560 feet (1,085 metres); and in England, Scafell Pike (in the Lake District,
Cumbria)’, 3,210 feet (978 metres).

the ice sheets, the great central plain has large boggy areas, due to interruption
of the previous natural drainage. The mountains and hill masses1 are irregu¬
larly placed around central lowlands; the rocks of Ireland are of the same types
as the highland zone of Great Britain, and in the higher parts the moorland
vegetation resembles that of the higher parts of highland Britain.
Britain’s complex geology is one of the main reasons for its rich variety
of scenery and the stimulating contrasts found within short distances, parti¬
cularly on the coasts. The ancient rocks of highland Britain often reach the
coast in towering cliffs; elsewhere the sea may penetrate in deep lochs, as
along much of the west coast of Scotland. Bold outstanding headlands are
notable features in other parts of the varied coastline: the granite cliffs of
Land’s End; the limestone masses and slates of the coast of south-west Wales;
the red sandstone of St. Bees Head on the Cumbria coast; and the vertically
jointed lavas of Skye and the island of Staffa in the Inner Hebrides. Even
around lowland Britain there are striking contrasts. In some parts the soft,
white limestone—the chalk—forms white cliffs as at Dover and in the Needles
off the Isle of Wight; while other parts of the south and south-east coastline
have beaches of sand or shingle. The eastern coast of England between the
Humber and the Thames estuary is for the most part low-lying, and for
hundreds of years some stretches of it have been protected against the sea by
embankments.
The marked tidal movement around the British Isles sweeps away much of
the sand and mud brought down by the rivers and makes the estuaries of the
short British rivers2 valuable as natural harbours.
Britain has a generally mild and temperate climate. It lies in middle latitudes
to the north-west of the great continental land mass of Eurasia, but the prevail¬
ing winds are south-westerly and the weather from day to day is controlled
mainly by a succession of depressions from the Atlantic which, moving in a
generally easterly or north-easterly direction, pass over or near the British
Isles. The climate is subject to frequent changes but to few extremes of
temperature. Although it is largely determined by that of the eastern Atlantic,
occasionally during the winter months easterly winds may bring a cold, dry,
continental type of weather which, once established, may persist for many days
or even weeks. During the summer months the Azores high pressure system
usually extends its influence north-eastwards towards north-west Europe, and
the depressions take a more northerly course, often passing entirely to the
north of the British Isles.
In Britain, south-westerly winds are the most frequent, and those from an
easterly direction the least; such winds occur about one-third as often as south-
westerlies although easterly winds are appreciably more frequent in the
spring than at any other time of the year. In hilly country, wind direction may
differ markedly from the general direction owing to local topography. Winds
are generally stronger in the north than in the south of the British Isles, stronger
on the coasts than inland, and stronger in the west than in the east. The
strongest winds usually occur in the winter; the average speed at Lerwick,
Shetland Islands, varies from about 19 m.p.h. (31 km.p.h.) in January to about
14 m.p.h. (23 km.p.h.) in August, while at Kew Observatory, on the western
outskirts of London, the average speed varies from about 10 m.p.h. (16

210 miles (354 and 338 km.) long respectively.

km.p.h.) in January to about 7 m.p.h. (11 km.p.h.) in August. The stormiest
region is along the north-west coast with over 30 gales a year; south-east
England and the east Midlands are the least stormy, with gales occurring on
about 2 days a year inland«and on some 15 to 20 days on the Channel coast.
Near sea level in the west of Britain the mean annual temperature ranges from
8°C. (47°F.) in the Hebrides to n9C. (52°F-) in the extreme south-west of
England; latitude for latitude it is slightly lower in the east. The mean monthly
temperature in the extreme north, at Lerwick (Shetland), ranges from 4 C.
(39°F.) during the winter (December, January and February) to I2°C. (54°F.)
during the summer (June, July and August): the corresponding figures for the
Isle of Wight, in the extreme south, are 5°C. (4i°F.) and i6°C. (6i°F.). The
average range of temperature between winter and summer varies from 7 C. to
i2°C. (450-54°F.), being greatest inland in the eastern part of the country.
During a normal summer, the temperature occasionally rises above 27°C.
(8i°F.) in the south, but temperatures of 32°C. (90°F.) and above are in¬
frequent. Extreme minimum temperatures depend largely on local conditions,
but —7°C. (20°F.) may occur on a still, clear winter’s night, — I2°C. (io°F.)
is rare, and — i8°C. (o°F.) or below has been recorded only during exception¬
ally cold periods.
The British Isles as a whole have an annual rainfall of over 40 inches (1,016
mm.), while England alone has about 34 inches (854 mm.). The geographical
distribution of annual rainfall is largely governed by topography and exposure
to the Atlantic, the mountainous areas of the west and north having far more
rain than the lowland of the south and east. Between 150 and 200 inches (3,810
and 5,080 mm.) of rain fall on the summits of Snowdon and Ben Nevis during
the average year, whereas some places in the south-east of England record less
than 20 inches (508 mm.). Rain is fairly well distributed throughout the year,
but, on the average, March to June are the driest months and October to
January the wettest. A period of as long as three weeks without rain is excep¬
tional, and is usually confined to limited areas. In successive years, however,
remarkably contrasting weather conditions are sometimes experienced.
The distribution of sunshine over Britain shows a general decrease from south
to north, a decrease from the coast inland, and a decrease with altitude. During
May, June and July—the months of longest daylight—the mean daily duration
of sunshine varies from five hours in north-west Scotland to eight hours in the
Isle of Wight; during the months of shortest daylight—November, December
and January—sunshine is at a minimum, with an average of half an hour a
day in some parts of the Highlands of Scotland and in the Peak District
(Derbyshire) and two hours a day on the south coast of England.
In fine, still weather there is occasionally haze in summer and mist and fog
in winter. Fogs have become less frequent and less severe in recent years as a
result of changes in fuel usage and the operation of clean air legislation.
Many parts of the surface of highland Britain have only thin, poor soils, with
the result that large stretches of moorland are found over the Highlands of
Scotland, the Pennines, the Lake District, the mountains of Wales and in
parts of north-east and south-west England. In most areas the farmer has
cultivated only the valleys and the plains where soils are deeper and richer,
villages and towns are often separated by uplands with few if any habitations.
With the exception of a few patches of heath and forest, almost the whole
THE LAND AND THE PEOPLE
5
Fauna
of lowland Britain has been cultivated, and farmland covers the area except
where there are urban and industrial settlements. Elaborate land drainage
systems have been developed through the centuries to bring under cultivation
the fertile soil of the low-lying fenland of Lincolnshire and part of East Anglia.
With its mild climate and varied soils, Britain has a diverse pattern of
natural vegetation. When the islands were first settled, oak forest probably
covered the greater part of the lowland, giving place to extensive marshlands,
forests of Scots pine on higher or sandy ground and perhaps some open moor¬
land. In the course of the centuries the forest area was progressively diminished
and, in spite of planting by estate owners in the eighteenth and nineteenth
centuries and the establishment of large forests by the Forestry Commission
in the past 50 years, woodlands now occupy only about 8 per cent of the surface
of the country. The greatest density of woodland occurs in the north and east
of Scotland, in some parts of south-east England and on the Welsh border.
Yet much of Britain appears to be well wooded because of the numerous
hedgerows and isolated trees. The most common trees are oak, beech, ash and
elm and, in Scotland, pine and birch.
There are various types of wild vegetation, including the natural flora of
woods, fens and marshes, foreshores and cliffs, chalk downs and the higher
slopes of mountains; the most widespread is that of the hilly moorland country,
which consists mainly of heather, grasses, gorse and bracken, with cotton
grass in the wetter parts. Most of Britain, however, is agricultural land, of
which over a third is arable and the rest pasture and meadow, a varied semi¬
natural vegetation composed of indigenous grasses and flowering plants.
Farming land is divided into fields by hedges, stone walls or wire fences and,
especially in the mixed farms which cover most of the country, presents a
pattern of contrasting colour. The cool temperate climate of Britain and the
even distribution of rainfall ensure a long growing season; streams rarely dry
up, grassland is green throughout the year with many wild flowers from spring
to autumn; in most years there is scarcely a month in which some flowers may
not be found in hedgerows and sheltered woodland glades.
The fauna of the British Isles is, in general, similar to that of north-western
Europe, though there are fewer species. Some of the larger mammals, includ¬
ing the wolf, the bear, the boar and the reindeer, have become extinct; but red
deer, protected for sporting reasons, flourish in the Scottish Highlands and on
Exmoor in the counties of Devon and Somerset, roe deer are found in Scotland
and in the wooded areas of southern England, and fallow deer (which are
probably not indigenous) have been introduced into parks and are wild in
some districts. The badger, a nocturnal animal, is rarely seen; there are foxes
in most rural areas, and otters are found along many rivers and streams. Both
common and grey seals may be seen on various parts of the coast, though not
usually in the same localities. Smaller mammals include mice, rats, voles,
shrews, hedgehogs, moles, squirrels (the imported grey more numerous than
the native red), hares, rabbits, weasels and stoats.
About 460 species of birds have been recorded in the British Isles. Some 200
species breed; the rest are regular migrants to, or pass through, the country, or
are casual stragglers. Visitors to Britain are often struck by the abundance,
variety and tameness of song birds in towns and villages. The pigeon, blackbird
and chaffinch are widely distributed but sparrows usually predominate near
houses. London and some other large towns have huge flocks of starlings which
congregate to roost on buildings, especially in winter. Most species of birds
have maintained their numbers over the last few decades, owing to their
6
BRITAIN 1976: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
success in adapting themselves to man-made surroundings, and in London
there has been an increase in the number of species breeding as a result of the
improvement in the environment brought about by anti-pollution measures.
Some large birds, on the other hand, have tended to decrease, but several
species, such as the osprey and the ruff, have re-established themselves after
disappearing from Britain in the nineteenth century.
Many species of gulls and other sea birds nest around the coast, and gulls
may regularly be seen feeding far inland; some nest in inland sites such as
gravel pits and sewage farms. The drainage and reclamation of marshlands
have diminished the natural habitat of ducks, geese and other aquatic birds,
but the survival of such species is largely assured on the nature reserves and
bird sanctuaries which have recently been established on an increasing scale.
Nearly all British wild birds are protected; the principal exceptions are those
considered injurious to agriculture and birds shot for sport in the open season.
About 30 kinds of freshwater fish are found; salmon, trout, pike, roach,
dace and perch being widely distributed. Stocks of trout, rainbow trout (an
introduced species), carp, tench and roach are frequently supplemented by
introductions for angling purposes. In a number of rivers measures to control
pollution have resulted in fish becoming more numerous. In the Thames in
London, for example, where 80 species of fish have been found, conditions
are now thought to be suitable for salmon to enter the river.
Reptiles and amphibians are few. The former are represented by three
species of snakes, of which only the adder is venomous, and three species of
lizards, including the snake-like slow-worm. The amphibians are represented
by three species of newts and five species of frogs and toads. Most British
reptiles and amphibians are indigenous but at least one, the marsh frog, has
been recently introduced from Europe. There are no snakes in Ireland.
There are more than 21,000 different kinds of insects, most of them small,
in the British Isles. Among the largest are the rare swallowtail butterfly (3 to
4 inches or 8 to 10 cm.) and the stag beetle (2| inches or 6 cm.). The insect
fauna in Britain is less varied than that of continental Europe and lacks a
number of common European species. With modern methods of pest control,
extensive insect damage to crops or timber and serious outbreaks of diseases
spread by insect vectors are not common in Britain but there is some anxiety
among naturalists that chemical protection against insects may be reducing
the population of creatures which feed on them, and of their predators in turn.
These and other effects of agricultural chemicals on wild life are the subject of
special safeguards.
THE DEMOGRAPHIC BACKGROUND
The people who now inhabit Britain are descended mainly from the people
who inhabited the area nine centuries ago. The last of a long succession of
invaders and colonisers from Scandinavia and the continent of Europe were
the Normans, a branch of the Norsemen or Scandinavian Vikings who, after
settling in northern France, intermarrying with the French, and assimilating
the French language and customs, crossed to England and conquered it in
1066.
Obviously it is not possible to estimate the relative importance of various
early peoples—pre-Celts, Celts, Romans, Anglo-Saxons and the Norsemen,
including the Danes—in the ancestry of the present English, Scots, Welsh and
Irish. Over most of England and the lowlands of Scotland the language which
soon came to predominate was English, mainly a marriage of Anglo-Saxon and

Norman-French, while the use of Celtic languages persisted in Wales, Corn¬

The available records do not enable any precise estimates to be made of the
size of population or of the extent or direction of population movement until
the beginning of the nineteenth century. It is believed, however, that at the
end of the eleventh century the population of Great Britain was about 2 million,
while at the end of the seventeenth century a reasonable contemporary estimate
put the population of England and Wales at 5^ million and that of Scotland
at about 1 million. The main factor in this gradual growth of population was a
slow natural increase, the rate of which was retarded in Britain, as in all
countries before the development of medical science, by high death rates and,
in particular, by very high infant and maternal mortality. Immigration from
the continent of Europe has been an influence at certain times and immigra¬
tion from Commonwealth countries more recently.
From the beginning of the nineteenth century, information about the British
people—their number, sex, age, geographical distribution, births, deaths, mar¬
riages, occupations, language and family structure—is relatively plentiful and
reliable. Most of it is derived from two main sources: the regular flow of vital
statistics (that is, statistical information based on statutory registration of
births, marriages and deaths) and the periodic censuses of population.
The compilation of complete records of births, marriages and deaths is
carried out by registrars of births and deaths, some of whom also act as
registrars of marriages. In England and Wales there are some 500 superintend¬
ent registrars in charge of registration districts and nearly 1,150 registrars in
charge of sub-districts. Registrars and superintendent registrars are appointed
either by the councils of counties or of metropolitan districts and in London
by the borough councils. They act under the instruction of the Registrar
General for England and Wales, who is also director of a central government
department, the Office of Population Censuses and Surveys, whose functions
include regulating the registration of births, deaths and marriages, the
planning and carrying out of population censuses, and the compilation and
analysis of population and vital statistics. There are corresponding authorities
and similar arrangements in Scotland, Northern Ireland, the Channel Islands
and the Isle of Man.
Since 1801 and until 1971 censuses of the people of Great Britain have
been taken regularly every ten years, except that there was no census in 1941
because of the second world war. The latest full census covering Britain was
taken in April 1971. Censuses were taken throughout Great Britain (on a
sample basis) and Northern Ireland in 1966.
In mid-1974 the estimated home population of Britain (excluding the popula¬
tions of the Isle of Man and the Channel Islands) was 55,970,000 compared
with 53,885,000 in mid-1964, 38-2 million in 1901, and 10-5 million (in Great
Britain) in 1801. The main causes of this great increase in numbers were a
progressive reduction in death rates and a continuance of high birth rates into
the beginning of the twentieth century.
Britain’s population density was approximately 594 persons per square
mile (229 per sq. km.) in mid-1974, but in England there were approximately
922 persons per square mile (356 per sq. km.), and in Greater London 11,756
persons per square mile (4,538 per sq. km.).
Future Growth
Since 1971 there has been a decline in the rate of population growth. However,

BRITAIN 1976: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
on the basis of mid-1974 population estimates and of present trends in birth
and death rates and migration, the increase in population is expected to con¬
tinue, reaching 567 million in 1984, 58'5 million in 1994, 59'7 million m 2004
and 62-2 million in 2014. This represents an average growth rate of o-2 per
cent a year over the whole period.
Growing public concern about the effects of an increasing population on an
already densely populated island led to proposals for a policy on population
matters. In 1971 the Government set up a Population Panel following
recommendations made by a House of Commons Select Committee. In its
report the panel endorsed the main recommendations of the select committee
for an official attitude on population and for comprehensive family planning
services as an integral part of the National Health Service. Provisions for
family planning advice and help within the framework of the National Health
Service have gradually been extended so that a free service is now available
to all (see p. 140). In 1974 the Government announced that it proposed to
give higher priority to survey and research work to study fertility, mortality
and migration, in an attempt to discover more about the factors which have
caused the recent decline in the rate of growth of population in the United
Kingdom. The Lord Privy Seal has been given ministerial responsibility for
monitoring and co-ordinating further developments in population matters.
For most of the nineteenth century the annual birth rate was over 30 per
thousand of the population, and the annual death rate was just over 20 per
thousand. Both birth and death rates fell over the last 20 years of the century,
but natural population increase changed little.
BIRTH RATES AND DEATH RATES
These fertile years, with their comparatively high death rates in all age
groups, produced a population of low average age. But when death rates in all
age groups fell by an average of about a third, as they did between 1880 and
1910, the results were a very low general death rate, which helped to maintain
the population increase in spite of a fall in the birth rate, and a gradual
increase in the average age of the population. By the 1930s the birth rate had
fallen to less than half the nineteenth century rate. The population continued
to increase slowly, but its average age rose more rapidly.
Owing to the changing age composition, the general death rate has remained
THE LAND AND THE PEOPLE
9
Mortality
Causes
Sex Ratio
nearly stationary since 1920 at around 12 per thousand of the population
though death rates have continued to fall heavily in every age group, particu¬
larly among pre-school children, school children, and adults in their thirties
and forties, with a consequent lengthening of the expectation of life from about
48 years at birth for a boy born in 1901 and 52 years for a girl, to 69 years at
birth for a boy born in 1971-73 and 75-2 for a girl.
The continuous fall in the number of births and birth rates ceased in 1933
and for the rest of the 1930s remained at about 15 per 1,000 population.
During the second world war the birth rate began to rise and reached a tem¬
porary post-war peak of 20-7 per thousand population in 1947. It receded to
slightly above the pre-war level in the early 1950s, but from 1956 onwards
began to rise again, reaching a peak of 18-8 per thousand in 1964. It has since
fallen particularly sharply, reaching 13-3 per 1,000 population in 1974. The
proportion of illegitimate births, which reached a peak of 9-1 per cent of all
live births in 1945, the end of the second world war, fell between 1945 and
I955> when it reached 4-5 per cent; since then it has risen, and was about 8-7
per cent in 1974.
EXPECTATION OF LIFE AT BIRTH
The causes of the decline in mortality include better nutrition, rising standards
of living, the advance of medical science, the growth of medical facilities,
improved health measures, better working conditions, education in personal
hygiene, and the smaller size of the family, which has reduced the strain on
mothers and enabled them to take greater care of their children.
Mortality from acute infectious diseases and from tuberculosis, and infant
and maternal mortality have declined very sharply. Mortality from the main
acute infectious diseases of childhood is less than a two-hundredth and mor¬
tality from tuberculosis is about one-fifty-fifth of the rate prevailing in the
mid-nineteenth century. The infant mortality rate (deaths of infants under
one year old per thousand live births) has fallen from 142 in 1900-2 to 17-2
in 1973 and maternal mortality from 4‘7I Per thousand live births in 1900—2
to 0-14 in 1973. The reported mortality from some of the illnesses of middle
and old age, such as cancer of the lung and heart diseases, has risen during
the twentieth century, and this rise, though exaggerated by the improvement
in diagnosis, is at least partly real. Medicine has not yet discovered effective
measures to combat some of these illnesses and improvement in positive health
does not always bring increased immunity or resistance to them.
Total births of boys naturally exceed those of girls by about 6 per cent, but
stillbirth rates and mortality rates at almost all ages are higher for males, so

that in nearly all countries-and in Britain since records began-women pre¬
ponderate among the elderly and outnumber men m the total population.
There are nearly 106 females to every 100 males in Britain. Formerly women
outnumbered men in every age group from adolescence onwards'. Recently,
however the fall in stillbirths and infant mortality has reduced the influence
of these’factors on sex ratio so that the age at which women begin to out¬
number men has advanced and is now about 45. On the other hand the
lengthening of the expectation of life, which has been rather more marked for
women than for men, has increased the preponderance of women among the
elderly—there are now some 18 women over 70 years old to every 10 men
and made it a weightier factor in the sex ratio of the whole population.
Over the past 30 years the proportion of the population of Great Britain who
are or have been married has risen from about 52 per cent in 1939 to 59 per
cent in 1973, while the proportion of single persons in the population aged
1S years or over has fallen from 33-3 per cent to 22-5 per cent. This change has
been due mainly to an increase in marriage rates among men and women in
their late teens and early twenties; whereas in 1939 only 33-8 per cent ot
young women aged 20 to 24 were or had been married, in i973 the Percentage
was m-i. Earlier marriage has led to a large increase in the number of children
born to women under 30 years of age and in recent years has contributed to a
substantial acceleration of the total flow of births into the population.
There were 8 decrees of divorce made absolute in 1973 for every I>0°°
married people in England and Wales; a substantial proportion of divorced
people marry again.
Fertility Trends
Age
Distribution
The fall in birth rates in the latter part of the nineteenth and the early part
of the twentieth centuries was due mainly to a decline in the size of the fami y
(that is, the number of children born per married couple) caused by the spread
of deliberate family limitation. Couples married just over a hundred years ago
produced on the average rather more than six liveborn children. The decline
seems to have set in with those married in the 1860s, and the average fami y
size for Great Britain fell to less than 2-1 for those married in the decade
1034.-43 There has since been some increase, and the average family size of
women marrying in the 1950s is about 2-3 liveborn children, although recently
married women have delayed child bearing.
The generation of girls born about 1840, and married mostly between 20
and 30 years later, had about 40 per cent more children than were needed to
replace the original generation, while those born at the beginning of the present
century had only about 70 per cent of the number of children needed for
replacement. Since then the figure has been rising again and seems likely to
exceed full replacement with the generation born during the second world
war. The rise has been due mainly to the increased proportion of women
getting married and of children surviving to adult life.
The effect of the fall in the birth rate beginning in the latter part of the
nineteenth century was to reduce the ratio of children and old people to
adults of working age. This ratio was at a minimum in 1930. After 1936 the
number of children leaving school for work fell sharply owing to the drop in
the birth rate after 1921, but the population aged over 64, born during an era
of high fertility and representing successive generations of steeply rising
numbers, increased very rapidly; the population aged over 40 was also in¬
creasing relatively faster than that between 15 and 40. The higher birth rates
THE LAND AND THE PEOPLE
II
after 1942 arrested the compensating fall in the number of children and further
reduced the proportion of people of conventional working age.
Because of this high proportion of the young and the old in the present
population, which is expected to increase still further, and the growing num¬
bers of young people continuing in full-time education, there is a special need
to make the best use of national human resources, both by placing those
available for work in suitable employment and by introducing technological
improvements and wider training in order to raise productivity. At the time of
the 1971 census 92 per cent of men and 55 per cent of women between 15 and
normal retirement age (65 for men, 60 for women) in Great Britain were
economically active in remunerative work (this includes those temporarily out
of work or sick). In addition some 19 per cent of men and nearly 13 per cent
of women over normal retirement age were still economically active. At the
other end of the scale, some 30 per cent of young people between 15 and 20
were continuing their education (in 1971, 15 was the school-leaving age; it
was raised to 16 in 1972).
Migration
From the beginning of the nineteenth century until the 1930s the balance of
migration was markedly outward. Between 1815 and 1930 well over 20 million
people left Britain for destinations outside Europe, mainly in the Common¬
wealth and the United States. Many emigrants later returned and large num¬
bers of Europeans, mainly Russians, Poles, Germans and Hungarians, entered
Britain. Nevertheless, the net loss by migration from Britain’s present area
amounted to some 4 million between 1871 and 1931. Since then the balance
of migration for Britain as a whole was inward until 1967, after which a small
net outflow has been recorded. The population of Scotland and Northern
Ireland has been characterised by a net outward movement of population to
countries overseas as well as to England and Wales, although in the year
ended mid-1974 a net gain in population by migration into Scotland was
recorded.
There have been two main periods of net inflow into Britain since 1931. The
first was in the years 1931 to 1940 when emigration was very low, many former
emigrants returned, there was considerable net immigration from the Irish
Republic, and extensive immigration from Europe, including about a quarter
of a million refugees seeking sanctuary in Britain. The second, from the 1950s,
resulted from a large increase in net immigration from Commonwealth coun¬
tries, particularly West Indian countries, India and Pakistan. In the three
years 1960-62 total net immigration amounted to some 388,000 people, about
three-quarters of them from the Commonwealth. It was in these circumstances
that the Government introduced the Commonwealth Immigrants Act 1962,
which gave it power to restrict the number of people from the Commonwealth
and, in principle, the Irish Republic who did not have citizenship of the
United Kingdom and Colonies and who might immigrate into Britain without
assured prospects of employment or adequate means of self-support. The
Commonwealth Immigrants Act 1968 extended immigration control to citizens
of the United Kingdom and Colonies who had no close links with Britain:
broadly speaking, those neither born, naturalised, adopted or registered in
Britain nor having a parent or grandparent who was. The Immigration Act
1971, which replaced this earlier legislation, provides a single system of control
over Commonwealth citizens and foreign nationals entering Britain. It confers
a right of abode—and exemption from control—on citizens of the United
Kingdom and Colonies who are connected with Britain by birth, adoption,
naturalisation or registration or are children or grandchildren of such persons,
12

BRITAIN 1976: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
on citizens of the United Kingdom and Colonies from overseas who have been
resident in Britain for a continuous period of five years, and on Common¬
wealth citizens with a parent born in the United Kingdom. Those having this
right of abode are known as ‘patrialsh In general, others wishing to enter
Britain for employment must hold work permits (see p. 342). Exceptions are
Commonwealth citizens with a grandparent born in Britain, certain permit-
free categories, and nationals of European Community countries. The
dependants of work permit holders and of those who may enter without work
permits may also be admitted.
The net emigration from the United Kingdom to Commonwealth countries
in 1974 was 67,400 and to foreign countries 17,800. Some 19,400 work permit
holders and 5,100 dependants entered Britain from overseas countries in
addition to 68,900 Commonwealth citizens and foreign nationals accepted for
settlement. Over the same period residence permits were granted to some
11,300 nationals of European Community countries. (For welfare of im¬
migrants see p. 147.)
Under the British Nationality Act 1948, persons born in the United Kingdom,
the Channel Islands, the Isle of Man, a ship or aircraft registered in the
United Kingdom, or a territory which is still a colony, are, with insignificant
exceptions, citizens of the United Kingdom and Colonies by birth. Citizen¬
ship may also be acquired: by descent from a father who is himself a citizen
otherwise than by descent and, in certain specified circumstances, from a
father who is a citizen by descent only; by registration, for citizens of Com¬
monwealth member countries or of the Irish Republic, for minor children
and for women married to citizens of the United Kingdom and Colonies, in
consequence of an adoption order; and, for aliens, by naturalisation. The
requirements for naturalisation include five years’ residence in the United
Kingdom or Colonies or five years’ Crown service, good character, a sufficient
knowledge of English and the intention to reside in the United Kingdom or a
colony or to remain in Crown service. The requirements for registration are
similar except that most Commonwealth and Irish citizens settled in Britain
by 1st January 1973 have the right to be registered after completing five years’
ordinary residence without satisfying any other requirement. Some 70,000
persons acquired citizenship by naturalisation and registration in I974'
A citizen of the United Kingdom and Colonies does not forfeit his citizen¬
ship by acquiring or possessing the nationality or citizenship of another
country (although he can lose it automatically if the territory from which he
derives it becomes independent); nor does a woman who is a citizen of the
United Kingdom and Colonies lose her citizenship by marriage to a foreign
national. Indeed, a citizen cannot be deprived of his citizenship against his will
except in very exceptional circumstances (for example, if he has obtained
naturalisation or registration as a citizen by fraud). Any man or woman who
is a citizen is, however, at liberty to renounce citizenship if he or she possesses
or acquires the nationality or citizenship of another country.
Citizens of the other independent Commonwealth countries are, in United
Kingdom law, British subjects or Commonwealth citizens and, as such, enjoy
full political and civic rights if resident in Britain.
In England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland, English is the language
predominantly spoken. In Wales, however, Welsh, a form of British Celtic,
is the first language of the majority of the population in most of the western
counties and was spoken by 21 per cent of the population aged three years and
THE LAND AND THE PEOPLE
!3
over (some 542,400 people) at the time of the 1971 census. The Welsh
Language Council, an official body, promotes the use of the language. The
Welsh Language Act 1967 affirms the equal validity of Welsh with English
in the administration of justice1 * * * and conduct of government business through¬
out Wales. In Scotland some 88,000 persons in 1971, mainly in the Highlands
and western coastal regions, were able to speak the Scottish form of Gaelic.
A few families in Northern Ireland still speak the Irish form of Gaelic. The
Manx and Cornish varieties of Celtic are no longer effectively living languages,
although, in the Isle of Man, Manx is used in addition to English for certain
official pronouncements.
English is spoken throughout the Channel Islands, but a Norman-French
patois is still also spoken there by some people. French is still the official
language of Jersey, used for ceremonial and official procedure; both French
and English are used in the courts. In Guernsey, however, English is now used
for almost all official proceedings.

Distribution of
Population
BRITAIN 1976: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
The population of England is, and has been for centuries, greater than that
of all other parts of Britain. The distribution of the British population by
country, as enumerated by censuses in 1901, 1931, 1961, and 1971 (or nearest
possible estimate) and estimated in 1974, is shown in Table 1, which also gives
figures for the Isle of Man and the Channel Islands. The populations of
England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland were in every case greater in
1961 than in 1931 and in 1931 than in 1901, and they rose again between 1961
and 1974. The high rate of increase in England is partly due to migration from
the other three countries.
Geography, history and economic factors have given rise to the differences
between the four countries and to an uneven distribution of the population
within them. Table 2 shows the areas and populations of the metropolitan
and non-metropolitan counties and standard regions of England and Wales,

British population lives in a belt across England with south Lancashire and
West Yorkshire at one end, and the London area at the other, having the
industrialised Midlands at its centre. Other areas with large populations are

the central lowlands of Scotland; north-east England from north of the
river Tyne down to the river Tees; south-east Wales; the Bristol area; and
the English Channel coast from Poole, in Dorset, eastwards. Less densely
populated areas are the eastern fringes of England between the Wash and
the Thames estuary, and the far south-west. Most of the mountainous parts
of Britain, including much of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland and the
central Pennines in northern England, are very sparsely populated.
These differences in average density between different regions have been
widening. Though in most places the population has been increasing, there
have been local differences in the rate of increase. Many places in the Midlands
and south-east England, some south-coast areas and some of the most
prosperous parts of northern England, Wales and Scotland have had increases
well above the average national rate, while remote country areas in northern
England, Wales and Scotland and some coastal resorts have had relatively
small increases. The differences result from the combined effect of natural
increase in almost all areas and net migration towards the expanding employ¬
ment opportunities of the Midlands and south and towards certain retirement
areas, mainly on the south coast.
Throughout Britain the population is predominantly urban and suburban,
although there may be access to large parks, commons and other expanses of
open country within the urban area. Table 2 shows the distribution of the
people of Britain between areas of a generally urban and areas of a generally
rural nature (many of the non-metropolitan counties in England and Wales,
however, contain areas of urban population).
During the nineteenth century the labour demands of newly developing
industry drew great numbers from the countryside; by the end of the century
three-quarters of the British population was living in towns and the large
conurbation was already the dominant type of British community. During the
twentieth century the suburbs of the towns in these population centres have
continued to spread and merge. Over one-third of the population lives in
Greater London, the metropolitan counties, and the Scottish conurbation of
Central Clydeside (centred on the city of Glasgow). The centres of the metro¬
politan counties are the cities of Manchester (Greater Manchester), Liverpool
(Merseyside), Sheffield (South Yorkshire), Newcastle upon Tyne (Tyne and
Wear), Birmingham and Wolverhampton (West Midlands), and Leeds and
Bradford (West Yorkshire).
There has been a recent decline in the numbers of people living in inner
urban areas, balanced or surpassed by the increase of population in and
beyond the outer suburban fringes (limited in certain areas by the ‘green belt’
policy where little development is permitted). This applies most strikingly to
London, also to the outer areas of the West Midlands and Merseyside con¬
urbations and to such towns and cities as Bristol, Derby, Liverpool, Norwich,
Oxford, Portsmouth and Sheffield.
Factors in the further dispersal of the last few years have been the spread of
car ownership, expansion in public transport serving journeys to work, private
property developments to meet the demand for housing, and planned transfers
of population to the new towns around London, Glasgow, the West Midlands
and Merseyside and to selected expanding towns near to the great cities.
The extent to which people in Britain move about the country for work,
housing or study purposes is shown by the finding that 10-7 per cent of
residents in Great Britain in 1966 had changed their address in the preceding

year and 33 per cent in the previous five years; 4-2 per cent had moved
between England and Scotland or Wales, or from one region to another,
during 1961-66.

SOCIAL LIFE
This section gives some points of general interest about the structure of
households and social habits in Britain as a background to the information
given in later chapters of the handbook, in particular those on housing,
transport and environmental planning. Leisure activities are described in
Chapter 23.
The way of life of the people of Britain has been changing rapidly through¬
out the twentieth century. Underlying causes include a lower birth rate,
longer expectation of life, earlier marriage, widening educational oppor¬
tunities and technical progress, particularly in communications and transport.
The changes can be roughly classified as changes in the structure of house¬
holds, in housing and environment, in the pattern of living and in social
attitudes. The following account applies primarily to Great Britain. Many of
the same factors are at work in Northern Ireland but their effect is modified
both by the earlier background of life in the Province and the emergency
situation of recent years.
THE LAND AND THE PEOPLE
The Structure
of
Households
Housing
and
Environment
i?
There were at the time of the 1971 population census some 18-2 million
households in Great Britain. The majority of people (some 97 per cent) live
in private households (in families or on their own). The remainder include
such people as residents in hotels, people in hospital, in the armed services
and in educational or other institutions. Most people marry in their twenties
(women in their early twenties and men in their middle twenties), some
90 per cent being married by the time they are 30. There were approximately
27-5 million married people at the time of the 1971 population census and of
these about 25 million were estimated to be married couples living together in
some 12-5 million separate families containing some 46 million people, the
remainder living either on their own or with other persons or families, except
for a small number living in institutions. Of the 12-5 million families, nearly
eight million, comprising 32 million people, contained a married couple and
their children or grandchildren. There were, in addition, 1-2 million families
consisting of one parent living with children or grandchildren. About half of
these, most of them women, were bringing up between them about one million
dependent children. The rest were living with adult children or grandchildren.
The average size of households has continued to fall progressively, from
over four persons in 1911 to 3-i in 1961 and 2-9 in 1971. It is estimated that in
rg?1 17-1 per cent of households consisted of one person only, 31-3 per cent
of two, 19-4 per cent of three, 18 per cent of four and 14-2 per cent of five or
more. However, about half of the small households (one or two persons)
contained a person over 60 years old while the other half consisted in large
measure of young, often recently married couples, without children and of
young people who had left home to live on their own during the first years of
their employment and increasingly during the last stages of their education.
Relatively few people in their middle years lived in small families without
children.
Over 80 per cent of the households in Britain live in houses and only about
18 per cent in flats or rooms. In the centre and inner areas of large towns
and the inner streets of smaller towns and villages, terrace houses, most
of them built in the early years of the present century and many improved
to modern standards with the aid of government grants, still provide accom¬
modation for about 30 per cent of households. More recent inner urban
housing development is mainly the conversion of large old houses into flats,
or the construction of blocks of flats or maisonettes, usually of not more than
four or five storeys. Very few tall blocks are now being built, though there
was a certain amount of tall building in the 1960s.
The main housing development of the past 50 to 60 years, however, has
been suburban. More than half Britain’s families now live in houses, grouped
in small terraces, or semi-detached or detached, usually of two storeys with
gardens, and providing two main ground-floor living rooms, a kitchen, from
two to four bedrooms, a bathroom, and one or two lavatories—the sizes
needed to meet the needs of the average married couple while they are
responsible for growing children. From 1919 I939 such houses were often
located along main roads, a pattern which became known as ‘ribbon develop¬
ment . More recently the pattern has tended to change to one of housing in
estates set back from the main thoroughfares with more attention given to
amenities such as health centres and community centres which provide for
various activities, often run by associations of the residents. Standards of
new housing have improved considerably in recent years and many more
houses now have modern conveniences. It is estimated that in 1972 over
BRITAIN 1976: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
89 per cent of households in Great Britain had exclusive use of a bath or
shower, that 95 per cent had sole use of a lavatory and that 37 per cent were
centrally heated. About 93 per cent of all new dwellings built by local authori¬
ties in England and Wales in 1973 had central heating. At the same time
improved housing design and greater use of labour-saving equipment and
materials have combined to lighten the burden of housework. Nearly nine
households in ten have a vacuum cleaner, more than two in three a washing
machine, three out of four a refrigerator, one in three an electric food mixer
and nearly all an electric iron. An increasing, but still comparatively small,
number have a dish-washing machine, deep freeze and tumble drier. Probably
less than five per cent of households employ any regular paid help and less
than half of one per cent in England and Wales have a resident servant. Some
households get help through the local authority home help service because
of particular need, for example, if there is an invalid or elderly person in the
house or because the mother is having her baby at home. People in full-time
work benefit, among other things, from launderettes with extended opening
hours and from shops, particularly supermarkets, which stay open later at
least one evening a week.
Over half of all families now own their own dwelling (usually a house),
though half of these home owners still have further repayments of mortgages
to make. Most of the other households rent an unfurnished house or flat
either from a local authority (an increasing trend) or from a private landlord
(a falling trend). Though many people, perhaps 20 per cent of all heads of
households, seem to stay nearly all their lives in the house into which they
moved on marriage, there are always a number of individuals and whole
families (perhaps between six and nine per cent of families each year) changing
their homes for a variety of reasons. Much of this movement is to another
house in the same or a neighbouring area, but there are certain patterns of
movement to new areas, for example, the drift away from very remote rural
areas and from the centres of large towns towards suburbs and rural areas
accessible to towns and the movement of people on retirement into country
and seaside—particularly the south and south-east coasts.
Increasingly housing and services in the modern environment are based
on the assumption that families will have cars. New housing estates are
often some distance from public transport and from work places, schools
and the main shops. Over half of all households and about two-thirds of the
households owning their own home have a car while nine per cent have two
or more cars. By mid-1974 there were nearly 14 million cars licensed on the
roads in Great Britain compared with 5-5 million in i960.
The spread of car ownership is also one of the main reasons for the large-
scale urban reconstruction and road development programmes which are
being carried out. In general, towns and cities are being altered to accommo¬
date more traffic and house more people; experiments are being tried in
remodelling town centres with pedestrian precincts; by-passes help to reduce
traffic in city centres. In addition to new roads and motorways, more reser¬
voirs are needed to supply the growing demand for water and more lines to
carry electric power for the growing volume of appliances.
In modern industrial society in a densely populated country there is
much scope for conflict between the need for communal facilities and the
desire to preserve existing beauty or places of historic interest, and between
potential users of a new service and people whose way of life is threatened by
the need to accommodate it. As a result the activities of the established amenity
societies, such as the National Trust and the Council for the Protection
THE LAND AND THE PEOPLE
The Pattern
of Living
19
of Rural England, are being supplemented to a growing extent by those of
groups formed expressly to safeguard the amenities of a particular area and
to give publicity to the views of the people they represent.
Growing public concern about the dangers both to health and to the
natural environment which can be caused by the disposal of industrial and
human waste, by exhaust fumes and by the rising volume of noise is reflected
in the appointment by the Government of a standing Royal Commission on
Environmental Pollution, a Clean Air Council and an Advisory Council on
Noise. Voluntary societies include the National Society for Clean Air, the
Noise Abatement Society and the Council for Nature.
Most people have considerably more free time, more ways in which to spend
it, greater choice of occupation and higher real incomes than had previous
generations. Agreed hours of full-time work are usually from 35 to 40 hours
a week although many manual workers actually work somewhat longer be¬
cause of voluntary overtime work while the hours worked by women and
girls average somewhat less. It was estimated, from a study in the London
metropolitan area, that in 1970 a married man aged thirty to forty-nine spent
nearly 50 hours a week on paid work and travel to work, nearly ten hours
on household tasks, three on non-work travel, 74 on eating and sleeping and
nearly 32 on leisure. Women working full time spent on average only 40 hours
each week at their work (and travel to it) and 23 hours at household tasks,
three hours on non-work travel, 76 hours on eating and sleeping and nearly
26 hours on leisure. Women working part time and women not in paid
work spent respectively 12 and 22 additional hours a week on household
tasks.
Almost all full-time employees are entitled to a paid holiday each year
in addition to public holidays. The proportion receiving a minimum of three
weeks’ holiday a year has substantially increased to nearly 95 per cent of all
employees by the middle of 1974. The majority of employees work a five-day
week. Britain, however, has fewer public holidays than nearly all other
European countries.
In the last decade average earnings have risen more than prices. The
increased diversity of market products and greater spending power have
permitted a much freer expression of individual taste for everyone. Styles
in clothes, for example, vary more according to age group than according to
income group or occupation. The real incomes of manual workers, especially
unskilled workers and young people under 18 years old, have risen both in
absolute terms and in relation to the incomes of non-manual workers.
According to a study published in 1975, the proportion of married couples
and single people over 18 without any financial assets had declined from nearly
a third in the early 1950s to almost one-tenth in 1974.
The weakest groups economically in an age of inflation are retired people
wholly or mainly dependent on static or non-indexed pensions or fixed-
interest investments, households on supplementary assistance, households in
which the father is dead or absent, and low-wage earners with a number of
young children. If these groups and the richest four per cent of householders
are excluded, an average pattern for the distribution of household expenditure
can be calculated which is not very different from the average expenditure
patterns of households of different structures and income levels, though it
cannot of course take account of idiosyncracies of individual households. The
main differences of expenditure patterns of those with more money are the
increased amounts for restaurant meals, cars and holidays.
20
BRITAIN 1976: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
The general pattern of expenditure has been changing. Expenditure on
food now accounts for a smaller share of total consumer expenditure than it
did ten years ago. Increases have taken place, however, in expenditure on
motor vehicles, housing, alcoholic drink, recreation and entertainment. The
proportion of expenditure on clothing and footwear has fallem At thesame
time there have been noticeable changes in the types of clothes worn for
example the growing range of leisure clothes, the more adventurous sty ing
in men’s’ wear, and the large turnover in mass-produced fashions for young
people, with frequent changes of style which have also reflected the impact o
taste of foreign travel and of immigration from Asia, Africa and the WestIn •
The general level of nutrition is high. The movement towards a greater
use of convenience (including frozen) foods, and imported foods in the 1960s,
has been partly offset by a reversion to a slightly less-expensive diet Increases
in meat and fish prices have resulted in greater demand for poultry. Cheese and
vegetables, other than potatoes, are among the foodstuffs consumed in greater
quantities than a decade ago while the consumption of bread and flour has
declined. Regional differences in the consumption of certain foods occur,
for example, more butter is eaten in Wales than elsewhere and the Scots eat
more biscuits and cakes. Tea remains the most popular beverage but many
more people are drinking coffee, including ‘instant’ coffee than before.
The consumption of considerable quantities of sweets and chocolate (some
eight oz.—226-8 gr.—a person a week) remains a notable feature of Bntis
Many more people are now interested in ‘good food’, both traditional
English and exotic dishes. Restaurants providing the national dishes of
other countries are to be found throughout Britain; Chinese restaurants
predominate but there are also many which specialise in Indian and Italian
food. While the traditional fish and chip shops remain popular, their faci 1 les
have been supplemented by other ‘take-away’ shops offering a wide variety of
dishes. Interest in cooking has also widened and menus have become more
imaginative, helped by better equipped kitchens, cookery journalism, includ¬
ing television demonstrations, and a great variety of recipe books. Beer is the
most popular alcoholic drink in Britain, consumption per head in 1974 being
nearly 201 pints; but increased affluence and tastes acquired abroad have
increased the demand for wines, spirits and liqueurs—during the 1960s sales
of wines nearly doubled and consumption increased by nearly 54 per cent
between 1971 and 1974, from 7-8 pints to 11-9 pints a head a year.
The gradual reduction of class differences has continued throughout the
twentieth century. The old middle-class way of life with its resident servants
has almost entirely disappeared. Big town houses have mostly been converted
into flats, offices or nursing homes, while country estates have become schoo s,
rehabilitation or recreation centres or wild-life parks. The proportion of the
working population in non-manual occupations is growing and an increasing
number of people in professional or managerial occupations are the children
of manual workers. More and more people of every occupation and a wide
range of economic levels follow a way of life which is broadly similar—the
compact, convenient house on a housing estate; the car that maintains the
link with work-places, schools and shops; the evening hours watching tele¬
vision; the weekend devoted to car cleaning, gardening, ‘do-it-yourselt
decoration and maintenance of the home, hobbies, recreation and outings.
There may often also be animals as pets (dogs, cats, hamsters, and budgeri¬
gars), for sport (greyhounds and racing pigeons) or for ornament (tanks ot
tropical fish).
THE LAND AND THE PEOPLE
21
Social
Attitudes
Aspiration to a broadly similar way of life is shared by many members of
the immigrant communities who have settled in Britain since the 1950s
though, as new arrivals, sometimes with a poor command of the English
language or none at all, they may face problems of limited employment
opportunities and inadequate housing. Evidence of immigrant cultures can
be seen in the urban areas where most of them have settled—national dress
worn by many Asian women, Indian films, Asian food shops, market stalls
with West Indian fruit and vegetables—and many schools have adapted their
curricula to allow host and immigrant communities better to understand each
other s traditions. The needs of immigrant children for language training are
being met in special centres run by the education authorities, of workers, in¬
creasingly, in colleges of further education and in the factories themselves,
and of Asian women in groups run by local community relations councils
and other voluntary organisations.
The greatest social changes have been in the lives of women. During the
twentieth century there has been a dramatic shortening of the proportion
of a woman s life devoted to the care of children. A woman marrying at the
end of the nineteenth century would probably have been in her middle
twenties, and would be likely to have seven or eight children of whom four
or five survived to the age of five. By the time the youngest was 15 she would
have been in her early fifties and would expect to live a further 20 years,
during which custom, opportunity and health made it unusual for her to get
paid work. Today women marry younger and have fewer children. Usually
a woman s youngest child will be 15 when she is 45, and she can expect to
live another 35 years and is likely to take paid work until retirement at 60.
Even while she has the care of children, her work is lightened by household
appliances and convenience foods. This significant change in women’s life
pattern has only recently begun to have its full effect on women’s economic
position. Up to about 20 years ago some 85 per cent of girls left school at the
minimum age of 15 and most of them took a full-time job. However, when
they married, they usually left work at once and often never returned to it.
Thus, single women, nearly half of them under 25, formed some 56 per cent
of the female labour force. Today the school-leaving age is 16, many girls
stay at school after that age, and though women tend to marry younger, more
married women stay at work at least until shortly before their first child is
born. Aery many more subsequently return to full- or part-time work. Such
changes have led to a new relationship in marriage, with the husband accept-
a greater share of the burdens and satisfactions of family life, and with
both partners sharing more equally in financing and running the home
according to their respective capacities and interests. However, in spite of
these major social changes and in spite of the removal of practically all sex
discrimination in political and legal rights, the British Government believes
that tradition and prejudice still handicap women in their working careers
and personal lives. Accordingly, during 1975, proclaimed by the United
Nations as International Women’s Year, a Sex Discrimination Bill was intro¬
duced into Parliament prohibiting discrimination against women or men on
the ground of their sex.
The changed position of women and the changing attitude of society towards
their position is part of a more general change in social attitudes. Over the
past 20 years there has developed a more informed tolerance of deviant
behaviour and an unwillingness to penalise individuals with particular
problems. This new spirit of toleration is reflected, for instance, in the
22

rJrirtions on certain freedoms must be extended in the interests of society

drRSeladodnsfihripsr,between the generations are also undergoing considerable
change with the result that there is today a greater readiness on e par

more influence in shlphig society. This desire for personal mvolvemem

2 Government
Devolution
GENERAL SURVEY
The United Kingdom is a monarchical State. It is one of the independent
members of the Commonwealth,1 all of whose members recognise the Queen
as head of the Commonwealth, and a member nation of the European
Community which includes all the major powers of Western Europe and
over 80 per cent of its population (see p. 77).
The origins and traditions of the United Kingdom are to be found in each
of its four component parts: England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland.
England was united as a kingdom a thousand years ago, and Wales became
part of the kingdom during the middle ages. The thrones of England and
Scotland were dynastically united in 1603, and in 1707 legislation passed in
the two countries provided for the establishment of a single Parliament of
Great Britain with supreme authority both in England and Wales and in
Scotland. Ireland had had links with the kingdom of England since the
thirteenth century, and in 1800 the creation of the United Kingdom was
completed by a union joining the Irish Parliament to that of Great Britain.
In 1922 Southern Ireland (now the Irish Republic) became a self-governing
country. The six counties of Northern Ireland had in 1920 been given their
own subordinate Parliament, and voted to remain within the United Kingdom.
Present arrangements for the government of Northern Ireland are described
on page 58.
The United Kingdom Parliament at Westminster in London—with an
elected chamber comprising members from English, Scottish, Welsh and
Northern Ireland constituencies—therefore represents people sharing very
varied backgrounds and traditions. It has ultimate authority for government
and law-making, but administrative arrangements have developed in such a
way as to take account of the particular needs of different areas.
England and Wales on the one hand and Scotland on the other have different
systems of law, a different judiciary, different education systems, different
systems of local government and, for most domestic matters, different govern¬
ment departments. In Scotland departments are grouped under a Secretary
of State (see p. 55), and in the administration of Welsh affairs there is a con¬
siderable measure of devolution under a Secretary of State (see p. 55).
To build on this existing devolution of decision making from London, the
Government is proposing the establishment of elected assemblies for Scot¬
land and Wales. The assemblies would meet, initially at least, in Edinburgh
and Cardiff respectively. The Scottish assembly would have law-making
powers within areas for which separate Scottish legislation already exists
(for example, housing, health and education) and the Welsh assembly would
assume certain powers over delegated legislation. The assemblieg would also
The other members are: Canada, Australia, New Zealand, India, Bangladesh, Sri
Lanha, Ghana, Malaysia, Nigeria, Cyprus, Sierra Leone, Tanzania, Jamaica, Trinidad
and lobago, Uganda, Kenya, Malawi, Malta, Zambia, The Gambia, Singapore
Guyana, Botswana, Lesotho, Barbados, Mauritius, Swaziland, Tonga, Western Samoa’
rij1, the Bahamas, Grenada and Papua New Guinea. Nauru is a special member par-
ticipating in functional activities but not in meetings of Heads of Government.
24
BRITAIN 1976: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
take over some executive functions. Membership would be on the same system
as membership of the United Kingdom Parliament. There would be a block
erant to the assemblies which would take into account local needs and the
desirability of some uniformity of standards in all parts of the United ing-
dom. Allocation of the grant among different services would be a matter tor
the assemblies. .
The establishment of the assemblies would not, however, detract in any
wav from the overriding interest of all British people in the determinatton of
United Kingdom policies as a whole. The United Kingdom Parliament and
central Government ministers would remain fully responsible for overa
British interests; Scotland and Wales would retain their present representa-
tion in Parliament; and there would continue to be Secretaries of State or
Scotland and Wales to act as full members of the Government forming
United Kingdom policies. , u a.u ^
Consultations are taking place in the regions of England to see whether ther
is a case for devolving further decision-making powers from London (existing
devolution includes a series of economic planning councils and boards).
(For arrangements in Northern Ireland, see p. 58.)
Ministerial responsibility for devolution policy is held by the Lord Presi¬
dent of the Council, a senior member of the Cabinet. He is assisted by other
ministers, and works in collaboration with the Secretaries of State for Scot¬
land and Wales. At official level a new unit within the Cabinet Office works
closely with divisions of the Scottish and Welsh Offices, and reports to the
Lord President.
Channel Islands
and Isle of Man
The Channel Islands and the Isle of Man (which are Crown dependencies
not part of the United Kingdom) have their own legislative assemblies and
systems of local administration and of law, and their own courts. At the same
time, they have a special relationship with the United Kingdom because of
their proximity to it and the antiquity of their connection with the Crown.
The United Kingdom Government is responsible for their defence, their
international relations and, ultimately, their good government.
The
Constitution The United Kingdom constitution is formed partly by statute, partly by
common law and partly by precepts and practices, known as conventions
which have never been codified and are not directly enforceable in a court of
law, but which, nevertheless, have a binding force as rules of the constitution.
Because the constitution is not contained in any document, because it can be
altered by the passing of an Act of Parliament or by general agreement to vary,
abolish or create a convention, it can the more readily be adapted to changing
political conditions and ideas without serious disturbance to existing organs
and forms. . .
The organs of government in the United Kingdom constitution are readi y
distinguishable although their functions often intermingle and overlap. They
are:
1. the legislature, which consists of the Queen in Parliament, and is the
supreme authority in the realm (see p. 28);
2. the executive, which consists of: (a) the Government that is the Cabinet
and other ministers of the Crown, who are responsible for initiating and
directing national policy (see p. 41); (b) government departments, most of
them under the control of ministers and all staffed by civil servants, which
are responsible for administration at the national level (see p. 44); (Q local

authorities, which administer and manage many services at the local
level (see p. 66); and (d) public corporations which may be responsible
for the operation of particular nationalised industries (see p. 197) or of a
social or cultural service, for example, and which are subject to ministerial
control in varying degrees; and
3. the judiciary, which determines common law and interprets statutes, and is
independent of both the legislature and the executive (see p. 94).
THE MONARCHY
The monarchy is the most ancient secular institution in the United Kingdom.
Its continuity has been broken only once in over a thousand years; and, in
spite of interruptions in the direct line of succession, the hereditary principle
upon which it was founded has never been abandoned. The royal title in the
United Kingdom is: ‘Elizabeth the Second, by the Grace of God of the United
Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and of Her other Realms
and Territories Queen, Head of the Commonwealth, Defender of the Faith’.
The form of the royal title is varied for the other member nations of the
Commonwealth of which the Queen is Sovereign, to suit the particular
circumstances of each.
The seat of the monarchy is in the United Kingdom. In the Channel
Islands and the Isle of Man the Queen is represented by a Lieutenant-
Governor. In the other member nations of the Commonwealth of which
the Queen is Sovereign, her representative is the Governor-General, who is
appointed by her on the advice of the ministers of the country concerned and
is wholly independent of the United Kingdom Government. In the United
Kingdom dependencies the Queen is usually represented by Governors who
are appointed by the Crown, having various executive and legislative powers,
and are responsible to the United Kingdom Government for the good govern¬
ment of the countries concerned.
The title to the Crown derives partly from statute and partly from common
law rules of descent. Lineal Protestant descendants of Princess Sophia (the
Electress of Hanover, grand-daughter of James I of England) are alone
eligible to succeed, and although succession is not bound to continue in its
present line, it cannot now be altered other than by common consent of the
member nations of the Commonwealth of which the Queen is Sovereign.
Rules of descent provide that the sons of the Sovereign are in order of succes¬
sion to the throne according to their seniority; if there are no sons, the
daughters succeed in order of their seniority. When a daughter succeeds, she
becomes Queen-Regnant and the powers of the Crown are vested in her as
fully and effectively as though she were a king. By convention, the consort of
a king takes the rank and style of her husband; the converse, however, does
not apply and the constitution has never attached any special rank or privileges
to the husband of the Queen-Regnant although in practice he may fill an
important role in the life of the nation.
There is no interregnum between the death of one Sovereign and the
accession of another. Immediately on the death of his or her predecessor the
new Sovereign is proclaimed at an Accession Council to which all members
of the Privy Council are summoned. The Lords Spiritual and Temporal, the
Lord Mayor, aldermen and other leading citizens of the City of London, and
the High Commissioners in London of the member nations of the Common¬
wealth are also invited to attend.

Acts of
Government
BRITAIN 1976: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
The coronation of the Sovereign follows the accession after an interval of
possibly a year or more. The ceremony has remained much the same m
substance for over a thousand years although the details have frequently
been modified to bring it into conformity with the customs of the time
The coronation service is held at Westminster Abbey m the presence of
representatives of the Lords, the Commons and all the great public interests
in the United Kingdom, of the Prime Ministers and leading members of the
other Commonwealth countries and of representatives of foreign States.
The Queen is the personification of the State. In law, she is the head o e
executive, an integral part of the legislature, the head of the judiciary, the
commander-in-chief of all the armed forces of the Crown and the temporal
‘governor’ of the established Church of England. In practice, as a result of a
long evolutionary process during which the absolute power of the monarc y
has been progressively reduced, the Queen acts on the advice of her ministers
which she cannot constitutionally ignore. She reigns, but she does not rue.
The United Kingdom is governed by Her Majesty’s Government in the
name of the Queen. ... , u a a
Within this framework, and in spite of a trend during the past hundre
years towards assigning powers directly to ministers without any necessity
for royal intervention, there are still important acts of government which
require the participation of the Queen. These include the summoning,
prorogation and dissolution of Parliament; giving Royal Assent to Bi s
passed by both Houses of Parliament; making appointments to aU important
State offices, including those of government ministers, judges, officers in e
armed forces, governors, diplomats and all the leading positions in e
established Church of England; conferring peerages, knighthoods and other
honours1; and remitting all or part of the penalty imposed on a person con¬
victed of a crime. An important function is the appointment of the Prime
Minister. This is normally automatic, and the Queen must invite the leader o
the political party commanding a majority in the House of Commons to form
a government. If, however, no party has a majority, or if the majority pa y
has no recognised leader, the Queen must select a Prime Minister, and can
consult anyone she wishes. In international affairs, the Queen as Head of
State has the power to declare war and make peace, to recognise foreign
States and governments, to conclude treaties and to annexe or cede territory
With rare exceptions (such as in the appointment of the Prime Minister)
these and other acts involving the use of ‘royal prerogative’ powers are nowa¬
days exercised by government ministers who are responsible to Parliamen
and can be questioned about a particular policy. The law does not require
Parliament’s prior authority before such powers can be exercised, but Parlia¬
ment has the power to pass legislation to restrict or abolish a prerogative rig .
Ministerial responsibility for the exercise of powers by the Crown does not
however detract from the importance of the Queen’s participation m the
smooth working of government. She holds meetings of the Privy Council
gives audiences to her ministers and other holders of office at home and
overseas receives accounts of Cabinet decisions, reads dispatches and signs
innumerable State papers; she must be informed and consulted on every
aspect of the national life; and she must show complete impartiality.
1 Although most honours are conferred by the Queen on ^ adv ^ ^
Minister, a few are conferred on her personal selection—the Order of the barter, tne
Order of the Thistle, the Order of Merit and the Royal Victorian Order.

Ceremonial and
Royal Visits
Royal Income
and Expenditure
BRITAIN 1976: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Such is the significance attached to these royal functions that provision has
been made for a regent to be appointed to fulfil them if the Sovereign is
totally incapacitated (or is under the age of 18 years on accession to the throne).
The regent would be the Prince of Wales, and thereafter those in succession
to the throne who are of age. In the event of the Sovereign’s partial incapacity
or absence abroad, provision is made for the appointment of Counsellors of
State (the Duke of Edinburgh, the four adult persons next in succession to the
Crown and the Queen Mother) to whom the Sovereign may delegate certain
royal functions. Counsellors of State may not, however, dissolve Parliament
(except on the express instructions of the Sovereign), or create peers.
Ceremonial has always been associated with British kings and queens and,
in spite of the changes that have taken place in the outlook of both the
Sovereign and the people, many traditional customs and usages remain.
Royal marriages and royal funerals are marked by public ceremony. The
birthday of the Sovereign is officially celebrated early in June by Trooping
the Colour on the Horse Guards Parade and is also celebrated as Common¬
wealth Day. State banquets take place when a foreign monarch or head of
State visits the United Kingdom; investitures are held at Buckingham
Palace; and royal processions add significance to such occasions as the open¬
ing of Parliament, when the Queen drives in state from Buckingham Palace.
The Queen and other members of the royal family visit many parts of the
United Kingdom every year, and their presence at the inauguration of scien¬
tific artistic, industrial and charitable works of national importance ensures
nation-wide interest and support. The Queen pays State visits to foreign
governments, always accompanied by the Duke of Edinburgh, and undertakes
lengthy tours in other countries of the Commonwealth. Other members of the
royal family pay official and private visits overseas.
More than three-quarters of all expenditure arising from the official duties of
the royal family is borne on the votes of public departments including or
example, the costs of the royal yacht, the Queen’s Flight, travel by train
and the upkeep of the royal palaces. Apart from this the Queen s public
expenditure is financed from the Civil List, approved by Parliament her
private expenditure as Sovereign is met from the Privy Purse, and h
personal expenditure as a private individual from her own personal resources.
The annual Civil List provision of £1-4 million covers the cost of staff a
expenses incurred in carrying out the Queen’s official duties as head o
State. Annual allowances approved by Parliament are specifically made to
certain other members of the royal family, but not to the Queen s eldest son
the Prince of Wales, who as Duke of Cornwall is entitled to the net revenue
of the estate of the Duchy of Cornwall (he has voluntarily agreed to surrender
one half of the revenue to the nation). In addition, £85,000 is provided to
meet the official expenses incurred by some members of the royal family for
whom Parliament has not specifically provided.
PARLIAMENT
The supreme legislative authority in the United Kingdom is the Qu^en m
Parliament, that is to say, the Queen and the two Houses of Parliament the
House of Lords and the elected House of Commons.
The three elements of Parliament are outwardly separate; they are con-
stituted on different principles; they work in different places; and they mee

together only on occasions of symbolic significance such as the coronation, or
the State opening of Parliament when the Commons are summoned by the
Queen to the House of Lords. As a law-making organ of State, however,
Parliament is a corporate body and cannot legislate without the concurrence
of all its parts (except in the case of Bills passed under the Parliament Acts
1911 and 1949).
The Parliament at Westminster can legislate for the United Kingdom as a
whole, or any of the constituent countries separately, or for any combination
of them. It can also legislate for the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man, which
are Crown dependencies and not part of the United Kingdom, and have
subordinate legislatures1 which legislate on island affairs.
Because it is not subject to the type of legal restraints imposed on the
legislatures of countries with formal written constitutions, Parliament is
virtually free to legislate as it pleases: generally to make or unmake any law; to
legalise past illegalities and make void and punishable what was lawful when
done and thus reverse the decisions of the ordinary courts; and to destroy
firmly established conventions or turn a convention into binding law. If
both Houses agreed, it could even prolong its own life beyond the normal
period without consulting the electorate. In other words, Parliament is
sovereign.
In practice, however, Parliament does not assert its supremacy in this way.
Its members bear in mind the common law which has grown up in Britain
throughout the centuries and act as far as possible in accordance with prece¬
dent and tradition. Moreover, although the validity of an Act of Parliament
that has been duly passed, legally promulgated and published by the proper
authority cannot be disputed in the law courts, no Parliament would be likely
to pass an Act which it knew would receive no public support. The system
of party government in Britain ensures that Parliament legislates with its
responsibility to the electorate in mind.
On 1 st January 1973, when Britain acceded to the European Community,
the provisions of the European Communities Act 1972 (passed by Parliament)
applying the Treaty of Rome became operative (see p. 77)’ These provide for
various types of Community legislation, including regulations, which take
direct effect in member countries, and directives, which are binding as to the
result achieved upon each member State to which they are addressed, but
allow the national parliaments to choose the form and method of implementa¬
tion. Under the Treaty of Rome the national parliaments delegate a number
of their members to sit in the European Parliament (see p. 80).
A Parliament (in the sense of a parliamentary period) has a maximum dura¬
tion of five years, but may be, and nearly always is, dissolved, and a general
election held, before the end of this term. The maximum life may, however,
be prolonged by legislation passed in the usual way (this happened for
example during the two world wars). Dissolution is ordered by the Queen
on the advice of the Prime Minister, by means of a royal proclamation which,
besides dissolving the existing Parliament, orders the issue of writs for an
election, and announces the date on which the new Parliament is to meet
(not less than 20 days after the dissolution). The proclamation is followed as
1 The legislatures of the Channel Islands (the States of Jersey and the States of
Guernsey) and the Isle of Man (the Tynwald Court) consist of the Queen, the Privy
Council and the local assemblies. It is the duty of the Home Secretary, as the member
ot the Privy Council primarily concerned with island affairs, to scrutinise each legislative
measure before it is submitted to the Queen in Council.
BRITAIN 1976: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
soon as practicable by the issue of writs in each constituency to cause an
election to be held on the day named.
The life of a Parliament is divided into sessions. Each usually lasts tor one
year—beginning and ending most often in October and interspersed with
‘adjournments’ at night, at weekends, at Christmas, Easter and the spring
holiday and during a long summer recess starting late in July or early in
August. The average number of ‘sitting’ days in a session is about 160 in the
House of Commons and about 125 in the House of Lords. At the start of each
session the Queen’s speech in the House of Lords outlines to the members of
both Houses the Government’s broad policies and proposed legislative pro¬
gramme. Each session is terminated by prorogation, a prerogative act which
appoints the day of meeting in a new session (on rare occasions Parliament
has been dissolved without prorogation), and a short speech is made on behalf
of the Queen summarising Parliament’s work during the past session. Parlia¬
ment then ‘stands prorogued’ until the new session opens. Whereas an
adjournment does not affect uncompleted business, the effect of a prorogation
is at once to terminate nearly all parliamentary business, so that all public Bills
not completed in the session lapse, and must be reintroduced in the next
unless they are to be abandoned.
The House of The House of Lords consists of the Lords Spiritual and the Lords Temporal.
Lords * The Lords Spiritual are the Archbishops of Canterbury and York, the Bishops
of London, Durham and Winchester, and 21 other bishops of the Church of
England, according to their seniority as diocesan bishops. The Lords Tem¬
poral may be sub-divided into (1) all hereditary peers and peeresses of Eng¬
land, Scotland, Great Britain and the United Kingdom who have not dis¬
claimed their peerages under the Peerage Act 1963, (2) all life peers and
peeresses created by the Crown under the Life Peerages Act 1958, and (3)
those Lords of Appeal in Ordinary who are appointed to assist the House in
the performance of its judicial duties and who remain members of the House
after their retirement. Hereditary peerages carry with them a right to sit in
the House of Lords (subject to certain statutory disqualifications), provided
the holder is 21 years of age or over, but anyone succeeding to a peerage may,
within 12 months of succession, disclaim that peerage for his or her lifetime.
Disclaimants lose their right to sit in the House of Lords but they gain the
right to vote at parliamentary elections and to offer themselves for election to
the House of Commons. No hereditary peerage has been conferred since 1965.
Not all peers with a right to sit in the House of Lords attend the sittings of
that House. Those who do not wish to attend may apply for leave of absence
for the duration of a Parliament.
Peers who frequently attend the House of Lords (the average daily atten¬
dance is about 270) include elder statesmen and others who have spent their
lives in public service. They receive no salary for their parliamentary work,
but they are entitled to travelling expenses from their homes to the Palace of
Westminster and (with the exception of the Lord Chancellor, the Lord
Chairman of Committees, the Law Lords and any member in receipt of a
salary as the holder of a ministerial office) they may claim payment for ex¬
penses incurred in attending the House (except for judicial sittings).
The House of Lords is presided over by the Lord Chancellor, who takes his
place on the woolsack as ex officio Speaker of the House. In the absence of
the Lord Chancellor his place may be taken by a deputy speaker appointed
by the Crown or a deputy chairman appointed by the House or, if neither a
deputy speaker nor a deputy chairman is present, by a speaker chosen by the
GOVERNMENT ^
Lords present. The first of the deputy speakers is the Lord Chairman of
Committees, who is appointed each session and takes the chair in all commit¬
tees, unless the House otherwise directs. The permanent officers include the
Clerk of the Parliaments, who is responsible for the records of proceedings
including judgments and for the promulgation of Acts of Parliament; the
other Clerks at the Table; the Gentleman Usher of the Black Rod, who is also
Serjeant-at-Arms in attendance upon the Lord Chancellor; and the Yeoman-
Usher who is Deputy Serjeant-at-Arms.
The House of
Commons
Parliamentary
Electoral
System
The House of Commons is a representative assembly elected by almost
universal adult suffrage and consists of men and women from all sections of the
community. There are 635 seats in the House of Commons (516 for England,
36 for Wales, 71 for Scotland, 12 for Northern Ireland).
General elections are held after a Parliament has been dissolved and a
new one summoned by the Sovereign. If a vacancy occurs in the House as a
result of the death or resignation1 of a member, or as a result of his elevation
to the House of Lords, a by-election takes place. Members are paid an annual
salary of £5,750 and an allowance of £3,200 a year for secretarial and research
expenses. They also have a number of other allowances, including travel
allowances, a supplement for London members and, for provincial members,
subsistence allowances. A select committee is considering the present support
facilities available to private members, in particular those relating to research
assistance.
The chief officer of the House of Commons is the Speaker, who is elected
by the members to preside over the House. Other parliamentary officers of the
House are the Chairman of Ways and Means, and one or two deputy chairmen
who act as Deputy Speakers; these officers are elected by the House on the
nomination of the Government and, like the Speaker, neither speak nor vote
other than in their official capacity.
Permanent officers of the House (that is, those who are not members of
Parliament) include the Clerk of the House of Commons, who conducts the
business of the House in the official departments under his control and is
charged with such matters as keeping the records, endorsing Bills and signing
orders, and the Serjeant-at-Arms, who attends upon the Speaker, executes the
orders of the House and is responsible for domestic staff arrangements.
For electoral purposes the United Kingdom is divided into constituencies,
each of which returns one member to the House of Commons. To ensure
equitable representation, four permanent Boundary Commissions (for
England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland) make periodic reviews of
constituencies and recommend any redistribution of seats that may seem
necessary in the light of population movements or for some other reason.
The most recent reorganisation of constituency boundaries was approved by
Parliament in 1970, and the elections of February and October 1974 were
fought on the revised boundaries.
The law relating to parliamentary elections is contained principally in the
Representation of the People Act 1949 as amended by the Act of 1969. Under
the provisions of these Acts, election to the House of Commons is decided by
If a member wishes to resign from the House, he may apply either for what is techni-

secret ballot in which British subjects (except members of the House of Lords)
and citizens of the Irish Republic are entitled to vote provided that they are 18
years old or over, and are not subject to any legal incapacity to vote. Those eli¬
gible to vote in any constituency are those who are annually recorded on a regis¬
ter of electors for the constituency as resident in that constituency on a date
fixed by statute. Each elector may cast one vote, normally in person at a
polling station, although members of the armed forces, Crown servants of the
United Kingdom and staff of the British Council employed overseas, and
wives or husbands of such persons, if resident overseas with their married
partners, may vote by proxy. Voting by post, or in certain cases by proxy
may also be allowed if the voter cannot attend in person because of physical
incapacity or the nature of his work or on grounds of religious observance.
British subjects who are on the electoral register and who are temporarily
abroad on business may vote by proxy if they cannot return in time for polling
day; those who are away on holiday cannot vote.
Voting is not compulsory, but of about 40 million people entitled to vote
in the elections of February and October 1974 some 787 per cent and 72*8 per
cent respectively cast their votes. The candidate who polls the most votes in
any constituency is elected; an absolute majority is not required.
Anyone, man or woman, who is entitled to vote and who has reached the
age of 21 can stand for election, except clergy of the Church of England,
the Church of Scotland, the Church of Ireland and the Roman Catholic
Church, undischarged bankrupts and certain other people holding offic^ of
profit under the Crown. This last category includes holders of judicial office,
civil servants, members of regular armed forces or the police service, members
of the legislature of any country or territory outside the Commonwealth, and
Government-nominated directors of commercial companies which are
ordinary trading concerns. A candidate is usually a member of one of the
main national political parties, although smaller political parties or less formal
groupings also nominate candidates, and individuals may be nominated with¬
out party support. . , . , „ ,
The conduct of elections, including the manner in which candidates can
nominated for election, is likewise governed for the most part by provisions o
the 1049 and 1969 Acts. The maximum sum of money that a candidate may
spend on his election campaign is £1,075, plus £0-06 for each eight electors in
a borough constituency and £0-06 for each six electors in a county constitu¬
ency. A candidate may send by post (free of postal charge) an election address
to each elector in his constituency. All other expenses, apart from the candi¬
date’s personal expenses, must be covered by the statutory sums.
The party system, existing in one form or another since the seventeenth
century, is an essential element in the working of the constitution.
The present system is based upon the existence of organised political parties,
each laying rival policies before the electorate. Whenever there is a general
election or a by-election, the parties may put up candidates for election; any
other citizen who wishes may also stand. The electorate then in icates, y 1 s
choice of candidate at the poll on election day, which of the opposing policies
it would like to see put into effect. . . _ ,

House of Commons receive ministerial appointments on the advice of the
Prime Minister. The largest minority party becomes the official Opposition
with its own leader1 and its own council of discussion or ‘shadow Cabinet’;
while the members of any other parties or any independents who have been
elected may support or oppose the Government according to their party’s or
their own view of the policy being debated at any given time. On occasions
no party succeeds in winning an overall majority of seats in the House of Com¬
mons; then a minority government or a coalition might be formed.
The effectiveness of the party system in Parliament rests upon the fact that
to a considerable extent Government and Opposition alike are carried on
by agreement: that is to say, the opposition agrees that the Government must
govern and therefore accepts its decisions; and the Government agrees that
the opposition should criticise and therefore sets time aside for that criticism
to be heard. The detailed arrangements of government business are settled
under the direction of the Prime Minister and the Leader of the House,’
by the Government Chief Whip in consultation with the Opposition Chief
Whip. The Chief Whips together constitute the ‘usual channels’ often
referred to in the House of Commons when the question of the possibility of
finding time for debating some particular issue is discussed. The direction of
the business of the House is primarily the responsibility of the Leader of the
House, and it is his duty to provide all reasonable facilities for the House to
debate matters about which it is concerned.
Outside Parliament, party control is exercised by the national and local
organisations. Inside Parliament, it is exercised by the Chief Whips and their
assistants (chosen within the party) whose duties include keeping members
informed of forthcoming parliamentary business, maintaining the voting
strength of their parties by ensuring the attendance of members at important

debates, and conveying upwards to the party leadership the opinions of their
back-bench members. The Government Chief Whip in the House of Com¬
mons is Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasury; of the other Government
Whips, three (one of whom is deputy Chief Whip) are officers of the Roya
Household, five hold titular posts as Lords Commissioners of the Treasury
and six are paid Assistant Whips. Salaries are likewise paid to the Chief
Opposition Whip and his counterpart in the House of Lords, and to two of
the Assistant Whips for the Opposition in the House of Commons. The
Government Whips in the House of Lords hold offices in the Royal Household
and sometimes act as spokesmen for the Government in debates.
Annual financial assistance from public funds helps opposition parties in
Parliament to carry out their business. It is limited to parties which had at
least two members elected at the last general election or one member elected
and a minimum of 150,000 votes cast. The formula is: £500 for every seat
and /i for every 200 votes, up to a maximum of £150,000. A committee is
examining whether public funds should be made available to political parties
for their work outside Parliament.
The main functions of Parliament are (1) to pass laws regulating the life of
the community, (2) to take formal action, cast in legislative form, to make
available finance for the needs of the community and to appropriate the funds
necessary for the services of the State, and (3) to put relevant facts and issues
before the electorate. By custom, Parliament is also consulted before the ratifi¬
cation of certain international treaties and agreements (in spite of the fact
that the making of treaties is a royal prerogative exercised on the advice of the
Government and, in theory, is not subject to parliamentary approval).
Parliamentary procedure is largely based on custom and precedent, supple¬
mented by standing orders governing details of practice in each House.1 The
system of debate is much the same in the two Houses: for instance, every
matter is determined upon questions put from the chair or woolsack and
resolved in the affirmative or negative, as the case may be; and members speak
from wherever they have been sitting and not from a rostrum. The main
difference is that in the House of Lords the office of Speaker carries with it no
authority to check or curtail debate, such matters being decided by the general
sense of the House, whereas in the Commons the Speaker has full authority to
give effect, promptly and decisively, to the rules and orders of the House. He
must guard against abuse of procedure or any infringement of minority
rights, and he has a discretion whether to allow or disallow any closure motion
(that is, a motion to end discussion so that the matter may be put to the vote).
He has certain powers to check irrelevance and repetition in debate, and to
save the time of the House in various other respects. In case of grave disorder
he can adjourn the House or suspend the sitting on his own initiative.
Voting in the House of Commons is carried out under the direction of the
Speaker, and it is his duty to pronounce the final result. If an equal number
of votes is cast for and against the motion under debate, the Speaker must
give the casting vote, but he does so only in accordance with rules which pre¬
clude an expression of opinion on the merits of the question.
The procedure on voting in the House of Lords is similar to that in the
House of Commons, except that the Speaker or chairman has an original, but
no casting, vote—the House of Lords being generally governed by the prm-

ciple that unless there is a majority in favour the question is decided in the
negative. When the House is sitting judicially (see pp. 84 and 90) the question
is put in such a way that, if the votes are equal, there is no interference with
the judgment under appeal.
The House of Commons has agreed on criteria for the establishment of a
compulsory register of members’ pecuniary interests. Members with a direct
pecuniary interest in a matter before the House must abstain from voting in
connection with it, though in order to operate as a disqualification the interest
must be immediate and personal, and not merely of a general or remote
character. In any proceedings of the House or in transactions with other
members or with ministers or civil servants, members must disclose any
relevant pecuniary interest or benefit.
All proceedings of either House are public, except on extremely rare occa¬
sions; the minutes (in the House of Commons called Votes and Proceedings
and in the House of Lords, Minutes of Proceedings) and the speeches (The
Official Report of Parliamentary Debates, Hansard) are published daily.
The records of both Houses from 1497, together with the parliamentary and
political papers of certain past members of the Houses, are available to the
public in the House of Lords Record Office. Parliamentary proceedings are
not transmitted on television, but following a four-week experiment in 1975
involving radio broadcasting of House of Commons proceedings the Govern¬
ment is to make proposals for broadcasting on a permanent basis.
The law undergoes constant reform in the courts as established principles
are interpreted, clarified or refashioned to meet new circumstances, but
substantial changes are the responsibility of Parliament and the Government
through the normal legislative process.
Draft legislation takes the form of a parliamentary Bill. Most Bills are
public Bills involving measures relating to public policy, but there are also
private Bills which deal solely with matters of individual, corporate or local
interest. Public Bills can be introduced either by a Government minister or
by a private member’ of either House of Parliament who does not hold office
in the Government. Most public legislation is in fact drafted on behalf of
ministers, and has the support of the Cabinet before being presented to
Parliament by the appropriate minister.
In the modern legislative process, before a Government Bill is finally
drafted, there is normally considerable consultation with, for instance,
professional bodies, voluntary organisations and other agencies interested in
the subject-matter of the proposals, such as major interest groups and ‘pressure’
groups which aim to promote a specific cause.1
Public Bills can first be introduced in either House. As a rule, however,
Bills likely to raise political controversy go through the Commons before
the Lords, while those of an intricate but uncontroversial nature often pass
through the Lords first. A Bill with a mainly financial purpose must be
introduced in the Commons, and a Bill involving taxation or the spending of
public money must be based on resolutions agreed to by the House, often
after debate, before it can be introduced. If the main object of a Bill is
to create a public charge, it can only be introduced by a Government
Proposals for legislative changes are sometimes set out by the Government in ‘White
Papers which may be debated in Parliament before the introduction of a Bill. From time
to time Green Papers’ are published setting out for public discussion major ministerial
proposals which are still at the formative stage.
36
BRITAIN 1976: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
minister, which gives the Government an important degree of control over
legislation.
At the beginning of each session private members of the Commons ballot
for the chance to introduce a Bill during time specially allocated for private
members’ Bills; the first 20 are successful. A private member may also present
a Bill after question time on notice given, or seek leave to introduce a Bill
under the ‘ten minute rule’ which allows two speeches, one in favour of
and one against the measure, after which the House decides whether to allow
the Bill to be brought in. Private members’ Bills do not often proceed very
far, but a few become law. If one secures a second reading, the Government
usually introduces any necessary money resolution. Private members Bills
may be introduced in the House of Lords at any time, without notice, but the
time that can be given to them in the Commons is strictly limited.
The process of passing a public Bill is similar in both Houses of Parliament.
The Bill receives a formal first reading on introduction, it is printed, and
after a while (between one day and several weeks depending on the nature of
the Bill) it is given a second reading after a debate on its general principles
and merits. In the Commons a non-controversial Bill may be referred to a
second reading committee to recommend whether it should be taken as
read a second time. After a second reading in the Commons, a Bill is usually
referred for detailed examination to a standing committee (see p. 37). If the
House so decides, the Bill may be referred to the whole House sitting in
committee. The committee stage is followed by the report stage, during
which previous amendments may be altered and new amendments incor¬
porated. At the third reading a Bill is reviewed in its final form. In the
Commons this stage is taken without a debate unless there is a motion in the
name of six members that the question ‘be not put forthwith’—a procedure
of which substantial use is made.
After the third reading the Bill is sent from the Commons to the Lords
where it goes through broadly the same stages. Similarly a Bill which starts
in the Lords and is passed by that House is then sent to the Commons for all
the stages there. Amendments made by the second House must be agreed by
the first, or a compromise reached, before a Bill can become law.
Most Bills introduced and passed in the Lords pass through the Commons
without difficulty because of their non-controversial nature. However, should
any Lords Bill be unacceptable to the Commons it would not become law
because no debating time would be allotted to it—at least until a new Govern¬
ment came into office. The Lords, on the other hand, cannot prevent a Bil
insisted upon by the Commons from finally becoming law. In the normal
course of events they either accept a Commons Bill without changes, or they
amend and return it for consideration by members of the other House, who
frequently agree to the amendments made. In practice, the Lords pass without
amendment such financial Bills as the Finance Bill, which authorises taxation
or the Consolidated Fund or Appropriation Bill, which authorises national
expenditure. A Bill that deals only with taxation or expenditure must become
law within one month of being sent to the Lords, whether or not they have
agreed to it, unless the Commons directs to the contrary. The Lords can delay
a non-financial Commons Bill for about 13 months. The limitations on the
power of the Lords are based on the belief that the principal legislative
function of the non-elected House nowadays is to act as a chamber of revision,
complementing the elected House of Commons and not rivalling it.
When a Bill has passed through all its parliamentary stages, it is sent to the
Queen for royal assent, after which it is part of the law of the land and

known as an Act of Parliament. The Sovereign’s power to refuse assent has
not been exercised since 1707.
Private Bills, which can be promoted by people or organisations outside
Parliament, go through substantially the same procedure as public Bills,
but most of the work is done in committee, where proceedings follow a semi¬
judicial pattern: the promoter must prove the need for the powers or privileges
he seeks, and objections on the part of the opposing interests are heard.
Both parties may be legally represented.
The system of delegated legislation, which is used to relieve pressure on
parliamentary time, empowers ministers and other authorities to regulate
administrative details after a Bill has become an Act. In order to minimise the
risk that powers thus conferred on the executive might supersede or weaken
parliamentary government, they are normally delegated to the Queen in
Council or to authorities directly responsible to Parliament, that is, to Govern¬
ment ministers, government departments for which ministers are responsible,
or to organisations whose regulations are subject to confirmation or approval
by ministers who thereby become responsible to Parliament for them. More¬
over, the Acts of Parliament by which particular powers are delegated
normally provide for some measure of parliamentary control over legislation
made in the exercise of these powers, for instance, by reserving to Parliament
the right to confirm or annul the orders themselves. Certain Acts also require
direct consultation with organisations which will be affected thereby before
rules and orders (in the form of statutory instruments) are made.
A joint committee of both Houses checks the technical propriety of statu¬
tory instruments, and a standing committee of the House of Commons
considers their merits.
Either House may resolve itself into a committee, known as a committee of
the whole house, to consider Bills in detail, clause by clause, after their
second reading. A committee of the whole house is presided over by the
Chairman of Ways and Means (the Chairman of Committees in the House of
Lords) or a deputy chairman.
House of Commons standing committees include those which examine
public Bills at the committee stage and, in certain cases, at the second reading
and report stages; two Scottish standing committees; the Scottish Grand
Committee; the Welsh Grand Committee; and the Northern Ireland standing
committee. Ordinary standing committees have no distinctive names, being
referred to simply as Standing Committee A, B, C, and so on. Each has
between 16 and 50 members with the balance of the parties reflecting as far
as possible that in the House as a whole. The Scottish Grand Committee
which comprises all 71 Scottish members and ten to 15 others, considers the
principles of Scottish Bills referred to it at second reading stage, the Scottish
estimates and other matters relating exclusively to Scotland. The Welsh
Grand Committee, with all 36 Welsh members and up to five others, considers
the annual report for Wales and other subjects concerning Welsh affairs.
I he Northern Ireland committee considers matters relating specifically to the
province. An experimental standing committee has been set up to consider
English regional affairs.
Select committees are generally set up, by either House, to help Parliament
with the control of the executive by examining some aspect of administration

and reporting to the House. They may be appointed as occasion demands
or as ‘sessional’ select committees, at the beginning of a session. On rare
occasions a parliamentary Bill is examined by a select committee (a procedure
additional to the legislative process). Select committees are constituted on a
party basis, in proportion to party strength in the House.
Sessional select committees in the Commons include committees on public
accounts, expenditure, privileges, services, nationalised industries the Par 1a-
mentary Commissioner for Administration and European Community
secondary legislation. The Committee of Selection and the Standing Orders
Committee have duties relating to private Bills, and the Committee of Selection
also chooses members to serve on standing committees. ‘Specialist select
committees not necessarily appointed regularly include those on science an
technology, race relations and immigration, and overseas development.
In the House of Lords there are sessional committees on the European
Community, standing orders, personal Bills, procedure, offices, privileges,
leave of absence, selection and the Appeal and Appellate Committees.
The two Houses may agree to set up joint select committees, and joint
committees are also appointed in each session to deal with measures of the
General Synod of the Church of England, Consolidation Bills and delegated
legislation.
In addition to the official committees of the two Houses there are several
important party organisations or committees. The Conservative and Unionist
Members Committee, popularly known as the 1922 Committee, consists o
the back-bench membership of the party. The Parliamentary Labour Party,
is a corporate body comprising all members of the party in both Houses; when
the Labour Party is in office a liaison committee acts as a channel of communi¬
cation between the Government and its back-benchers in both Houses; when
the party is in opposition the Parliamentary Labour Party is organised under
the direction of a Parliamentary Committee.
Parliamentary Control of the Government in power is exercised in the final analysis by the
Control ability of the House of Commons to force the Government to resign either
by passing a resolution of ‘no confidence’ or by rejecting a proposal which the
Government considers so vital to its policy that it has made it a matter o
confidence’. A number of opportunities for a searching examination of
government policy by both the Opposition and the Government’s own back¬
benchers are provided in parliamentary procedure. In the House of Commons
such opportunities include:
1. Question time, which is an hour of .parliamentary time on Monday,
Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday during which ministers, in rotation,
answer questions put to them on matters for which they are responsible.
So much parliamentary time is devoted to scheduled public business that
questions are regarded as one of the best means of eliciting hitherto un¬
published information about the Government’s intentions, as well as an
effective way of airing, and possibly securing some redress of, grievances
brought to the notice of members by their constituents. (Another means
available to members is by way of the Parliamentary Commissioner for
Administration—see p. 39.) r u tt
2. The right of members to use motions for the adjournment of the House to
initiate discussions on constituency cases or matters of public concern.
There is a half-hour adjournment period at the end of public business; and
immediately before the adjournment for each recess (Christmas, Easter,

spring and the summer) a whole day is spent discussing matters raised
by private members. Moreover, if a member wishes to discuss a ‘specific
and important matter that should have urgent consideration’ he may, at
the end of question time, ask leave to move the adjournment of the House.
If the Speaker accepts the terms of the motion, he asks the House for leave
for it to be put forward. Leave can be given unanimously, or if 40 or more
members support the motion, or if fewer than 40 but more than ten support
it and the House (on a vote) is in favour. Once leave has been given, the
matter is debated for three hours, usually on the following day.
3. The 29 ‘supply’ days each session, which were formerly used to discuss
details of proposed government expenditure, and which are nowadays,
in practice, time for the Opposition to choose subjects for debate (scrutiny
by small committees has been found more apt for detailed expenditure
proposals.
Procedural opportunities for criticism of the Government also arise during
the debate on the address in reply to the Queen’s speech at the beginning of
a session, during debates or motions of censure for which the Government
gives up part of its own time, and during debates on the Government’s
legislative proposals.
Certain opportunities for criticism of the Government are also provided
in the House of Lords at question time and during debates on specific motions.
The involvement of Parliament, and more particularly the House of Com¬
mons, in the management of the revenues of the State and payments for the
public service is described in Chapter 17, Finance.
Arrangements have been made in both Houses of Parliament to keep
members informed about European Community developments, and to enable
them to scrutinise and debate matters which are to be decided in Community
institutions. These include the provision of Community documents and
explanatory memoranda, oral ministerial statements and reports, special
allocation of parliamentary time for debates and questions, and the establish¬
ment of select committees (one in each House) to identify important Com¬
munity proposals.
The Parliamentary Commissioner for Administration is an independent
statutory officer whose function is to investigate complaints of maladministra¬
tion brought to his notice by members of the House of Commons on behalf of
members of the public. His powers of investigation extend to actions taken by
central government departments in the exercise of their administrative func¬
tions, but not to policy decisions (which are the concern of the Government
and can be questioned in Parliament). Certain administrative actions also
outside his jurisdiction include matters affecting relations with other countries
and the activities of British officials outside the United Kingdom.
In the performance of his duties, the Parliamentary Commissioner has
access to all departmental papers, and reports his findings to the member of
Parliament who presented the case. The Parliamentary Commissioner reports
annually to Parliament and may submit such other reports as he thinks fit. A
select committee considers these reports.
Each House of Parliament enjoys certain rights and immunities designed to
protect it from unnecessary obstruction in carrying out its duties. These
rights apply collectively to each House and individually to each member.
For the Commons the Speaker formally claims fromthe Crown ‘their ancient
BRITAIN 1976: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
and undoubted rights and privileges’ at the beginning of each Parliament.
These include freedom of speech in debate; freedom from arrest; and the
right of access to the Crown, which is a collective privilege of the House.
Further privileges include the right of the House to control its own proceedings
(so that it is able, for instance, to exclude strangers if it so wishes); the right
to pronounce upon legal disqualifications for membership and to declare a
seat vacant on such grounds; and the right to penalise those who commit
a breach of its privileges. .
The privileges of the House of Lords include: freedom of speech in debate;
freedom of access to the Sovereign for each peer individually; and the right to
commit for contempt. These privileges are not formally claimed by the Speaker
as in the House of Commons; they exist independently.
THE PRIVY COUNCIL
Until the eighteenth century, the Sovereign in Council, or Privy Council, was
the chief source of executive power in the State. As the system of Cabinet
government developed, however, the Privy Council became less prominent.
Many of its powers were transferred to the Cabinet as an inner Committee
of the Privy Council, and much of its work was handed over to newly created
government departments, some of which were originally committees of the
Privy Council. Nowadays the Privy Council is responsible for advising the
Sovereign to approve Orders in Council, of which there are two kinds, differ¬
ing fundamentally in constitutional principle: those made by virtue of the
royal prerogative, such as Orders approving the grant of royal charters of
incorporation; and those made under statutory powers, which are the highest
form of delegated legislation. It is an accepted principle that members of the
Privy Council attending meetings at which Orders in Council are made do
not thereby become personally responsible for the policy upon which the
orders are based; this rests with the minister responsible for the subject
matter of the order in question, whether or not he was present at the meeting.
The Privy Council also advises the Crown on the issue of royal proclama¬
tions, some of the most important of which relate to prerogative acts (such as
summoning or dissolving Parliament) of the same validity as Acts of Parlia¬
ment. The Privy Council’s own statutory responsibilities, which are indepen¬
dent of the powers of the Sovereign in Council, include powers of supervision
over the registering bodies for the medical and allied professions.
Apart from Cabinet Ministers, who must be Privy Counsellors and are
sworn of the Council on first assuming office, membership of the Privy Council
(which is retained for life) is accorded by the Sovereign on the recommendation
of the Prime Minister as an honour to persons who have reached eminence
in some branch of public affairs in any country of the Commonwealth. 1 here
are usually about 330 Privy Counsellors. The whole Privy Council is called
together only on the death of the Sovereign or when the Sovereign announces
his or her intention to marry.
Committees of There are a number of Privy Council committees whose meetings differ from
the Privy those of the Privy Council itself in that the Sovereign cannot constitutionally
Council' be present. These advisory committees may be prerogative committees, such
as those which deal with legislative matters submitted by the legislatures of
the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man and with applications for charters of
incorporation; or they may be provided for by statute as are those for the
universities of Oxford and Cambridge and the Scottish universities.

The Judicial Committee of the Privy Council is the final court of appeal
from the courts of the United Kingdom dependencies, courts of independent
members of the Commonwealth which have not elected to discontinue the
appeal, courts of the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man, and certain other
courts, some professional and disciplinary committees and church sources.
The administrative work of the Privy Council committees is carried out
in the Privy Council Office under the Lord President of the Council, a senior
Cabinet minister. He is assisted by a Minister of State and a Parliamentary
Secretary, and has special responsibility for devolution policy (see p. 24) and
other work relating to the development of political institutions.
HER MAJESTY’S GOVERNMENT
Her Majesty’s Government is the body of ministers responsible for the
administration of national affairs.
The Prime Minister is appointed by the Crown, and all other ministers are
appointed by the Crown on the recommendation of the Prime Minister.
The majority of ministers are members of the House of Commons. How¬
ever, the Government must be fully represented by ministers in the House of
Lords as it requires spokesmen of standing to expound its policy and justify
its actions to that House. The Lord Chancellor is always a member of the
House of Lords.
The composition of the Government is subject to variation from time to time,
both in the number of ministers and in the titles of some offices. The creation
of a paid ministerial office with entirely new functions requires legislation, but
the abolition of an office, the transfer of functions from one minister to another,
or a change in the designation of a minister may be effected by Order in
Council. Functionally ministers may be classified under the following heads:
The Prime Minister, who is also First Lord of the Treasury and Minister for
the Civil Service. The head of the Government became known as the Prime
Minister during the eighteenth century. The unique position of authority
enjoyed by the holder of this office derives from his ability to command a
majority in Parliament and from his power to submit his own choice of minis¬
ters to the Sovereign and to obtain their resignation or dismissal individually.
Nowadays, by convention, the Prime Minister always sits in the House of
Commons.
It is the duty of the Prime Minister to inform the Sovereign of the general
business of the Government; to preside over the Cabinet; and to exercise a
general supervision over departments, settling departmental differences and
approving important departmental decisions where reference to the Cabinet
is not required. The Prime Minister speaks for the Government in the House
of Commons on the most important topics and answers questions on its
general administration.
The Prime Minister s other responsibilities include making recommenda¬
tions to the Sovereign for the appointment of Church of England archbishops,
bishops and deans and the incumbents of some 200 Crown livings, as well as
for appointments to high judicial offices, such as the Lord Chief Justice, Lords
of Appeal in Ordinary, and Lord Justices of Appeal. He also advises the Crown
on appointments of Privy Counsellors, Lord-Lieutenants and certain civil
appointments, such as Lord High Commissioner of the General Assembly of
the Church of Scotland, Poet Laureate, Constable of the Tower, and some

university appointments which are in the gift of the Crown. The Prime
Minister makes similar recommendations for appointments to various public
boards and institutions, such as the British Broadcasting Corporation, as well
as to various royal and statutory commissions. He likewise makes recommenda¬
tions to the Sovereign for the award of many civil honours and distinctions
and of Civil List pensions (awarded to people who have achieved eminence in
science and the arts and who are in some financial need) and selects the
trustees of certain national museums and institutions.
A specialist unit advises the Prime Minister on domestic policy matters.
Departmental ministers, who are in charge of government departments. The
holders of these offices (most of whom are in the Cabinet) are known as
‘Secretary of State’ or ‘Minister’, or they may have a special title, as in the
case of the Chancellor of the Exchequer (who is responsible for the Treasury
and a number of sub-departments). There may also be some ministers who
are in charge of a department not represented in the Cabinet, who are re¬
sponsible, under a Secretary of State, for a particular part of the activities of
the department concerned.
Non-departmental ministers, who include the holders of various traditional
offices—the Lord President of the Council, the Chancellor of the Duchy of
Lancaster,1 the Lord Privy Seal, the Paymaster General—and from time to
time Ministers without Portfolio. Sometimes these ministers have few or no
departmental duties and are thus available to perform any special duties
which the Prime Minister may wish to entrust to them.
The Lord Chancellor holds a special position, being a Minister of the Crown
with departmental functions and also head of the judiciary in England and
Wales. The four Law Officers of the Crown are: for England and Wales, the
Attorney General and the Solicitor General; for Scotland, the Lord Advocate
and the Solicitor General for Scotland.
Ministers of State who are usually appointed in a subordinate capacity to
government departments in which the work is particularly heavy or complex
and where it involves frequent travelling abroad. It is possible for a Minister
of State to be given a place in the Cabinet and to be paid accordingly.
Junior ministers, who generally have the title of Parliamentary Secretary or,
where the senior minister is a Secretary of State, Parliamentary Under
Secretary of State. The primary function of most junior ministers is to relieve
their senior ministers of some of their burden by taking part in parliamentary
debates, answering parliamentary questions, and assisting in departmental
duties. In certain cases, however, they may be given responsibility, directly
under the head of the department, for specific aspects of the department s

The Prime Minister and ministers in the House of Commons also have
parliamentary salaries of £3,000 (£3,700 for non-Cabinet ministers) and
allowances paid to all members of the House. The Lord Chancellor receives
£20,000 a year, £2,500 for his speakership of the House of Lords.
The Cabinet is composed of about 20 ministers personally selected by the
Prime Minister and may include the holders of departmental and non-
departmental offices. Its origins can be traced back to the informal conferences
that the Sovereign held with his leading ministers, independently of the Privy
Council, during the seventeenth century. After the Sovereign’s withdrawal
from an active role in politics in the eighteenth century, and the development
of organised political parties stimulated by successive extensions of the
franchise from 1832 onwards, the Cabinet assumed its modern form.
The functions of the Cabinet are: the final determination of the policy to
be submitted to Parliament; the supreme control of the national executive
in accordance with the policy agreed by Parliament; and the continuous co¬
ordination and delimitation of the authority of government departments. The
exercise of these functions is vitally affected by the fact that the Cabinet is a
group of party representatives, depending for its existence upon the support
of a majority in the House of Commons.
The Cabinet meets in private and its proceedings are strictly confidential.
Its members are bound by their oath as Privy Counsellors not to disclose
information about its proceedings. The Official Secrets Acts forbid the publica¬
tion of Cabinet as well as of other State papers (although after they have been
in existence for 30 years they may be made available for inspection in the
Public Record Office) and a resigning minister desiring to make a statement
involving disclosure of Cabinet discussions should first obtain the permission
of the Sovereign through the Prime Minister. From a practical point of view,
this secrecy is essential in the interests of full and frank discussion, which can
be maintained only if there is no risk of publicity for every statement made and
every point conceded. A committee is considering the principles which should
govern the publication by former ministers of memoirs and other works
relating to their experience as ministers.
In normal times the Cabinet meets for a few hours once or twice a week
during parliamentary sittings, and rather less frequently when Parliament is
not sitting. Additional meetings may be called by the Prime Minister at any
time if a matter urgently requiring discussion should arise. To keep the
amount of work coming before the Cabinet within manageable limits, a great
deal of the work of the Cabinet is carried on through the committee system,
which involves the reference of any issue either to a standing Cabinet com¬
mittee or to an ad hoc committee composed of the ministers primarily con¬
cerned. The committee then considers the matter in detail and either disposes
of it or reports upon it to the Cabinet with recommendations for action.
Ministers not in the Cabinet are called to attend its meetings when matters
affecting their departments are under discussion; they may also be members
of Cabinet committees.
The Secretary of the Cabinet and senior officials of the Cabinet Office
attend meetings of the Cabinet and its committees as appropriate. A record is
kept of the conclusions and of the main points made in discussion.
Ministerial responsibility means both the collective responsibility which
ministers share for the policy and actions of the Government and the individual
BRITAIN 1976: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
responsibility of ministers to Parliament for the work of their depart-
The doctrine of collective responsibility, which was fully accepted by the
middle of the nineteenth century, means that the Cabinet is bound to offer
unanimous advice to the Sovereign, even when its members do not hold
identical views on a given subject. Consequently it means that the policy of
departmental ministers must be consistent with the policy of the Government
as a whole. In principle, once the Government’s policy on a particular matter
has been decided, each minister is expected to support it, unless he chooses
to resign, as he is free to do if he cannot agree with his colleagues on a matter
of general policy or on a single major issue.1
The individual responsibility of a minister for the work of his department
means that, as political head of that department, he is answerable for all its
acts and omissions and must bear the consequences of any defect of admini¬
stration, any injustice to an individual or any aspect of policy which may be
criticised in Parliament, whether he is personally responsible or not. Since
the majority of ministers are members of the House of Commons, they are
available to answer questions and to defend themselves against criticism in
person. Departmental ministers who are in the House of Lords must be
represented in the Commons by someone qualified to speak on their behalf,
usually a Minister of State or a Parliamentary Secretary.
Departmental ministers normally decide all matters within their responsi¬
bility, although on important political matters they will usually wish to consult
their colleagues collectively, through the Cabinet or a Cabinet committee. Any
decision by a departmental minister binds the Government as a whole.
The responsibility of ministers for their departments is an effective way
of bringing government under public control, for the knowledge that any
departmental action may be reported to and examined in Parliament dis¬
courages the taking of arbitrary and ill-considered decisions.
On assuming office ministers must resign directorships in private and public
companies. In all other respects they must order their affairs in such a way
that there is no conflict between their public duties and their private interests.
GOVERNMENT DEPARTMENTS
Government departments are the main instruments for giving effect to govern¬
ment policy when Parliament has passed the necessary legislation. They may,
and frequently do, work with and through local authorities, statutory boards,
and government-sponsored organisations operating under various degrees of
government control.
A few departments have existed for over 200 years. Many more have come
into existence during the past half-century to match the widening scope of
government activity. The election of a party of a different political complexion
does not necessarily affect the number or general functions of government
departments, although a radical change in policy may be accompanied by some
organisational change.

45
The work of some departments, for instance, the Ministry of Defence,
covers the United Kingdom as a whole. Other departments, for instance, the
Department of Employment, cover England, Wales, and Scotland, but not
Northern Ireland; others, such as the Department of Education and Science
and the Department of the Environment, are mainly concerned with affairs in
England. There are separate departments for Scotland and Northern Ireland,
and there is also a separate department with responsibility for affairs in Wales.
A department is usually headed by a minister. Certain departments in
which questions of policy do not normally arise are headed by a permanent
official, and a minister with other duties is responsible for them to Parliament.
For instance, the minister in charge of the Civil Service Department is
responsible for the Central Office of Information, Her Majesty’s Stationery
Office, and the Department of the Government Actuary; and Treasury
ministers are responsible for the Board of Customs and Excise, the Inland
Revenue, the Department for National Savings and a number of small depart¬
ments including the Treasury Solicitor’s Department, the Royal Mint, and
the National Debt Office. Generally, departments receive their funds directly
out of money provided by Parliament and are staffed by members of the Civil
Service (see p. 60).
Departments differ in size and in the volume, type and complexity of their
work. Since each department makes its own arrangements for discharging
its duties, there are variations in internal organisation. Most departments, how¬
ever, have certain features in common: for instance, the minister of a major
department is likely to have at the head of his officials a permanent secretary,
sometimes assisted by one or more second permanent secretaries, and also one
or more deputy secretaries, and a varying number of under-secretaries and
assistant secretaries. Usually major departments also have a principal finance
officer and a principal personnel and organisation officer. Many depart¬
ments also have their own legal advisers or solicitors, economists, statisticians
and their own information divisions. TheGovernment Statistical Service, which
includes the Central Statistical Office (CSO), the Business Statistics Office
(BSO), the Office of Population Censuses and Surveys and the statistics divi¬
sions of the major departments, provides a service of statistical information
and advice. Each department is responsible for compiling statistics relating
to its own policy area and publishing them, usually through its own publica¬
tions. Information about individual industries is published by the BSO in
Business Monitors. Comprehensive statistical publications are produced by
the CSO.
Some departments maintain a regional organisation, and some that have
direct contact with the public throughout the country also have local offices.
Many government departments are assisted by advisory councils or com¬
mittees (several hundred in all) which undertake research and collect informa¬
tion, mainly to enable ministers to ascertain informed opinion before coming
to a decision involving a legislative or executive act. In some cases there is a
statutory obligation on a minister to consult a standing committee, but usually
advisory bodies are appointed at the discretion of the minister concerned be¬
cause he feels the need for their advice.
The membership of the advisory councils and committees varies according
to the nature of the work involved, and may include civil servants and repre¬
sentatives of varying interests and professions—for instance, industrialists,
BRITAIN 1976: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
trade unionists, university and industrial scientists, educationists, lawyers and
local government councillors and officers.
In addition to these standing advisory bodies, there are ad hoc committees
which the Government frequently sets up to examine and make recommenda¬
tions on specific matters. For certain important inquiries Royal Commissions
whose members are selected on the grounds of their wide experience and
diverse knowledge, may be appointed (by royal warrant). Royal Commissions
examine written and oral evidence from government departments and in¬
terested organisations and individuals, and on this evidence submit recom¬
mendations. The Government may accept the recommendations in whole or
in part, or it may decide to take no further action or to delay action. Inquiries
may also be undertaken by departmental committees, appointed by the head
of the appropriate department.

The following pages provide an outline of the principal functions of the main
government departments. They are arranged in alphabetical order, except for
the Cabinet Office, the Civil Service Department, and the Treasury (which
in view of their central positions, are placed first) and the Scottish and
Northern Ireland departments (which are grouped at the end of the section).
Further information on the work of departments is given in later chapters
under the relevant subject headings.
The Cabinet Office, headed by the Secretary of the Cabinet, under the direc¬
tion of the Prime Minister, comprises the Cabinet Secretariat, the Central
Policy Review Staff, the Central Statistical Office and the Historical Section

Cabinet business. It operates as an instrument in the co-ordination of policy
at the highest level. Functions of the office include circulating the memoranda
and other documents required for Cabinet or Cabinet committee business,
preparing agenda for meetings of the Cabinet and its committees recording
their discussions and circulating the minutes, keeping in touch with the pro¬
gress of action on decisions, and safeguarding the security of documents.
The Central Policy Review Staff advises ministers collectively on major
issues of policy. . . „ ,, , .

ments and produces statistics needed for central economic and social policies
and management, such as the national accounts, balance of payments, financia
statistics and measures of output. It is responsible for a number of statistical
publications. , r
The Historical Section of the Cabinet Office is in the process of completing
the official histories of the second world war, and is responsible for the
preparation of official histories of certain peace-time events.

The Civil Service Commission, which is responsible for the recruitment of
civil servants, forms part of the Civil Service Department. In matters con¬
cerned with recruitment policy, the commissioners are responsible to ministers
in the normal way, but in the selection of individuals for appointment, they
act under Order in Council and are completely independent of ministers.
The Office of the Parliamentary Counsel is responsible for the drafting of all
Government Bills, except Bills or provisions of Bills extending exclusively to
Scotland, which are handled by the Lord Advocate’s Department. The office
drafts all financial and other parliamentary motions and amendments moved

questions of parliamentary procedure; and attends sittings (and committees)
of both Houses. In addition the Parliamentary Counsel draft subordinate legis¬
lation when specially instructed, and advise the Government on legal, parlia¬
mentary and constitutional questions falling within their special experience.
Nominally the heads of the Treasury are the Lords Commissioners: the
First Lord of the Treasury (always the Prime Minister), the Chancellor of the
Exchequer and five junior Lords. In practice, the Lords Commissioners never
meet as a board and their responsibilities are carried by the Chancellor of the
Exchequer assisted by the Paymaster General, the Chief Secretary to the
Treasury, the Financial Secretary and a Minister of State. There is also a
Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasury, who is the Chief Government Whip
in the House of Commons.

education for which the department has responsibility are the broad allocation
of resources for education, the capital programmes for the building of new
schools and other institutions, the supply, training and superannuation of
teachers, and the basic standards of education. The department works in co¬
operation with local education authorities whose duty it is to provide and run
the schools and colleges in their areas. Its relations with the universities are
conducted through the University Grants Committee. Activities concerning
civil science are discharged through five research councils: the Medical
Research Council, the Agricultural Research Council, the Natural Environ¬

The Central Office of Information is a common service department which
produces information and publicity material, and supplies publicity services
required by other government departments which are responsible for the
policy expressed in its work. In the United Kingdom, it conducts government,
press, television and poster advertising, produces booklets leaflets, fi ms
television material, exhibitions, photographs and other visual material, and
distributes departmental press notices. For the Foreign and Commonwealth
Office it supplies British information posts overseas with press, radio an
television material, books, graphics, magazines, reference services, films,
exhibitions, photographs, display and reading-room material, and manages
schemes for promoting the overseas sale of British periodicals and newspapers^
It provides exhibition services (except for trade and cultura exhibitions), an
it organises tours (other than those sponsored by the British Council and t e
British Overseas Trade Board) for visitors officially invited to Britain. There
are nine regional information offices in England, which provide services for
the home departments and assist the overseas services by the provision of
material and by arranging tours for overseas visitors; similar services are
supplied on a mutually agreed basis by the information staffs of the Scottish,
Welsh and Northern Ireland Offices.
The Board of Inland Revenue administers the laws relating to income tax,
corporation tax, capital gains tax, stamp duty, capital transfer tax petroleum
revenue tax, and the proposed development land tax and certain other direct
taxes, and advises the Chancellor of the Exchequer on any matters connected
with them. It is also responsible for the valuation of real property ffir such
purposes as compensation for compulsory purchase and local rates m England
and Wales.
The Law Officers of the Crown for England and Wales—the Attorney
General and the Solicitor General—appear on behalf of the Crown in import¬
ant civil and criminal proceedings and in proceedings before Internationa
tribunals such as the international court at The Hague and the EuroF^
Commission and Court of Human Rights at Strasbourg^ The Attorney
General is the senior legal adviser to the Government. He has the ultimate
responsibility for the enforcement of the criminal law and his consent is
necessary before proceedings for a number of criminal offences can be c°
menced; the Director of Public Prosecutions is subject to his superintende .
Legal proceedings for the enforcement of public rights and on behalf of the
interests of charity are conducted in his name and the functions of the Queen s
Proctor, who has certain duties connected with the operation of the divorce
laws, are exercised under his direction. The Attorney General is also spokes¬
man for the Lord Chancellor in the House of Commons on matters affecting
the administration of justice. The Solicitor General is subject to the authority
of the Attorney General, with the same rights and duties^The Law Officers

The Paymaster General’s Office acts generally as a banker for government
departments other than the Boards of Inland Revenue and Customs and
Excise, for which separate arrangements exist. Money granted by Parliament
is transferred (in such sums as may be required from day to day) from the
Exchequer account to the account of the Paymaster General at the Bank of
England. Most departmental payments are made by means of payable orders
drawn on the Paymaster General’s Office; their recipients obtain payments
through the commercial banks, whose accounts at the Bank of England are in
turn reimbursed by the Paymaster General’s Office.
The department is also responsible for the regular payment of many public
service pensions.
The Office of Population Censuses and Surveys, whose director is also the
Registrar General for England and Wales, is concerned with the regulation of
civil marriages, the registration of births, marriages and deaths in England and
Wales, and control of the registration services. Its work also includes the pre¬
paration and publication of reports on vital, medical and demographic statistics,
taking the periodical census of the population, and, through the Social Survey
Division, conducting research into the attitudes and circumstances of indivi¬
duals through direct contact with members of the general public on a sample
basis, or of particular groups.
The Department of Prices and Consumer Protection is responsible for
general policy and legislation on prices. It also deals with consumer affairs,
covering consumer protection, home safety, consumer credit, and standards,
weights and measures. The department carries out government policy in
relation to monopolies, mergers and restrictive practices; it is responsible to
Parliament for the Price Commission, the Office of Fair Trading and the
Metrication Board; and it is the sponsoring department for the National
Consumer Council. The Secretary of State for Prices and Consumer Protec¬
tion is assisted by a Minister of State and a Parliamentary Under Secretary
of State.
The Treasury Solicitor provides a common legal service for a large number of
government departments in England and Wales. The duties of his department
include instructing Parliamentary Counsel on Bills and drafting subordinate
legislation, representing other departments in court, and giving general advice
on the interpretation and application of the law. The department undertakes a
considerable amount of conveyancing connected with the transfer of property,
administers residuary estates (estates undisposed of by will) of certain
deceased persons, and deals with the outstanding property and rights of dis¬
solved companies. The Statutory Publications Office is staffed and controlled
by the Treasury Solicitor, who reports annually on its work to the Statute
Law Committee (a body appointed by the Lord Chancellor from among t e
judiciary and legal profession in Great Britain).
Some government departments are wholly dependent on the Treasury
Solicitor for their legal work; some have their own legal staffs for a proportion
of the work and draw on the Treasury Solicitor for special advice and, often
for litigation and conveyancing; others, whose administrative work is based
on or deals with a code of specialised law or involves a great deal of legal work,
have their own independent legal sections.
The Treasury Solicitor is also the Queen’s Proctor (an officer who has
certain duties in connection with the divorce laws).

Her Majesty’s Stationery Office (HMSO) is the central purchasing organisa¬
tion responsible for supplying the home and overseas public service with paper,
printing, binding, books, periodicals, office supplies, and office machinery.
The department also provides services, such as duplicating, addressing, photo¬
copying, micro-copying, distribution and repair of office machinery.
As publisher for Parliament and the Government, HMSO produces a wide
range of printed matter in its eight printing works and through private printers
under contract. It operates six binding works, two of which are involved in the
repair of manuscripts from national archives. Official publications are sold by
government bookshops in London, Edinburgh, Manchester, Belfast, Bristol,
Cardiff and Birmingham, and through agents in Britain and overseas. HMSO
is also the United Kingdom agent for European Community publications, and
for those of the principal international organisations. The Controller is
Queen’s Printer of Acts of Parliament, and the copyright of all British Govern¬
ment documents is vested in him.
The Department of Trade is responsible, under a Secretary of State, for
general overseas trade policy, commercial relations and tariffs, including those
aspects of relations with the European Community. It sponsors the work of the
British Overseas Trade Board in export services and promotions, overseas
finance and planning. In addition, it is responsible for matters arising from
companies legislation, supervision of the insurance industry, the insolvency
service and the work of the Patent Office. Other responsibilities include civil
aviation, marine and shipping policy, tourism, the hotel and travel industries,
the newspaper industry and the film industry. The Secretary of State for
Trade is assisted by two Parliamentary Under Secretaries of State.
The Secretary of State for Wales, a Cabinet minister, has for some years had
full responsibility in Wales for ministerial functions relating to child care,
health, housing, local government, primary and secondary education, town
and country planning, new towns, water and sewerage, roads, forestry,
tourism, national parks and historic buildings, and shared responsibility for
the administration of urban grants to areas of acute social deprivation, and
(with the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food) for agriculture in
Wales. He has direct ministerial responsibility in Wales for selective financial
assistance to industry, and exercises a general responsibility for Welsh
economic development. This aspect of the Secretary of State’s work is to be
strengthened by the planned establishment of a Welsh Development Agency,
responsible to him, with important industrial and environmental functions.
The Secretary of State is assisted by two Parliamentary Under Secretaries
of State. He has certain responsibilities relating to the national library and
the national museum.
The Welsh Office maintains close and continuous working relationships
with the government departments mainly concerned with economic and
social planning through the Welsh Planning Board and Welsh Council. The
Welsh Office is centred in Cardiff; there is also a small ministerial office in
London.
Scotland has its own system of law and a wide measure of administrative
autonomy. The Secretary of State for Scotland, a United Kingdom Cabinet
minister, has responsibility in Scotland (with some exceptions) both for the
formulation of policy and for its execution in such matters as agriculture and
fisheries, education, local government and environmental services, social

work, health, housing, roads and certain aspects of shipping and road trans¬
port services. He is also responsible for a range of other functions from police
and fire services to sport and tourism. At ministerial level he is assisted by two
Ministers of State and two Parliamentary Under Secretaries of State.
The United Kingdom Government’s administrative functions arising from
these responsibilities are carried out principally by five Scottish departments
based in Edinburgh and known collectively as the Scottish Office. A manage¬
ment group comprising the five heads of departments under the chairmanship
of the Permanent Under Secretary of State (the senior official in Scottish
administration) advises the Secretary of State, particularly on questions, such
as the allocation of resources and forward planning, with which more than
one of the departments are concerned.
The Secretary of State also has a major and expanding role in the planning
and development of the Scottish economy. He is to acquire important
additional functions related to industrial development, with the intended
establishment of a Scottish Development Agency responsible to him, and his
assumption of responsibility for selective financial assistance to industry in
Scotland.
He plays a full part in the Government’s determination of energy policy
and exercises a co-ordinating function over activities in Scotland such as
the location of industry, the creation of employment and the land-based
facilities needed for North Sea oil—which are not his direct responsibility
but have an important effect on the country’s economy. United Kingdom
Government departments with significant Scottish responsibilities have offices
in Scotland with delegated powers, and work closely with the Scottish Office.
The Secretary of State is responsible for legal services in Scotland, and other
important functions are exercised by the two Scottish Law Officers. the Lord
Advocate and the Solicitor General for Scotland. On many domestic matters,
in order to reflect distinctive Scottish features and the different conditions
and needs of the country and its people, there is separate legislation relating
wholly to Scotland, or else clauses of special application to Scotland only are
inserted in Acts which otherwise apply to the United Kingdom generally.
The Department
of Agriculture
and Fisheries
for Scotland
The Department of Agriculture and Fisheries for Scotland has a general re¬
sponsibility for, and in most cases administers, government measures for the
promotion and development of farming in Scotland. It also has responsibilities
for the oversight and protection of the Scottish inshore, deep sea and fresh¬
water fisheries, and functions relating to certain harbours.
The Scottish
Development
Department
The Scottish Development Department is concerned with a number of services
affecting the physical development of Scotland, such as town and country
planning, housing, roads, water supplies and sewerage, coast protection, flood
prevention, building standards and the prevention of river and air pollution
(most of which are administered by local authorities). The department is also
responsible for general policy in regard to local government organisation and
finance and for ancient monuments and historic buildings.
The Scottish
Economic
Planning
Department
The Scottish Economic Planning Department is responsible for industrial and
economic development including the Scottish aspects of regional policies in
both British and European Community contexts and the development of North
Sea oil resources. It is also concerned with general policy in relation to the
Secretary of State’s responsibilities for Highlands and Islands development,
transport, electricity, tourism, new towns, and rural development.

The Scottish Education Department is responsible for the development of
public education in Scotland in all its forms (except universities). Through its
Social Work Services Group the department has a responsibility for the
guidance of local authorities in their provision and development of social work
services. It is also concerned with sport in Scotland, including the financing of
the Scottish Sports Council, and with the development of the arts in Scotland,
with responsibility for the administration of the National Galleries of Scotland,
the Royal Scottish Museum (including the Scottish United Services Museum),
the National Museum of Antiquities of Scotland, and the National Library
of Scotland.
The Scottish Home and Health Department is responsible for the central
administration of functions relating to law and order, including the police
service, criminal justice and legal aid and the administration of penal institu¬
tions. It also has responsibility for the administration of the National Health
Service in Scotland, legislation relating to public service superannuation
schemes in Scotland and the administration of the teachers’ and National
Health Service superannuation schemes. The Home and Health Department
is the central authority in Scotland for the fire service, for certain home de¬
fence and emergency services, and for legislation concerning shops, theatres,
cinemas, licensed premises and land tenure matters. It is responsible for
Scottish aspects of devolution.
In addition to the main departments, there are a number of other Scottish
departments, all of which work in varying degrees under the direction of the
Secretary of State. Such departments include the Department of the Registrar-
General for Scotland (the General Register Office); the Scottish Record Office;
and the Department of the Registers of Scotland. There are also Scottish
branches of the Great Britain and United Kingdom departments under the
direction of controllers, who are responsible for ensuring that the execution in
Scotland of the policy and procedure of their departments is in accordance with
Scottish conditions and needs.
The Law Officers of the Crown for Scotland (the Lord Advocate and the
Solicitor General for Scotland) are the chief legal advisers to the Government
on Scottish questions and the principal representatives of the Crown for the
purposes of litigation in Scotland. The Lord Advocate is also closely concerned
with questions of legal policy and administration and is himself responsible
for the institution and direction of all prosecutions on indictment in Scotland,
and the control of summary prosecutions in the sheriff court, which are con¬
ducted by officials of the Procurator Fiscal Service. In some of this work the
Lord Advocate is assisted by the Lord Advocate’s Department and the
Scottish Courts Administration. The members of the Lord Advocate’s
Department also act as legal advisers on Scottish questions to certain govern¬
ment departments who have no Scottish legal adviser of their own. The work
relevant to prosecutions is centred in the Crown Office in Edinburgh.
The Parliamentary Draftsmen for Scotland, incorporated in the Lord
Advocate’s Department, are responsible to the minister concerned and to the
Law Officers for the drafting of government Bills affecting the law of Scotland.
The Scottish Courts Administration has a general responsibility to the Secre¬
tary of State for the organisation, administration and staffing of the courts
and court offices, and is responsible to the Lord Advocate for certain functions

in the field of law, including the programme of the Scottish Law Commission,
proposals for law reform and questions involving private international law,
international conventions and associated problems, the jurisdiction and
procedure of the Scottish courts, and enforcement of judgments.
Northern Ireland has traditionally had its own subordinate legislature respon¬
sible for a broad range of domestic matters. The Government of Ireland Act
1920 enacted a constitution which, while preserving the supreme authority of
the United Kingdom Parliament and reserving certain matters to that Parlia¬
ment, provided Northern Ireland with its own legislature and executive to
deal with domestic ‘transferred’ matters. These arrangements remained in
force until 1972 when, following several years’ political instability and violence
in Northern Ireland, a period of direct rule was introduced, with executive
powers exercised by a Secretary of State for Northern Ireland and laws made
by Order in Council. In 1973 a new type of constitution for the Province
provided, among other things, for the devolution of powers to a legislative
assembly and a power-sharing executive. These arrangements came into force
in January 1974, but following widespread opposition in Northern Ireland
the Assembly was prorogued in May 1974- JU^Y I974 the Northern Ireland
Act was introduced, providing for the election of a Constitutional Convention
to consider what arrangements for the government of Northern Ireland would
be likely to command most widespread acceptance throughout the community.
The Act provided that, in the interim period (defined as one year from the
passing of the Act), the United Kingdom Government and Parliament
should continue to be responsible for law and order, electoral matters and
business of national importance, such as the Crown, foreign policy, defence
and certain aspects of taxation. It further provided that the Secretary of State
for Northern Ireland should be responsible to the United Kingdom Parlia¬
ment for the devolved services, and that laws for Northern Ireland on matters
formerly within the competence of the Assembly should be made by Order
in Council during the interim period, which could be shortened or extended
by the United Kingdom Parliament. The Northern Ireland Assembly was
dissolved at the end of March 1975’ Rud elections to the Constitutional
Convention and its first meeting took place in May. In the meantime, the
Northern Ireland departments, which have executive responsibility for the
devolved matters (such as agriculture, commerce, education, health, finance
and the environment), are temporarily the responsibility of ministers in the
Northern Ireland Office.
The Northern Ireland Office is the department of the Secretary of State for
Northern Ireland who, assisted by two Ministers of State and two Parliamen¬
tary Under Secretaries of State, has overall responsibility, and is fully answer-
able to Parliament, for the government of Northern Ireland. In addition to
exercising personal responsibility for constitutional developments, law and
order and security in Northern Ireland, the Secretary of State is closely con¬
cerned with financial and economic matters in the Province. The four other
ministers are in charge of the various Northern Ireland departments, the
activities of which are co-ordinated as necessary.
The Northern Ireland departments’ functions are listed below.
The Department of Agriculture is responsible for the development of Northern
Ireland’s agricultural, forestry and fishing industries, and for the administra¬
tion of legislation and schemes in Northern Ireland relating to farm improve-

forest recreation, fisheries, and marketing and processing. The functions of the
department also include the collection of agricultural census data, the compila¬
tion of statistics, the provision of extensive advisory services to farmers, and
the promotion of agricultural research, education and training.
The Department of Commerce is concerned with the development of Northern
Ireland’s industry and commerce, and with the administration of schemes of
assistance to industry. The department also has responsibilities in connection
with electricity and other fuel undertakings; harbours (other than fishery
harbours); the tourist trade; the regulation and inspection of mines and
quarries; mineral development; consumer protection (including weights and
measures); the registration of companies, societies, credit unions, trade
unions, and insurance and unit trusts; and the administration of an industrial
forensic science department.
The Department of Education’s functions include the development of
primary, secondary and further education, including adult and higher educa¬
tion; oversight of the five area education and library boards which are
responsible to the department for the local administration of the education
and library services; teacher training; examinations; youth welfare and youth
services; museums; the Arts Council for Northern Ireland; and the Armagh
Observatory.
The department is also responsible for sport and recreation, for formulating
and sponsoring policies for the improvement of community relations, and for
making grants to local authorities and voluntary bodies for a wide range of
social provisions to relieve special social need in urban areas.
The Department of the Environment is responsible for European Community
co-ordination. Its other functions are concerned with the construction and
maintenance of roads and bridges; street lighting; traffic management; road
safety; public service vehicle inspection; driving licences; fire services; trans¬
port; water supply; sewerage services; environmental public health; clean air;
and the listing and preservation of historic buildings.
The Department of Finance’s responsibilities include the control of the
expenditure of the Northern Ireland departments, liaison with the United
Kingdom Treasury and the Northern Ireland Office on financial matters, and
the management of Northern Ireland’s Civil Service. Functions include
economic and social planning and research; compilation of statistics; issue of
Ulster savings securities; control of borrowing; advancement of government
loans to local and public authorities; making regional rate orders and fixing
the regional rate and collection of the regional and district rates; and
staffing, recruitment and training of civil servants and regulation of Civil
Service conditions.
The department also has certain duties in relation to constitutional and
legal policies and law reform, and to charities and charitable funds. Its other
responsibilities include the provision and maintenance of public buildings, the
issue of building regulations, liaison with the construction industry, property
valuation, ordnance survey, public records, the registration of births, deaths
and marriages, the registration of titles, land, miscellaneous licensing (includ¬
ing licensing bookmakers, money lenders and the sale of intoxicating liquor)
and the registration of clubs.

The Department of Health and Social Services is responsible for the
administration of social security benefits in Northern Ireland; for health
services (which include hospitals, family doctors, dentists, chemists and
opticians); and for the personal social services (including child care and
adoption and care of the elderly and the physically and mentally handicapped).
The department is also responsible for the development of community work.
The Department of Housing, Local Government and Planning is responsible
for housing; local government; planning (area planning and planning control);
amenity lands—country parks, nature reserves and areas of natural beauty;
and comprehensive development (redevelopment—other than housing—of
district, town or village centres).
The Department of Manpower Services is responsible for the administration
of the employment service in Northern Ireland; for the compilation of employ¬
ment and unemployment statistics; for the provision of an advisory service to
companies; and for government training centres, integrated work-force units,
industrial training boards, management training, and the training-on-employ-
ers-premises scheme. The department also has functions in connection with
industrial relations, provides the factory inspectorate and is concerned with
disabled persons, contracts of employment, redundancy pay and wages
councils.
THE CIVIL SERVICE
A civil servant in Britain is a servant of the Crown (not being the holder of a
political or judicial office), who is paid wholly and directly out of money voted
by Parliament and works in a civil capacity in a department of government.
Including part-time staff (two part-time officers being reckoned as equivalent
to one full-time), there are about 700,000 civil servants (one-third of them
women), roughly 290,000 of whom are engaged in the provision of public
services—paying sickness benefits and pensions, collecting taxes and contribu¬
tions, running employment services, staffing prisons, and providing services
to industry and agriculture. About 265,000 are employed in the Ministry of
Defence, including the Royal Ordnance factories and Royal Dockyards. The
rest are about equally divided between: central administrative and policy
duties; service-wide support services, such as accommodation, printing, and
information; and services which are largely self-supporting financially, for
instance those provided by the Department for National Savings and the
Royal Mint.
Over 70 per cent of civil servants work outside the London area, and plans
have been made for further dispersal from the capital.
The total of civil servants includes about 177,000 industrial staff, mainly
manual workers in government industrial establishments, whose pay and condi¬
tions of service are largely separately administered, and differ quite sub¬
stantially, from those for non-industrial grades.
Stability of administration is ensured by the political neutrality of the service.
Although a civil servant works under the authority and direction of the minister
of the department to which he is appointed, legally he is a servant of the Crown.
A change of minister, whether due to ministerial changes within a government
or the advent of a government of a different political complexion, does not
involve a change of permanent staff.
GOVERNMENT
The
Development
of the
Modern
Service
61
The Civil Service in its present form is a product of the past 120 years.
Before then, departments were free to choose their own staffs, qualifying
standards were unknown, there was no central supervision, and political
jobbery was rife. Nineteenth-century reforms included the substitution of open
competition for the practice of obtaining Civil Service appointments by favour
or purchase, and the establishment of an independent body, the Civil Service
Commission, to control recruitment. The great expansion in State activity in
the first half of the twentieth century, and the consequent increase in the
numbers of civil servants and the scope of their duties, led to further re¬
organisation, including the creation of service-wide scientific and professional
classes; recruitment was adapted to a developing educational system, and
co-ordination between the various departments improved. Civil servants,
though they remained employees of their departments, became members of an
integrated service with common conditions of employment and traditions and
standards of conduct belonging, not to individual departments, but to the
Civil Service as a whole.
More recently the structure and management of the Civil Service came
under detailed internal scrutiny following the report of the Fulton committee
which in 1968 assessed the structure, recruitment and management, including
management training, of the service. As a result of the report, the Civil
Service is undergoing a programme of reshaping and modernisation, designed
to make it more effective in carrying out its changing tasks.
Structure
General
Category
The structure of the Home Civil Service, which until recently tended to reflect
the assumption that specific types of work should be allocated to particular
groups of civil servants on the basis of their specialist or vocational qualifica¬
tions, is at present being redesigned to provide for a more flexible deployment
of staff so that talent can be used to the best advantage and the highest levels of
the Civil Service seen to be open to people of outstanding ability, whatever
their specialist background or original method of entry to the service. These
structural changes involve the abolition of classes, and are being allied with
personnel management policies designed to ensure that, although work
requiring specialist skill is always done by appropriately qualified individuals,
people with the necessary aptitudes are given suitably wide experience to fit
them for higher posts.
At the top levels of the Civil Service, where staff are predominantly con¬
cerned with higher management and policy, there is now an open and unified
structure, with three grades—permanent secretary, deputy secretary and
under secretary—available for all types of post. Posts at these levels are filled
by the people most suitable for them without regard to their academic
background or to whether they were previously in a specialist or generalist
stream.
At other levels the structure is being based on a system of categories which
are pay and grading structures and occupational groups which are groups of
staff within each category, whose members have common personnel manage¬
ment and recruitment needs. Four new categories have so far been created,
and the groups of staff that are so far members of them are shown below.
The Administration Group contains some 270,000 staff. Their functions range
from the co-ordination and improvement of government machinery and the
formulation of advice to ministers on matters of policy to the performance of
normal clerical duties connected with the running of departmental business at
lower levels.

The Economist Group contains about 300 staff. They provide economic
advice and undertake economic analysis.
The Statistician Group (some 450 staff) undertakes the collection and
analysis of statistics required for government policies (see p. 45).
The Information Officer Group (some 1,350 staff) carries out a variety of
specialised press, publicity, public relations and information work.
The Science Category contains the Science Group (18,000 staff), which is
responsible for conducting scientific research and testing in numerous govern¬
ment laboratories and testing establishments, and for providing advice on
scientific policy. Its members also participate in the planning and management
of advanced technology procurement projects.
The Professional and Technical Group contains some 40,000 staff and
includes a range of professionals—architects, surveyors, quantity surveyors,
and electrical and mechanical engineers—and appropriate supporting staff,
whose main function is to plan and oversee a wide range of government
construction and procurement activities, and to carry out certain inspection
and regulatory activities.
The Illustrator Group contains about 500 staff responsible for the prepara¬
tion of all forms of artwork applied to the wide range of requirements within
the Government service.
Within the Training Category the Instructional Officer Group comprises
some 4,000 staff employed on instruction in a trade, craft or subject, or on
ancillary or supervisory duties connected with instruction.
The four categories already established account for some 60 per cent of the
non-industrial staff; the remainder are in due course to be allocated to one of
the three main categories or, where this is impossible, to additional categories
to be set up for the purpose. Such staff include those in a number of ‘general
service’ classes (that is to say, classes whose members serve in a number of
departments), for instance, the medical and legal classes.
The Civil Service employs about 24,000 shorthand typists, audio typists and
copy typists, who work mainly in small groups, and about 4>500 porsona^
secretaries who work mainly to senior civil servants.
There are about 29,000 other support staff, including paperkeepers, office
cleaners and messengers. (As far as practicable, posts of messengers are
reserved for ex-servicemen, although other men and women over the age of
30 may be recruited.)
The Diplomatic Service is a separate self-contained service of the Crown,
which provides the staff (it directly administers some 6,500 civil servants) for
service in the Foreign and Commonwealth Office and at United Kingdom
diplomatic missions and consular posts in foreign and in independent Com¬
monwealth countries. Its functions include advising on policy, negotiating
with overseas governments and conducting business in international organisa¬
tions', promoting British exports and the advancement of British trade, present¬
ing British ideas, policies and objectives to the people of overseas countries;
and protecting British interests abroad.
The service has its own grade structure, linked for salary purposes with
that of the Home Civil Service. It also has secretarial, communications and
security officer branches. Various specialists and advisers from home depart-

ments or the armed forces may serve at overseas posts on secondment or
attachment to the Diplomatic Service.
The Northern Ireland has its own Civil Service which, subject to regional differ-
Northern Ireland ences, is modelled on its counterpart in Great Britain, recruitment being
Civil Service effected through its own Civil Service Commission. Interchange of staff
between the two Civil Services occurs to a minor extent only, and is a matter
for departmental agreement in individual cases.
Britain’s dependent territories fill vacancies in their public services by the
appointment of suitably qualified local candidates wherever possible; but
when vacancies cannot be filled by this means the Foreign and Commonwealth
Office, the Ministry of Overseas Development and the Crown Agents for
Oversea Governments and Administrations (see p. 379) are asked to recruit
other candidates, principally from the United Kingdom.
Recruitment Recruitment to the Civil Service is the responsibility of the Civil Service
Commission which, working in conjunction with departments, ensures that
staff are selected on the basis of fair and open competition. The selection of
junior staff, especially those engaged in clerical and manual work, is under¬
taken almost entirely by departments. The commission, however, always
issues the ‘certificate of qualification’ necessary for permanent appointment.
The appointment of a successful candidate is made by the department in
which he is to be employed.
For the administration group, which forms the central part of the Home
Civil Service, entry is at three levels relating broadly to the academic achieve¬
ments of university honours graduates; 18-year-old school-leavers; and 16-
year-old school-leavers. The selection procedure for the highest of these levels
—the Administration Trainee entry—comprises qualifying tests, followed by
a series of tests and interviews at the Civil Service Selection Board and an
interview by the Final Selection Board. For most other entries selection from
among those possessing the necessary academic qualifications is normally by
interview only.
Entry to the professional and technical grades usually requires appropriate
qualifications in the subject concerned, and selection is on the basis of past
record and by interview.
Training In all except the smallest government departments, there are full-time training
officers and instructors whose task it is to help identify the training needs of the
staff and to organise courses, both general and technical, to provide for their
varying requirements. The number of management courses run within the
Civil Service, including those provided at the Civil Service College, has
recently increased substantially. Some use is also made of external management
courses in business schools, the Administrative Staff College, Henley, and
other centres.
Methods of training within the Civil Service combine lectures, discussion
groups, instructional visits and case-studies with the use of many audio-visual
aids such as closed-circuit television and video-tape recordings, instructional
films and programmed learning. There is also a considerable amount of‘on-the-
job’ training. Civil servants are regularly moved between the different branches
of their department and sometimes between departments so that they can gain
as wide an experience as possible of Civil Service work.
In order that they may continue their education, arrangements are made for

the release of civil servants under the age of 18 to attend appropriate courses
usually on one day a week ((day release schemes). Adult staff are assisted
financially to undertake, mainly in their own time, private studies leading to
recognised educational or professional qualifications in approved subjects.
There are also opportunities for civil servants in mid-career to obtain fellow¬
ships or otherwise to go on sabbatical leave to undertake research in areas of
interest to themselves or their departments.
Training is co-ordinated by the Personnel Management (Training) Division
of the Civil Service Department which is responsible, in conjunction with the
Civil Service College, for the analysis and determination of training needs to be
met centrally, and which exercises advisory functions in regard to depart¬
mental training. All central training is provided by the Civil Service College
which offers a wide range of courses and seminars (some of a broad develop¬
mental nature and others more job-related) for civil servants, including those
in specialist groups, at various levels up to and including that of under
secretary. Subjects covered include structure and machinery of government,
organisation and staff management, economics, statistics, industrial growth,
social administration, operational research, computers and information
systems.
The college also provides courses on European institutions and their
working, and is developing links in a variety of matters, including training,
with other European countries.
A period of probation (varying according to grade, with extensions in certain
instances) is the rule for all new entrants to the Civil Service.
Promotions are made partly through centrally conducted examinations and
partly by the departments themselves. Promotions or appointments to most
of the highest positions in the service (for instance, permanent secretaries,
principal personnel officers and principal finance officers) are approved by
the Prime Minister, who is advised in these matters by the head of the Home
Civil Service.
The consideration governing all promotion is the advancement of the
efficiency of the public service—the criterion being the fitness of an officer for a
more senior, responsible post. Normally promotion is from grade to grade, but
a procedure of accelerated promotion has been worked out for administration
trainees and officers who have shown exceptional promise but are outside the
age and salary limit for a particular grade.
Machinery for negotiation on conditions of service affecting the Civil Service
as a whole is provided by the National Whitley Council, which is composed
jointly of official and staff representatives. Negotiating machinery for separate
sections of the service is provided through the various staff associations which
civil servants are encouraged to join (for instance, the Civil and Public
Services Association, the Society of Civil Servants and the Institution of
Professional Civil Servants), and through departmental Whitley Councils.
In general, the civil servant receives a salary which is based on a fair
comparison with that paid for similar work outside the service and usually he
receives annual increments up to the maximum of the scale of the grade to
which he belongs. In addition, although a civil servant holds office at the
pleasure of the Crown and may therefore be dismissed at any time, in practice
he enjoys a considerable measure of security of tenure. Thus every civil
servant who is capable and efficient may reasonably expect a full career in
Political and
Private Activities

the public service and is entitled to receive pension benefits. Equal pay exists
for men and women in the Civil Service.
It is possible for staff to interrupt their careers, or to have special leave
granted, to look after domestic responsibilities, and staff who resign may apply
later to rejoin the service in the grade they held at the time of resignation.
Civil servants are required to work a specified number of hours each week.
Certain grades are eligible for overtime pay for any hours worked in excess of
the standard hours, but this does not apply to the higher grades whose salaries
are determined on the assumption that they will work such long hours as may
be necessary without additional pay. The standard working week for office
staff is 41 hours in London and 42 hours in the provinces. Annual leave varies
according to grade and length of service up to a maximum of six weeks (that is,
30 working days a year).
Sick leave on full pay, less any national insurance benefit received, may be
granted to civil servants for up to six months in any 12 months, and on
reduced pay up to a maximum of one year’s sick leave in any four years; any
officer whose health is permanently impaired may be retired.
The position and functions of a civil servant remain the same whichever
political party is in power; and it is his duty to serve the government of the day
irrespective of his own political opinion. The extent to which he is free, as a
private individual, to participate in political activities varies according to grade.
For this purpose civil servants are divided into three groups: those who are
completely free to engage in all kinds of national and local political activities
(although if they intend standing for Parliament, they must resign their
appointment before nomination day on the understanding that if not elected
they will be reinstated in their previous capacity within a week of the declara¬
tion of the election result); those who are free, subject to the acceptance of the
need for discretion and with the permission of the department, to take part in
most activities except parliamentary candidature; and those who are debarred
from national political activities though they may seek permission to take part
in local government political activities. In the non-industrial Civil Service, the
completely free groups are members of the minor classes such as cleaners and
messengers. The intermediate group includes mainly members of the clerical
and typing grades and the granting of permission by the department depends,
broadly, on the nature of the work done. The remainder are not allowed to
take part in national political activities. Permission is usually granted to
members of all groups to engage in local political activities to the maximum
extent consistent with the reputation of the Civil Service for political im¬
partiality and the avoidance of any conflict with official duties. Where per¬
mission is granted, it is subject to a code of discretion and to the obligation to
notify the department of election or co-option to a local council.
All civil servants enjoy the right to register their private political opinions
on appropriate occasions, for instance, at general or local authority elections.
They may also engage in such private activities as they wish, provided that
these do not in any way conflict with their official duties, nor with the pro¬
visions of the Official Secrets Acts 19111 and 1920, and the Prevention of
Corruption Act 1926. However, since a civil servant must not use his official
position to further his private interests, he is subject to certain restrictions in
commerce and business: for instance, he may not hold private interests in

public contracts and he may not use official information in writing, broad¬
casting or lecturing without the approval of his department.
The political views of civil servants are not as a general rule a matter of official
concern, but there are some civil service duties in which secrecy is so vitally
important to State security that the Government does not feel itself justified
in employing anyone to carry them out whose reliability is in doubt. For this
reason no one who is known to be a member of, or actively associated or in
sympathy with, the Communist Party or with Fascist organisations, or is liable
to be a security risk in any other respect, is employed on secret work.
Each government department is responsible for its own internal security,
and the Security Service, which operates independently under a Director-
General who is responsible for its efficiency to the Home Secretary, deals with
national security. In addition, there is a Security Commission which, if
requested by the Prime Minister in consultation with the Leader of the
Opposition, may investigate and report on breaches of security in the public
service and, in certain circumstances, advise whether any change in security
arrangements is necessary or desirable.
LOCAL GOVERNMENT
The local government system comprises a pattern of elected councils for
defined areas. The councils represent their own localities, provide a local level
of democracy and make available a wide range of services.
The specific powers and duties of local authorities are conferred on them by
Act of Parliament (or by measures made under the authority of an Act). The
actual administration and the exercise of discretion within statutory limits are
the responsibility of the local authority, but, in respect of certain services,
Acts of Parliament dealing with local government give government ministers
defined powers, some of which are designed to secure a measure of national
uniformity in the standard of service provided or to safeguard public health,
while others are for the protection of the rights of individual citizens. For some
services the minister concerned has wide powers of supervision; for others
there are strictly limited powers. Government policy is to ensure that central
government controls over local authorities are kept to a minimum.
In addition to their statutory powers, ministers concerned with local
government give assistance to local authorities by the general issue of advisory
circulars and by giving advice in individual cases.
The main links between local authorities and the central Government are:
in England, the Department of the Environment; in Scotland, the Scottish
Development Department; in Wales, the Welsh Office; and in Northern
Ireland, the Department of Housing, Local Government and Planning.
The main pattern of local government organisation in England and Wales
(outside Greater London) is a division of the country into 53 large county
authorities (see map on p. 67), within which there are 369 smaller district
authorities. Both types of authority have independent, locally elected councils,
and have separate functions to perform. County authorities normally provide
the large-scale local government services, while the districts are responsible
for the more local ones (see p. 69). However, in six of the English counties,
which are in heavily populated areas and known as ‘metropolitan counties,
responsibility for certain large-scale services rests with the district authorities.
In England populations in the non-metropolitan counties range from 286,000

to about 1-4 million (the Isle of Wight with a population of about 111,000
is an exception), and in the metropolitan counties from 1-2 to 2-8 million.
District authorities within metropolitan counties have populations of between
172,000 and 1-i million; other districts’ populations average between 75,000
and 100,000, although many fall outside this range. The local government
system in Wales closely resembles that in non-metropolitan areas of England.
Populations in the counties range from 100,000 to 539,000, and the districts
have populations of between 19,000 and 285,000* English parish councils or
meetings in villages and small towns serve as focuses for local opinion as
bodies with limited powers of local interest. In Wales similar functions
are discharged by community councils.
Greater London—an administrative area of about 610 square miles (1,580
sq km) and a population of some 7-2 million—is administered by the Greater
London Council, the councils of 32 London boroughs (with populations
ranging from 137,000 to 329,000) and the Corporation of the City of London
(the historic centre which has a resident population of less than 6,000).
On the mainland of Scotland local government is on a two-tier basis: nine
regions are divided into 53 districts, each area having its own elected council.
There are three virtually all-purpose authorities for Orkney, Shetland and
the Western Isles. Local community councils are being formed to express
local views and to take action in the interests of the community.
The pattern of local authorities, and of their electoral arrangements, is kept
up to date by three Boundary Commissions—one for England, one for Wales
and one for Scotland.
In Northern Ireland local environmental services are the responsibility of
26 district councils; area boards and local offices responsible to the appropriate
central departments administer other services at a local level.
Local authorities comprise a number of elected unpaid councillors presided
over by a chairman. They can claim flat-rate attendance allowance as of right
(without proof of loss of earnings) on the performance of council business;
they are also entitled to travelling and subsistence allowances. Parish and
community councillors cannot claim for duties performed within their own
areas.
In England and Wales each council annually elects a chairman and vice-
chairman. Some districts have the ceremonial title of borough granted by
royal charter and some are cities. In boroughs and cities the chairman is
normally known as the Mayor (in the City of London and certain other cities,
he is known as the Lord Mayor). In Scottish regions and islands areas the
chairman is called the convener; no general title is laid down for district
chairmen, but some are known as conveners, while others continue to use the
old burghal title of ‘provost’.
The term of office of a councillor elected to any form of local government is
usually four years. In England and Wales county council elections will take
place in 1977 and every fourth year thereafter. The metropolitan district
elections are held for a third of the seats in each year when there is no county
council election; the non-metropolitan district councils can adopt the
same procedure or choose block elections in 1976, 1979 an<^ every fourth
year thereafter. In London the next Greater London Council elections will
be held in 1977, and elections to the London borough councils will take
place in 1978. In Scotland the next elections for the regions will be in 1978,
and for the districts in 1977. Elections are held every four years in Northern
Ireland.
GOVERNMENT
69
Any person (including a member of the House of Lords) is entitled to vote
at a local government election in Great Britain provided that he or she is 18
years of age or over, is a British subject or a citizen of the Irish Republic, is
not subject to any legal incapacity and is registered as a local government
elector for the area for which the election is held. A person qualifies for regis¬
tration as a local government elector if, on the qualifying date for the register
(compiled annually), he or she is resident in the council area. In Northern
Ireland, a person must be 18 years of age or over and must have been born in
Northern Ireland or, alternatively, have resided continuously in Britain for
seven years immediately prior to the qualifying date.
A candidate for election as councillor—man or woman—normally stands
as a representative of one of the national political parties, as a member of an
association representing some local interest, or as an independent. He must be
of British nationality and aged 21 or over. In addition, he must be registered as
a local government elector in the area of the local authority to which he seeks
election; or have resided or occupied (as owner or tenant) land or other pre¬
mises in that area during the whole of the 12 months preceding the day on
which he is nominated as a candidate; or, in that 12 months, have had his
principal or only place of work there. A candidate is also subject to a number of
statutory disqualifications designed to ensure that unsuitable people do not
offer themselves for election.
Local authority areas are generally divided into electoral areas for local
council elections. Administrative counties in England and Wales are divided
into electoral divisions returning one or more councillors in accordance with
orders made by the Home Secretary. Districts in England, Wales and Nor¬
thern Ireland are divided into electoral ‘wards’. In Scotland in the regions and
islands areas the electoral areas are called electoral divisions, each returning
a single member; the districts are divided into wards, similarly returning a
single member. For parish or community council elections in England and
Wales, each parish or ward of a parish (or, in some cases, a combination of
parishes) forms an electoral area which returns one or more members. For
elections to the Greater London Council, parliamentary constituencies form
the electoral areas, with each constituency returning one councillor.
Voting takes place at polling stations arranged by the returning officer
concerned, and under the supervision of a presiding officer appointed for the
purpose. The procedure for local government voting is similar to that for
parliamentary elections, although facilities for postal voting are more res¬
tricted. In Great Britain each elector has one vote for each seat contested in
his electoral area: he need not record all his votes, but must not give more than
one vote for each candidate. In Northern Ireland the 1973 loc^l government
elections were held on the basis of proportional representation.
The functions of local authorities are far reaching. Some are framed primarily
as duties mandatory on an authority, others are purely permissive.
Broadly speaking, functions in England and Wales are divided between
county and district councils on the basis that county councils are responsible
for matters requiring planning and administration over wide areas or requiring
the support of substantial resources. Within the metropolitan areas district
councils are responsible for functions needing substantial resources because
they have populations large enough to give such support. District councils as a
whole administer functions of more local significance. In London the division
of functions is slightly different.
7°
BRITAIN 1976: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
In England all county councils are responsible for such matters as strategic
planning, transportation planning, highways, traffic regulation consumer
protection, refuse disposal, police and the fire service. Education, libraries and
the personal social services are functions of county councils in non-metro¬
politan areas and of district councils in metropolitan areas. All district councils
are responsible, for instance, for environmental health, housing, decisions on
most planning applications and refuse collection. They may also provide off-
street car parks subject to the consent of the county council. Powers to operate
some functions—such as the provision of museums, art galleries and parks
are available at both levels; arrangements depend on local agreement.
In Greater London the London boroughs and the Corporation of the City of
London are responsible for the same range of functions as district councils in
metropolitan areas (with the addition of consumer protection). The Greater
London Council (GLC) deals only with those services which by their nature
require unified administration and control over the whole area. In the inner
London area education is administered by the Inner London Education
Authority, an independent committee of the GLC. Responsibility for hig -
ways in London is divided according to the type of road: principal roads (t e
main strategic road network) are a matter for the GLC, while the London
boroughs look after the other roads. The boroughs are primarily responsible
for the provision of housing, although the GLC also maintains a stock o
housing. It is additionally involved in such matters as the provision of
housing outside London for people from the London area, assisting the inner
London boroughs in relation to slum clearance, the provision of accommoda¬
tion for people on the London boroughs’ housing waiting lists and the
rehousing of its own tenants and those of the London boroughs whose
accommodation needs have changed. Greater London and certain areas just
outside are policed by the Metropolitan Police Force, which, unlike county
police forces, is directly responsible to the Home Secretary and not to local
police authorities. , .
In Wales the division of functions between county and district councils is
much the same as that between county and district councils in non-metro¬
politan areas of England. The main differences are that Welsh district councils
are responsible for refuse disposal; they may, subject to the consent of the
county council, provide on-street as well as off-street car parking facilities,
and they may, exceptionally, be designated to exercise library and consumer
protection functions. r ..u • f ^
Local authorities in England and Wales may arrange for most of their func¬
tions to be carried out on their behalf by another local authority. The excep¬
tions to this general rule are functions relating to education, police, the
personal social services and national parks. , ,
In Scotland the regional and district authorities discharge local governmen
functions in a way broadly similar to that of authorities ^ England and
Wales, including some at both levels. Orkney, Shetland and the Western
Isles, because of their isolation, have single, virtually all-purpose authentic .
In Northern Ireland, local environmental services are administered by
district councils, but control of roads, water supply and sewerage services
is exercised in each district by a local office of the Northern Ireland Depart¬
ment of the Environment working in close association with the district coun
and its staff. Responsibility for planning is similarly exercised by local o ces
of the Department of Housing, Local Government and Planning Area boards,
responsible to appropriate central departments, administer locally education,
public libraries and the health and personal social services.

Internal
Organisation
of Local
Authorities
Officers and
Employees
Local authorities are free to a very considerable extent to make their own
internal arrangements and to choose the means and methods by which they
discharge their responsibilities. Most councils use the committee system,
whereby questions of policy and principle are decided in full council, and
committees are appointed to administer the various services. Parish and
community councils in England and Wales are often able to do their work
efficiently in full session although they appoint committees from time to time
as necessary. Many councils have rationalised their organisation by reducing
substantially the number of their committees. Some have established policy
advisory or co-ordinating committees with powers to originate policy,
subject to the approval of the full council. Advice to enable councils to deter¬
mine appropriate management principles and structures has been given in the
report of an official study group (see Bibliography, p. 468).
The powers and duties of local authority committees (which may be ad¬
visory or executive) are usually laid down in the appointing council’s standing
orders. A council is free to delegate all its powers to committees, except its
powers in connection with raising loans, levying rates (see p. 72), or making
financial demands on other authorities liable to contribute, which are legally
reserved to the council as a whole.
Local authorities can make arrangements among themselves for the dis-
charge of their functions. These include co-operation through joint commit¬
tees, joint teams and the loan of staff. One authority may discharge functions
for another, and may also supply others with a range of goods and services.
The public and the press are admitted to all meetings of a council (and of
committees) but may be excluded while a particular item is considered if the
council (or committee) resolves that publicity for that matter would be pre¬
judicial to the public interest.
The execution of council policy rests with salaried officers and employees, of
whom there may be tens of thousands in the larger authorities. Well over
two million people are employed by local authorities, including administra¬
tive, professional and technical staff, manual workers such as refuse collectors
and other groups including teachers and transport staff. A few appointments,
such as chief education and fire officers and the director of social services,
must by law be made by all the authorities responsible for the functions
concerned, but councils are normally free to employ whatever staff they
consider necessary and to choose their personnel. An authority must not
however employ one of its own councillors.
As a general rule, employees are of three kinds: heads of departments or
chief officers, whose duties are mainly of an administrative and managerial
kind; subordinate officers employed in an administrative, a professional,
clerical or technical capacity; and manual workers who are employed to do the
physical work for which the council is responsible. Senior staff appointments
are usually made at the instance of the committee or committees particularly
concerned; most junior appointments are made by heads of departments, who
are also responsible for engaging manual workers. Appointments and engage¬
ments always conform to the council’s set establishment, and committees
are informed of any appointments which they have not made themselves.
Rates of pay and conditions of service for local authority staff are within
the jurisdiction of the employing council. They are based on recommendations
made by the Whitley Councils (see p. 64), of which the largest are the National
Joint Council for Local Authorities’ Administrative, Professional, Technical
and Clerical Services and the National Joint Council for Local Authorities’

Services (Manual Workers). Conditions of service and salary scales for senior
local government officers are determined by separate joint committees for
England and Wales, and for Scotland. The local government service in
Northern Ireland has its separate joint negotiating machinery at various levels.
Local
Government
Finance1
Government
Grants
Rates
Local authority expenditure in the United Kingdom (on both current and
capital accounts) was nearly ^14,000 million in I974" A clear distinction is
made between capital and current expenditure. Capital expenditure (just
under a quarter of the total) is normally financed by borrowing. Housing, the
major element, accounts for almost a third of the total. The education service
accounts for about a third of current expenditure, followed by the police, the
personal social services, roads, and refuse disposal. Current expenditure is
financed from three principal sources: government grants (nearly a half
in 1974); local rates paid by occupiers of land and buildings (almost a
third); and rents from council houses, and other income (about a fifth).
Each local authority is responsible for its own finance, although in a few
cases several authorities combine their resources to organise a specialised
service which it would be uneconomic for each authority to provide on
its own.
The most important government grants to local authorities are the rate
support grants’ which are paid in aid of revenues generally. Grants are also
paid towards the cost of specific services—either towards current expenditure,
such as on the police, or towards capital expenditure, such as on the acquisi¬
tion and clearance of derelict land. Annual subsidies are paid for local authority
housing.
Rate support grants are distributed among authorities in three parts. the
‘needs’ element which is designed to give most help to authorities whose
spending needs are greatest; the ‘resources’ element, which is used to supple¬
ment the rate income of authorities whose rateable value per head of popula¬
tion falls below a standard figure, prescribed for each year; and the ‘domestic’
element, which compensates authorities for loss of rate income from reduc¬
tions in rate poundage which they are required to give to householders.
The formula for distributing the ‘needs’ element is subject to variations from
year to year. Grants are also made towards the cost of rate rebates for people
with low incomes.
In Northern Ireland the district councils receive specific grants plus a
resources element towards the services they provide.
Rates are local taxes paid by the occupiers of non-agricultural land and build¬
ings to meet the cost of local services (after allowing for grants and other
income). Each occupier’s payment is calculated annually by the rating autho¬
rity by multiplying the rateable value of his property (broadly equivalent to its
annual rental value) by the rate poundage—an amount per l of rateable value
fixed by the authority according to its projected financial needs. Rateable
values are assessed periodically in England and Wales by the Board of Inland
Revenue, which is independent of local authorities. The present valuation
lists came into force in i973- Disputes about rating assessments are heard by
local valuation courts, and then, on appeal, by the Lands Tribunal.
In Scotland valuation is on a basis similar to that in England and Wales,

but it is carried out by assessors appointed by the regional and islands
councils. Appeals are heard by the valuation appeal committee of each valua¬
tion area and thereafter by the Lands Valuation Appeal Court of the Court of
Session. In Northern Ireland the valuation authority is the Commissioner of
Valuation, whose office is part of the Department of Finance.
In England and Wales the responsibility for levying and collecting the rates
lies with the district councils and London borough councils. Expenditure by
county councils and the Greater London Council is met by contributions from
district councils and London borough councils respectively, who take these
into account in the rates they levy. In Scotland, every authority determines
a rate for its own services, but the collection of rates and the administration
of rating is the responsibility of regional and islands councils. In Northern
Ireland rates are set by the district councils (district rate) and by the Depart¬
ment of Finance (regional rate); both are collected by the department.
Agricultural land and buildings (apart from living accommodation) and
places of religious worship are exempted from rate payments, and in Scotland
and Northern Ireland industry and freight transport are rated at a half and a
quarter, respectively, of their net annual value. Householders in Great Britain
benefit from rate reductions financed by government grant and they have the
right to pay rates in ten instalments a year. Householders with small incomes
are entitled to rebates. Charities pay half the full rate on property they
occupy for charitable purposes but may be given further reliefs by the rating
authorities, which can reduce or remit the rates for a range of non-profit-
making bodies. Full rates may be levied on empty properties.
Loans may be raised by local authorities to finance capital expenditure under
general powers conferred by national legislation. For items of expenditure
in key sectors (such as education, housing and roads) local authorities in
England and Wales must seek approval from the government department con¬
cerned before raising loans. For other capital expenditure, each authority
receives an annual loan authorisation within which it determines what sums
to borrow and what projects to undertake. The GLC applies annually for
parliamentary sanction to raise the money it needs for capital expenditure. In
Scotland and Northern Ireland the government department responsible for
the service also issues the appropriate loan approvals.
Local authorities may raise long-term loans by means of private mortgages,
issuing stock upon the Stock Exchange and bonds which may or may not be
quoted on the Stock Exchange. Although these bonds may be for any period,
local authorities normally issue them for one year. Local authorities also
have right of access to the Public Works Loan Board, financed by the Ex¬
chequer, or, in Northern Ireland, to the Government Loans Fund, for long¬
term borrowing to finance a proportion of their reckonable capital payments,
and may borrow temporarily for a limited proportion of their current out¬
standing loan debt.
Internal control of finance is normally exercised on behalf of the council
concerned by a finance committee, whose function it is to keep the financial
policy of the council under constant review. (There is no statutory require¬
ment for local authorities in England and Wales to appoint a finance com¬
mittee, but they have to make proper arrangements for the administration of
their financial affairs.) For the auditing of their accounts, local authorities in
England and Wales can choose between the district auditor (appointed by the
Secretary of State for the Environment) and an approved private auditor for

the audit of some or all of their accounts. In Scotland the accounts of each
authority are audited by a professional auditor appointed by the Secretary of
State for Scotland and paid by the council concerned, and in Northern Ire¬
land by local government auditors appointed by the Department of Housing,
Local Government and Planning.
A complaints system for local government in Great Britain involves inde¬
pendent statutory Commissions for Local Administration (one each for Eng¬
land, Wales and Scotland), comprising a number of local commissioners,
each responsible in a particular area of the country for investigating citizens
complaints of maladministration by local authorities. The commissioners
help local authority councillors to protect the interests of constituents.
In Northern Ireland a Commissioner for Complaints deals with complaints
alleging injustices suffered as a result of maladministration by certain public
bodies, including all local authorities.
FIRE
AUTHORITIES
IN GREAT
BRITAIN
THE FIRE SERVICES
The fire services in Great Britain are organised on a local basis, subject to
a measure of central control. The cost is borne by local authorities, aided by
central Government through the rate support grant (see p. 72)- Every part of
the country is covered by a public fire brigade.
Estimated property losses from fire in Great Britain in 1974 amounted to
about £231 million. Each authority must by law make provision for fire¬
fighting purposes, and in particular maintain a brigade of sufficient strength
to meet efficiently all normal requirements. There are 55 fire authorities
in England and Wales: 53 county councils, the Greater London Council
and the Isles of Scilly authority. In Scotland there are nine ‘regional’ fire
authorities on the mainland and three ‘islands’ authorities. The
and Border regions in the south-east, and the Highland region and the
islands authorities in the north, are combined to provide fire cover. Other
fire-fighting organisations include, for instance, those maintained y t e
Army and Air Force Departments of the Ministry of Defence; by the Depart¬
ment of Industry at certain establishments; and by some large industrial and
commercial concerns.
Central Control
The Home Secretary and the Secretary of State for Scotland have central
responsibility for the fire service in England and Wales and in Scotian
respectively. Central control is directed mainly towards ensuring the opera¬
tional efficiency of brigades. Ministers have statutory powers to make regula¬
tions on such matters as appointments and promotions, standards of training
and equipment, pensions, and disciplinary matters. Their approval is also
required for reductions in the operational establishments of fire brigades.
In matters affecting the fire brigades as a whole (excluding discipline and
conditions of service), each minister is advised by the appropriate Centra
Fire Brigades Advisory Council, consisting of officers of the respective home
departments, representatives of the local authority associations, and of t e
associations representing members of fire brigades, and other persons wit
special qualifications, appointed by the minister concerned. The National
Joint Council for Local Authorities’ Fire Brigades and the National Joint
Council for Chief Officers of Local Authorities’ Fire Brigades are the negotiat¬
ing bodies on ranks, pay and conditions of service of firemen in Great Britain.
GOVERNMENT

Inspectorates of fire services advise the ministers on operational and
technical matters.
Most fire brigade establishments include part-time retained firemen to aug¬
ment and support the full-time strength in return for a retaining fee and call¬
out and attendance fee. Volunteer firemen (who receive no remuneration)
undertake to attend a fire if called upon. Many fire authorities employ women
for duties in controls communications and mobilising and staff duties. Some
brigades have schemes for the employment of junior firemen of 16-18 years,
prior to their enrolment as regular firemen at the age of 18.
Each fire authority must draw up a scheme showing the establishment of
officers and other ranks (both whole-time and part-time), the number and
location of fire stations and the number and type of appliances considered
necessary for the provision of fire cover for its area. Establishment schemes
vary according to the fire risks in the area concerned, the strength of individual
brigades ranging from 27 whole-time and 224 part-time men in Powys, Wales,
to 6,500 whole-time men in Greater London. In England and Wales as a
whole there are about 30,000 full-time and 13,500 part-time firemen; corre¬
sponding numbers in Scotland are 3,500 and 3,150.
Recruits and junior ranks in the fire service in England and Wales receive
practical training in basic firemanship at collective training schools run by the
larger fire authorities. In Scotland similar training is carried out at a central
training school which is the responsibility of the Scottish Home and Health
Department. Management and command training is provided for the higher
and middle ranks at the Fire Service Staff College, where high-level opera¬
tional studies are also conducted. Fire prevention, practical firemanship,
advancement and instructor training for junior and middle ranks is provided
at the Fire Service Technical College. Both colleges are maintained by the
Home Office and the Scottish Home and Health Department. Facilities for
officers from overseas fire services to study the organisation, current training
methods, appliances and equipment of British fire brigades are arranged by
the Home Office Fire Department.
Every fire authority must buy such appliances and equipment as may be
necessary to meet efficiently all normal fire-fighting requirements in its
area. Certain items of equipment are standardised so that there is complete
interchangeability when a fire is attended by men and appliances from more
than one area. The principal types of fire-fighting appliances are bought by
fire authorities to requirement specifications approved by the Home Office
and the Scottish Home and Health Department on the advice of the respec¬
tive Central Fire Brigades Advisory Councils. These specifications ensure that
minimum standards are maintained, and allow sufficient freedom of design to
meet special circumstances and encourage further developments.
In England and Wales more than 4,300 fire-fighting appliances are used
(including pumps, turntable ladders, water tenders, emergency tenders and
hose-laying lorries), and are housed in some 1,600 fire stations. Scotland
has over 500 fire-fighting appliances and 367 fire stations.
Each fire authority must appoint a chief fire officer (firemaster in Scotland)
for its fire brigade. The appointment must be approved by the Home Secre¬
tary or by the Secretary of State for Scotland.
Central control is exercised by the chief fire officer from brigade head¬
quarters. Divisional officers in charge of the geographical divisions into

which most areas are divided, are responsible for mobilising forces to deal
with outbreaks of fire in their divisions. Constant communication is maintained
between divisional and brigade headquarters and, if at any time an outbreak
of fire should grow beyond the capabilities of a division, help is sent from one
or more neighbouring divisions, or even from the area of another fire authority.
Under arrangements for mutual help made by all fire authorities, the nearest
available force is sent to a fire, regardless of area boundaries. The number of
fire calls in 1974 (including false alarms and special service calls) was about
502,300 in England and Wales and 59,200 in Scotland.
Fire authorities have discretion to employ their brigades and equipment for
purposes other than fire-fighting, and they are in fact used in a variety of
emergencies (such as rail, road and aircraft accidents, collapse of buildings,
flooding of premises, leakage of noxious gas or liquids and the rescue of people
or animals from dangerous situations) for which no charges are made. Brigades
are also used, by prior arrangement, for such purposes as emptying swim¬
ming pools and filling water tanks.
Fire authorities are concerned with fire prevention measures required
under a wide range of statutes relating to most buildings to which the public
have resort or in which they are employed. The authorities are also under a
statutory duty to give advice on fire prevention, restricting the spread of hres,
and means of escape in case of fire. Courses in fire prevention are held at the
Fire Service Technical College for fire brigade officers.
Fire precautions are not normally required by law in private dwellings, so
that, in addition to enforcement duties, brigades are also involved in educa¬
tional and publicity activities to promote fire safety in the home.
Central government is advised on all these fire prevention matters by the
Joint Fire Prevention Committee of the Central Fire Brigades Advisory
Councils, representing the service and central and local authorities.
Research into the different aspects of fire is undertaken by a number of
government departments and other organisations. A comprehensive pro¬
gramme of research into fire brigade operations, organisation, fire-fighting
appliances and equipment is conducted by the Home Office with the help
of the fire service under the auspices of the Joint Committee on Fire Research
of the Central Fire Brigades Advisory Councils. Individual research projects
are undertaken by the Home Office Scientific Advisory Branch or under
contract to the Home Office, by other government agencies, notably the hire
Research Station, which is part of the Building Research Establishment o t e
Department of the Environment, or by private consultants.
The Fire Research Station is the main organisation undertaking the study
and investigation of the technical aspects of fire. Its work is supervised by a
steering committee, the membership of which is drawn from the Department
of the Environment, the Home Office and independent sources.
The fire service in Northern Ireland is controlled by the Fire Authority for
Northern Ireland, which is responsible to the Northern Ireland Department
of the Environment. The authority, whose members include representatives
of the local government, maintains six whole-time and 49 part-time stations
throughout the area. Brigade establishment is about 1,200: 420 whole-time
officers and men and 800 part-time firemen, manning 120 appliances.
3 Membership of the
European
Community
Britain, together with the Irish Republic and Denmark, joined the original
six countries—Belgium, France, the Federal Republic of Germany, Italy,
Luxembourg and the Netherlands—in the European Community on ist
January 1973.
British membership of the Community was endorsed by a more than two-
to-one majority in the first national referendum to be held in Britain, on 5th
June 1975. Some 67-2 per cent of those voting wanted Britain to remain in the
Community, against 32-8 per cent who voted for withdrawal. Almost 65 per
cent of those eligible to vote did so.
The British Government recommended that the British people should
support continued Community membership in the referendum after the
objectives of its policy of renegotiating the terms of membership had been
largely achieved. The renegotiation, which was begun in April 1974, was
directed towards securing a fairer system of financing the Community budget
(see p. 81); improvements in the operation of the common agricultural
policy (CAP), better trade and aid arrangements for Commonwealth and
developing countries; and assurances that British regional, industrial and
fiscal policies would not be unacceptably circumscribed by Community
rules. J
Britain negotiated these changes within the terms of the Treaty of Accession
and the Treaties of Rome and Paris (see below), and largely in the course of
the Community’s normal programme of work. Details of British participation
m the work of the Community are provided in the relevant chapters.
The Treaty of The Treaty of Accession was signed by the applicant countries and the original
Accession member states in January 1972. It provided for tariffs on trade in industrial
products between Britain and the original six member countries to be progres¬
sively reduced over a transitional period ending in 1977, when they will be
abolished. The cumulative reduction in 1976 amounts to some 80 per cent. At
the end of the transitional period the phased introduction of the common
external tariff on British imports from countries neither members of, nor
having any special arrangements with, the Community will also be complete.
In addition, Britain is progressively adopting the Community system of
agricultural support (the CAP) during the transitional period. The Treaty
provided for a slightly longer period of adjustment with regard to payments to
the Community budget. Other provisions included those relating to participa¬
tion in the Community’s institutions and to its relations with Commonwealth
and other countries. Separate arrangements for the Channel Islands and the
Isle of Man take into account their special relationship with Britain.

BRITAIN 1976: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
The European Communities Act became law in October 1972 and made the
legislative changes necessary for Britain to comply with the obligations entailed
by membership of the Community, and to exercise the rights of membership
The Act gave the force of law in Britain to that part of Community law which
is directly applicable in member states. It also contained detailed legislation
(in part repealing or amending existing statutes) to implement Community
obligations. Other Community obligations are being met under existing
powers to make subordinate legislation, introduced as the measures become
applicable.
The European Community consists of three communities set up by separate
treaties—the European Coal and Steel Community, the European Economic
Community and the European Atomic Energy Community. These are
described briefly in the following pages.
The European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC) was established in 1952
by bringing together the coal and steel resources of the six member countries,
and formed the model for the ‘community’ approach to economic integration.
The Community is designed to ensure an orderly supply of coal and steel to
member countries, to promote the rational expansion and modernisation of
production and to provide better conditions of employment and living for the
employees in the industries. The Treaty of Paris which established the ECSC
and was signed in 1951 provided for the abolition of duties and quantitative
restrictions (or charges having the same effect) on trade in coal and steel
between member states; of discrimination by producers in prices, delivery
terms or transport rates; of any measures which hampered free choice o
supplier; and of restrictive practices resulting in the collusive sharing or
exploitation of markets. The treaty also provided for action by the Com¬
munity over a wide field of activity in the coal and steel industries, the work
of the Community being financed by a levy on production. The Community
provides funds for capital investment, research and other programmes, as
well as loans to help create new jobs in declining coal areas or where restruc¬
turing of the steel industry is taking place. Grants to assist redundant coa
and steel workers until they find new employment, or while undergoing
retraining, are also made.
The European Economic Community (EEC) was created by the Treaty o
Rome signed by the six countries in 1957, and aimed to promote the con¬
tinued and balanced expansion of the members’ economies by their progressive
harmonisation and integration. The preamble to the treaty included among
the basic objectives of the EEC the establishment of the foundations for a
growing unity among European peoples, the improvement of their working
and living conditions, the progressive abolition of restrictions on trade, and t e
development of the prosperity of overseas countries. The initial steps towards
the attainment of these objectives were the creation of a customs union, a o 1-
tion of internal tariffs and other barriers to trade and establishment of a
common external tariff, the development of a common policy for agriculture,
and the introduction of measures to establish the free movement of labour,
capital and services. At the same time, provision was made for the overseas
countries which had special links with the member countries to have preferen¬
tial treatment in aid and the development of trade.

Atomic Energy

MEMBERSHIPOFTHEEUROPEANCOMMUNITY 79
The European Atomic Energy Community (Euratom) was set up by a
second treaty signed in Rome in 1957 which provided for the co-ordinated
development of members’ atomic energy industries and of their other peaceful
nuclear activities. Euratom has worked to develop a co-ordinated research
programme (for power production, industrial and medical purposes) and to
ensure the dissemination of technical information, to facilitate the co¬
ordination of investment in the nuclear field, and to ensure a proper supply
of nuclear ores and fuels and wider commercial outlets. A common market for
all nuclear materials and equipment came into effect at the beginning of 1959,
with a common external tariff on imports of nuclear materials, while the
Community has established common nuclear legislation and a common control
system for nuclear materials to prevent their diversion to purposes other than
those declared. Following the enlargement of the Community, agreement was
reached in February 1973 on a further four-year research programme.
The separate institutions established by the treaties for each of the three
Communities were merged in 1967. The Community institutions, comprising
the Council of Ministers, the Commission, the Court of Justice, the Assembly
or European Parliament and others including a number dealing with specific
subjects, provide a framework (see diagram below) within which the interests
of the member states are represented and reconciled and common policies
formulated and administered. In each of the institutions Britain has a position
equal to that of France, the Federal Republic of Germany or Italy. English is
one of the official languages of the Community.

foreign minister or other ministers appropriate to the subject of discussion,
directly represent each member country. Most Council decisions are taken on
the basis of a proposal by the Commission. Although provision is made in the
Treaty of Rome for certain matters to be decided by a qualified majority,
using a system of weighted voting, in practice decisions are taken on the basis
of consensus. On all matters of major importance, affecting vital national
interests, decisions are taken on the basis of unanimity.
The Commission is responsible for formulating detailed policy proposals for
submission to the Council of Ministers, for promoting the Community interest
and attempting to reconcile national viewpoints and for implementing the pro¬
visions of the treaties and Community measures. It is composed of 13 com¬
missioners nominated by the member governments; two are from Britain.
Each commissioner is responsible for one or more of the main Community
activities. The Commission is pledged to act in complete independence of
national or sectional interests and to formulate its proposals and administer
policy in the interests of the Community as a whole. Its proposals are made
only after extensive consultation with officials of the national governments
and with such organisations as producers, trade unions, employers’ associa¬
tions and many others.
The Court of Justice interprets and adjudicates on the meaning of the
treaties and of any measures taken by the Council and Commission under
them, hears complaints and appeals brought by or against Community institu¬
tions, member states or individuals and gives preliminary rulings on questions
referred to it by courts in the member states. As a court of final appeal its pro¬
cedure in such cases is broadly similar to that of the highest courts in member
states; its rulings are binding on member countries, Community institutions
and individuals. The Court of Justice consists of nine judges, assisted by four
advocates-general.
The Assembly or European Parliament is composed of nominated members
of the parliaments of member states, sitting according to party affiliation and
not nationality. Britain is entitled to nominate 36 members out of a total of 198.
The parliament is consulted on and debates all the major policy issues of the
Community. Its powers regarding the Community’s budget have been
expanded and a new Court of Auditors is to be established. Members of the
parliament may question the Council and Commission and have the power to
dismiss the Commission by a two-thirds majority.
The Committee of Permanent Representatives consists of representatives of
the member states, of ambassadorial rank, whose task is to prepare for the
meetings of the Council and perform whatever additional functions it might
delegate.
The Economic and Social Committee is a consultative body representing a
cross-section of economic interests. Its members representing employers
organisations, trade unions and other interests are consulted by the Council
and Commission during the formulation of policy. Britain is entitled to send
24 members out of a total of 144.
Other Community institutions include the European Investment Bank, and
the European Monetary Co-operation Fund.
In addition to, and separate from, these Community institutions, the mem¬
ber states have set up the European political co-operation machinery for the
consideration of important problems of foreign policy. The Community
foreign ministers meet in this framework four times annually. Under the
foreign ministers there is a structure of official committees. The country
having the Presidency of the Council of Ministers provides the Secretariat.
The Community
Budget
MEMBERSHIP OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITY 8l
Close contact is maintained with Community institutions when this is
appropriate, and decisions are made on the basis of consensus.
The Community’s heads of Government meet at least three times annually
as the European Council in order to ensure progress and consistency in the
activities of the Community. The European Council combines the functions
of a meeting of the Council of Ministers with those of a meeting held within
the context of political co-operation.
All member countries contribute to a common budget for certain specific
purposes, such as agricultural support (administered by the European Agri¬
cultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund, often known by its French initials,
FEOGA), the European Social Fund (used for occupational re-training and
re-adaptation programmes and programmes designed to further manpower
mobility), the Regional Development Fund, and administrative costs. Under
the direct income system, which came into effect for the original members in
January 1971, the Community has progressively drawn a greater proportion of
the finance for this budget directly from the revenue of customs duties and of
levies on agricultural imports. Except for a 1 o per cent rebate to cover collection
costs all levies on agricultural imports and all customs revenues are handed over
to the Community budget by the original six member states. The remaining
proportion of the necessary income (taking into account the new members’
contributions, which in Britain’s case are described below) is made up by
contributions from the (six original) member states according to their shares
of the Community’s gross national product (GNP); eventually this will be re¬
placed by a proportion (equivalent to up to a 1 per cent rate) of the proceeds
of the value added tax (see p. 368).
The Treaty of Accession gave Britain a transitional period up to 1980 in
which to adopt this system. The Treaty set a percentage (or key) based on
Britain’s share of the total GNP of the nine countries in the enlarged Com¬
munity. This represented the proportion of the budget which Britain would
nominally have been expected to pay in the first year of membership. During
the transitional period, Britain is paying a proportion of its nominal contribu¬
tion, increasing in annual steps, from some 875 per cent of the budget in
1973 to about 19 per cent in 1977. For the two-year period after 1977, the
British contribution is not to increase by more than a limited amount.
As a result of Britain’s renegotiation, a ‘correcting mechanism’ has been
established providing for repayments to a member state whose contribution
to the Community budget is seriously out of line with its share of total
Community GNP and its economic situation.
4 Justice and the Law
THE LAW
Although the United Kingdom is a unitary State, it does not have a single body
of law applicable universally within its limits. England and Wales on the
one hand and Scotland on the other have their own distinctive legal systems
and law courts. Common opinions on broader issues, and a common final
court of appeal in civil matters have resulted in substantial identity on many
points, but considerable differences in substantive law, as well as in legal
procedure and practice, remain. In Northern Ireland legal procedure and
practice have closely resembled those of England and Wales for centuries
but its enacted law derives in certain spheres from a different source and may
differ in substance from that which operates in England and Wales. However,
a large volume of modern legislation, particularly in the social field, applies
throughout the United Kingdom.
Sources of Law The main sources of law in the United Kingdom are legislation, common
law and, since Britain’s accession to the European Community, Community
law the impact of which is mainly confined to economic matters. Legisla¬
tion consists of laws made by or under the authority of Parliament and may be
Acts of Parliament, or Orders in Council, orders, rules and regulations made
by ministers under the authority of an Act of Parliament, or by-laws made by
local government or other authorities exercising powers conferred upon them
by Parliament. Common law is, broadly speaking, the ancient law of the land,
as deduced from custom and interpreted by the judges. It has never been
precisely defined or codified1 but forms the basis of the law other than where
it has been superseded by legislation.
Community law is mainly the directly applicable law of the treaties estab¬
lishing the European Community treaties and the instruments made under
them by the Community institutions. It has not been incorporated or made
identical with domestic law but operates as a separate system side by side
with that law. The English and Scottish legal systems remain intact and their
courts continue to operate as before. In the event of conflict, however,
Community law prevails over domestic law. Community judgments and
orders, the formal authenticity of which has been verified by the designated
national authority (the Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary or one of his
officials), may be registered and enforced in the United Kingdom courts.
(See also European Court of Justice, pp. 80 and 94.)
Branches of the A feature common to the domestic legal systems of the United Kingdom is the
Law distinction made between the criminal law and the civil law. Broadly speaking,
criminal law is concerned with wrongs against the community as a whole
while civil law is concerned with the rights, duties and obligations of individual
members of society between themselves.
1 The Law Commissions (see p. 99) are working on the codification of certain branches
of law.
JUSTICE AND THE LAW
CRIMINAL LAW There are two levels of criminal courts in England and Wales: magistrates’
Criminal Courts courts, which try and dispose of the great majority of criminal cases and con-
in England duct preliminary investigations into the more serious offences; and the Crown
and Wales Court which takes all criminal work above the level of magistrates’ courts.
Magistrates Courts Magistrates’ courts are for the most part presided over by lay magistrates
(justices of the peace ), of whom there are some 19,500 who sit regularly but
are part time and unpaid. The jurisdiction of the courts is local, their areas
being mainly the counties which are divided into petty sessional divisions so
that the courts are held in different places. The function of the courts, which
consist of between two and seven magistrates, is to hear and determine charges
against people accused of summary offences—minor offences that may legally
be disposed of by the magistrates sitting together without a jury. In addition,
magistrates may also try certain offences which would normally be tried on
indictment the more serious offences—if the accused consents to forgo his
right to trial by jury. In fact, about 98 per cent of all criminal cases are dis¬
posed of in magistrates courts. Magistrates also sit as ‘examining justices’
to conduct preliminary inquiries to determine whether there is sufficient
evidence to justify the committal of the accused for trial in the Crown Court
for a serious offence.
In inner London and a few large provincial cities there are, in addition to
lay magistrates, some 49 stipendiary magistrates, who are full-time salaried
lawyers, and usually sit alone. In the City of London, the courts consist of
the aldermen of the City, who are magistrates ex officio by virtue of charters,
as well as magistrates appointed individually. Benches of lay magistrates
work with the help and advice of a justices’ clerk (a barrister or solicitor or
other person with court experience).
To hear cases involving people under the age of 17 brought before the court
in care or criminal proceedings, and to deal with applications for the adoption
of children, magistrates courts sit as juvenile courts. Juvenile courts sit either
in a different room or building from other courts, or at a different time, and
only limited publicity is allowed. If a young person under the age of 17 is
charged jointly with someone who has attained the age of 17, the case is heard
in the ordinary magistrates court. If the young person is found guilty, that
court remits the case to a juvenile court, unless it wishes to dispose of the case
by discharge or fine.
The Crown Court The Crown Court is served by High Court judges and circuit judges and,
in addition, by recorders who sit on a part-time basis. It sits regularly at
nearly 90 centres.
There are three kinds of centre: first tier centres where the Crown Court
is served by both High Court and circuit judges and where the High Court
also takes civil business; second tier centres where, again, High Court and
circuit judges sit in the Crown Court; and third tier centres, where the Crown
Court is served only by circuit judges and recorders.
The jurisdiction of the Crown Court comprises trials on indictment
(broadly, for the more serious offences), the sentencing of those committed
for sentence from magistrates’ courts, and appeals from magistrates’ courts.
This appellate jurisdiction includes certain civil as well as criminal appeals.
In addition the court has a minor original civil jurisdiction.
A High Court judge, circuit judge or recorder presides at all trials of the
Crown Court with a jury. A circuit judge or recorder sits with between two
and four magistrates for appeals and committals for sentence from magistrates’
84

courts, and may sit with magistrates for the less important trials on indictment.
For the more important criminal trials, a High Court judge sits without any
magistrates. In the City of London, where the Crown Court is known as
the Central Criminal Court, the Lord Mayor and aldermen are entitled to
sit with any High Court judge, circuit judge or recorder in any class of work.
The distribution of Crown Court business is determined by directions given
by, or on behalf of, the Lord Chief Justice of England, with the concurrence
of the Lord Chancellor; such directions allocate the various classes of offences
to High Court judges, circuit judges and recorders.
A person convicted by a magistrates’ court may appeal against the conviction
or against the sentence to the Crown Court. Where the appeal is on a point
of law either the prosecutor or the defendant may appeal from the magistrates
court to the High Court by way of case stated—that is, by requesting the
magistrate to ‘state a case for the opinion of the High Court’. In certain cases,
an appeal by case stated may lie to the High Court from the Crown Court,
but normally appeals from the Crown Court, either against conviction or
against sentence, are made to the Court of Appeal (Criminal Division). Appeals
against conviction may be brought to the court by right on any point of
law, and with leave of the trial judge or the court on any question of fact or
mixed fact and law. Appeals against sentence come with the leave of the court,
provided that the sentence was in the discretion of the trial judge and not
fixed by law. The Court of Appeal (Criminal Division) normally consists of
three judges, who may be Lords Justices of Appeal or judges of the High
Court, although the Lord Chief Justice or a Lord Justice of Appeal usually
presides. A further appeal from the Court of Appeal (Criminal Division) to
the House of Lords can be brought if the court certifies that a point of law of
general public importance is involved and it appears to the court or the
House of Lords that the point is one that ought to be considered by the House.
In addition, a prosecutor or defendant may appeal to the House of Lords
from a decision of the High Court in a criminal case.
The Attorney General may seek the opinion of the Court of Appeal on a
point of law which has arisen in a case where a person tried on indictment is
acquitted; the court has power to refer the point to the House of Lords if
necessary. The acquittal in the original case is not affected, nor is the identity
of the acquitted person revealed without his consent.
Criminal cases in Scotland are heard either under solemn procedure, when
proceedings are taken on indictment and the judge sits with a jury, or under
summary procedure, when the judge sits without a jury. All cases in the High
Court of Justiciary and the more serious ones in the sheriff court are tried
under solemn procedure. Proceedings are taken under summary procedure
in the less serious cases in the sheriff court, and in the district courts.
The system of lay summary courts is based on the district and islands areas
of local government. Judges in the district courts are justices of the peace,
including up to one-quarter of the membership of district and islands authori¬
ties who may be nominated as ex officio justices. In Glasgow there are three
stipendiary magistrates who are full-time salaried lawyers.
For purposes of sheriff court jurisdiction, Scotland is divided into six sheriff¬
doms, and these sheriffdoms are further divided into sheriff court districts.
A sheriffdom has a sheriff-principal and a number of sheriffs who act as the

judges of the court. The sheriff courts exercise an extensive civil as well as a
criminal jurisdiction.
The High Court of Justiciary is Scotland’s supreme criminal court. It is both
a trial court and an appeal court. Any one of the following judges is entitled
to try cases in the High Court: the Lord Justice General (who is also the
Lord President of the Court of Session), the Lord Justice Clerk, or any one
of the 18 Lords Commissioner of Justiciary who are also judges of the Court
of Session. The seat of the court is in Edinburgh, but the judges go on circuit
to preside at trials in other towns.
A person convicted in the High Court or in a sheriff court on indictment may
appeal to the High Court of Justiciary (a) against his conviction on any ground
which involves a question of law alone, or, with leave of the High Court or
upon the certificate of the judge who presided at the trial that it is a fit case
for appeal, on any ground, and (b) against his sentence, with the leave of the
High Court, unless the sentence is one fixed by law. Appeals are heard by
three or more judges, and there is no further appeal to the House of Lords.
A person convicted summarily may appeal to the High Court, but only on
questions of law and procedure, and not on issues of fact.
Children under 16 years (and in some cases people between 16 and 18) who
are considered to need compulsory care are normally brought before an
informal children’s hearing comprising three members of the local community.
(Prosecution in the criminal courts is rare, and may take place only on the
instructions of the Lord Advocate.) An official ‘reporter’ decides whether
a child should come before a hearing. The hearing’s main task is to decide,
after the grounds for referral have been accepted by the child and his parents,
what measures of compulsory care (if any) are most appropriate. If the
grounds for referral are not accepted, the case must first go to the sheriff
court for proof. An appeal lies from the decision of a hearing.
The decision to prosecute normally rests, in England, Wales and Northern
Ireland, with the police and in Scotland with public prosecutors. Police
outside Scotland have powers to issue cautions instead of prosecuting,
especially in the case of young people; in Scotland police can issue warnings.
All criminal trials in the United Kingdom take the form of a ‘contest’
between the Crown and the accused person. In England and Wales (and
very exceptionally in Scotland) a private person may institute criminal
proceedings, but they are usually initiated and conducted by the police.
Some offences in England and Wales can be prosecuted only by or with the
consent of the Attorney General or the Director of Public Prosecutions.
Where the consent of the Attorney General is required (for example, under
the official secrets legislation), such prosecutions are invariably in the hands
of the director (a senior civil servant and prominent lawyer appointed by the
Home Secretary) who is responsible to the Attorney General. His other
duties include: prosecuting all serious offences, which must be reported to
him by the police; advising the police and others concerned with the adminis¬
tration of the criminal law; and taking over, where necessary, criminal pro¬
ceedings instituted by another prosecutor. He is also concerned, for instance,
with complaints of criminal offences by the police, extradition and offences
committed by foreign servicemen stationed in England and Wales.
Professional officers of the director’s department are either barristers or
86
Arrest
BRITAIN 1976: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
solicitors, and, although the former have a right of audience in the higher
courts, they appear in practice only in magistrates courts where they and
their solicitor colleagues conduct summary and committal proceedings.
When cases go for trial, barristers in private practice are instructed to appear
on the director’s behalf; at the Central Criminal Court in London, these
are drawn from a panel of ‘Treasury Counsel’ appointed by the Attorney
General.
Each year the director’s department conducts between five and ten per
cent of the prosecutions brought on indictment in England and Wales; it also
conducts some summary prosecutions.
In Scotland the Lord Advocate, acting through the Crown Office and
subordinate prosecutors, is responsible for the prosecution of practically all
crimes before Scottish courts (except the district courts which have their
own prosecutors). The Crown Office is concerned with the preparation of
prosecutions in the High Court; the public prosecutors in the sheriff courts
known as ‘procurators fiscal’, are lawyers who are usually full-time civi
servants. The police make preliminary investigation of all offences known to
them, and report the details to the procurator fiscal, who can decide whether
to prosecute, subject to the discretion and control of the Crown Office.
Private prosecutions, though permitted in some circumstances, are very rare.
The Director of Public Prosecutions in Northern Ireland, who is responsible
to the Attorney General, has functions which include the initiation of criminal
proceedings in certain circumstances, representing the Crown in criminal
actions, and prosecuting offences against statutory provisions on behalf of
government departments. The director also has functions in relation to the
granting of bail.
In criminal cases in England and Wales arrest may be effected either on a
warrant issued by a judicial authority on sworn information laid before it or, in
certain cases, without warrant. In the latter circumstances, a police officer may
release the defendant on bail, that is, he may discharge him temporarily,
subject to his entering into a recognisance, with or without sureties, for a
reasonable sum of money, to appear in court or at a police station at an
appointed time. If the defendant cannot be brought before the magistrates
court within a day, and his alleged offence is not serious, the police must
release him on bail. Magistrates also have discretion to grant bail, which they
exercise according to well-defined principles. If bail is refused by the magis¬
trates, the defendant is entitled to apply to the Crown Court or the High
Court, and he must be informed of this right.
Once anyone has been charged with an offence, the police may not put any
further questions to him, save, in exceptional circumstances, to prevent or
minimise harm or loss to any person or to the public, or to clear up an ambi¬
guity in a previous answer or statement. This is laid down by the Judges
Rules which, although they do not have the force of law, nevertheless carry
very great weight.
A person detained in custody who thinks that the grounds for his detention
are not lawful,1 may apply for a writ of habeas corpus against the person who
detained him, this person then being required to appear before the court on the
day named to justify the detention. An application for such a writ is normally
1 Lawful grounds are: in pursuance of criminal justice; for contempt of court or of
either HoSse of Parliament; detention of persons found to be mentally dis°rdered.
detention of children by their parents or guardians; and detention expressly autho
by Act of Parliament. The writ of habeas corpus applies in both criminal and civil cas .

made to a divisional court of the High Court either by the person detained or
by someone acting on his behalf. If no court is sitting the application may be
made to a single judge who may, and in some cases must, direct that it should
come before a divisional court. An application on behalf of anyone under 18 is
always first made to a judge sitting in chambers or in private. A writ may be
refused only by a divisional court.
In Scotland the police have very broadly the same powers of arrest as have
the police in England and Wales. The Judges’ Rules do not apply, but when
anyone is arrested he must be cautioned and have the charge read over
to him. Thereafter, only his voluntary statements are used in evidence
at his trial, and the court will reject any statements made by him unless it is
satisfied that they have been fairly obtained. As in England and Wales, when
anyone is apprehended in Scotland he must be brought before the court
competent to deal with his case with the least possible delay. Where a prosecu¬
tion on indictment is contemplated, the accused is brought before a judge for
judicial examination and the judge may then commit him for trial or for
further examination. Eight days may elapse between commitment for further
examination and commitment for trial.
People in custody in Scotland, other than those charged with murder or
treason, may be liberated on bail by the sheriff or, if the offence is within the
jurisdiction of a summary court other than the sheriff court, by that court or
by the police. Even in the case of murder or treason, bail may be granted at the
discretion of the Lord Advocate or the High Court of Justiciary. There is a
right of appeal to the High Court by the accused person against the refusal of
bail, by the prosecutor against the granting of bail, or by either party against
the amount fixed. The writ of habeas corpus does not apply in Scotland, but the
High Court of Justiciary has power to release anyone unlawfully detained and
trials must, in any event, be brought to a conclusion within no days of
committal to custody.
Since criminal law in Britain presumes the innocence of the accused until
his guilt has been proved, the prosecution is not granted any advantage,
apparent or real, over the defence. A defendant has the right to employ a legal
adviser for his defence and if he cannot afford to pay he may be granted legal
aid wholly or partly at the public expense. If remanded in custody he may be
visited in prison by his legal adviser to ensure that his defence is properly
prepared. During the preparation of the case, it is customary for the prosecu¬
tion to inform the defence of any relevant documents which it is not proposed
to put in evidence and to disclose them if asked to do so. The prosecution
should also inform the defence of any witnesses whose evidence may assist
the accused and whom the prosecution does not propose to call.
Criminal trials in England and Wales are (with rare exceptions) held in open
court and the rules of evidence (which are concerned with the proof of facts)
are rigorously applied. For instance, although generally the evidence of one
uncorroborated witness is, as a matter of English law, sufficient, where the
evidence is that of an accomplice (or accomplices), the judge will warn the
jury of the danger of convicting on such uncorroborated evidence and a
conviction made without any such warning would not be upheld on appeal.
During the trial the defendant has the right to hear and subsequently to
cross-examine (normally through his lawyer) all the witnesses for the prosecu¬
tion; to call his own witnesses who, if they will not attend the trial of their own
free will, may be legally compelled to attend; and to address the court either
in person or through his lawyer—the defence having the right to the last

speech at the trial. Moreover, the defendant cannot himself be questioned
unless he consents to be sworn as a witness in his own defence. The right
to cross-examine him, even when he is so sworn, is limited by law, with the
object of excluding inquiry into his character or into past offences not relevant
to the particular charge on which he is being tried. Although confessions made
in the course of previous judicial proceedings are admissible as evidence if they
have been made upon oath, no confessions made in any other circumstances
are admitted unless it can be proved that they were made voluntarily.
In criminal trials by jury the judge determines questions of law, sums up
the evidence for the benefit of the jury, and acquits the accused or passes
sentence according to the verdict of the jury; but the jury alone decides the
issue of guilt or innocence. Verdicts need not necessarily be unanimous, in
certain circumstances the jury may bring in a majority verdict provided that,
in the normal jury of 12 people, there are not more than two dissentients.
If the jury returns a verdict of ‘not guilty’, the prosecution has no right of
appeal and the defendant cannot be tried again for the same offence. From a
verdict of ‘guilty’ there is a right of appeal on the part of the defendant to the
appropriate court. The defence or prosecution may suggest that the mental
state of the defendant is such that he is unfit to be tried. A jury must decide
whether or not this is so. If they find that it is, the defendant will be admitted
to a hospital specified by the Home Secretary.
In Scottish trials on indictment, the first ‘pleading’ proceedings take place
in the sheriff court, when the accused person is called upon to plead guilty or
not guilty. If he pleads not guilty, the case is continued to the second ‘trial’
proceedings in the appropriate court. If he pleads guilty, and it is a case which
is to be dealt with in the sheriff court, the sheriff may dispose of it at once. If it
is a High Court case, it is continued to the second proceedings in the High
Court for disposal.
The trial proceedings are held at least nine days after the pleading pro¬
ceedings, either before the sheriff or the High Court, with a jury of 15.
Evidence is led (without opening speeches) and there are closing speeches for
the prosecution and for the defence, followed by the judge’s charge to the
jury. The jury may return a verdict of ‘not guilty’ or not proven , both o
which result in acquittal, or they may find the accused ‘guilty’, in which case
the court proceeds to deliver sentence. The verdict may be by a simple
majority. Fairness to the accused is ensured by the fact that, with a few minor
exceptions, no person may be convicted without the evidence of at least two
witnesses, or corroboration of one witness by facts and circumstances whic
clearly implicate the accused in the crime.
At summary trials in Scotland the accused is asked to plead to the charge at
the first calling of the case and, if he pleads guilty, the court may dispose of the
case. Where the plea is ‘not guilty’, the court may proceed to trial at once or it
may appoint a later date.
The Criminal Injuries Compensation Scheme was established in 1964 to
provide ex gratia compensation to victims of crimes of violence and people
hurt as a result of attempts to arrest offenders and prevent offences. It is
administered by a board which consists of legally qualified members appointed
by the Home Secretary and the Secretary of State for Scotland after consul¬
tation with the Lord Chancellor. Compensation, which is assessed on the
basis of common law damages and usually takes the form of a lump sum pay¬
ment, has totalled over £24 million since the scheme began. A review of the
scheme is in progress with a view to putting it on a statutory basis.

The scheme does not apply in Northern Ireland where there is statutory
provision in certain circumstances for compensation from public funds for
criminal injuries and also for malicious damage to property.
The main civil courts in England and Wales are the county courts, which
deal with a wide variety of civil cases, and the High Court, where those that
cannot be decided in the county courts are heard. Magistrates’ courts have
limited civil jurisdiction, as does the Crown Court—mainly in connection with
appeals from magistrates’ courts. Most appeals in civil cases go to the Court of
Appeal (Civil Division) and from there may go to the House of Lords.
The civil jurisdiction of magistrates’ courts extends to matrimonial proceed¬
ings for separation and maintenance orders, adoption and affiliation and
guardianship orders. The courts also have jurisdiction in respect of such
matters as nuisances under the Public Health Acts and the recovery of rates.
Committees of magistrates exercise quasi-administrative functions in relation
to the licensing of public houses and of betting shops and clubs.
County courts (of which there are 337) are so located that no part of the
country is more than a reasonable distance from one of them. In the busier
centres, the courts may sit every day; in others they may sit weekly, monthly,
or at longer intervals.
All judges of the Supreme Court (comprising the Court of Appeal, the
Crown Court and the High Court) and all circuit judges and recorders have
power to sit in the county courts, but each court has one or more circuit judges
assigned to it by the Lord Chancellor, and the regular sittings of the court are
mostly taken by them. The judge normally sits alone, although on the request
of a party the court may, in exceptional cases, order a trial with a jury.
The jurisdiction of the county courts covers, for instance, actions founded
upon contract and tort (with minor exceptions) where the amount claimed is
not more than £1,000; trust and mortgage cases, where the amount does not
exceed £5,000; and actions for the recovery of land where the net annual
value for rating does not exceed £1,000. Cases outside these limits may be
tried in the county court by consent of the parties, or may in certain circum¬
stances be transferred from the High Court.
Other matters dealt with by the county courts include hire purchase, the
Rent Act, landlord and tenant, and adoption. In addition undefended divorce
cases are heard and determined in county courts designated as divorce
county courts (defended cases are transferred to the High Court); outside
London bankruptcies are dealt with in certain county courts; and complaints
of racial discrimination brought by the Race Relations Board are heard in
selected courts where the judge sits with assessors. Where small claims are
concerned (especially those for less than £100 involving consumers), there are
special facilities for arbitration and simplified procedures.
The High Court of Justice is divided into the Chancery Division, the Queen’s
Bench Division and the Family Division. Its jurisdiction, which is both original
and appellate and covers all civil and some criminal cases, is vested in all its
divisions. In general, however, particular types of work are assigned to a
particular division—distribution of work being governed by statute, the rules
of court and the practice of the court. For instance, the Family Division deals
with all jurisdiction of a family kind, including matrimonial cases, and cases
relating to wardship, adoption, and guardianship; while Admiralty and prize

Session
BRITAIN 1976: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
jurisdiction rests with a specially constituted Admiralty Court of the Queen s
Bench Division.
There are 70 High Court judges each of whom is attached to one division
on appointment but may be transferred to any other division during his
term of office. The Lord Chancellor is president of the Court of Appeal and
of the Chancery Division—the administration of the Chancery Division being
the responsibility of the senior judge known as the Vice-Chancellor. The
Queen’s Bench Division is presided over by the Lord Chief Justice of England,
who ranks next to the Lord Chancellor in the legal hierarchy, and the Family
Division is headed by the President. Outside London (where the High Court
sits at the Royal Courts of Justice) sittings of the court are held at 23 Crown
Court centres which are known as first tier centres.
For the hearing of cases at first instance, High Court judges sit singly.
Appellate jurisdiction in civil matters from inferior courts is exercised by
divisional courts of two (or sometimes three) judges, or by single judges of
the appropriate division, nominated by the Lord Chancellor.
Appeals in matrimonial proceedings heard by magistrates courts lie to a
divisional court of the Family Division of the High Court. Affiliation appeals
are heard by the Crown Court, as are appeals from decisions of the licensing
committees of magistrates. Appeals from the High Court and the county
courts are heard in the Court of Appeal (Civil Division) and may (with leave
of the court or of the House of Lords) go on to the House of Lords, which is
the ultimate court of appeal in civil cases.
The ex officio members of the Court of Appeal (Civil Division) are the Lord
Chancellor, the Lord Chief Justice, the President of the Family Division and
the Master of the Rolls; the ordinary members are 14 Lords Justices of
Appeal.
The judges in the House of Lords are the ten Lords of Appeal in Ordinary,
who must have a quorum of three, but usually sit as a group of five, and |
sometimes even of seven. Lay peers do not attend the hearing of appeals
(which normally takes place in a committee room and not in the legislative
chamber), but peers who hold or have held high judicial office may also sit.
The president of the House in its judicial capacity is the Lord Chancellor,
and proceedings take the form of the normal proceedings of the House of j
Lords: judgments are given in the form of speeches to a motion, and the
decision of the House is taken by a vote.
The main courts of civil jurisdiction in Scotland are the sheriff courts which,
in their civil capacity, correspond roughly to English county courts, and the
Court of Session.
The civil jurisdiction of the sheriff court extends to most kinds of action and
is normally unlimited by the value of the case. Much of the work is done by
the sheriff, against whose decisions an appeal may be made to the sheriff-
principal or directly to the Court of Session.
The Court of Session sits only in Edinburgh, and has jurisdiction to deal with
all kinds of action, subject to a few exceptions. The main exception is an action
where the value claimed is less than £250—a matter for the sheriff court. The 1
Court of Session has sole jurisdiction in divorce and certain other actions. The
court is divided into two parts: the Outer House, a court of first instance, and
the Inner House, which is mainly an appeal court. The Inner House is divided
JUSTICE AND THE LAW
The Scottish Land
Court
Civil
Proceedings
91
into two divisions of equal status, each consisting of four judges—the first
division being presided over by the Lord President and the second division
by the Lord Justice Clerk. Appeals to the Inner House may be made from the
Outer House and from the sheriff court. From the Inner House an appeal may
lie to the House of Lords.
The Scottish Land Court is a special court that deals with certain agricultural
matters. The court is presided over by a legal chairman, who has the rank
and dignity of a judge of the Court of Session.
In England and Wales civil proceedings are instituted by the aggrieved person;
no preliminary inquiry as to the authenticity of the grievance is required.
Actions are usually begun in the High Court by a writ of summons served on
the defendant by the plaintiff, which notifies the defendant that the plaintiff
has a claim against him and states the nature of the claim. If the defendant
intends to contest the claim, he ‘enters an appearance’ by informing the court
to this effect and documents setting out the precise question in dispute (the
pleadings) are then delivered to the court. County court proceedings are
initiated by a ‘plaint’ served on the defendant by the court; subsequent
procedure is simpler than in the High Court.
A decree for divorce can be obtained only after a hearing in court, whether
or not the case is defended. Civil proceedings, because they are a private
matter, can usually be abandoned or compromised at any time without leave
of the court the parties to a dispute being able to settle their differences
through their solicitors before the stage of actual trial is reached. Actions that
are brought to court are usually tried by a judge without a jury, except in cases
involving claims for defamation, false imprisonment, or malicious prosecution,
when either party may insist on trial by jury, or in a case of fraud, when the
defendant may claim this right. In trials where a jury is present, the jury is
responsible for deciding questions of fact (as in criminal trials) and also the
amount of damages to be awarded to the injured party; majority verdicts may
be accepted.
Judgments in civil cases are enforceable through the authority of the court.
Most are for sums of money and may be enforced, in cases of default, by
seizure of the debtor s goods or by attachment of earnings (a court order
requiring an employer to make periodic payments to the court by deduction
from the debtor’s wages). Refusal to obey a judgment directing the defendant
to do something or to refrain from doing something may result in imprison¬
ment for contempt of court. Arrest under an order of committal may be
effected only on a warrant of the court.
The general rule is that the costs of the action (the barrister’s fees, solicitor’s
charge, court fees and other payments) are in the discretion of the court.
Normally, the court orders the costs to be paid by the party losing the
action.
In Scotland proceedings in the Court of Session or ordinary actions (of a
value exceeding £250) in the sheriff court are initiated by the service on the
defender of a summons or initial writ. In Court of Session actions the next
step is the calling of the summons, which is the publication of the action in
the court lists. If the defender intends to contest the action, he must ‘enter
appearance’ within two days of calling and thereafter lodge defences, other¬
wise decree in absence can be obtained against him. In sheriff court ordinary
actions there is no calling of the summons; the defender is simply required to
enter appearance within a certain number of days after service of the initial
92
BRITAIN 1976: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
writ, and if he does so this is followed by the ‘tabling of the cause which in¬
volves a formal appearance in court by solicitors or, in some cases, the parties
to the dispute. .»
In summary causes (actions normally of a value less than £250) in the shentl
court the usual procedure is slightly different. The statement of claim in the
summons can be less formally drafted, and the summons specifies a date when
the action will first be heard in court. If on that date the defender does not
appear, decree can be given against him; if the pursuer does not appear, the
action can be dismissed. If both appear and the defender wants to defend
the action, the court will usually fix a date for proof. No legal argument on the
relevancy of the action is allowed until after proof. A pursuer can abandon his
case, including any matrimonial case, at any time, but, where abandonment is
sought after the commencement of the proof or trial, only with leave of the
court. Trial by jury in civil actions in Scotland is more common than in
England and Wales, being the usual form of procedure in actions for damages
for personal injuries in the Court of Session. In the sheriff court it is relatively
rare, being confined to actions between employer and employee.
iNUKinr.™ The higher courts in Northern Ireland comprise the Supreme Court of
IRELAND Justice (consisting of the High Court of Justice and the Court of Appeal) and
the Court of Criminal Appeal. The High Court, the superior court of first
instance, is constituted of the Lord Chief Justice, and five judges. The Court
of Appeal, which is the appellate tribunal, comprises the Lord Chief Justice
and two Lords Justices of Appeal.
The lower courts are the county courts and courts of summary jurisdiction
(petty sessions). The county courts exercise both civil and criminal jurisdiction
and are presided over by county court judges, of whom there are ten. The es¬
tablishment has been proposed of a central criminal court for the Belfast region,
to which the original criminal jurisdiction of county courts lying within the region
should be transferred. Petty session courts are composed of one resident magis¬
trate (who corresponds to a stipendiary magistrate in England and Wales) who |
normally sits alone. Juvenile courts are similar to those in England and Wales.
Coroners’ courts are common law courts convened when a person appears to >
have died a violent or unnatural death or a sudden death of which the cause
is unknown, and in certain other circumstances, for example, in deciding what
is ‘treasure trove’. Cases may be brought to the notice of the local coroner (a
senior lawyer or doctor appointed by local government) by medical practi¬
tioners, by the police, by various public authorities or by members of the I
public,' and it is his duty to hold an inquiry into how, when and where the
deceased died. He may hold an inquest in court for this purpose, and he must
do so if he has reason to believe that the deceased has died a violent or un¬
natural death or has died in prison or in circumstances for which an Act of
Parliament provides that an inquest must be held. If the coroner has reason to
suspect that the death was due to murder, suicide, manslaughter, or infanti¬
cide, or was caused in a road accident, he must summon a jury.
In Scotland the office of coroner does not exist. The Procurator Fiscal
inquires privately into all sudden and suspicious deaths in his district and may
report the result of his inquiries to the Crown Agent in order that Crown
Counsel may consider what proceedings, if any, are required.
Administrative tribunals consist of persons or bodies exercising judicial or
quasi-judicial functions outside the ordinary hierarchy of the courts. As

a rule, they are set up by Act of Parliament or under powers conferred by
statute, which also govern their constitution, functions and procedure.
The continuing expansion of governmental activity and involvement in the
social and economic affairs of the nation has greatly multiplied the occasions
on which the individual may find himself at issue with the administration,
with a group of people or with another individual. Consequently there has
been a substantial growth during the past 30 years of administrative tribunals
with a regular or permanent existence and the function of deciding or adjudi¬
cating in disputes arising under regulatory or welfare legislation. Such tribunals
include those concerned with: land and property; national insurance; supple¬
mentary benefits and family allowances; the National Health Service; trans¬
port; taxation; and many which do not fall into any specified group. Their
constitution follows a fairly general pattern: usually they consist of an uneven
number of persons so that a majority decision can be reached; members are
usually appointed by the minister concerned with the subject but other
authorities (for instance, the Lord Chancellor) have the power of appointment
in appropriate cases; the Lord Chancellor (or the Lord President of the Court
of Session in Scotland) makes appointments in most cases where a lawyer
chairman or member is required; and, with some exceptions, members hold
office for a specified period.
There are also tribunals which enforce professional discipline (for example
of doctors and solicitors) but these are entirely different in constitution from
the statutory tribunals and have no jurisdiction over the general public.
Appeals from all the more important tribunals may be made, at least on a
point of law, to the High Court, or, in Scotland, to the Court of Session. An
appeal may also be made to a specially constituted appeal tribunal, to a minis¬
ter of the Crown or to an independent referee. An advisory body known as the
Council on Tribunals (appointed jointly by the Lord Chancellor and the Lord
Advocate) exercises general supervision1 over tribunals and reports on parti¬
cular matters, those peculiar to Scotland being dealt with by the Scottish
Committee of the Council.
Courts martial have jurisdiction over serving members of the armed forces
and, in certain circumstances, their dependants and other civilians who
accompany them outside the United Kingdom. The courts do not deal with
certain serious offences if committed in the United Kingdom: treason; murder;
manslaughter; treason-felony; rape; genocide; and aiding, abetting, counsel¬
ling or procuring suicide. Civil offences committed by servicemen in the
United Kingdom are also normally dealt with in the ordinary courts.
A court martial (which consists of a president and a number of serving
officers) may be convened by an authorised officer. A judge advocate is
appointed to sit with the court in more serious cases brought under the
Army and Air Force Acts (and at every trial brought under the Naval Discipline
Act) to advise upon law and procedure and, in the former case, to sum up the
evidence. The judge advocate in the case of the Army and the Air Force is a
civilian barrister; in the case of the Navy a legally qualified serving officer.
Appeals lie to the Courts Martial Appeal Court, and from that court to
the House of Lords if the court certifies that a point of law of general public
importance is involved and it appears to the court or to the House of Lords
that the point is one that ought to be considered by the House. Servicemen
can appeal to the Courts Martial Appeal Court only against finding. They can

petition against sentence to the confirming and reviewing authority. Civilians
can appeal against both finding and sentence.
European Court
of Justice
Under the treaties establishing the European Community, questions of the
validity and interpretation of Community law may be referred by the courts of
the United Kingdom to the Court of Justice of the European Community
(see p. 79), and must be so referred when there is no further judicial remedy
under national law, that is, when the question arises in a final court of appeal,
such as the House of Lords. The European Court gives a preliminary ruling
on the question referred, and this is binding on the national court on that
particular point. However, it remains with the national court to apply the law
thus interpreted and to decide the case.
ADMINISTRATION In the United Kingdom the judiciary is independent of the executive and is
OF THE therefore not subject to ministerial direction or control in regard to the
JUDICIAL judgment of the courts. Responsibility for administrative matters in England
SYSTEM an(j \yaieS) when it does not rest with the courts themselves, lies partly with
the Lord Chancellor and partly with the Home Secretary; in Scotland and
Northern Ireland it lies with the appropriate Secretary of State.
In England and Wales the Lord Chancellor is concerned with the composi¬
tion of all courts, both criminal and civil, with parts of criminal procedure
and with everything relating to civil law; and the Home Secretary with criminal
law, preventing offences, apprehending offenders, part of the process of trying
them, and virtually the whole of their treatment. The Prime Minister is
concerned in that he is responsible for recommending to the Crown the
highest judicial appointments—the Lords of Appeal in Ordinary, the Lord
Chief Justice, the Master of the Rolls, the President of the Family Division
and the Lords Justices who are the judges of the Court of Appeal. The
Secretary of State for the Environment is responsible for providing accommo¬
dation for all the superior courts, except the Central Criminal Court which is
the responsibility of the City of London.
The Lord Chancellor is the senior member of the judiciary of England and
Wales. He sits from time to time as the presiding judge in the Judicial Com¬
mittee of the House of Lords which hears appeals to the House. He is also
a senior member of the Government of the day, and the Cabinet minister
responsible for the administration of justice and the running of all courts in
England and Wales, save magistrates’ courts (which are the responsibility
of the Home Secretary). He is responsible for the appointment of judges and
magistrates1 and of officers of the civil and higher criminal courts of law in
England and Wales.
Magistrates’ courts in England and Wales are mainly administered by the
magistrates themselves, chiefly through local committees, but the elected
local authorities, with financial assistance from the Government, are responsible
for meeting their costs, and the Home Secretary, besides exercising a general
oversight, has certain specific responsibilities, including the approval of
boundary changes, approval of the appointment of justices clerks, and decid¬
ing disputes on financial matters.
In Scotland the Prime Minister makes recommendations for the appoint¬
ment of the most senior judges. Recommendations for the appointment of all
other judges are made by the Secretary of State for Scotland. He is responsible

behalf of the Crown in this matter.

for the appointment and removal of justices of the peace. He appoints the
staff of the High Court of Justiciary and the Court of Session and is respon¬
sible for the composition, staffing and general organisation of the sheriff
courts. The district courts are staffed and administered by the district local
authorities.
In Northern Ireland the judiciary are appointed by the Sovereign on the
advice of the Lord Chancellor. The Northern Ireland Office is responsible for
staffing and general organisation of the county and petty sessions courts.
The Attorney General and the Solicitor General, the Law Officers of the
Crown for England and Wales, are the Government’s principal advisers on
English law, and represent the Crown in appropriate domestic and interna¬
tional cases. They are senior barristers, elected members of the House of
Commons and hold ministerial posts. The equivalent Scottish officers are the
Lord Advocate and the Solicitor General for Scotland. The Attorney General
is also Attorney General for Northern Ireland.
As well as exercising various civil law functions, the Attorney General has
ultimate responsibility for the enforcement of the criminal law in England and
Wales, and the Director of Public Prosecutions (see p. 85) is subject to his
superintendence. The Attorney General is concerned with the institution
and prosecution of certain types of criminal proceedings, but he must exercise
an independent discretion, and must not be influenced by his Government
colleagues. The Solicitor General is subject to the authority of the Attorney
General, with similar rights and duties.
The Lord Advocate and the Solicitor General for Scotland are the chief
legal advisers to the Government on Scottish questions and the principal
representatives of the Crown for the purposes of litigation in Scotland. The
Lord Advocate is closely concerned with questions of legal policy and adminis¬
tration, he is responsible for the Scottish parliamentary draftsmen, and he is
responsible for the public prosecution of all major crimes. He delegates most
of the work of prosecution to the Solicitor General, to seven Advocates
Depute and to Procurators Fiscal who are full-time legally qualified prosecu¬
tors. The permanent adviser to the Lord Advocate on prosecution matters is
the Crown Agent who is also head of the procurator fiscal service and is
assisted by a staff of civil servants known as the Crown Office.
The operation of the law requires the participation of judges, with whom,
aided in certain cases by juries, the decision of disputed cases rests, and of the
officers of the court, who have general or specialised functions of an adminis¬
trative (and sometimes of a judicial) nature in the courts to which they are
attached. Barristers (advocates in Scotland) and solicitors who are entrusted
with representing the interests of the parties to a dispute are also involved
because, although the law allows an individual to conduct his own case if he
wishes, most people prefer to be legally represented.
The courts of the United Kingdom are the Queen’s Courts (since the Crown
is the historic source of all judicial power) and the Sovereign, acting on the
advice of ministers, is responsible for all appointments to the judiciary.
Full-time judges do not engage in politics, except for the Lord Chancellor
who, as well as being head of the judiciary and speaker of the House of Lords,
is a leading member of the Government in power. With the exception of
lay magistrates, judges are normally appointed from practising barristers,
advocates or solicitors and neither their training nor their careers are in any

way dictated by the State. Lay magistrates in England and Wales need no
legal qualifications, being appointed for their qualities of integrity and under¬
standing and as broadly representative of the community which they serve. On
appointment, however, they give an undertaking to complete a period of basic
training, so that they may obtain a sufficient knowledge of the law, including
the rules of evidence, and may understand the nature and purpose of sen¬
tencing. A special committee advises the Lord Chancellor on training policies.
Justices of the peace in Scotland likewise need no legal qualifications, and the
Secretary of State for Scotland is responsible for providing such training for
them as is necessary. In certain circumstances (for instance, in cases of
misconduct or proven incapacity) judges of the inferior courts in England and
Wales and Northern Ireland may be removed from their position by the Lord
Chancellor, and in Scotland, by the Secretary of State.
In order to safeguard and perpetuate the independence of the judiciary
from the executive, however, superior judges in England and Wales and
Northern Ireland (other than the Lord Chancellor who, as a Cabinet Minister,
changes with the Government) are subject to a power of removal only by the
Sovereign on an address presented by both Houses of Parliament, in Scotland
there is no statutory provision for removal of judges of the Court of Session or
High Court of Justiciary from office and it is probable that special legislation
would be required to effect such a dismissal.
A jury in England and Wales summoned to a criminal or civil court consists of
12 persons (except in county courts, where it consists of eight persons). In
Scotland the jury consists of 15 persons in criminal cases, 12 persons in civil
cases in the Court of Session and seven in civil cases in the sheriff court. In
Northern Ireland the jury numbers 12 in ordinary criminal1 and seven in civil
cases. Jury service in England and Wales is determined by a qualification
based on the electoral register: all citizens between the ages of 18 and 65,
subject to a five-year residence qualification, are liable for jury service. How¬
ever, people following certain occupations are either ineligible or entitled to
claim excusal, and certain persons with criminal records are disqualified. Jury
service in Scotland, for which citizens between the ages of 21 and 60 are liable,
is based on a low property qualification. In Northern Ireland it is determined
by a qualification based on the electoral register. Everyone between the ages
of 18 and 70 whose name is on the register is liable for service; categories
of exemptions and disqualifications are similar to those in England and Wales.
A jury is completely independent of both the judiciary and the executive.
In criminal cases the accused can have up to seven jurors (in Scotland, five)
changed without giving reasons and both defence and prosecution can object
for cause shown (for instance, lack of impartiality), but once members of the
jury have been sworn, they are protected by law from interference of any kind.
At certain inquests at coroners’ courts in England and Wales and Northern
Ireland and at fatal accident inquiries in Scotland, a jury is required to be
present to return a verdict on how, when and where a deceased person died.
Juries in this instance consist of from seven to eleven jurors. In England and
Wales a coroner may accept a majority verdict provided that the minority
consists of not more than two. At fatal accident inquiries in Scotland a simple
majority is sufficient. A jury is also required at an inquest held by a coroner in

offences’ (generally speaking, offences involving terrorism) are heard by a single judge,

England and Wales to decide whether objects of gold or silver found in the
ground are ‘treasure trove’.
The legal profession is divided into two branches: barristers (advocates in
Scotland) and solicitors. Barristers are known collectively as the ‘Bar’, and
collectively and individually as ‘counsel’. Each branch of the profession per¬
forms distinct duties—solicitors undertake legal business for lay clients, while
barristers advise on legal problems submitted through solicitors and present
cases in the higher courts—though certain functions are common to both.
To become a barrister in England a student must have reached an accepted
educational standard, have passed certain examinations and attended certain
courses prescribed by the Council of Legal Education. He must also have
become a member of one of the four Inns of Court—Lincoln’s Inn, the Inner
Temple, the Middle Temple and Gray’s Inn—where he must keep a number
of terms. He may then be called to the Bar, but is normally not allowed to
practise until he has kept further terms and completed six months’ pupilage
with a practising barrister of at least five years’ standing. Most higher judicial
offices are filled from the ranks of senior barristers (known as Queen’s
Counsel). The Senate of the Inns of Court and the Bar, the governing body of
the profession, comprises representatives of each Inn of Court and representa¬
tives elected by barristers themselves. The latter also constitute an autonomous
Bar Council charged with maintaining the standards and independence of the
profession and improving its services.
A prospective solicitor in England and Wales must be considered suitable
by the appropriate committee of The Law Society (the professional organisa¬
tion of solicitors) and he must enter into ‘articles of clerkship’ with a practising
solicitor of not less than five years’ standing before he can begin his profes¬
sional career. The term of articles lasts for two, two and a half, or five years,
depending upon the educational qualifications of the student. An articled clerk
must pass the necessary examinations prescribed by The Law Society and,
unless he has been a barrister or is a law graduate of a university, he is
generally required to attend a course of studies at a recognised law school.
Once a solicitor is qualified, he may become a member of The Law Society.
In Scotland prospective advocates and solicitors undergo much the same
training. While the respective professional organisations—the Faculty of
Advocates and the Law Society of Scotland—have their own professional
examinations, candidates usually obtain exemption from them by including
the necessary subjects in a law degree of a Scottish university. The prospective
advocate must, thereafter, undergo a period of training (either of 21 months
or of 12 months depending on whether or not he has been granted exemption
from nine months’ training) in a solicitor’s office, followed by about nine
months’ pupilage with a practising advocate. The prospective solicitor must
serve an apprenticeship of two years in a solicitor’s office before he can begin
his professional career.
In Northern Ireland barristers are members of the Inn of Court of Northern
Ireland; there is also a General Council of the Bar of Northern Ireland. The
professional organisation for solicitors is the Incorporated Law Society of
Northern Ireland.
Britain’s legal aid scheme helps people of limited means and resources to
meet the cost of work normally done by a lawyer. Under the scheme lawyers’
costs and expenses are paid out of a state legal aid fund drawn from three
sources: contributions which assisted people may be required to pay; costs and

damages recovered from opposite parties in litigation; and a grant from the
Exchequer.
Before court proceedings are involved, people in Great Britain with limited
means can obtain help from a solicitor on criminal or civil matters for little or
no payment. This includes giving advice, writing letters, drafting wills, obtain¬
ing opinions from a barrister and visiting a police station or prison. A solicitor
may act for a client until his costs and expenses reach a total of ^25, but
authority may be obtained for this limit to be exceeded. A person seeking help
has to give the solicitor brief details about his income and savings to show that
he comes within the financial limits allowed by the scheme. People with
disposable capital of up to a prescribed sum who are also receiving either
supplementary benefits (see p. 131) or family income supplement (seep. 132)
are within the financial limits; other people are also eligible provided their
disposable capital does not exceed the prescribed sum and their weekly
disposable income does not exceed a certain amount (in this case a contribu
tion may be payable). The disposable income limit is reviewed at least annually.
Similar provisions are proposed for Northern Ireland.
Legal aid is available to people whose disposable incomes and disposable
capital do not exceed certain prescribed amounts,1 but a contribution is
payable according to the level of the applicant s income; if that is below a
prescribed amount, legal aid is given free of any contribution. As in the case
of legal advice and assistance, the qualifying income limits for aid in civil
proceedings are reviewed at least once a year.
The legal aid schemes are run by The Law Society, The Law Society of
Scotland and The Incorporated Law Society of Northern Ireland, under the
general guidance respectively of the Lord Chancellor, the Secretary of State
for Scotland and the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland.
An applicant for legal aid must show that he has reasonable grounds for
asserting or disputing a claim. If his application is successful, he is entitled
to select from a panel a solicitor (who, if necessary, instructs counsel), and the
case is then conducted in the ordinary way, except that no money passes
between the assisted person and his solicitor—payments being made in and
out of the legal aid fund. The costs of an action which an assisted litigant loses
against an unassisted opponent may also, subject to certain conditions and if
the court so orders, be met out of the fund. Local committees have the right
to refuse assistance if it appears unreasonable that the applicant should receive
it in the particular circumstances of a case; both solicitors and counsel have a
duty to review the case at each stage to see that it is not being pursued un¬
reasonably at the public expense. Legal aid is not available for proceedings in
tribunals (except the Lands Tribunals and the Commons Commissioners),
coroners’ courts and cases where redress is sought for alleged defamation.
In criminal proceedings in England and Wales a legal aid order may be made
by the court concerned if it appears to be in the interest of justice and that a
defendant’s means are such that he requires financial help in meeting the costs
of the proceedings in which he is involved. An order must be made when
1 Assessments of disposable income and capital are made by the Supplementary Benefits
Commission and are governed by regulations which allow for deductions from gross
income for maintenance of dependants, interest on loans, income tax, rent and other
matters for which a person may reasonably provide out of income, and deductions for
the value of a person’s house, furniture and other household effects from his capital.

a person is committed for trial on a charge of murder or applies for leave to
appeal from the Court of Appeal (Criminal Division) or the Courts Martial
Appeal Court to the House of Lords. No person can be sentenced for the first
time to a term of imprisonment, borstal training or detention in a detention
centre unless he is legally represented, or has been refused, or has failed to
apply for, legal aid after having been informed of his right to do so.
Broadly similar arrangements exist in Scotland and Northern Ireland, but
in Scotland there is in addition a duty solicitor system which enables people in
custody to be represented on first appearing in court without any inquiry into
their means.
The duty of keeping the law under review in order to ensure that it meets the
needs of modern society lies, in England and Wales with the Law Reform
Committee, the Criminal Law Revision Committee and the Law Commission,
and in Scotland with the Scottish Law Commission. The Law Reform
Committee and the Criminal Law Revision Committee are standing commit¬
tees of judges and lawyers, appointed respectively by the Lord Chancellor and
the Home Secretary, to examine such aspects of the civil and criminal law
as may be referred to them by the appropriate minister. The Law Commission
is a permanent body consisting of five lawyers of high standing, charged with
the duty of scrutinising the law with a view to its systematic development and
reform, including the possibility of codification, the elimination of anomalies,
the repeal of obsolete and unnecessary enactments, and the reduction of the
number of separate enactments. The Commission submits programmes of
reform to the Lord Chancellor and may recommend further examination of
specified topics by itself or by some other body, such as a Royal Commission
or the Law Reform Committee or Criminal Law Revision Committee. The
Lord Chancellor may also ask the Commission to prepare draft Bills or to
advise government departments. In the course of its work the Commission
seeks information about the legal systems of other countries in so far as this
may assist its work. The Scottish Law Commission has a constitution similar to
that of the English body and similar functions in relation to the law of Scot¬
land. It reports to the Lord Advocate.
THE POLICE SERVICE
The police service of Great Britain is organised in a number of large forces
linked with local government and subject to the influence and eventual control
of the Home Secretary in England and Wales and the Secretary of State for
Scotland in Scotland. In Northern Ireland, it is organised in a single force.
There are 43 regular police forces in England and Wales and eight in Scotland.
Each is responsible for a separate area, but there is constant co-operation be¬
tween them. They are defined according to area of responsibility. Outside
London most counties have their own forces, though in the interests of
efficiency several have combined forces; in London the Metropolitan Police
Force is responsible for an area within a radius of about 15 miles (24 kilometres)
from the centre but excluding the City of London, where there is a separate
force. In Scotland there are six regional forces and two combined forces.
The strength of the regular police force in Great Britain is about 119,000
(including over 5,000 policewomen), the size of individual police forces
depending on the area and population which they serve. The strength of the
Metropolitan Police Force is about 21,000.

BRITAIN 1976: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
In addition to the regular police forces, there are constabularies maintained
by the statutory transport and other public authorities, and by the Ministry
of Defence. Considerable numbers of people are employed by commercial
security organisations (which are subject to the ordinary law of the land).
Each of the regular police forces is maintained by a police authority. In
England and Wales the authority is a committee consisting of the local
councillors and magistrates. Combined police authorities, which also com¬
prise councillors and magistrates, contain representatives from each con¬
stituent county.
The police authority for the Metropolitan Police Force is the Home
Secretary. In the City of London the Court of Common Council is the
police authority, although it usually appoints a standing committee to deal
with all police matters on its behalf.
In Scotland the police authority is the regional or island council. Where
there are combined forces there is a joint police committee.
The primary duty of the police authority is to provide an adequate and
efficient police force for the area for which it is responsible. Its functions,
some of which are subject to ministerial approval, include appointing the
chief constable and deputy and assistant chief constables and, if necessary,
calling upon them to retire; fixing the establishment of the force and the
number of officers in each rank; appointing traffic wardens; and providing
and maintaining buildings and equipment. In the Metropolitan Police area
the chief officer of police and his immediate subordinates are appointed by
the Crown on the recommendation of the Home Secretary.
Chief constables are responsible for the direction and control of police
forces and for the appointment, promotion and discipline of all ranks below
deputy or assistant chief constable; they are, however, generally answerable
to the police authorities on matters of efficiency, and are required to submit
a written annual report.
The Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC) operates under the direction of a chief
constable who is responsible to the Police Authority for Northern Ireland,
which has a duty to maintain an adequate and efficient police service. The
RUC has a strength of some 4,500. Ranks, conditions of service, pay and
general duties follow closely on the lines of the service in Great Britain.
The RUC is aided in its duties by the civilian Royal Ulster Constabulary
Reserve, a largely part-time body of men and women; while on duty, they
have the same powers and duties as members of the regular force.
The Home Secretary and the Secretary of State for Scotland, who have a
general responsibility for the preservation of law and order throughout Great
Britain, are concerned both in the overall organisation of the police service
and in its administration and operation. They approve the appointment of
chief constables, and may require a police authority to retire a chief constable
in the interests of efficiency, call for a report from a chief constable on any
matters relating to the policing of his area, or cause a local inquiry to be
held. They are also empowered to make regulations, with which all police
authorities must comply, covering such matters as rank; qualifications for
appointment, promotion and retirement; discipline; hours of duty, leave, pay
and allowances; and uniform and equipment. Some of these regulations are
first negotiable on the Police Council (a negotiating body on which are repre¬
sented the police authorities, police staff associations and ministers), the

others are discussed on representative advisory bodies, together with any
general questions affecting the police service.
All police forces in Great Britain (except the Metropolitan Police for which
the Home Secretary is directly responsible) are subject to inspection on
behalf of ministers. Inspectors of constabulary carry out, under Her Majesty’s
Chief Inspector of Constabulary and Her Majesty’s Chief Inspector of
Constabulary for Scotland, a formal annual inspection of the forces in their
regions, inquiring into efficiency and reporting to the Home Secretary or the
Secretary of State for Scotland. Annual reports are published, covering the
whole range of police matters. The inspectors also maintain close touch with
forces for which they are responsible, and have various advisory functions.
The income of police authorities derives from central Government, the ‘rates’
(a form of local property tax) and various other local sources. The Govern¬
ment s contribution, which is a half of approved expenditure (except in the
case of the City of London police where it is a third) is conditional on the
Home Secretary or the Secretary of State for Scotland being satisfied that
the force is being efficiently administered and maintained.
In general, entry to the regular police force is open to men between the ages
of 18^ and 30, and to women in England and Wales between the ages of 18^ and
35, and in Scotland between 19 and 30. An individual chief constable may
approve appointment of especially suitable older men and women.
The standard police ranks in Great Britain, except in the Metropolitan
Police area, are: chief constable, assistant chief constable, chief superin¬
tendent, superintendent, chief inspector, inspector, sergeant and constable. The
chief officer in the Metropolitan Police area, the Commissioner of Police of the
Metropolis, is assisted by a deputy commissioner and four assistant commission¬
ers. Next in rank are deputy assistant commissioners, and then commanders;
from chief superintendent the ranks are the same as in the rest of the country.
In the City of London the ranks are the same as in the regions except that the
chief officer is the Commissioner of Police and the second in command is an
assistant commissioner, and there is one commander.
Cadet training is designed to prepare boys and girls between 16 and i8|
years of age for a career in the police service (a few forces do not recruit girls).
They have no police powers but, in addition to their educational studies and
physical and adventure training, are instructed in elementary police work.
In order to release as many uniformed police officers as possible for operational
duties police authorities employ over 30,000 civilians on administrative
(pay, records, finance, and other general subjects) and other duties (finger¬
print, scenes of crime and control room work). Some civilian staff are also
employed on catering and domestic duties.
Traffic wardens (of whom there are nearly 7,000) are extensively employed to
discharge specified duties connected with road traffic and vehicles, normally
undertaken by the police. In this connection they may be authorised to serve
fixed penalty notices1 for minor offences to which the fixed penalty system
applies; to man police car-pounds (except in Scotland); to enforce the vehicle
1 A fixed penalty notice gives the recipient the option of paying a specified sum to the
clerk of the appropriate court instead of having his case tried in the ordinary way.

excise laws; and to obtain the names and addresses of people thought to have
committed certain types of traffic offence. They may also be employed to
direct traffic, to act as parking attendants at street parking places, and as school¬
crossing patrols, if the police agree. Traffic wardens remain under the contro
of the chief constable of the force to which they are attached, whatever duties
they may perform.
Each police force has an attachment of special constables, who are volunteers
willing to perform police duties without pay in their spare time. In Eng an
and Wales the function of special constables is to act as auxiliaries to the
regular force when required. In Scotland they are employed only in emer¬
gencies although they may be assigned for duty for training purposes.
A police officer in Great Britain is an independent holder of a public office
and exercises his powers as a constable, whether conferred by statute or y
common law, by virtde of his office. He is an agent of the law of the land not
of the police authority nor of the central Government and, although his chie
officer of police has a vicarious liability for any wrongful act he may commit
in the performance of his functions as a constable, he himself may also be sued
in respect of his own wrongful act.
No member of the police service may belong to a trade union since it is a
basic principle of the service that its members must not only be free from
political bias, but must also be seen to be free of it. All ranks, however, have
their own associations which can make representations to ministers or to
police authorities on matters of interest or concern to their members
The many functions of a police officer as a constable range from the pro¬
tection of people and property, road or street patrolling and traffic control to
crime prevention, criminal investigation and the apprehension of offenders.
The main departments in all police forces are the uniform department, the
criminal investigation department and the traffic department. Many forces
also have specialised departments, including river police (in districts with
stretches of navigable waterway), a mounted branch and dog handlers.
In all aspects of police work, the application of scientific aids has reached
an advanced stage: about £25 million is spent annually on police equipment,
including about £3-9 million on radio communications. The police have some
30 000 personal radio sets operational. A police computer project 18 being
developed on a national basis for rationalising the keeping of records and
speeding up the dissemination of information.

number of common services are provided by the central government depart-
lents for the benefit of all forces to supplement those provided by the police
athorities for their own use and by communal arrangements made between
ie forces themselves. The most important of these services are: training
^rvices; a forensic science service in England and Wales which provides eight
“gional laboratories (in addition to the Metropolitan Police Laboratory),
decommunications services, including depots which in England and Wales
apply and maintain wireless equipment for the police; and central an
rovincial criminal records which are available to all forces. In addition,
egional crime squads, consisting of teams of experienced detectives from
everal forces, operating under a committee of chief constables, are employed
n England and Wales to investigate major crimes involving inquiries in more
han one police area. The Scottish Crime Squad assists police forces in
Scotland in the investigation and prevention of crime and in the collection
JUSTICE AND THE LAW
I03
and maintenance of information concerning criminals. Arrangements are
also made for everyday assistance by one force to another.
Scientific Research There are three inter-related branches of the Home Office Police Department
and Planning devoted to scientific research and medium- and long-term planning. The
Police Scientific Development Branch and the Police Research Services Unit,
which are staffed by scientists and senior police officers respectively, are
concerned with operational research into police methods and the develop¬
ment of equipment for police forces throughout Great Britain. The Economic
Planning Unit which is composed mainly of economists and accountants, is
responsible for the development of a planning-programming-budgeting
system for the police. This work includes the production of programme
accounts and studies of the utilisation of police resources.
Metropolitan
Police Force
Services
Services provided by the Metropolitan Police Force for other forces include
(1) the publication of the Police Gazette,1 which contains particulars of people
wanted for crime and details of stolen property, and is supplied without
charge to the police forces of the United Kingdom and to certain other
Commonwealth and foreign forces; (2) the organisation and control of the
special branch of the criminal investigation department at New Scotland
Yard, whose duties include the protection of royalty, some ministers and
distinguished foreign visitors; and (3) the carrying out of extradition orders
made by the courts. The Metropolitan Police Force is also available, on
request, to assist any other police force in England and Wales in criminal
investigations. Similarly, the services of the Fraud Squad, run jointly by the
Metropolitan Police Force and the City of London Police, are available
throughout Great Britain for the investigation of serious company frauds.
The National Central Bureau, which handles the business of the International
Criminal Police Organisation (Interpol) on behalf of the United Kingdom
and the British dependencies, is part of the Metropolitan Police Force.
For certain of these services, the Metropolitan Police Force receives an
additional Government grant.
Relations with Because of the small number of police officers in relation to the population
the Public as a whole (one officer to roughly 500 people), the limitations on their powers
and their lack of firearms, the sanction of the police in enforcing the law rests
to a very considerable extent upon common consent. Police training courses
increasingly emphasise the role of both the service and the individual officer
in local communities, and all forces are concerned with schemes for dealing
with problems before court action becomes necessary, particular attention
being paid to relations with children and young people and with coloured
immigrant communities.
In England and Wales every chief officer of police must record and investi¬
gate any complaint received from the public about a member of his force.
He may request the chief officer of another force to provide the investigator
(and must do so if the Home Secretary so directs), and, unless completely
satisfied that no criminal offence has been committed, must send the papers
to the Director of Public Prosecutions who decides whether or not criminal
proceedings should follow. Legislation is planned to introduce an independent
element into the handling of complaints against the police. In Scotland
1 The Scottish Criminal Record Office in Glasgow is responsible for the publication of
the Scottish Police Gazette.
BRITAIN 1976: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
also chief constables have a duty to arrange for the investigation of complaints;
procurators fiscal investigate independently complaints alleging that an officer
has committed a criminal offence. Police authorities and all inspectors of
constabulary throughout Great Britain must keep themselves informed about
the way in which chief officers handle complaints.
Treatment of
Offenders
PENAL SYSTEMS
The chief aims of the penal systems of the United Kingdom are to deter the
potential law-breaker and to reform the convicted offender. The element of
deterrence is in the probability of detection, public trial and punishment rather
than in the severity of the punishment itself.
Imprisonment and, for certain categories of young offender, other forms of
custodial treatment form an important part of British penal practice, but
are increasingly seen as the last resort in dealing with people who break the
law. Wherever possible and appropriate for the safety of the public the treat¬
ment of offenders within the community is regarded as preferable to custodial
treatment. . , ,
Traditional non-custodial treatment includes fines; probation; absolute
or (in England, Wales and Northern Ireland) conditional discharge for up to
three years (one year in Northern Ireland)—a discharge being made in
circumstances in which there is properly a conviction but the court feels that
there is no need to impose punishment; and ‘binding everywhere the offender
is required to pledge money, with or without sureties, to keep the peace
and be of good behaviour’.
The suspended sentence in England, Wales and Northern Ireland means
that an offender does not actually serve his sentence unless he is convicted of
a further offence punishable with imprisonment within a specified period
(maximum two years). If he is convicted of such an offence within the period
of a suspended sentence, the sentence will normally take effect and a further
sentence may be imposed for the new offence. An offender who is given a
suspended sentence of over six months may, in England and Wales, be made
subject to supervision by a probation officer for all or part of the period during
which the sentence is suspended.
Offenders who are convicted of imprisonable offences in England and
Wales and who live in areas where facilities are available may be ordered to
perform a specified number of hours (up to a maximum of 240) of unpaid
service to the community under the supervision of the probation service.
There are provisions for probation hostels, intensive supervision and day
training centres. An offender may also with his consent have his sentence
deferred for up to six months to enable a court to arrive at the most appro¬
priate sentence, taking into account his conduct after, for instance, some
expected change in his circumstances.
The courts may order an offender (having considered his means) to pay
compensation for any personal injury, loss or damage resulting from his
offence. In the case of major crimes against property a criminal bankruptcy
order against the offender can form the basis of bankruptcy proceedings
against him in England and Wales. In Scotland a committee is considering the
potential role of the criminal court in ordering reparation by the offender
to the victim. , r . . r
In certain circumstances the courts may order the forfeiture of property
used, or intended for use, in the commission of a crime. An offender convicted
Administrative
Authorities
JUSTICE AND THE LAW I05
of a serious crime may be disqualified from driving if a motor vehicle was
used in its commission.
The mandatory penalty for murder in the United Kingdom is imprison¬
ment for life. This is also the maximum penalty for manslaughter and certain
other offences, including rape, robbery offences and arson.
Except in cases of murder (and of one or two other rarely prosecuted
offences), for which the penalty is prescribed by law, the courts have complete
discretion to select the sentence in the light of the nature and gravity of the
offence and the available information about the character and needs of the
offender. In certain cases this discretion is modified by statutory provisions
designed to ensure that prison sentences are kept to a minimum. There are
special provisions for dealing with children in trouble and young adult
offenders see pp. 110-2. In England and Wales a person who has not
previously served a custodial sentence of a particular kind may not be
sentenced to custodial treatment of that kind unless he is legally represented
or has chosen not to be, and in the case of imprisonment unless the court is
satisfied that no other sentence will suffice. On the other hand, special sentences
longer than the normal maximum term (extended sentences) may be imposed
on persistent offenders.
In Northern Ireland special temporary procedures are provided for dealing
with people suspected of terrorism, but there are safeguards for the individual
based on referral to independent legal commissioners with a further right of
appeal to a tribunal.
In the interests of the rehabilitation of offenders, anyone in Great Britain
who has received a prison sentence of up to 2| years and then has managed to
avoid further convictions for a specified period (the time depends upon the
nature of the original sentence) is entitled for most purposes to treat his
spent conviction as though it had never occurred (for instance, in some
judicial proceedings and in most applications for employment).
The Home Secretary and the Secretaries of State for Scotland and Northern
Ireland are the government ministers generally responsible for legislation
relating to the treatment of offenders, for collecting statistical and other
information about the operation of the penal system, for keeping penal
methods under review, and for bringing information about these methods to
the attention of the courts. In England and Wales the Home Secretary is
assisted by an Advisory Council on the Penal System, which makes recom¬
mendations on such matters relating to the prevention of crime and the treat¬
ment of offenders as the Home Secretary may refer to it. In Scotland the
Scottish Council on Crime keeps under review questions relating to the
prevention of crime and the treatment of offenders in Scotland, in consulta¬
tion with the Secretary of State for Scotland.
In England and Wales probation, the after-care of prisoners and other
related functions are the responsibility of the probation and after-care
service. Its officers are employed by local probation and after-care committees
composed largely of magistrates and representatives of the Crown Court.
The Home Secretary, through the Home Office Probation and After-Care
Department, is responsible to Parliament for the efficiency of the service.
In Northern Ireland the Secretary of State has responsibility for the probation
and after-care service. There is no separate Scottish probation service; local
authority social work departments provide the services and officers required
by the criminal courts in their areas.

the Home Office Prison Department, the Scottish Home and Health Depart¬
ment’s Prison Service and the Prison Administration of the Northern Ireland
Office A board of visitors composed of men and women representing t e oca
community and including a proportion of magistrates is appointed by the
Home Secretary at each custodial centre in England and Wales. The boards
have general responsibility concerning the state of the buildings, the adminis¬
tration of the establishment and the treatment of inmates. They report
annually to the Home Secretary. They have certain disciplinary powers in
cases involving serious breaches of discipline, and they hear representations
or complaints from inmates. Similar arrangements exist in Scotland and
Northern Ireland. ^ o 1 j j
The Home Secretary and the Secretary of State for Scotland are advised
by parole boards on the release of prisoners on licence.
Special provisions within the penal system apply to young offenders I he
responsible Government departments are: in England and Wales, the Home
Office and the Department of Health and Social Security; in Scotland the
Home and Health and Education Departments; and in Northern Ireland,
the Northern Ireland Office. Local authority social services departments are
responsible for many functions relating to children and young people.
Probation is designed to secure the rehabilitation of an offender while he
continues his ordinary life under the supervision of a probation officer, whose
dutv it is to advise, assist and befriend him. ,
Before making a probation order (which may be for not less than one and n°
more than three years) the court must explain its effects and make sure tha
the probationer understands that if he fails to comply with the requirements o
the order he will be liable to be dealt with again for the original offence. A
probation order can be made only if the offender is 17 years of age or over and
must have his consent; it usually requires the probationer to keep m regu ar
touch with the probation officer, to be of good behaviour and to lead an
industrious life. It may also require him to live in a specified place, or m
appropriate circumstances to submit to treatment for his mental c^dl^
Probation and after-care committees may, with the approval of the Home
Secretary, provide and maintain day training centres (which offenders may be
required to attend for up to 60 days for intensive supervision and social
education as a requirement of a probation order), bai oste s, Pr0 a lon f
tels and other establishments for use in connection with the rehabilitation o
offenders. The service is also responsible for administering the scheme o
service to the community, whereby courts have the power to require offenders
to perform, in their spare time, up to 240 hours (within 12 months) of such
unpaid work as painting and decorating for families in need, the handicapped,
and the elderly; building adventure playgrounds; clearing sites at redevelop
ment areas; and nature conservation tasks. , . ,
In England, Wales and Northern Ireland, the services of probation a
after-care officers are available to every criminal court.
In Scotland, where there is no separate probation service offenders subjec
to probation orders or to after-care supervision following release from a penal
institution are supervised by specially approved local authority social workers.
The aims of the prison service are, briefly, to provide for the detention of those
committed to custody under the law in conditions generally acceptable t
society, and to develop constructive methods of treatment and training in the
hope that they will lead to the prisoner’s rehabilitation and reform. To thi

end prisoners are classified into groups, taking into account the likelihood of
their escaping, the degree to which their escape would offer a threat to the
public or the State, and the justification of high expenditure on providing
secure conditions. Unconvicted prisoners are entitled to privileges not granted
to convicted prisoners. As far as practicable, unconvicted prisoners are
separated from convicted prisoners, and those under 21 are separated from
those over that age.
Prisons to which offenders may be committed directly by a court are known
as local prisons ; all are closed establishments. Other prisons, which may be
open or closed, receive prisoners on transfer from local prisons. Separate
prisons cater for female prisoners.
Many British prisons were built during the nineteenth century and are
unsatisfactory by modern standards; overcrowding is also a problem. To
improve conditions generally, new prisons are being built and existing
establishments redeveloped and modernised.
All prisoners serving a sentence of imprisonment for an actual- term of more
than one month, except those sentenced to imprisonment for life, are allowed
remission of one-third of their sentence provided that this does not reduce
their sentence below 31 days (in Scotland, 30 days). Remission may be for¬
feited for serious misconduct in prison. In addition, except in Northern
Ireland, prisoners serving fixed sentences totalling more than 18 months
become eligible for consideration for release on parole after serving one-third
of their sentence or 12 months, whichever expires later. Each eligible prisoner
is first considered for release by a local review committee which reports to the
Home Secretary or the Secretary of State for Scotland on his suitability for
parole. In some cases the minister concerned has power to grant or refuse
parole, while others he refers to an officially appointed parole board. Where
the board recommends favourably, the decision whether or not to release a
prisoner depends finally on the minister, but where the board does not recom¬
mend release the minister has no power to grant parole. The licence remains in
force until the date on which the prisoner would have been released if he had
not been licensed or, for prisoners serving extended sentences (in England and
Wales only) and offenders sentenced while under 21 years of age, until the end
of the sentence.
Prisoners serving life sentences are also eligible for release on licence. In
England and Wales the practice is for cases to be referred to the local review
committee at a date fixed for each case after consultation between the parole
board and the Home Office. In Scotland the usual practice is to seek the views
of the local review committee after the offender has served seven years. The
Lord Chief Justice in England and Wales or the Lord Justice General in
Scotland (as the case may be) and, if he is available, the judge who presided
at the trial, must be consulted before any life sentence prisoner is released. In
Northern Ireland the judiciary is similarly consulted before any such release
takes place. Prisoners released in this way remain on licence for the whole of
their lives, and are subject to recall at any time should the circumstances
warrant it.
The main aim of prison industries is to give an offender in custody a training
and experience that will fit him to get and retain a job on discharge. The
primary source of work lies in the domestic requirements of the prison service
itself in clothing and equipping prisoners and providing furniture and furnish¬
ings. Goods and services are also supplied to other government departments
io8

and public bodies, and there is a steady growth of sales of a wide range of
products in the open market—for example, textiles, woodwork and engineer¬
ing products. The profitable farming and horticultural industries also provide
work and training and play an increasing part in contributing to the prison
food provision. A few prisoners are employed outside prison in agriculture
and on work such as archaeological excavation and the preservation of canals.
In England, Wales and Scotland, small payments are made to inmates for
the work they do; in some prisons, special incentive schemes provide an
opportunity for higher earnings on the basis of output and skill. In Northern
Ireland there is a progressive system of earnings, related to work done.
Any prisoner serving a sentence of four years or more may be considered
for employment in an ordinary civilian job outside prison for about six
months before his discharge. Prisoners selected for the scheme may live either
in a separate part of the prison or in a prison hostel; they are paid normal
wages, from which they support their families and meet their own expenses.
Education for those in custody is provided by local education authorities in
close liaison with central departments. Each prison in England and Wales
has an education officer and a number of part-time teachers.
In many prisons the education officer is assisted by one or more full-time
teachers. Attendance at evening classes is voluntary but full-time day classes j
are provided for young people under 16 years of age (such as those in borstals).
Day release may be granted to certain prisoners to improve their basic educa-
tion standards or to pursue examination courses. Increasing numbers of
prisoners are taking Open University courses. All inmates have access to the
prison library. Other recreational activities include: films, plays, concerts,
lectures, discussions, gymnastics and, where facilities allow, outdoor sports.
Physical education in custodial centres aims to maintain and improve general :
physical fitness; all offenders under 21 must attend a certain number of classes, ;
but others choose whether to take part.
Selected prisoners take vocational training courses leading to recognised
qualifications. Others learn construction industry crafts, and their skills are
later used in maintaining and improving existing establishments and building
new ones. Facilities in Scotland and Northern Ireland are similar to those in
England and Wales.
The physical and mental care of inmates is a statutory duty of the prison
medical officer. Large establishments have medical teams, while others may
only need the services of a medical officer on a part-time basis. All have hospital
and out-patient treatment facilities and the necessary support staff.
In a few prisons there are large, fully equipped hospitals where major
surgery and treatment can be undertaken by visiting specialists. The patients
include inmates from other establishments. There is one psychiatric prison in
England and Wales with accommodation for some 300 inmates. Many establish¬
ments have psychiatric units to which inmates are transferred from other
establishments. Use is also made of hospital and specialist facilities of the
National Health Service, and if necessary arrangements are made for treat¬
ment to continue after release from custody.
There has been a constant development of the application of psychological
principles to the tasks of the penal system over the past 30 years. The work of
a prison psychologist varies from one place to another. Psychologists are
involved in the analysis of operational processes, the evaluation of treatment
programmes and regimes, the assessment of individuals, contributions to

management and treatment and the selection and training of staff. The focus
of their work is primarily upon tasks involving design, development and
evaluation.
All prisoners, from the beginning of their sentence, have a general right to
write and receive letters and to be visited by their relatives at regular intervals.
They also have such privileges as additional letters and visits, the use of
books, periodicals and newspapers, and the right to make purchases from the
canteen with money they have earned in prison. Depending on the facilities
available, they may be granted the further privileges of dining and recreation
in association and watching television in the evening.
Breaches of discipline are dealt with by the prison governor, or board of
visitors, who have power to order, among other penalties, forfeiture of re¬
mission and forfeiture of privileges.
Welfare in prisons is the general concern of the prison staff as a whole, and in
particular of the chaplains and assistant governors, but special responsibilities
attach to prison welfare officers, who, in England, Wales and Northern
Ireland, are probation officers seconded by the probation and after-care service
(in Scotland, social workers from local authority social work departments). The
functions of these officers include helping the prisoner in his relationships
with individuals and organisations outside the prison, and making plans for
the prisoner’s after-care, working closely in this connection with colleagues in
the probation and after-care service and with other agencies in the com¬
munity whose help the prisoner or his family may need either during sentence
or after release.
For the spiritual welfare of the inmates, a chaplain of the Church of
England (in Scotland of the Church of Scotland, and in Northern Ireland of
the Church of Ireland and of the Presbyterian Church), a Roman Catholic
priest and a Methodist minister are appointed to every prison. Ministers of
other denominations are appointed or specially called in as needed.
Prisoners may also receive visits from specially appointed prison visitors
whose work is voluntary and in England and Wales is co-ordinated and
guided by the National Association of Prison Visitors.
In England and Wales pre-release courses are conducted at all prisons.
During these courses experts hold open forum with prisoners nearing their
release on the domestic, social and employment problems with which they
are likely to be faced. Certain categories of prisoners may be granted home
leave towards the end of their sentences to enable them to preserve links with
their families and friends, or to make new contacts with people, including
potential employers, who may be able to assist them on release. Some categories
are considered for two periods of home leave, one allowing five clear days and
the other a week-end at home, and others for one period of five days at home.
Prisoners granted parole may have preparatory leave. After-care begins at the
commencement of a prisoner’s sentence, and probation officers arrange inter¬
views for offenders in the cells at court immediately after sentence. Officers
often visit prisoners’ families to discuss problems and in some areas set up
prisoners’ wives’ groups which meet informally and provide a source of
mutual companionship and support.
All prisons in England and Wales arrange pre-release preparations for
prisoners, varying according to the needs of the inmates concerned. At many
prisons they take the form of open discussion groups. For prisoners with
sentences of two years or more home leave is extensively granted towards the

end of their sentences, and for some male prisoners serving four years or more
and for some women serving 18 months or more there are special provisions
for work outside the prison before release.
There are two systems of after-care in England and Wales, both run by the
probation and after-care service. A compulsory system applies to prisoners
released from life imprisonment or extended sentences, young prisoners and
voung people discharged from borstals and detention centres; and a voluntary
system is offered to the remainder. After-care is also provided by a number of
voluntary societies, most of which are members of the National Association
for the Care and Resettlement of Offenders. This may take the form of
providing associates to probation officers in their work of befriending ex¬
prisoners; befriending prisoners’ families; providing club rooms; or helping
discharged offenders to find work and accommodation. Hostels and other
forms of accommodation are provided, often with some financial help from t e
Home Office. , .
In Northern Ireland after-care duties are similarly carried out by probation
and after-care officers. In Scotland responsibility for statutory and voluntary
after-care is vested in local authority social workers.
In England and Wales no child under ten years can be held guilty of any
offence. A child aged ten to 16 years who is alleged to have committed an
offence may be the subject of criminal proceedings or of ‘care’ proceedings,
both of which are normally held before special juvenile courts (see p. 83)
To make an order in care proceedings the juvenile court must be satisfied
that any one of a number of conditions is met, one of which is that an offence
has been committed. The court must also believe that the child is in need o
care or control which he is unlikely to receive unless an order is made. I his
means that the commission of a criminal offence is not in itself a ground tor
a care order to be made by a court. . . .
A number of orders are available to courts in both care and criminal pro¬
ceedings. A care order commits the child to the care of the local authority, so
that the authority becomes responsible for deciding where the child shou e
accommodated, for example, with foster parents or in a ‘community home .
The care order generally lasts until the child is aged 18 or 19 unless it is in
the meantime discharged by a court. For children who are too severe y
disturbed and disruptive to be treated successfully in other child care homes
but who do not need treatment in hospital, three new establishments, known
as ‘youth treatment centres’ are being provided.
Under a supervision order (usually valid for three years or less) a child
normally remains at home under the supervision of a local authority social
worker or a probation officer. He or she may be required to undergo inter¬
mediate treatment’ which is a compromise between measures involving com¬
plete removal from home and those which do not. It consists of participation
under a supervisor in a variety of constructive and remedial activities either
through a short residential course or through attendance at a day or evening
centre.
A court may also order a parent or guardian to enter into recognisances to
take proper care of the child and to exercise proper control over him; may
order payments of compensation; or may order a stay in hospital in accordance
with the mental health legislation.
In criminal proceedings the courts may also impose fines or grant a condi¬
tional or absolute discharge. If the offender is a boy, he may be ordered to
spend a total of (normally) 12 to 24 hours of his spare time on Saturdays at

one of 60 attendance centres (up to three hours on any one occasion). The
centres are for boys found guilty of offences for which older people could be
sentenced to imprisonment, and provide physical training and instruction in
handicrafts or some other practical subject. For boys aged 14 or over courts
may make a detention centre order (see below), and young people of 15 and
over may be committed to the Crown Court with a view to borstal training
(see below). In the case of a very serious crime, detention in a place approved
by the Home Secretary or the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland may be
ordered.
In Scotland the age of criminal responsibility is eight years, but prosecution
is the exception, and no child can be prosecuted for an offence other than at
the instance of the Lord Advocate. Children under 16 years who have com¬
mitted an offence or need care and protection are generally brought before an
informal children s hearing (not a juvenile court), where the aim is to discuss
difficulties and provide the most appropriate measures of care and treatment
(see p. 85). The hearing can commit a child to supervision by a local authority
subject to conditions appropriate to the child’s needs (this may include a
requirement to stay in a residential home).
Offenders aged xy to 20 years have been recognised as a category distinct
from child and adult offenders for many years in Britain, and there are special
forms of custodial treatment for this age group. The main non-custodial
measures are generally the same as those used in dealing with adults, although
in the London and Manchester areas an attendance centre order (usually made
for younger boys, see above) may be given. The custodial sentences available
are: detention in a detention centre, borstal training and imprisonment.
Some 12 senior detention centres provide a means of treating young male
offenders in Great Britain for whom a long period of residential training away
from home does not seem necessary or justified by the offence, but who can¬
not be taught respect for the law by such non-custodial measures as fines or
probation. Detention is usually for a period of three to six months (a fixed
period of three months in Scotland). Life in a centre is brisk and formal,
demanding the highest possible standard of discipline and achievement. The
emphasis is on positive training which provides a normal working week of 40
hours, including an hour each day devoted to physical training, with con¬
siderable attention paid to education. All offenders discharged from a deten¬
tion centre are subject to supervision for a year.
Borstal training aims to bring about a development in the trainee’s character
and capacities, progressively increasing scope for personal decision, responsi¬
bility and self-control, and to enable the trainee to develop as an individual.
Offenders are placed as near their home area as possible so as to maintain and
foster their ties with the local community. The system is essentially remedial
and educational, based on personal training by carefully selected staff.
Emphasis is placed on vocational training in skilled trades. There is much
freedom of movement, and many borstals are open establishments. The
training system is available to offenders aged 15 to 20 years (16-20 years in
Scotland and Northern Ireland). Courts rarely order borstal training unless
they have already tried fines, probation or detention centre training, perhaps
all three. In England, Wales and Northern Ireland the training period ranges
from six months to two years, and is followed by supervision for two years
(one year in Northern Ireland). In Scotland, where there is no minimum
training period the maximum is two years, and supervision for one year.
[I2 BRITAIN 1976: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
A person under 17 years cannot be sentenced to imprisonment in England
and Wales, and no court may pass a sentence of imprisonment on an offender
aged 17-20 years unless satisfied that no other method of dealing with him is
appropriate. If imprisonment is imposed, the term must normally be of
less than six months or more than three years (or not less than 18 months if
the person has served a previous sentence of not less than six months im¬
prisonment or a sentence of borstal training). Sentences of up to two years
may be ordered by a court to be suspended. Prisoners under the age of 21 at
the time of their sentence are classified as ‘young prisoners . and serve their
sentences separately from older prisoners unless they are reclassified as adults
and treated as such in an adult prison. In Scotland no offender under 21 years
may be sent to prison; where neither borstal nor detention training is suitable
for an offender aged 16-20 years, detention in a special ‘young offenders
institution’ may be ordered.
CRIMINOLOGICAL A wide range of criminological and other social research is carried out by the
RESEARCH AND Home Office Research Unit which also provides liaison on research matters
STUDIES between the Home Office and the Social Work Services Group of the Scottish
Home and Health Department. Research is carried out in university depart¬
ments, much of it financed by the Home Office and the Scottish Home
and Health Department. The principal university research establishment is
the Institute of Criminology at Cambridge.
Studies undertaken in the Home Office Research Unit are mainly concen¬
trated on subjects of direct interest to home departments. The results of the
unit’s work are published in learned journals and by Her Majesty’s Stationery
Office in the Home Office Research Studies series. First degree courses
(normally in law, sociology or social administration) which include some study
of criminology, one-year postgraduate courses and research facilities are
available at a number of universities.

5 Defence
Europe
In 1974-75 the Government undertook a major review of Britain’s defence
commitments and capabilities in implementation of its policy to maintain a
modern and effective defence system while reducing its costs as a proportion
of national resources. The review was completed in early 1975, following
consultations with Britain s allies, and concluded that the economic as well as
the military and political objectives of the Government could be achieved
only if the defence forces were concentrated on those areas in which a British
contribution to collective defence would be most effective in ensuring Britain’s
security and that of her allies. This means that the North Atlantic Treaty
Organisation (NATO) will remain the first and overriding charge on Britain’s
defence resources, and that Britain will withdraw from its non-NATO
commitments wherever this is consistent with its fundamental military and
political obligations. At the same time, general purpose forces will be main¬
tained as insurance against the unforeseen. As a result of the review, the
average annual cost of the planned defence programme over the period to
i983-84 at I974 prices has been reduced from £4,300 million to less than
£3,800 million. Similarly, it is estimated that defence expenditure as a pro¬
portion of gross national product will fall from its 1974-75 level of about
5‘5 Per cent to about 4-5 per cent over the next ten years. Except where other¬
wise indicated, the programmes and commitments outlined below are both
current and continuing.
POLICY
Britain’s basic security depends on the strength of the North Atlantic Alliance,
and it is to NATO that by far the greater part of Britain’s military forces is
committed. Britain makes a major contribution to the full range of deterrent
capabilities, both conventional and nuclear, required to maintain NATO’s
defensive posture. Within NATO, Britain plays an important part in the
efforts of the European members to assume, through closer co-operation, an
increasing responsibility for Western defence. In the Eurogroup Britain and
nine other European members are working to improve their contribution to
the Alliance and to achieve a more effective collective result from the avail¬
able resources. A major achievement was the European Defence Improve¬
ment Programme, launched in 1970, which provided $1,000 million over
five years for extra defence measures, including expenditure on additional
force improvements and a cash contribution towards the NATO Infrastruc¬
ture Fund. The sub-groups of the Eurogroup, each of which concentrates
on a specific area such as training, logistics and, most importantly, the pro¬
curement of equipment, make an important contribution towards the strength
of the Alliance by increasing co-operation among its members.
Britain is playing a major part in the efforts to reduce tension and achieve
more lasting peace in Europe, and is working to ensure that the agreements
with the Soviet Union and Eastern European countries on security and
co-operation in Europe, concluded in August 1975, and the related talks on
mutual and balanced force reductions will contribute to increased stability
and improved relations.

BRITAIN 1976: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Britain is a member of the Central Treaty Organisation (CENTO) and the
South-East Asia Treaty Organisation (SEATO) and participates with
Australia, New Zealand, Malaysia and Singapore in the Five-Power defence
arrangements in IVfalaysia and Singapore. Britain is also responsible for the
defence and internal security of its remaining dependencies. In addition, the
armed forces give extensive assistance to communities overseas, particularly
in such activities as disaster relief and development work.
Britain supports the peacekeeping and other efforts of the United Nations
supplying the largest national contingent to the UN Peace-Keeping Force in
Cyprus—and other international consultative authorities working to eliminate
the sources of tension and conflict between nations and to promote arms con¬
trol and disarmament. Britain played a leading part in the negotiations for the
Non-Proliferation Treaty and the Sea-Bed Treaty, and Britain’s proposal for
a convention for the prohibition of biological methods of warfare led to the
conclusion of a further international arms control agreement.
PLANNING AND CONTROL
Supreme responsibility for national defence rests with the Prime Minister and
the Cabinet, who are responsible to Parliament. The formulation of defence
policy is the responsibility of the Secretary of State for Defence. In recent
years the emphasis in defence organisation has been on increased central
policy control and the co-ordinated planning of the defence effort as a whole.

Miscellaneous expenditure and receipts - £32 million TOTAL £4,548 million
Note: Research and Development costs have been included, where possible, in relevant

The Ministry of Defence (see p. 48) ensures effective co-ordination on policy
and administration concerning the Services. The Secretary of State is assisted
by a Minister of State, and by three Under-Secretaries of State for the Navy,
Army and Air Force respectively. They, together with the Chief of the De¬
fence Staff, the three Service Chiefs of Staff, the Chief of Personnel and
Logistics, the Chief Scientific Adviser, the Chief Executive of the Procure¬
ment Executive and the Permanent Under-Secretary of State for Defence,
form the Defence Council, which deals with major defence policy under the

chairmanship of the Secretary of State. The Chiefs of Staff Committee,
comprising the Chief of the Defence Staff as chairman and the Chiefs of
Staff of the three Services, is responsible for giving professional advice on
strategy and operations, and on the military implications of defence policy.
The day-to-day management of the three Services is the responsibility of the
Admiralty, Army and Air Force Boards of the Defence Council.
Information about defence policy and the armed forces is provided in an
annual Statement on the Defence Estimates (Cmnd 5976 in 1975 published in
March). The defence estimates for i975_7^> I975 prices, totalled
£4,548 million, which represents about 575 per cent of the gross national
product. Of the total expenditure ^2,102 million (46 per cent) is on personnel
(pay, allowances, pensions), ^1,529 million (34 per cent) on equipment and
the remainder £9X7 rnillion (20 per cent) on works, lands, miscellaneous
stores and services. See also diagram on page opposite.
DEPLOYMENT
The basis of the present NATO strategy of flexible response, which retains
the principle of forward defence, is that credible deterrence of military actions
of all kinds is necessary. While NAT O must be ready to use nuclear weapons
if necessary, its conventional forces must be maintained to enable it to respond
to aggression at a variety of levels, providing an alternative to a nuclear
response against anything but a major attack, and thereby enabling it to gain
time for negotiations to end a conflict. The strategy requires a comprehensive
range of mobile and well-equipped conventional forces and tactical and
strategic nuclear weapons.
Britain makes a major contribution to the forces required by NATO’s present
strategy. The British Polaris force forms the contribution to the Western
strategic deterrent. \ irtually all ships of frigate size and above are earmarked
for assignment in an emergency to NATO. The Royal Navy also contributes
to NATO’s Standing Naval Force Atlantic, Standing Naval Force Channel,
and the Naval On Call Force Mediterranean. The British Army of the Rhine
(BAOR), an independent brigade in Berlin and RAF Germany are deployed in
the Federal Republic of Germany. BAOR is organised as a corps of three
divisions with five armoured brigades, one mechanised brigade and two
artillery brigades. Its peace-time strength of around 55,000 would be more
than doubled on mobilisation from Britain’s reserves (see p. 120). Royal Air
Force Germany is a tactical air force including strike/attack, reconnaissance,
close support and air-defence aircraft. In addition, most of the air and ground
combat units based in the United Kingdom have primary roles in support of
NATO, and provide an important part of NATO’s mobile reinforcement
capability. These include the ground elements of the United Kingdom Mobile
Force, and the British contribution to the Allied Command Europe Mobile
Force (Land). RAF Strike Command provides forces for strike/attack,
reconnaissance, close support, air defence and maritime patrol and anti¬
submarine warfare, together with transport forces and air elements for the
United Kingdom Mobile Force and Allied Command Europe Mobile Force
(Air).
At home a major task of the armed forces since 1969 has been to assist the
civil authorities in Northern Ireland in the maintenance of law and order, and
they have operated to counter the terrorist activities of extremist organisations.

BRITAIN 1976: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Britain continues to maintain forces in certain dependencies, such as Hong
Kong, Gibraltar, Belize, and the Falkland Islands and also at the sovereign
bases in Cyprus. The forces currently stationed in Malta are to be withdrawn
by 1979, and Britain’s naval presence in the Indian Ocean and the Caribbean
will be reduced by 1976, but occasional deployments from European waters
will continue. British forces in Singapore, apart from a small contribution to
the integrated air defence system of the Five-Power defence arrangements
(see p. 114), will also be withdrawn in 1976.
THE ARMED FORCES
Britain’s armed forces are organised on a tri-service basis, and consists of the
Royal Navy and Royal Marines, the Army and the Royal Air Force.
The Royal Navy has four main arms: the Naval General Service, which
mans and maintains the surface fleet; the Fleet Air Arm; the Submarine
Service; and the Royal Marines, who primarily provide an amphibious strik¬
ing-force. . . , ,
The Army is organised into some 30 arms and services which include the
Guards division and divisions of infantry, the Royal Armoured Corps, the
Royal Regiment of Artillery, the Household Cavalry, the Corps of Royal
Engineers, the Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers, the Royal Corps of
Signals, the Royal Corps of Transport, the Army Air Corps, the Royal Army
Ordnance Corps and the Royal Army Education Corps.
The Royal Air Force is organised in commands, on a functional basis at
home and on a geographical basis overseas. These comprise Strike Command
and Training and Support Commands, Royal Air Force Germany and
Near East Air Force. The Royal Navy has a unified sea command, Com-
mander-in-Chief, Fleet; shore commands have been reorganised under a
single Commander-in-Chief, Naval Home Command, Portsmouth with
subordinate area commands based at Plymouth, Chatham and Rosyth. At
home the Army is under a single command, United Kingdom Land Forces;
overseas commands are British Army of the Rhine, Near East Land Forces,
Land Forces Hong Kong, and British Troops Malta and Gibraltar.
The three women’s Services, the Women’s Royal Naval Service (WRNS), the
Women’s Royal Army Corps (WRAC) and the Women’s Royal Air Force
(WRAF), are integral parts of the armed forces, and servicewomen serve
alongside servicemen in Britain and overseas. Nursing services are provided by
Queen Alexandra’s Royal Naval Nursing Service, Queen Alexandra’s Royal
Army Nursing Corps and Princess Mary’s Royal Air Force Nursing Service.
Britain’s armed forces totalled 342,500 on 1st January 1975, 77T31
Royal Navy and Royal Marines, 169,089 in the Army and 96,301 in the Royal
Air Force. The forecast total for 1st April 1976 is 333,900, while for 1st April
1979 the forecast total is 321,000. Recruitment to the armed forces in 1974-75
totalled 42,236, an increase on the total for the previous year which had been
affected by the raising of the school-leaving age. The average number of
civilian staff expected to be employed by the Ministry of Defence during
I975-76 is 295,600. A functional analysis of personnel is shown in the
diagram on p. 117.
Britain’s armed forces consist entirely of personnel serving on a voluntary
basis. Engagements available to non-commissioned ranks range from three to

22 years, with a wide freedom of choice on the length and terms of service.
In 1972 a new type of engagement was introduced for non-commissioned
ranks of all three Services, under which recruits are committed for only a
minimum period of productive service (about three years) and, subject to that
minimum, may leave at any time at 18 months’ notice. Discharge may also be
granted on compassionate grounds, by purchase, or on grounds of conscience,
for which there is an independent tribunal to assess cases. Commissions may
be granted for short, medium and long terms. In all three Services there are

opportunities for promotion from the ranks, and almost half of each year’s
officer intake is on such promotion. Entry to commissioned ranks is on the
basis of educational and other qualifications (O and A levels and their equiva¬
lents or degrees): all three Services have schemes for university cadetships
which enable young men to take a degree before commencing their training.
Entrants to non-commissioned ranks are given basic training, and further and
specialist training is given during the course of their careers. Young service¬
men are encouraged to study for secondary educational qualifications, all three
Services providing extensive facilities for the consolidation and development
of Service personnel’s education. Trade and technical training, though pri¬
marily designed for Service purposes, leads for about half the total number of
servicemen to nationally recognised qualifications including qualification for
membership of trade unions.
Service technical training is highly valued in industry, which is a significant
advantage on return to civilian life. To assist such resettlement the Services
provide an advisory service, familiarisation attachments to civilian organisa¬
tions and, for those without technical qualifications, opportunity and assistance
to study for suitable civilian qualifications.
Entrants to commissioned ranks receive initial training at the Britannia
Royal Naval College Dartmouth, the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst, the
Royal Air Force College Cranwell or similar institutions. This is followed by
specialist training, often including degree courses at university or Service
establishments.
Staff training is provided by the Royal Naval Staff College, Greenwich, the
Army Staff College at Camberley, and the Royal Air Force Staff College at
Bracknell. The National Defence College at Latimer is designed to provide

mid-career officers with training for posts involving inter-Service staff work.
Specially selected and more senior officers from the Services, the Civil
Service, and from the Commonwealth, the United States, and allied Euro¬
pean countries attend the Royal College of Defence Studies (formerly the
Imperial Defence College) in London, which provides the wider background
necessary for senior posts in the direction of defence.
Considerable operational training is done through Joint-Service and inter¬
allied exercises. All three Services provide training facilities for the armed
forces of allied and Commonwealth countries.
Combat forces are functionally divided as the nuclear strategic force (costing
an estimated £58 million in i975-76)> Royal Navy general purpose combat
forces (£632 million), European theatre ground forces (£826 million), other
Army combat forces (£88 million) and Royal Air Force general purpose
forces (£874 million).
The British contribution to the Western strategic deterrent is provided by the
Royal Navy’s force of four Polaris nuclear submarines—itoo/wf/on, Repulse,
Renown and Revenge. Each has indefinite underwater cruising range and is
equipped with 16 Polaris missiles with a range of about 2,800 miles and carry¬
ing thermonuclear warheads.
The naval general purpose combat forces comprise amphibious and naval air
forces, submarines (excluding the Polaris force), helicopter-cruisers, des¬
troyers, frigates, and mine countermeasure forces and support and other ships.
The following section contains detail of some of the equipment of these forces.
The aircraft carrier Ark Royal operates Phantom and Buccaneer strike aircraft,
Gannet airborne early warning aircraft and Sea King anti-submarine heli¬
copters. Amphibious forces are provided by the commando ships Bulwark
and Hermes and the assault ships Fearless and Intrepid. (This capability
is to be reduced in 1976 to the two assault ships, only one of which will be
operational at any time, while Hermes, which will be transferred to anti¬
submarine duties, will retain a secondary role as a commando ship.) The
command-helicopter-cruisers Blake and Tiger Aso carry Sea King helicopters
and are responsible for directing and controlling naval forces. There are also
eight County class guided missile destroyers equipped with Seaslug and Seacat
surface-to-air missile systems; three of them have also been fitted with the
Exocet surface-to-surface guided missile system. The Type 82 guided missile
destroyer Bristol is equipped with the Seadart area air defence missile system
and the Ikara anti-submarine guided weapon system. Sheffield, first of the new
class of Type 42 Seadart destroyers, and three of the Amazon class Type 21
frigates, have recently entered service. There are also 26 Leander class
and seven Tribal class general purpose frigates, three anti-aircraft frigates,
four aircraft-direction frigates, 15 anti-submarine frigates, and the diesel
frigate Mermaid. The frigate classes are variously armed with automatic guns,
surface-to-air missile systems, underwater detection and anti-submarine
weapons. Most have the Wasp helicopter embarked which will in due course
be replaced, where appropriate, by the Lynx. The balance of the Fleet is
made up of the mine-sweeper and mine-hunter forces, patrol vessels, survey
and trials ships. Under construction is the Invincible, We first of a new class!
of cruiser, which will be equipped to operate Sea King helicopters and will
have the optional capability of operating maritime vertical short-take-off and

landing aircraft. In addition five of the new Sheffield class Type 42 Seadart
destroyers and five of the Amazon class Type 21 frigates are building. The
first of a new class of frigate, Type 22, to be armed with the iSeazco/f surface-
to-air missile system, has been ordered and work is in hand on a new class of
mine counter-measure vessel in glass reinforced plastics.
Besides the four Polaris submarines (see above) there are eight nuclear-
powered fleet submarines in service together with 20 conventional patrol
submarines. A further three nuclear submarines are under construction.
Tankers and store ships of the Royal Fleet Auxiliary Service provide world¬
wide afloat logistic support.
The European theatre ground forces consist of the BAOR, and the forces
stationed in Britain, the main elements of which have primary roles in support
of NATO (see p. 115).
This category comprises land forces stationed abroad to meet treaty commit¬
ments to Commonwealth and other countries (see p. 114).
Some of the equipment of this and the previous category is described below.
Armoured regiments are equipped with the Chieftain main battle tank and the
Swingfire long-range anti-tank guided missile. Armoured reconnaissance
regiments are now equipped with the Scorpion, mounting a 76-mm gun, the
first member of the new tracked combat reconnaissance vehicle series to come
into service. Another, the Scimitar, mounting a 30-mm gun, will come into ser¬
vice at the end of 1975. The primary tracked armoured personnel carriers used
by mechanised infantry battalions is the FV 432, some of which are fitted with
81-mm mortars or Wombat 120-mm anti-tank guns. Artillery units are
equipped with the Abbot 105-mm gun, 155-mm and 175-mm self-propelled
guns, and Field Artillery Computer Equipment (FACE). Tactical nuclear
support is provided by the Honest John missile and the 203-mm self-propelled
howitzer. Air defence is provided by the Thunderbird mobile surface-to-air
missile system and by the L 40/70 gun which is now being replaced by the
Rapier low-level surface-to-air missile system.
The Royal Air Force general purpose forces consist of aircraft for air defence,
strike/attack, reconnaissance, offensive support and tactical reconnaissance,
maritime patrol and anti-submarine warfare, transport and in-flight refuelling
together with RAF Regiment field squadrons.
Lightning and Phantom FGi and FGR2 aircraft, together with Bloodhound,
Tiger cat and Rapier surface-to-air missiles are employed in air defence.
Reporting and control is provided by the computerised Linesman system,
and a number of Shackletons have been converted to provide airborne early
warning over the sea. Jaguars, Vulcans, Buccaneers and Phantom FGRzs
operate in the strike/attack role. The primary role of some of the strike/attack
and air defence aircraft is the shore-based protection of naval forces at sea.
Vulcans, Canberras and Phantom FGRzs are employed in the reconnaissance
role; Harrier V/STOL aircraft and Jaguars for offensive support (the Harrier
also having a tactical reconnaissance capability); and Nimrods in maritime
patrol and anti-submarine warfare. With the introduction of the Jaguar in
the strike/attack, reconnaissance and offensive support roles which began in
I974- the Phantom FGRzs are being gradually transferred to air defence,
where they will largely replace the Lightnings.

Strategic transport support is provided by Belfast, VCio and, for the present,
Britannia aircraft. The Hercules, which also has a strategic capability is used
for tactical transport support over medium ranges. For short-range tasks the
Wessex and Puma helicopters are available. A force of Victor tanker aircraft
provides in-flight refuelling which gives added range and flexibility to
operations of air defence, maritime strike and other aircraft.
Reserve and auxiliary forces are an integral part of the armed forces. Apart
from their essential military role—to supplement the regular forces in time of
war or emergency with trained personnel able immediately to take their places
in the Services either as formed units or as individual reinforcements—they
form an important link between the Services and the civil community. Some
of their members have a reserve liability following a period of regular service j
(regular reserve): others are volunteer men and women who devote their spare
time to training for the roles they would undertake in war or an emergency. On
1 st January 1975 regular reserves totalled 168,000 and volunteer reserves and
auxiliary forces 69,700. Cadet forces, which make a significant contribution to I
recruitment to the regular forces, totalled 130,500.
The regular reserve consists of various categories of former full-time officers
and ratings liable to recall in emergency, including the Royal Fleet Reserve :
of men with recent experience of active service. The volunteer reserves com¬
prise the Royal Naval Reserve, with its associated women’s reserve, and the
Royal Marines Reserve. Both carry out regular part-time training, the former
to man a number of operational minesweepers and support maritime and other
headquarters, the latter to reinforce the regular corps and in particular the
Royal Marine Commandos.
The Army reserves comprise the individual reserves of ex-regular service¬
men and the Territorial and Army Volunteer Reserve (TAVR).
The TAVR’s primary role is to reinforce the ground forces committed to
NATO and to assist in maintaining a secure United Kingdom base in support
of the forces deployed in Europe. It consists of independent units, organised
on a local basis with regular Army and permanent civilian staff, and sponsored
units of specialists recruited on a country-wide basis. They are liable for call¬
out in an emergency. There is also a number of miscellaneous units (including
university officer-training corps) and pools of individuals (known as Group B)
which have a variety of functions.
The Ulster Defence Regiment is a locally recruited, part-time force designed
to support the regular forces in their security tasks in Northern Ireland.
The Royal Air Force Reserve consists of former regular officers and personnel
with a reserve liability, and the Royal Air Force Volunteer Reserve, which
includes the 16 university air squadrons. The Royal Auxiliary Air Force
consists of maritime headquarter units which would support regular forma¬
tions in an emergency.
Civil defence arrangements are principally based on the extended and adapted
use of existing public services operated by nationalised industries, by local
authorities, police authorities and government departments. Supplementary
effort from individual volunteers and voluntary organisations would be brought
in either at the discretion of local authorities or in response to a national appeal
DEFENCE

in time of crisis. A central point of recent policy has been to improve the pre¬
paredness of local government to meet a war emergency; there is much
common ground between such planning and the preparations and organisation
for a major peace-time emergency or national disaster. Activities have therefore
also been directed towards creating a closer relationship in local planning for
the different emergencies of peace and war.
Within an annual budget of ^12 million emphasis is placed on a high level
of central and local government planning. Studies and seminars are arranged
by the Home Office on staff college lines.
Arrangements also include an emergency system for decentralised govern¬
mental control and communications. The United Kingdom Warning and
Monitoring Organisation, including the civilian Royal Observer Corps, is
organised to provide public warning of an attack, of the location and power of
nuclear explosions, and of the distribution and level of radioactive fall-out.
DEFENCE PROCUREMENT
Responsibility for the procurement (that is, research, development and pro¬
duction) of defence equipment, including aircraft, ships, ordnance, guided
weapons and electronics, lies with the Procurement Executive within the
Ministry of Defence. The Executive was set up in August 1971 following a
reorganisation of the departments responsible for defence procurement and
civil aerospace. The main objectives of the reorganisation have been to estab¬
lish a closer liaison between the Service users and the machinery for
procurement, closer co-ordination with industry in the formulation of
programmes, and stronger and more accountable management, so ensuring
a co-ordinated and cost-effective approach.
Research The major part of research is undertaken by the Ministry of Defence’s
and Development research and development establishments, but the Ministry also sponsors a
substantial amount of research by industry and the universities. The research
and development establishments have a very wide technological capability,
which has civil as well as military applications c for example, support is given
to civil aerospace projects such as Concorde and advanced aero-engines. On the
development side, the establishments collaborate closely with the Ministry’s
contractors by monitoring their progress, assisting in testing programmes, and
in solving particular technical problems.
Modern defence equipment is becoming ever more complex, and its
development requires a high initial investment; in 1975-76 the total cost of
British equipment research and development is estimated at £554 million.
The search for a more efficient use of these resources has caused attention to
be concentrated on collaborative projects, which enable the cost of develop¬
ment and production to be shared. On occasions, the outright purchase of
foreign equipment is the most economical solution. Nevertheless, the im¬
portance of maintaining a sound national industrial base for defence procure¬
ment is recognised, and there is close consultation between government and
industry both in the National Defence Industries Council and through other
specialised machinery.
Collaboration between Britain and European countries is already extensive,
and may be expected to increase, particularly through the work of the Euro¬
group (see p. 113). The most important single project, the multi-role combat
aircraft, is being developed by Britain, Italy and the Federal Republic of
Germany. A number of Anglo-French projects—the Jaguar aircraft, the

Republic are studying the possible collaborative development of a future
main battle tank. Britain and Belgium are partners in a programme for the
development and production of a family of tracked combat reconnaissance
vehicles.
Britain has also co-operated with Australia on the Ikara anti-submarine
equipment.
Equipment collaboration also facilitates joint logistic support and training
arrangements, like those being discussed between Britain and four other
European countries who have agreed to purchase the Lance surface-to-
surface missile system from the United States.
A considerable number of projects, covering all the main equipment areas, are
under development. They include the Hawk jet trainer, the Rapier low-level
surface-to-air guided weapon system, the Sea Wolf short-range surface-to-air
guided missile, navigation and attack systems for aircraft, radar, sonar and
communications systems, the anti-submarine cruiser, and a new range of
logistic vehicles for battlefield support.
Following the development of defence equipment, either nationally or in
co-operation with allies, production is usually undertaken by private industry
on a contract basis or by the Royal Ordnance Factories and Royal Dockyards.
Production may also be undertaken on a collaborative basis. The Defence
Sales organisation provides support, assistance and advice to British industry
and the Royal Ordnance Factories in promoting the sales of defence equip¬
ment overseas. In 1975-76 the value of exports of British defence equipment
is expected to be in excess of £560 million.
6 Social Welfare
Voluntary
Organisations
STATE AND VOLUNTARY SERVICES
Central and local government are responsible for a wide range of health and
social services. Central government is responsible directly for social security,
including family allowances, national insurance and financial help to those in
special need. It is also responsible for all health services and the health
authorities and boards which administer these services are its agents. It has
a certain overall indirect responsibility for many local authority services.
Local authorities are directly responsible for education (see Chapter 7) and
housing (see Chapter 9) and for a variety of personal social services (all de¬
scribed in this chapter). They also have certain responsibilities regarding
environmental health. Public expenditure on health and personal social
services is given on pp. 360-1.
The publicly provided services are supplemented by those provided by
voluntary organisations and by individual volunteers. Voluntary organisations,
especially the Churches, were the pioneers of nearly all the social services.
They provided schools, hospitals, clinics, dispensaries, and social and recrea¬
tional clubs before these were provided by the state. They made themselves
responsible for the welfare of the very young and the very old, the homeless
and the handicapped. Gradually the state accepted the primary responsibility
for the major services, supplementing the voluntary services and developing
a comprehensive structure that ensured a minimum standard of living and
well-being for all citizens.
State and voluntary social services are now complementary and co-operative.
Both central and local authorities make grants to the voluntary agencies.
Public authorities plan and carry out their duties taking account of the volun¬
tary help available and co-operating with the voluntary agencies, which have
specialised in meeting particular needs, while the residential provision made by
public authorities for the care of children, the chronic sick, the mentally ill or
handicapped, the disabled and the aged is supplemented by voluntary homes
of various types.
In England and Wales the Charity Commission, a government department,
gives free advice to trustees of charities, making schemes to modify their pur¬
poses or facilitate their administration when necessary; it maintains central
and local registers of charities which are open to public inspection; and it
investigates and checks abuses, though it has no power to act in the adminis¬
tration of a charity.
Co-ordination of government interests in voluntary social service is the
responsibility of the Home Office in England and Wales and of the Scottish
Office in Scotland. The Volunteer Centre, a national centre for information
and research on voluntary work, was established in London in 1973 with the
aid of a government grant. Its initial focus is on the health and social services.
The number of voluntary organisations in Britain runs into thousands; they
range from national organisations to small individual local groups. Most
organisations, however, are members of larger associations or are represented
on local or national co-ordinating councils or committees. Some are chiefly
124
BRITAIN 1976: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
concerned with giving personal service, others in the formation of public
opinion and exchange of information.
Organisations concerned with personal and family problems include the
voluntary family casework agencies like the Family Welfare Association,
Family Service Units, and the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty
to Children; marriage guidance centres affiliated to the National Marriage
Guidance Council; the National Council of \oluntary Child Care Organisa- j
tions; the National Council for One-Parent Families; and the Samaritans,
who help people near to committing suicide.
Community service of many kinds is given by young people, particularly
those belonging to a number of national and local organisations, for example,
the Young Volunteer Force Foundation, Community Service Volunteers,
Task Force, Scouts, Girl Guides and school groups.
Voluntary service to the sick and disabled in general is given by—among
others—the British Red Cross Society, the St. John Ambulance Association
and Brigade, the Women’s Royal Voluntary Service and the Leagues of
Hospital Friends, but a number of societies exist to help people with particular
disabilities and difficulties. Such societies, some of which are constituent
members of the Central Council for the Disabled, include the Royal National
Institute for the Blind, the Royal National Institute for the Deaf, MIND
(National Association for Mental Health), the National Society for Mentally
Handicapped Children, the Spastics Society, Alcoholics Anonymous, Age
Concern, Help the Aged and their Scottish equivalents.
Bodies working on a national scale whose work is specifically religious in
inspiration include the Salvation Army, the Church Army, Toe H, the Com¬
mittee on Social Service of the Church of Scotland, the Church of England
Children’s Society, the Church of England Council for Social Work, the
Young Men’s Christian Association, the Young Women s Christian Associa¬
tion, the Society of Friends, the Catholic Marriage Advisory Council and the
Jewish Welfare Board.
A wide range of voluntary personal service is given by the Women s Royal
Voluntary Service, which gives help in every kind of practical difficulty, brings
‘meals on wheels’ to housebound invalids and old people, provides flatlets
and residential clubs for the elderly, helps with family problems and assists in
hospitals and clinics, as well as doing relief work in emergencies.
The main voluntary body in England and Wales providing central links
between voluntary organisations and official bodies concerned with social
service is the National Council of Social Service, which brings together most
of the principal voluntary agencies for consultation and joint action, either as a
whole or in groups of those concerned with particular aspects, such as youth
work or work among the handicapped. There are also the Scottish Council of
Social Service and the Northern Ireland Council of Social Service, which
perform similar functions. The Citizens’ Advice Bureaux, of which there are
now some 670 in Britain, are steadily increasing in number. The primary role
of the bureaux is to give explanation and advice to the citizen who is in doubt
about his rights or who does not know about the state or voluntary services
which could help him.
URBAN PROGRAMME
A four-year urban programme providing for government-aided local authority
expenditure was launched in 1968 to assist areas of special social need, in
particular to relieve problems resulting from overcrowding, inadequate
SOCIAL WELFARE
I25
housing and schools and other forms of deprivation. In 1970 the programme
was extended to I97^ with total expenditure for the period 1968-76 of ^60
million to ^65 million. Projects approved include advice and information
centres, community centres, language teaching schools for immigrants and
other educational projects, nursery and day centres, schemes to train child
minders, schemes for old people, summer holiday schemes for deprived
children and schemes to assist maltreated women (‘battered wives’). A parti¬
cular aim of the programme is to support the work of voluntary bodies.
An experiment in community development is also being undertaken by the
Government in ten areas, mainly situated in declining inner city districts.
Local projects comprise action and research teams who analyse the needs of
their areas, co-operate with statutory and voluntary agencies in promoting
experimental programmes, encourage participation by local residents, and
make recommendations for changes in policy and administration where
appropriate.
SOCIAL SECURITY
National insurance, industrial injuries insurance, family allowances, family
income supplements and supplementary benefits together with (in a special
category) war pensions constitute a comprehensive system of social security in
the United Kingdom.
The Department of Health and Social Security administers these services
in Great Britain; within the department, the Supplementary Benefits Com¬
mission is responsible for the system of supplementary benefits. In Northern
Ireland the first five of these schemes are administered by the Department of
Health and Social Services which contains the Supplementary Benefits Com¬
mission for Northern Ireland. Pensions and welfare services for war pensioners
and their dependants are the responsibility of the Department of Health and
Social Security throughout the United Kingdom. Appeals relating to claims
for the various benefits are decided by independent authorities.
Although the development of public provision for social security in Britain
can be traced back for several centuries (one major early statute was the 1601
Poor Relief Act in England and Wales), the modern social security system
is a creation of the twentieth century. In 1908 non-contributory old age
pensions were introduced and the first contributory pensions for old people,
widows and orphans came in 1926. A contributory scheme of health and
unemployment insurance was passed by Parliament in 1911, unemployment
insurance being extended in 1920 to cover the great majority of employees.
Although Britain’s social security provision was among the best in the world
by the beginning of the second world war, it lacked co-ordination because of
its piecemeal development and not everyone came within its scope.
In the immediate postwar years a series of Acts established the main features
of a comprehensive social security system which became operative (together
with a National Health Service) in July 1948. In 1961 an earnings-related
supplement to retirement pension was started, based on graduated contribu¬
tions, and this principle was extended in 1966 to unemployment and sickness
benefit; in April 1975 the supplement became payable with maternity allow¬
ance. In the 1970s new benefits were added including pensions for elderly
people who were over pension age when the national insurance scheme
started, pensions for widows aged between 40 and 50 when widowed or when
entitlement to widowed mother’s allowance ended and old persons’ pensions
payable to persons aged 80 and over.
126
BRITAIN 1976: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Increased provision has been made for the chronic sick and disabled, in
1971 an invalidity pension was introduced for those who had received sickness
benefit for six months with an additional invalidity allowance for people
becoming chronically sick more than five years before retirement age. This
was followed in the same year by an attendance allowance for severely dis¬
abled people needing attention or supervision by day and at night, the scheme
being extended in 1973 with a lower rate for those needing attendance by day
or at night. Social security provision was extended to further groups of dis¬
abled people by the Social Security Benefits Act 1975. Statutory provision
for the war disabled goes back to the end of the sixteenth century, but
the main lines of the present war pensions scheme were laid down during |
the first world war with further developments during and after the second
world war.
Family allowances and national insurance benefits or allowances, other than J
maternity, unemployment, sickness, invalidity, injury or disablement benefit, j
are included in the taxable income on which income tax is assessed. On the j
other hand various income tax reliefs and exemptions are allowed on account
of age or liability for the support of dependants. Family income supplement,
attendance allowances and war disablement pensions are not taxable.
Types of Benefit There are three kinds of social security benefit: those paid in return for
contributions to the national insurance scheme (for example, retirement
pensions, sickness and unemployment benefits, maternity benefits, widows’
benefits and industrial injuries benefits); non-contributory benefits paid to
certain groups of people regardless of income (for example, family allowances,
attendance allowances and old persons’ pensions); and supplementary benefit
(also non-contributory) for people not in full-time work with incomes below
specified levels. Family income supplement is payable to low wage earners
with children to support.
NATIONAL The Social Security Acts apply, in general, to everyone over minimum
INSURANCE school-leaving age living in Great Britain. There are similar schemes in
Northern Ireland and the Isle of Man.
The national insurance scheme provides benefits in specified contingencies
where contribution conditions have been fulfilled. The benefits are paid for
partly by contributions from individuals, partly by contributions of employers
in respect of their employees, and partly by a contribution made by t e
Treasury out of general taxation.
Contributors and Under the new contribution arrangements which came into force in April
Contributions 1975, there are four classes of national insurance contribution. Class 1 is paid
by employed people, Classes 2 and 4 by self-employed people, and Class 3 by
voluntary contributors. The Class 1 contribution (which includes a small
contribution towards the cost of the National Health Service) is earnings- ]
related and amounts to 5-5 per cent of earnings up to £69 a week provided
that these are at least £11 a week. The employer’s contribution per employee
is 8-5 per cent over the same earnings range. Married women and most widows
(if employed) can pay full contributions or may opt to pay 2 per cent. If they
pay the lower contribution they rely on their husband’s (or late husband s)
insurance for maternity grant, retirement pension (at a lower rate), widow s
benefit and death grant. The contributions are deducted at source through the
‘Pay as You Earn’ income tax system. Table 6 below shows examples ol
contributions payable.

The self-employed pay a flat-rate Class 2 contribution of £2-41 a week (^2-io
for women) and, in addition, may have to pay a Class 4 contribution amount¬
ing to 8 per cent of net profits or gains between^i,6ooand^3,6ooayear. Self-
employed married women and widows must pay any Class 4 contribution
due but they have a choice whether or not to pay a Class 2 contribution.
There is also a Class 3 flat-rate contribution of ^1-90 paid voluntarily by
employed earners or others who wish to complete a contribution record to
safeguard entitlement to retirement pension and a limited range of other
benefits. Class 2 and Class 3 contributions are paid by means of stamps bought
from a post office which are affixed to a national insurance contribution card
or by direct debit of a bank or National Giro account.
Certain people are excepted from paying contributions. An employed
person ceases to be liable for contributions at the age of 70 for a man and 65
for a woman, or when he retires after reaching pensionable age (65 for a man
and 60 for a woman). Self-employed people with earnings below a certain
level may seek exception from contributions.
The graduated pension scheme initiated in 1961 ceased to operate from
April 1975 but entitlement to pension on the basis of contributions paid
between 1961 and April 1975 remains.
The national insurance scheme provides payments to contributors in the
event of unemployment (if normally working for an employer), sickness (if
normally working for an employer or self-employed), and confinement and
the weeks immediately before and after (for women normally working for an
employer or self-employed and paying national insurance contributions at the
full rate). Retirement pensions are paid to people who have reached 65 (60 for
women) if they have retired from regular work and from the age of 70 (65 for
women) even if they continue to work; people aged 80 and over who have not
participated in the scheme are eligible for an old person’s pension. Widows
normally receive benefit in the first 26 weeks after bereavement and subse¬
quently while they have young children or if they have reached the age of 40
when widowed or before their children have grown up; and there are two
kinds of allowance in respect of orphan children where a widow’s pension is
not payable. The scheme also provides lump-sum cash grants for two expen¬
sive contingencies—the birth of a child and a death. The benefit rates shown
below are applicable from 17th November 1975.
For most of the benefits there are two contribution conditions. First, before
benefit can be paid at all, a minimum number of contributions must actually
have been paid since entry into insurance; secondly, the full rate of benefit
cannot be paid unless a specified number of contributions have been paid or
credited over a specified period. There are special rules to help a widow who
does not become entitled to a widow’s pension at widowhood or when her
children have grown up, to qualify for sickness or unemployment benefit in

the period before she can have established or re-established herself in insur¬
ance through her own contributions; there are also provisions to help a
divorced woman who was not paying contributions during her marriage.

The standard flat-rate benefit for single men and women is 1-10 a week for
unemployment or sickness, while for invalidity, widows and retirement
pensions it is £13-30. Benefit, other than invalidity pension for those under
retirement pension age, may be reduced if insufficient contributions have been
paid, but is not affected by other unearned income or the previous level of
earnings. Earnings received while the benefit is in payment, however, may
cause its reduction or withdrawal: unemployment benefit cannot be paid to a
person earning more than a specified amount from a subsidiary occupation;
retirement pensioners under the age of 70 (65 for women) have their pensions
reduced in step with earnings over certain specified amounts; sickness and
invalidity benefits, though not affected by continued payment of wages during
illness, are not normally payable to a person doing any actual work. Widows’
benefits, however, are not affected by earnings. Exceptions to the basic flat
rates are the higher rate of £18-60 a week payable to widows during the first 26
weeks after bereavement, the increased retirement pension earned by some¬
one who has continued at work and paid contributions beyond minimum
pension age and the invalidity allowance paid in addition to invalidity pension
to people becoming chronically sick more than five years before pension age;
and the lower rate of £7-80 a week unemployment or sickness benefit payable
to married women who pay contributions and the rates for widows between
40 and 50 which reduce on a scale to £3-99 a week for a woman aged 40 at
the date of entitlement. The rate at which invalidity allowance is payable
depends upon the age at which incapacity begins; it ranges between £0-85
and £2-80.
Additions to benefits are payable for dependants. For invalidity and retire¬
ment pensions the additions are £7-90 for a wife or other adult dependant and,
for these pensions and for widow’s benefit, £6-50 for each child inclusive of
family allowances. For other benefits the additions are less—£6-90 for an adult
and £3-50 for each child, inclusive of family allowances.

A guardian’s allowance of £6-50 a week is payable to a person who has in
his or her family a child who has lost both parents, one of whom was insured
under the Social Security Acts. The allowance can sometimes be paid
on the death of one parent. For certain fatherless children there is a child’s
special allowance also of ^6-50 a week inclusive of family allowances; this is
payable to a woman whose marriage has been dissolved or annulled and who
has not remarried, if her former husband dies and she has a child to whose
support he was contributing before he died.
The graduated addition to retirement pension is at the rate of £o-oz\ a
week for each ^7-50 of all graduated contributions paid by a man and for each
£9 of such graduated contributions paid by a woman between 1961 and April
I975 (with, in each case, the matching amount of graduated contribution
coming from the employer). The earnings-related supplements to flat-rate
unemployment and sickness benefits and maternity allowance amount to
one-third of that part of a person’s average weekly earnings between j£io
and £3° and I5 Per cent of that part between £30 and £54 but the supple¬
ments cannot raise the total benefit, including increases for dependants,
beyond 85 per cent of the average weekly earnings on which the supplement
is based. An earnings-related addition based on the late husband’s earnings
may also be paid with the widow’s allowance to widows under 60 at widow¬
hood or to widows whose husbands were not entitled to a retirement pension
at time of death.
A £25 maternity grant is payable for a confinement and a further £25 for
each additional child born at the same confinement living 12 hours after birth;
while a £30 death grant is payable on the death of an adult insured person or
certain close relatives of the insured person (less for a child, or for an adult
who was within ten years of minimum pension age when the scheme started).
In general, national insurance payments are paid as long as the situation
requiring them lasts. However, unemployment benefit is payable for a maxi¬
mum of one year. The earnings-related supplement to unemployment and
sickness benefit is paid for a maximum of six months starting from the thir¬
teenth day of unemployment or incapacity for work. Maternity allowance
G£ii-io a week) normally begins 11 weeks before the expected week of con¬
finement and ends six weeks after the expected week or the actual confine¬
ment if this is later.
Similarly, a widowed mother’s allowance at the full rate ceases when her
children are no longer dependent on her, though a widow can continue to
receive £13-30 a week for herself while she has living with her a son or daughter
under 19. The widow’s pension payable to the childless widow, provided she
is 40 or over at the time of being widowed, or the similar pension payable to
the widowed mother who has reached 40 before her widowed mother’s allow¬
ance ends, normally continues until she has reached minimum pension age
(provided she does not remarry before that age) and retired, or at most till the
age of 65. On retirement she receives a pension at a rate not lower than her
widow’s pension.
The industrial injuries insurance scheme, which, in 1948, replaced the work¬
men’s compensation scheme (first introduced by the Workmen’s Compensa¬
tion Act of 1897), provides benefits for personal injuries caused by accidents
arising out of, and in the course of, employment, and for prescribed diseases
due to the nature of employment. It covers practically everyone liable to pay
Class 1 contributions and certain others. Before April 1975 industrial injuries
benefit was paid from a fund separate from the national insurance fund. In

April both funds were amalgamated. There are therefore no separate contri¬
butions for industrial injuries benefit.
Injury benefit for an adult is £13-85 a week plus ^6-90 for an adult dependant,
and £3-50 for each child inclusive of family allowances. It is paid when the
insured person is incapable of work as a result of an industrial accident or
prescribed disease, and payment can continue for a maximum of 26 weeks
beginning on the date of the accident or development of the disease. A person
entitled to sickness benefit who draws injury benefit instead, also receives any
earnings-related supplement (see p. 129) to which he is entitled.
Disablement benefit may be paid (but not at the same time as injury benefit)
when, as the result of industrial accident or prescribed disease, there is a loss
of physical or mental faculty. The amount depends on the extent of the
disablement as assessed by a medical board; it varies from £21-80 for too per
cent disablement to £4-36 a week for 20 per cent disablement, but for disable¬
ment of less than 20 per cent a gratuity is normally paid.
In certain circumstances disablement benefit may be supplemented as
follows: unemployability supplement, at the weekly rate of £13-30; constant
attendance allowance of up to £8-70 weekly normally, or a special rate of
£13-05 or £i7'4° a week in exceptionally severe cases; an allowance of £8-70
a week for exceptionally severe disablement; a special hardship allowance of
up to £8-72 for a person who is unfit to return to his regular job or to do work
of an equivalent standard; and hospital treatment allowance which raises the
benefit to that for a 100 per cent assessment during hospital treatment for the
industrial disability. Increases of disablement pension for dependants are
payable with unemployability supplement. People receiving unemployability
supplement may also receive an additional allowance similar to invalidity
allowance (see p. 128).
If the accident or disease results in the insured person’s death, death benefit
may be paid to the dependants.
For a widow a pension of £18-60 a week is payable for the first 26 weeks of
widowhood. In addition she receives any earnings-related supplement (see p.
129) that would have been paid had she claimed widow’s allowance under the
main national insurance scheme. Thereafter, the widow can receive a pension
of £13-85 a week if she was aged 50 at the date of her husband’s death, or has
dependent children or other special needs; otherwise she receives £3-99 a week.
If she had been living apart from her husband, a pension is payable only if she
was receiving or entitled to receive at least £0-25 a week for her maintenance
from him.
In addition allowances are paid for children under the family allowances
age limits at the higher rate of £6-50 to widows but at the lower rate of £3'5°
for other beneficiaries.
Certain other dependants, such as parents and other relatives, may be
entitled to pensions, allowances or gratuities.
Family allowances are provided in Great Britain under the Family Allow¬
ances Act 1965 (which consolidated the Acts of 1945-64) and in Northern
Ireland by separate legislation. They are paid in Great Britain to about 4-4
million families with over 6-9 million children and in Northern Ireland to
some 142,000 families. The rate of the allowance is £1-5° f°r each child in a
family other than the first. They are payable to families with two or more

children who are under minimum school-leaving age (or under 19 and either
in full-time education or apprentices with low earnings).
Allowances are paid from the Treasury and their object is to benefit the
family as a whole; they may be drawn by the wife or husband but they belong
in law to the wife who must claim them. Although the allowances are non¬
contributory, there are certain residence conditions.
A pension of ^5'15 f°r a niarried woman and ^8’15 for any other person
(including an age addition of £,0-25) is payable (subject to conditions of
residence in Britain) to people over 80 years old who were excluded from
the national insurance scheme when it started or who failed to qualify for
a retirement pension or qualified for one at a lower rate.
An attendance allowance of ^lo-bo a week is paid to severely disabled people
requiring a great deal of attention from another person by day and at night.
A lower rate of ^y^io may be paid to those who need help either by day or
night.
Other non-contributory benefits for the disabled are being introduced. In
November 1975 a new invalidity pension of £j'go becomes payable to people
of working age unable to work and not qualifying for the national insurance
invalidity pension because they had not paid sufficient contributions. The
Government is also to extend this benefit to disabled housewives who are
incapable of work and unable to perform their normal household tasks.
Another allowance to be introduced is a weekly invalidity care allowance
for those people who cannot go out to work because they are caring for a
severely disabled relative receiving an attendance allowance. It is hoped to
introduce it in ityjb—yy. In addition the Government is proposing the intro¬
duction (over a three-year period from 1976) of a mobility allowance for
severely disabled people (aged between 5 and 65) who are unable, or virtually
unable, to walk. This will assist all severely disabled people in their transport
costs as under the present system only certain classes of disabled people able
to drive a vehicle receive transport help in the form either of a car or three¬
wheeled vehicle or an allowance towards the cost of running a private car.
The Supplementary Benefits Act 1966 provides for a scheme of supplemen¬
tary benefits which is administered by a Supplementary Benefits Commission
within the Department of Health and Social Security. There is a similar
commission in Northern Ireland.
Every person in Great Britain aged 16 or over who is not in full-time work,
attending school or involved in a trade dispute and whose resources are
insufficient to meet his requirements is entitled to a supplementary benefit.
The benefit takes the form of a supplementary allowance for people under the
minimum retirement age, and a supplementary pension for those over. The
benefit is the amount by which a person’s requirements exceed his available
resources, both being defined by rules laid down by the Act. The calculation
of requirements is based on different amounts for single people and family
groups (for blind people there are special higher amounts) with, in each case,
an addition for rent. For the old and most other long-term cases a higher long¬
term scale rate is payable. Where there are exceptional circumstances, extra
help may be given through an addition to the weekly benefit. A single payment of
benefit may be made to meet an exceptional need. Available resources include

payments from a husband or the father of the claimant’s children are taken
into account in full but some part of most other resources is disregarded.
The payment of a supplementary allowance in the case of an able-bodied
person of working age may be conditional on registering for employment at
a local office of the Employment Service Agency.
The Supplementary Benefits Commission also has a duty to influence people
without a settled way of living to lead a more normal life. The commission
provides temporary accommodation for them in 23 reception centres, three of
which are administered by local authorities on behalf of the commission. For
men who have been unemployed for long periods and who are receiving
supplementary allowances or are using reception centres, it runs 15 re¬
establishment centres, three of which have residential accommodation where
they are given help to fit them again for work.
Family Income Supplement provides a cash benefit for families (including
single parents) with small incomes where the head of the family is in full-time
work and there is at least one dependent child. It is payable when the gross
weekly income of a family falls below a prescribed amount, fixed at ^3I’5° a
week where there is one child plus £3-50 for each additional child. The weekly
rate of the supplement is half the difference between the family’s income and
the prescribed amount up to a maximum of £7 for a one-child family and this
is increased by ^0-50 for each additional child.
Pensions and allowances for people disabled or bereaved through war or
service in the Forces since the second world war are paid under Royal Warrants
and other instruments administered by the Department of Health and Social
Security.
The current basic pension for 100 per cent disablement for a private soldier
is £21-8o a week, but the amount varies according to rank and the degree of
disablement. The latter is assessed by comparing the condition of the person
disabled by service with that of a normal healthy person of the same age and
sex. Allowances for a wife and children are paid in addition to the basic
pension. There is a wide range of supplementary allowances, the main ones
being for unemployability (^i4,20 a week), constant attendance (up to £8'jo
and, exceptionally, ^17-40 a week), comforts (£370 or £1-85 a week), and
lowered standard of occupation (up to £872 a week). An additional allowance
°f £8-yo or ^4'35 according to the severity of the disablement is payable to
war pensioners who are receiving constant attendance allowance at a rate
above the normal maximum. An age allowance (between j£i-6o and ^4-8o a
week) is payable to disablement pensioners who are aged 65 or over and whose
assessment is 40 per cent or more.
Both the basic disablement pension and the supplementary allowances are
free of income tax.
Pensions are also paid to war widows and war orphans. The standard rate
of pension for widows of private soldiers is a week, with additional
allowances for their children and, in certain cases, a rent allowance (up to
£670 a week). There is an additional allowance of £i-yo for widows aged 65
which is increased to £3-4° at the age of 70. Parents or other relatives who
were dependent on a person whose death resulted from service in the Forces
may receive pensions if they are in financial need.
The Department of Health and Social Security maintains a welfare service
for war pensioners and war orphans which is available to help any who require
advice or assistance. War pensioners have priority for treatment of their war

disablements in National Health Service hospitals subject only to needs of
emergency and other urgent cases.
Many voluntary associations and ex-Service organisations give financial aid
and personal service to disabled ex-Service men and women and their families.
The department’s welfare officers work in close co-operation with these and
other statutory bodies.
AGREEMENTS
WITH OTHER
COUNTRIES
The European Community Regulations on social security, framed to protect
the benefit rights of people moving within the Community, apply to employed
workers (and to pensioners who were employed workers) who are nationals
of any of the Community countries or of Gibraltar. People covered by these
regulations are entitled to benefit under the social security arrangements of
any Community country, including Gibraltar, where they are working or
visiting, on the same basis as nationals of that country. There are also bilateral
reciprocal arrangements which apply, between the United Kingdom and other
member states of the European Community individually, to self-employed
and non-employed people who are outside the scope of the European Com¬
munity Regulations. Reciprocal agreements on industrial injuries, family
allowances and most national insurance benefits are in operation with Austria,
Finland, Jersey and Guernsey, Norway, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland and
Yugoslavia. Agreements with Cyprus, Israel, Malta, and Turkey cover
industrial injuries and most insurance benefits. With Australia and New
Zealand there are agreements on family allowances and most national insur¬
ance benefits. There are limited agreements with Bermuda, Canada, Jamaica
and the United States. The Isle of Man is party to most of the bilateral
agreements with other countries and Jersey and Guernsey to a few; neither
the nationals of these areas nor their social security schemes are covered by
European Community regulations. The social security and family allowance
schemes of Great Britain and Northern Ireland operate as a single system.
HEALTH AND PERSONAL SOCIAL SERVICES
The concern of the state with the nation’s health is chiefly a development of
the years since the passing of the Public Health Act of 1848. The second half
of the nineteenth century was notable for the growth of the environmental
or public health services, such as provision of pure water, sewerage, disposal
of refuse and cleaning of streets, and the first half of the twentieth century
for the development of publicly provided personal health services, as distinct
from environmental services, culminating in the introduction in 1948 of a
comprehensive National Health Service available to every resident and to
every visitor taken ill or meeting with an accident while in Britain. Reciprocal
health agreements have been concluded between Britain and some other
countries (see p. 142).
Scientific discoveries of importance to medicine and health, including the
development of new drugs, and the improved services of the last 70 years,
particularly in maternity and child health, school health services and school
meals, are reflected in declining mortality rates (see p. 9) and improved
physique. The infant mortality rate has almost halved since the National
Health Service was inaugurated; this and the maternal death rate are among
the lowest in the world. The health of children has steadily improved and
emphasis is now placed on prevention or early detection of disease or dis¬
ability. Deaths from such diseases as tuberculosis, poliomyelitis and diph¬
theria have fallen so markedly that they are no longer major health problems.
i34
BRITAIN 1976: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Diseases now in the forefront of research programmes include cancer and
diseases of the central nervous system, such as muscular dystrophy. Efforts
are also being made to combat some of the most prevalent diseases, which
include, besides the common cold and influenza, bronchitis, rheumatism and
arthritis, and heart diseases.
The Public Health Acts of 1936 and 1961 and the Health Services and Public
Health Act 1968 constitute the present basic public health code in England and
Wales. Local authorities (under the general direction of the Department of
Health and Social Security or the Welsh Office and the Department of the
Environment) have extensive powers for making and administering by-laws on
matters of public health.
HEALTH SERVICE The general form of the organisation established in 1948 to administer the
ADMINISTRATION National Health Service persisted until April 1974 when a major reorganisation
took place. The health ministers—the Secretary of State for Social Services
in England, and the Secretaries of State for Scotland and Wales—have a
broad responsibility for all aspects of the health services in their respective
countries, and a duty to make provision to meet all reasonable requirements
for hospitals and other accommodation for health services; for medical, dental,
nursing and ambulance services; for facilities for expectant and nursing
mothers and young children; for facilities for the care and after-care of the
sick; for the provision of a contraceptive service; and for any other services
needed for prevention, treatment and diagnosis of illness.
The organisation responsible for the provision of these health services is
three-tier in England, and two-tier in Scotland and W ales. WAhin each of the
three countries the health departments (the Department of Health and Social
Security in England, the Scottish Home and Health Department in Scotland,
and the Welsh Office in Wales) are responsible for strategic planning, while
area health authorities in England and Wales and health boards in Scotland,
are responsible for area planning and operational control of all health services
in their area. In England only, because of its greater size and population, there
is an intermediate tier of regional authorities responsible for regional planning
and certain central services.
There are 14 regional health authorities and 90 area health authorities in
England, 8 area health authorities in Wales and 15 health boards in Scotland.
They are all statutory agencies of central government and co-operate closely
with local authorities responsible for social work, public health, education
and other services. In general the areas covered by area health authorities and
health boards correspond with those of the new major local authorities
established in England and Wales in 1974 an(^ Scotland in May I975-
Area authorities and health boards have wide discretion to determine the
pattern of services best suited to their area, and most have deputed the day-to-
day running of services to health districts which usually contain a district
general hospital and have a population of between 150,000 and 300,000,
though some are considerably larger.
The health authorities and boards consist mainly of unpaid part-time
members. The chairmen and members of the regional authorities and health
boards, and the chairmen of the area health authorities are appointed by the
health minister concerned after consultation with professional, local authority,
university and other interests. The members of the area health authorities are
appointed by the regional health authorities in England, and the health minis¬
ters in Wales except for some members appointed by the corresponding local
authorities, and at least one nominated by the university concerned. Area

PUBLIC HEALTH
authorities in areas containing a teaching hospital are known as area authorities
(teaching) and in addition to two university nominees contain at least two
members with experience of medical teaching.
Medical and dental schools are not under the control of the health ministers
but it is their responsibility to provide hospital clinical facilities for the training
of medical students. The universities are responsible for the provision of
teaching.
There is statutory provision for professional advisory committees and the
authorities have a duty to consult with these committees. At the national level
the main standing advisory bodies are the Central Health Services Council in
England and Wales, and the Scottish Health Service Planning Council in
Scotland. In Scotland a Common Services Agency organises those services
that can be provided most efficiently by one agency.
Public representation in the reorganised service for England and Wales is
provided by district community health councils. These consist of about 20-30
members, half of them appointed by local government councils and the rest
mainly on the nomination of voluntary bodies interested in local health
services. They are not involved in management but act as a channel of com¬
munication between health authorities and the public.
In Scotland local health councils have been set up by the health boards to
represent the interests of the public, and to report on questions relating to the
health service in their area or district.
The three Health Service Commissioners (for England, for Scotland and for
W ales) are statutory independent officers whose function is to investigate
complaints from members of the public that they have suffered injustice or
hardship as a result of failure in a service provided by a health authority, or
failure to provide a service which it was its duty to provide, or maladminis¬
tration. Health authorities include regional health authorities, area health
authorities, boards of governors and family practitioner committees. Before
the commissioner can investigate, the complaint must have been brought to
the attention of the authority concerned, and an adequate opportunity given
for it to investigate and reply. Matters which are outside his jurisdiction in¬
clude action taken solely in the exercise of clinical judgment and the action
of general practitioners and dentists in connection with their general medical
and dental services; these, however, may be investigated under a separate
procedure.
The commissioners report annually, and as they think fit, to the respective
Secretaries of State who lay the reports before each House of Parliament. The
terms of reference of the Select Committee on the Parliamentary Com¬
missioner for Administration, who also holds the three posts of Health Service
Commissioner, have been expanded to cover these reports (see p. 39). In
Northern Ireland this function is covered by the Commissioner for Complaints
(see p. 74). „
The health authorities have general responsibility for the prevention of
disease, and co-operate for this purpose with local, water and port authorities,
which have certain specific powers of inspection and control. The local
authorities mainly concerned are in England and Wales the district councils,
the London borough councils and the City of London council; and in Scotland,
new district and islands councils. District community physicians or community
medicine specialists have been appointed with dual responsibilities to the
BRITAIN 1976: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
health authorities and the local authorities, thus exercising both local govern¬
ment and health authority functions.
Control of
Infectious
Diseases and
Food Poisoning
Local authorities, under the new local government structure, have responsi¬
bilities and powers to investigate outbreaks of certain specific infectious
diseases and of food poisoning, and to carry out disinfection and various
other preventive measures. Most local authorities have appointed as their
‘proper officer’ to deal with infectious disease and food poisoning, a doctor who
is a community physician or a community medicine specialist of the health
authority, and as such has a general responsibility for the prevention and
control of disease. The same arrangements also generally apply to the proper
officers of the port authorities which supervise health control at seaports
and airports, the primary object of which is to prevent the introduction of
infectious disease into the country.
Immunisation The area health authorities and health boards carry out planned programmes
of vaccination and immunisation against diphtheria, measles, rubella (women
and girls only), poliomyelitis, tetanus, tuberculosis and whooping cough. Such
protection is given either in family doctors’ surgeries, or in health centres or
at child health centres (see p. 140).
Bacteriological and The Public Health Laboratory Service provides a network of bacteriological
Virological and virological laboratories throughout England and Wales which conduct
Laboratory Services research and assist in the diagnosis, prevention and control of epidemic
diseases. Its largest establishment is the Central Public Health Laboratory
at Colindale, in north-west London, which includes the National Collection
of Type Cultures, the Food Hygiene Laboratory, and reference laboratories
specialising in the identification of infective micro-organisms.
In Scotland there is no separate public health laboratory service and
bacteriological work is done mainly in hospital laboratories. In Northern
Ireland a central public health laboratory shares the bacteriological work with
hospital laboratories.
Pure Food The composition, labelling and description of food, food hygiene and the
safety and fitness of food are controlled by the Food and Drugs Act 1955 in
England and Wales, by the Food and Drugs (Scotland) Act 1956 in Scotland
and by the Food and Drugs Act (Northern Ireland) 1958 in Northern Ireland,
and statutory regulations. In England and Wales the question of the composi¬
tion, labelling and description of food are the concern of food and drugs
authorities (county councils, London borough councils and the City of
London council) and questions of food hygiene and the safety and fitness of
food are the concern of district councils and port health authorities. The
Department of Health and Social Security and the Ministry of Agriculture,
Fisheries and Food are the central departments responsible for giving advice
and making regulations. Premises where food or drink is prepared, handled,
stored or sold must conform to certain hygienic standards. Authorised officers
of the councils may take for analysis or for bacteriological or other examination
samples of any food for sale for human consumption. There are special
regulations for milk, meat and ice-cream.
In Scotland the local authorities chiefly concerned are regional and islands
councils who are responsible for food standards and labelling, and district and
islands councils who have responsibility for food hygiene.

Local authorities are also responsible for other environmental functions
including refuse collection, refuse disposal, control of pollution, and noise
abatement.
Public expenditure on the health services in Britain was estimated at ^4,570
million in 1974-75. Most of the cost falls on the Treasury while the rest is
met from local rates, the national health service contribution paid with the
national insurance contribution, and charges paid by people using certain
services.
There are charges for prescriptions (except for children under 16 years,
expectant and nursing mothers, women aged 60 and over and men aged 65 and
over, patients suffering from certain medical conditions, war and Service
disablement pensioners, and families with very low incomes, including those
receiving supplementary benefits and family income supplement), for treat¬
ment in the dental service (but not for examination only or for treatment given
to people under 21 years or women who are pregnant or have borne a child in
the past year), for dentures (except for children under 16 or still at school, and
women who are pregnant or have borne a child in the past year), for spectacles
(except children’s standard spectacles) and for certain other articles. Certain
low income groups are exempt from dental and optical charges (those receiv¬
ing supplementary benefit or family income supplement and those receiving
free prescriptions or welfare foods).
A limited number of beds may be made available for hospital patients
wishing for privacy, provided that this accommodation is not needed on
medical grounds for non-paying patients; a charge for part of the cost of the
accommodation is made. Provision is also made at certain hospitals for patients
to be treated as private patients on payment of the whole cost of their accom¬
modation and treatment but the Government is planning to phase out private
pay beds in National Health Service hospitals. Such patients may make private
arrangements for treatment by doctors of their own choice.
Hospital medical staffs are either full-time and salaried, or part-time; part-
time medical officers are usually paid on a sessional basis and are free to accept
private patients. General medical practitioners in the National Health Service
are paid according to the number of patients on their list with adjustments to
reflect differences in work and responsibility; certain practice expenses are also
directly reimbursed.
Dentists providing treatment in their own surgeries are paid on a prescribed
scale of fees according to the treatment they have carried out. Pharmacists
dispensing on their own premises are paid on the basis of the prescriptions they
dispense. Ophthalmic medical practitioners and ophthalmic opticians taking
part in the general ophthalmic service are paid approved fees for each sight
test made; opticians who dispense spectacles are paid according to the number
and type of pairs supplied.
Primary health care, the front line of the personal health services, is in the
hands of doctors, dentists, opticians and pharmacists working within the
service as independent practitioners, and home nurses, midwives and health
visitors employed by the health authorities.
The family practitioner services cover the services given to individuals by
doctors, dentists, opticians and pharmacists of their own choice from among
those taking part in the service. They are administered by family practitioner
committees established by the area health authorities.
1^8 BRITAIN 1976: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Some 25,640 general medical practitioners (principals and assistants) in
Great Britain take some part in the service. The maximum number of patients’
names permitted to be on a family doctor’s list is normally 3,500; the average
number in Great Britain is about 2,400* It is normally through the patient s
own family doctor that access to most other parts of the health service is
obtained.
There are about 11,520 dentists in England and Wales and some 1,176 in
Scotland in the general dental service.
Some 930 ophthalmic medical practitioners and over 6,080 ophthalmic
and dispensing opticians in England and Wales, and about 70 ophthalmic
medical practitioners and some 59° ophthalmic and dispensing opticians in
Scotland are engaged in the general ophthalmic services. These services pro¬
vide for the testing of sight and provision of spectacles. Patients requiring
treatment are dealt with through the hospital eye service.
There are about 11,300 retail pharmacies under contract to the National
Health Service in Great Britain. They are responsible for the dispensing of all
prescriptions except for the small number dispensed by certain general
medical practitioners and hospital pharmacies.
Home Nurses, Health authorities are under a duty to provide home nurses, midwives and
Midwives and health visitors, to meet the demand of patients. Home nurses attend to people
Health Visitors needing nursing in their homes or elsewhere outside hospitals. Midwives
assist the family doctor at home confinements (about 6 per cent of all confine¬
ments), and care for mothers and babies (whether born at home or in hospital)
for about 10 days after the birth. Health visitors are concerned with the health
of the household as a whole, and have an important part to play in health
education and preventive measures. They work in close co-operation with
general medical practitioners, the paediatric and geriatric wards of hospitals
and social workers.
Increasingly family doctors work as members of co-ordinated primary health
care teams. About three-quarters of them are in partnership or group prac¬
tices, and it is becoming more and more common for home nurses, midwives
and health visitors to work from the larger premises established for such
practices. About 15 per cent of doctors now work in health centres which are
built and maintained by the health authorities and which provide modern and
well-equipped accommodation for primary health care teams consisting of
general practitioners and home nurses, midwives and health visitors. Services
which may be provided at health centres include dentistry, chiropody, family
planning, ante-natal care, pre-school, and school health and health education.
Occasionally, when necessary, provision is made for general ophthalmic and
pharmaceutical services. In some cases, a social worker is attached to or co¬
operates with the primary health care team. Out-patient facilities for local
hospitals may also be provided.
There are nearly 700 health centres in operation in England and Wales
and others are under construction or planned. In Scotland some 66 centres
are in operation and 25 under construction with more planned.
HOSPITALS AND The hospital and specialist services provide hospital accommodation of all
SPECIALIST kinds, including district general hospitals with treatment and diagnostic
SERVICES facilities for in-patients, day-patients and out-patients, hospital maternity
departments, infectious disease units, psychiatric and geriatric facilities,
rehabilitation facilities, convalescent homes and all forms of specialised

treatment. A number of specialist hospitals for mentally ill and mentally
handicapped people are also provided. It is, however, planned to replace
many of these by facilities in district general hospitals.
A large proportion of the hospitals in the National Health Service were built
in the nineteenth century; some trace their origins to much earlier charitable
foundations, such as the famous St. Thomas’ and St. Bartholomew’s Hospitals
in London. Much has been done to improve and extend existing hospitals,
some of which are housed in inconvenient buildings, and a number of new
hospitals have been built.
There are about 2,500 NHS hospitals in England and Wales; they have
some 421,000 beds and a nursing and midwifery staff of 207,655 full-time
and about 131,450 part-time. There are 353 hospitals in Scotland with some
6i,4i3 beds and nearly 31,326 full-time and 18,384 part-time nurses and
midwives.
A small number of hospitals remain outside the service for special reasons.
Some of these are run by religious orders. Some, such as the Italian and Jewish
Hospitals, were set up to serve a special group of patients; others are main¬
tained for the chronic sick or for convalescents by charitable organisations.
Some treat NHS patients under special arrangements. There are also private
nursing homes which must be registered.
Rehabilitation is an important aspect of medical care and today treatment is
not limited to the relief of pain or cure of pathological conditions but aims at
helping people to resume normal living as soon as possible. Rehabilitation has
been applied with advantage in the care of many patients, including the
younger disabled, the mentally ill and the aged and has enabled many patients
to become self-sufficient and to resume an independent life in their own
homes. Rehabilitation facilities are provided in the majority of hospitals and
at special centres. The work is carried out by doctors, physiotherapists,
remedial gymnasts and occupational therapists together with social workers
acting as a team. The hospital departments work closely with the Disablement
Resettlement Service of the Employment Service Agency.
Medical rehabilitation may include the provision, free of charge, of artificial
limbs and eyes, hearing aids, surgical supports, invalid chairs, certain types of
invalid vehicles, and other appliances. Very severely physically handicapped
patients may be issued with electrical apparatus invented in Britain and
known as POSSUM; this enables a person to operate up to 11 electrical
devices such as alarm bells, radio and television, a telephone, and heating.
The control is operated by means of a switch or sustained via a pneumatic
tube with a pipe-stem mouthpiece. Nursing aids for the handicapped at
home can be borrowed through the service.
Social work help, provided by local authority social service departments,
is available to those hospital patients who have difficulties connected with
their illness. Social workers help to solve social and emotional problems and
are concerned with the rehabilitation and resettlement of patients especially
where the illness has been long or where the disability results in changes in the
patient’s life.
The hospital service plays a major part in the treatment of drug dependence,
providing treatment for both in-patients and out-patients either in special¬
ised drug dependence units or as part of the general psychiatric service.
Only doctors licensed for the purpose by the Home Secretary may prescribe
heroin and cocaine to addicts in the treatment of addiction and all medical

practitioners are required to notify the Chief Medical Officer of the Home
Office of any patient they consider to be addicted to certain controlled drugs.
Treatment is provided for alcoholics as part of the general psychiatric service.
In addition a number of specialised hospital units have been set up. Closely
linked with treatment are community services covering prevention, advice to
alcoholics and their families, and rehabilitation including, where necessary,
residential care.
Special preventive health services, including free dental care, are available for
expectant and nursing mothers and young children. Maternity and child
health centres are provided either in health centres, purpose built or rented
premises, or in mobile units. Special sessions are held for vaccination and
immunisation and for early testing of babies for vision deficiencies or hearing
loss. A feature of the service is the education of mothers before and after the
birth by means of talks, discussion groups, demonstrations and classes.
About four-fifths of babies in their first year of life are taken to the centres.
Family planning advice and help is provided at many maternity and child
health centres and welfare foods (dried milk and vitamins) are distributed
from them.
Whenever possible sick children are treated in their own homes, but for
those that need hospital treatment many hospitals have children’s departments
under the oversight of paediatricians and specially trained nurses.
The school health service, now part of the National Health Service, com¬
prises medical and dental inspection and treatment of school children, medical
services connected with the education of handicapped children, school clinics
to treat and advise on health problems of children of school age and child
guidance clinics to give help and advice about children with mental or emo¬
tional problems. (In Scotland child guidance clinics are run by education
authorities.)
A free family planning service is provided to all irrespective of age, sex or
marital status through National Health Service family planning clinics,
hospitals and family doctors.
The Abortion Act 1967, which came into force in Great Britain in 1968,
permits the termination of a pregnancy by a registered medical practitioner if
two registered medical practitioners are of the opinion that its continuance
would involve risk to the life of the pregnant woman, or of injury to the
physical or mental health of the pregnant woman or any children of her family
greater than if the pregnancy were terminated, or if there is a substantial risk
that if a child were born it would be seriously physically or mentally handi¬
capped. Abortions may be carried out in National Health Service hospitals
or in premises approved for the purpose by the Secretary of State concerned.
The National Blood Transfusion Service in England and Wales is administered
by the new regional health authorities. Donors give their blood voluntarily
without payment. There are two central laboratories administered by the
Medical Research Council on behalf of the Department of Health and Social
Security: the Blood Group Reference Laboratory, which prepares grouping
serum and investigates blood grouping problems referred to it, and the Blood
Products Laboratory, which prepares dried plasma and plasma fractions. In

Services Agency (see p. 135). In Northern Ireland the Blood Transfusion
Service is operated by the Eastern Health and Social Services Board, which
provides a service for all four health and social services boards.
A Chest Radiological Service, which is freely available, is provided by chest
clinics and the radiological departments of general hospitals. The success of
mass radiography units has been such that their work is being phased into the
hospital radiography service. Mobile X-ray units are still used among specially
susceptible groups.
Free conveyance by ambulance in England and Wales between home and
hospital is provided, where necessary, by the health authorities either directly
or by arrangement with voluntary organisations. The Hospital Car Service
(organised by the St. John Ambulance Association and Brigade, the British Red
Cross Society, and the Women’s Royal Voluntary Service) augments the
ambulance service in many areas by the conveyance of sitting patients. In
Scotland ambulances are run by the Common Services Agency (see p. 135). In
Northern Ireland they are run by the health and social services boards.
Health education in England, Wales and Northern Ireland is promoted by the
Health Education Council which assists in the development of programmes of
health education with the health authorities, professional organisations, volun¬
tary bodies and industry. Central health education services in Scotland are
provided by the Common Services Agency (see p. 135). Expenditure is met
largely from central government funds.
Under the Medicines Act 1968 the health and agriculture ministers are respon¬
sible for licensing the manufacture, marketing and importation of medicines
for human and veterinary use. The Medicines Commission advises the minis¬
ters on policy regarding medicines and a Committee on Safety of Medicines
advises the health ministers on the safety, efficacy and quality of medicines
and monitors adverse drug reactions. The Act also controls the advertising,
labelling, distribution, sale and supply of medicines.
Though practically all residents in Britain use the National Health Service, a
number of people sometimes prefer to pay for private consultations and treat¬
ment. Among the major users are the families of subscribers to the provident
schemes which make provision for private health care in return for annual
subscriptions (now about 2 per cent of the expenditure on NHS hospital and
specialist services).
Only people whose names are on the medical and dental registers respectively
may practise as doctors and dentists under the National Health Service. Dental
auxiliaries (who have undergone a two-year training course) and dental
hygienists (who have undergone a nine-month training course) may carry out
some kinds of simple dental work under the direction of a registered dentist.
The minimum qualification for registration as a doctor requires five to seven
years’ training in medical school and hospital, with an additional year’s
experience as a resident assistant doctor in a hospital; for a dentist, four or
more years at a dental school are required. The governing body of the medical
profession is the General Medical Council, first set up in 1858; that of the
dentists is the General Dental Council which succeeded the Dental Board in
1956. The British Medical Association is the doctors’ main professional
association; that of the dentists is the British Dental Association.

The minimum period of hospital training required to qualify for registra¬
tion as a nurse is normally three years. Training may be in general, sick
children’s, mental or mental subnormality nursing. An enrolled nurse takes a
two-year course. The examining bodies of the nursing profession in England
and Wales and in Scotland are the General Nursing Councils, and in Northern
Ireland the Northern Ireland Council of Nurses and Midwives. Midwives in
England and Wales and in Scotland must have the certificate of the appro¬
priate Central Midwives Board, and in Northern Ireland of the Northern
Ireland Council of Nurses and Midwives. Most pupil midwives are already
registered general nurses or sick children’s nurses; for them the two-year mid¬
wifery training period is reduced to one year and, for other registered and
enrolled nurses, to 18 months. The Royal College of Nursing and the Royal
College of Midwives are the professional bodies for nurses and midwives.
Health visitors are registered general nurses who have undergone at least the
first part of the midwifery course or obstetric nursing before taking a year’s
course in health visiting, promoted by the Council for the Education and
Training of Health Visitors. Home nurses are state registered or state enrolled
nurses, the majority of whom have undertaken additional training.
To practise as a retail or hospital pharmacist, a pharmaceutical chemist
must have his or her name entered in the register maintained by the Pharma¬
ceutical Society of Great Britain, the governing body of the profession, or by
the Pharmaceutical Society of Northern Ireland. Four or five years’ academic
study and practical training are necessary for registration. The dispensing of
all medicines on doctors’ prescriptions and sale of certain specified medicines
can be carried out only by, or under the supervision of, a registered pharma¬
ceutical chemist. Under the Opticians Act 1958 the General Optical Council
regulates the professions of ophthalmic optician and dispensing optician; only
registered ophthalmic opticians (or registered medical practitioners) may test
sight. Training of ophthalmic opticians takes four years including a year of
practical experience under supervision. Dispensing opticians may take a
two-year full-time course with a year’s practical experience or a part-time
day-release course while employed with an optician.
State registration may be obtained by chiropodists, dietitians, medical
laboratory technicians, occupational therapists, orthoptists, physiotherapists,
radiographers and remedial gymnasts. The governing bodies are eight boards
(called, for example, the Chiropodists’ Board or the Dietitians Board) under
the general supervision of the Council for Professions Supplementary to
Medicine. A professional training lasting two to four years is needed to qualify
for registration. Only members of these professions who are state registered
may be employed in the National Health Service and some other public
services.
Reciprocal health agreements have been concluded between Britain and a
number of other countries. In addition, under the terms of the social security
regulations of the European Community, British nationals and nationals of
other Community countries resident in Britain and normally working for an
employer are entitled to urgent medical treatment in another Community
country on the same basis as insured nationals of that country; this regulation
also applies to dependants and retirement pensioners.
PERSONAL Responsibility for personal social services rests with local authority social
SOCIAL SERVICES services departments. Many of the services which they provide are directed
towards the same groups of people who also have a great need for health
SOCIAL WELFARE
The
Handicapped

I43
services, for example, the elderly, the chronically sick and the disabled
and the mentally ill or handicapped. Other groups that are helped by the
local authority social services are young families with social problems, children
deprived of a normal home life and the young offender. Many adults and
children in these groups are also in need of medical and psychiatric services.
Close co-operation is maintained between local authority social services
departments and health authorities.
In England and W ales the powers and duties of local authorities to provide
these varied social services derive from a number of statutes; some of the main
Acts are mentioned in their context in the succeeding pages. In Scotland many
of the corresponding duties derive from the Social Work (Scotland) Act 1968
in accordance with which Scottish local authorities also undertake duties
similar to those of the separate probation and after-care service in England and
Wales. The Personal Social Services Council advises ministers on policy
issues and provides a service of information and advice to all concerned with
the personal social services in England and Wales, based on research projects
or inquiries sponsored by the council. Its members are from local govern¬
ment, voluntary, educational and research bodies and professional organisa¬
tions. There is cross-representation with the Central Health Services Council
and the Central Council for Education and Training in Social Work. Finance
comes from central and local government. In Scotland there is an Advisory
Council on Social Work.
Local authorities in England, Wales and Scotland have a duty to provide
social services for disabled people (for example, the blind and partially sighted,
the hearing impaired and other physically handicapped groups). Local
authorities are required to identify the number of handicapped people in their
area and to publicise services available to them. A wide range of facilities is
available, including advice on personal, social and occupational problems
arising from disability; assistance in overcoming the effects of disability; help
in carrying out adaptations in the home—for example, by fitting ramps, wide
doorways, ground floor toilets, guide rails, and the provision of various aids
to living to meet individual needs, including, in certain circumstances, help
towards obtaining a telephone and a television set; social and occupational
centres and clubs; teaching of handicrafts and other occupations either at
home or in centres; the provision of recreational facilities, outings and holi¬
days including recuperative holidays. They also provide residential homes
for handicapped people.
Help available from other sources includes financial aid, preventive and
medical treatment, special education, training for employment and placement
in suitable occupations, specially designed housing and specially designed
means of access to public buildings.
(For the provision of special educational treatment for handicapped children
see p. 153 and the child health centres and the school health service, p. 140.)
A number of services for elderly people in their own homes are provided by
statutory and voluntary bodies to help them to live there for as long as possible.
The services of local authorities include the advice and help of social workers,
domestic help, sitters-in, night attendants and laundry services as well as day
centres, clubs, recreational workshops and meals services. In many areas
‘good neighbour’ and friendly visiting services are also arranged by the local
authority or a voluntary organisation. Chiropody services for the elderly
are provided by area health authorities.

Local authorities also provide residential accommodation for the elderly and
infirm and have powers to register homes run by voluntary organisations or
privately. The newer homes provided by local authorities for elderly and
other infirm people usually have accommodation for 30 to 50 residents. About
2,550 homes for elderly people are provided by local authorities in England
and Wales which house about 1-4 per cent of the population over 65. Similar
homes are provided in Scotland.
For many years local authorities have, under the Housing Acts, provided an
increasing number of smaller dwellings for old people, and flatlets for frail or
infirm old people who can lead independent lives with some help. Local
authorities may contribute towards the cost of employing a warden in such
specially designed housing.
Local social services authorities have a duty to make arrangements for helping
the mentally ill or mentally handicapped in the community, and for prevention
and after-care services. Recent developments in the treatment of mental illness,
which enable patients either to be treated at home or to be discharged from
hospital more quickly provided support is available in the community, are
adding to demands for these services and particularly for social welfare support.
Arrangementsincludetrainingcentres for the mentally handicapped, day centres
for the mentally ill, as well as social centres and a variety of residential care
for the mentally ill and mentally handicapped of all ages. If necessary, the local
authority can place a mentally disordered person under guardianship within
the community. Local authority social workers help patients and their families
to deal with social problems arising from mental illness or mental handicap.
Help to Families Local authorities, through their own social workers or through a voluntary
organisation, make available help and advice to families facing special problems.
Domestic help (commonly called ‘home help’) is provided by local authori¬
ties. By far the most numerous category getting this help are the elderly, but
others include the chronically sick and severely physically handicapped, the
mentally ill or mentally handicapped and maternity cases.
Some local authorities make direct provision for the special needs of un¬
married mothers and their babies, but most contribute to the cost of work done
by voluntary organisations and other bodies.
For the homeless, local authorities provide or arrange temporary accommo¬
dation.
Local authorities also provide day care for children with special social or
health needs. This is done through their own day nurseries and part-time
nursery groups, voluntary and private day nurseries, child minders and play¬
groups.
Child Care Local authorities in Britain have a duty of care and protection towards children
who have no parent or guardian willing and able to provide for them and
control them adequately. Local authorities in England and Wales are em¬
powered under the Children and Young Persons Act 1963 make available
such advice, guidance and assistance as may promote the welfare of children
by diminishing the need to receive or keep them in the authority’s care or to
bring them before a juvenile court. The Children and Young Persons Act
1969 (for England and Wales) provides for children to be brought before a
court if they are neglected, exposed to moral danger, beyond the control of
parents or not attending school or if they have committed an offence and are
in need of care and control; and for the care and treatment of young offenders
SOCIAL WELFARE
H5
and others in need of care and control; and gives local authorities responsi¬
bilities for undertaking, through social workers, enquiries and consultations
with parents, schools and the police, and for the supervision of a child or
young person found to be in need of care and control. Children under 17 who
are charged with offences or brought before the court as being in need of care
or control are almost always dealt with in a juvenile court.
In England and Wales a child may be committed to the care of a local author¬
ity under a care order if the juvenile court is satisfied that he is in need of care
or control. A care order remains in force until a child’s eighteenth birthday (or
nineteenth if made after he is 16) unless revoked earlier by the court. In
England and Wales local authorities have a further duty, under the Children
Act 1948, to receive into their care any child under the age of 17 who has been
abandoned or has no parent or guardian able to provide for him. A child so
received remains in the care of the local authority until he is 18 years old unless
discharged to the care of parents, other relatives or friends before that time.
Similar provisions for assistance and care apply in Scotland under separate
legislation. Under the provisions of the Social Work (Scotland) Act 1968, the
juvenile courts were replaced by a system of children’s hearings which have
powers to impose compulsory measures of care on a child by means of a super¬
vision requirement which can remain in force until he is 18 years old.
When practicable, children in care are boarded out with foster parents, who
receive an allowance to cover the cost of maintenance. If a suitable foster home
cannot be found for a child, or he is not suitable for boarding out, he may be
placed in a community home, a voluntary home or other suitable residential
accommodation. Community homes for children in the care of local authorities
are now provided under plans formulated by regional planning committees
in accordance with the Children and Young Persons Act 1969. These homes
comprise local authority children’s homes and the voluntary homes which
have become ‘assisted’ or ‘controlled’ by a local authority together with former
approved schools and remand homes which have ceased to function under
these names. In Scotland local authorities are responsible for providing ap¬
propriate accommodation for children in their care and informal arrangements
exist for the development of services on a regional basis.
In England and Wales local authority child care functions are the responsi¬
bility of the social services committees appointed under the Local Authority
Social Services Act 1970. In Scotland child care work is undertaken by local
authority social work departments set up under the Social Work (Scotland)
Act 1968. Regulations regarding, for example, conduct of community homes
and registered voluntary homes and the boarding out of children in care are
made for England and Wales by the Secretary of State for Social Services
and the Secretary of State for Wales and, for Scotland, by the Secretary of
State for Scotland.
In Northern Ireland arrangements for the care of children and young per¬
sons follow the same general principles as in Great Britain.
Voluntary
Organisations
Voluntary organisations, many of which were pioneers in child care, continue
to play a valuable part in this work. Children’s homes run by voluntary
organisations (with some 10,280 places in Great Britain) are required to be
registered. Arrangements for the care of children and their accommodation
are subject to inspection by social work service officers of the Department of
Health and Social Security, the Welsh Office, the Scottish Education Depart¬
ment and the Northern Ireland Department of Health and Social Services.

homes include local family casework agencies and the Family Service Units.
The National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children and its
Scottish counterpart maintain inspectors and visitors to investigate reported
cruelty or neglect.
Provision for legal adoption was first made in England and Wales in 1926,
in Northern Ireland in 1929 and in Scotland in I930, About 25>ooo adop¬
tion orders are made annually by the courts in Great Britain and some 400
in Northern Ireland. Adoption is now regulated by the Adoption Act 1958 in
Great Britain and by the Adoption Act (Northern Ireland) 1967 in Northern
Ireland. The Registrars General keep registers of adopted children. In Great
Britain local authorities have had the power since 1959 to act as adoption
agencies and many do so. Adoption societies (over 70 societies arrange
adoptions) must be registered with the local authority. Further changes in the
law on adoption have been proposed in the Children Bill.
Adoptions of minors under the laws of most European and Commonwealth
countries are recognised in Great Britain by virtue of the Adoption (Designa¬
tion of Overseas Adoptions) Order 1973. The recognition does not confer on
the adopted person citizenship of the United Kingdom and Colonies.
Social services of all kinds require for their effective operation professional
social workers, that is, full-time salaried workers trained in the methods
of social work. Most professional social workers are employed in local authority
social services departments, in voluntary organisations or in the probation
service (see p. 106). Social workers working in the health services are employed
by local authority social services departments and made available by them to
hospitals and other health service establishments. Responsibility for advice
and professional training in social work rests with the Central Council for
Education and Training in Social Work. Professional training normally takes
two years, or one year for certain students who have previously obtained
relevant degrees or diplomas.
The services established under the Health and Personal Social Services
(Northern Ireland) Order 1972 correspond fairly closely to the system under
the National Health Service in Great Britain and are financed in the same way.
Services are provided by four health and social services boards acting as
agents of the Department of Health and Social Services. They include
hospital and specialist services, practitioner and other primary health care
services and personal social services. The boards have under their control 95
hospitals containing in all about 18,260 beds. There are some 745 general
practitioners (with an average of 2,100 patients each), 315 dentists, 11 ophthal¬
mic medical practitioners and 115 ophthalmic and a few dispensing opticians.
IMMIGRATION AND COMMUNITY RELATIONS
After the 1950s considerable numbers of people entered Britain from Com¬
monwealth countries in the West Indies, Asia and Africa to take up employ¬
ment, many with the intention of settling permanently (see pp. 11 and 342). It
was estimated that coloured Commonwealth immigrants and their families
numbered some 1-5 million at the time of the 1971 census, about 2| per cent
of the total population of Britain.

Commonwealth immigrants make an important contribution to the economy
and public services; but their concentration in areas where opportunities for
employment are greatest (60 per cent have settled in Greater London and the
West Midlands, including Birmingham) has led to an increased demand for
housing and additional pressures on some of the social services. The problems
of these inner urban areas are being met by continuous social service pro¬
grammes in housing, education, hospitals, health and personal social services,
which benefit the whole community, and by several social programmes which
are directed at areas of special need. Additional teachers have been appointed
to schools in immigrant areas and government grants are available to
local authorities with substantial immigrant populations towards the salaries
of extra staff, such as interpreters, health visitors and helpers in schools and
community homes. The welfare of immigrants and good relations between
immigrant groups and the local community are promoted by voluntary
community relations councils and other voluntary bodies.
The co-ordination of government action to promote the welfare of immigrants
is the responsibility of the Home Office. Voluntary efforts to achieve the
integration of immigrants as part of a wider aim of promoting harmonious
community relations are co-ordinated nationally by the Community Relations
Commission, a statutory body set up under the Race Relations Act 1968.1
The Commission co-ordinates the activities of local community relations
councils, of which there are about 85 operating in areas where there is an
immigrant population. It makes grants towards the salaries of full-time com¬
munity relations officers and assistants and towards special projects which
help improve community relations and advises and makes recommendations
to the Home Secretary on matters affecting community relations. The Com¬
mission gives specialist advice to those working in social services, including
education, employment and youth services, in the context of a multi-cultural
society.
Discrimination on grounds of colour, race, or ethnic or national origin in places
of public resort was first made unlawful in Great Britain by the Race Relations
Act 1965) which established a Race Relations Board to secure compliance with
the Act. The Race Relations Act 1968 replaced the 1965 Act and is much
wider in scope, making discrimination unlawful in the provision of goods,
facilities and services, in employment and housing and in advertising. The
Race Relations Board has a statutory duty to receive and investigate complaints
and seeks to resolve them by conciliation. The Board constitutes regional
conciliation committees which between them cover all areas of Great Britain.
If conciliation fails the Board can seek remedies in the courts. Employment
complaints are dealt with in the first instance by the Department of Employ¬
ment whose function it is to see whether voluntary machinery exists within
industry to deal with them. Where no such machinery exists the complaints
are investigated by the Board.
1 Under Government proposals to strengthen the law against racial discrimination,
published in September 1975, the Community Relations Commission and the Race
Relations Board would be merged into a new body.
7 Education
There are nearly 12 million pupils and students in full-time attendance at
schools and institutions of further and higher education in Britain. The great
majority of schools, attended by over 95 per cent of school children, and most
further education establishments are publicly maintained or assisted. Univer¬
sities are autonomous self-governing institutions but are also aided from public
funds.
The bulk of expenditure on education in Britain comes from public funds
although some older-established schools and colleges continue to benefit from
private endowments. In 1974-75 estimated total public expenditure on educa¬
tion, including school meals, milk, local libraries and museums, amounted to
over £4,500 million, which was 13 per cent of all public expenditure.
In England and Wales the main development of publicly provided primary
education started over a hundred years ago. In 1833 the Government had
begun to make annual grants to the voluntary societies which were providing
schools, but the Elementary Education Act of 1870 first established the
principle of compulsory education. By the end of the nineteenth century
elementary education had become virtually both compulsory and free of
charge. Public provision of secondary education (already begun in Wales)
started in England under the Act of 1902. The Education Act of 1944 now
governs public education in England and Wales. The Scottish and Northern
Ireland educational systems both have long and separate histories, but the
same general policy is implemented throughout Britain, with some national
variations. Education is governed by the Education (Scotland) Act 1962 and
the Education and Libraries (Northern Ireland) Order 1972.
A ten-year education programme for England and Wales was announced by
the Government in December 1972. The proposals involve substantially in¬
creased expenditure in five sectors: a new programme of nursery education
(see p. 152); a larger building programme for the renewal of secondary and
special, as well as primary, schools; a larger teaching force to improve further
the staffing standards in schools; new measures to improve the pre-service and
in-service training of teachers; and the development in higher education of a
wider range of opportunities for both students and institutions. Similar pro¬
posals have been made for Scotland. The original programme was somewhat
scaled down in 1975 in the light of the economic situation and of revised
(lower) estimates of future school population, but it remains substantial.
Broadly parallel developments are taking place in Northern Ireland.
As part of a policy of special educational help to children suffering from par¬
ticular social difficulties, including immigrants, the Government during 1974
established an Educational Disadvantage Unit and a related non-government
advisory committee. Both work in co-operation with an Assessment of
Performance Unit with the wider brief of finding out why some children of all
ranges of ability fall below their potential. In addition a government grant of
about £1 million to promote measures to reduce adult illiteracy has been
allocated (see p. 158).
Educational Educational responsibilities are devolved in varying degrees to ministers of the
Administration four countries of Britain: the Secretary of State for Education and Science is
EDUCATION
SCHOOLS
Management
I49
responsible for all aspects of education in England, for further education in
Wales, and for universities, civil science and the arts (see p. 48) throughout
Great Britain; the Secretary of State for Wales is responsible for nursery,
primary and secondary education in Wales; the Secretaries of State for Scot¬
land and Northern Ireland have full educational responsibilities in their
countries except that the Secretary of State for Scotland is consulted about
Scottish universities but is not responsible for them.
Administration of publicly provided schools and further education is divided
between the central government departments (the Department of Education
and Science, the Welsh Office, the Scottish Education Department, and the
Northern Ireland Department of Education), local education authorities
(education and library boards in Northern Ireland), and various voluntary
organisations. The relation between these three groups is based on consultation
and co-operation.
The local education authorities are responsible for the provision of school
education and further education and also provide grants to students pro¬
ceeding to higher education. In Scotland the central institutions (colleges of
higher education), which are administered by independent governing bodies,
are financed directly by the Scottish Education Department and grants to
students are also paid by the department.
In England and Wales teacher training has been mainly provided by colleges
of education under the financial and administrative control of local education
authorities or voluntary organisations. The system is being reorganised (see
p. 162). The Scottish colleges of education are financed directly by the Scottish
Education Department and administered by independent governing bodies;
in Northern Ireland they are controlled by the Department of Education or
voluntary agencies.
The universities are administratively independent and their governing
bodies are appointed according to the terms of their individual charters or
statutory provisions. The Government exercises its responsibilities in relation
to the universities through the University Grants Committee (see p. 160).
Parents in Britain are required by law to see that their children receive efficient
full-time education, at school or elsewhere, between the ages of 5 and 16.
There are over 11 million school children at some 37,000 schools. In
England and Wales there were 9-1 million children in publicly maintained
schools in 1974 besides 131,315 others at schools receiving direct grants from
the Department of Education and Science or the Welsh Office; there were
also 432,348 children of all ages at 2,433 independent schools. In Scotland
1-06 million children were attending education authority or grant-aided schools
and over 17,800 were at independent schools. In Northern Ireland 369,240
children were attending publicly maintained or assisted schools.
In Britain boys and girls are generally taught together in primary schools.
Some 70 per cent of pupils in maintained secondary schools in England and
Wales and about 48 per cent in Northern Ireland attend mixed schools. In
Scotland nearly all secondary schools are mixed. In the independent sector
most of the schools for younger children are co-educational; but of those
providing secondary education the majority are either for boys or for girls.
Schools supported from public funds are of three kinds in England and
Wales: county schools (the largest group), provided and maintained by local
education authorities wholly out of public funds; voluntary schools (mostly
‘aided’ or ‘controlled’ schools), provided by a voluntary body, usually of a
BRITAIN 1976: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
religious denomination; and direct-grant schools, completely independent of
local education authorities but receiving a grant (being phased out, see p. 153)
from the Department of Education and Science or the Welsh Office. The local
education authority is responsible for the running costs of all voluntary
schools and for the cost of all building work at controlled schools. Aided
schools have more independence than controlled schools and are responsible
for part of the cost of external repairs and any building work (see p. 155).
About a third of the 28,319 schools maintained by local education authorities
in England and Wales are voluntary schools and the majority of these are
Church of England schools. There are 2,629 Roman Catholic voluntary
schools and smaller numbers belonging to other religious bodies. Direct-
grant schools (the smallest group) are mainly grammar schools. In Scotland
most of the schools supported from public funds are provided by education
authorities and are known as public schools (in England this term is used for
a type of independent school, see p. i53)‘ There are also 26 grant-aided
secondary schools comparable to the English direct-grant schools, and subject
to a similar decision to phase out their grants. In Northern Ireland controlled
schools managed by education and library boards and voluntary schools
managed by maintained school committees, boards of governors and indivi¬
dual managers (usually clergymen) are both grant-aided from public funds.
In England and Wales no fees are charged to parents of children attending
maintained schools (that is, over 94 per cent of the school population) and
books and equipment are free. In Scotland, education authorities have power to
charge fees where this can be done without prejudice to the adequate provision
of free school education.
The direct-grant grammar schools in England and Wales and a few of the
grant-aided secondary schools in Scotland take pupils paid for by local educa¬
tion authorities as well as those whose fees are paid wholly or partly by parents.
In Northern Ireland no fees are charged to parents of children attending grant-
aided schools, with the exception of grammar schools, where qualified pupils
receive from the education authorities scholarships which cover the whole or
most of the fees charged by the school.
In England and Wales the secular curriculum in maintained schools is the
responsibility of the local education authority or, in the case of voluntary
aided secondary schools, of the schools’ governors. In practice there is a very
high degree of devolution to headteachers. Her Majesty’s Inspectors of Schools
are responsible for the inspection of all schools including independent
schools; they review and report on the content and value of the education
provided and are available as advisers. Local education authorities also employ
inspectors to advise on maintained schools. Further advice and encourage¬
ment for school-based research and development is available to teachers
through the Schools Council for Curriculum and Examinations. The council,
an independent body representative of all educational interests, acts as an
advisory body and carries out research and development work on curricula,
teaching methods and examinations in primary and secondary schools. In
Scotland the function of Her Majesty’s Inspectors is in general the same. The
content and balance of the curriculum is kept under continuous review by
the Consultative Committee on the Curriculum. Northern Ireland has a
Schools Curriculum Committee which works in close liaison with the Schools
Council; the Inspectorate of the Department of Education provides help and

advice to teachers and is responsible for the inspection and evaluation of the
work of all schools.
The schools’ freedom to frame their own curricula has facilitated a rapid
increase in study and experiment, partly stimulated by the Schools Council
and other organisations. The general purpose is to adapt the curriculum to the
everyday life and needs of children and young people.
In England and Wales by law all children in county or voluntary schools
receive religious instruction and take part in a daily corporate act of worship
unless their parents choose otherwise. In county schools, and in certain circum¬
stances in voluntary schools, religious instruction of an undenominational
Christian character is given which may include the study of comparative reli¬
gions. In all kinds of voluntary school there is opportunity for denominational
instruction. In Scotland, subject to safeguards for the individual conscience,
religious instruction must be given, but the content is determined by educa¬
tion authorities or, more commonly, by the schools themselves. Roman
Catholic children generally have their own schools. In controlled schools in
Northern Ireland clergy have a right of access which may be used for de¬
nominational instruction; in voluntary schools corporate worship and religious
education are controlled by the management authorities.
Physical education, including organised games, is a part of the curriculum
of all schools. Those receiving financial assistance from public funds must
have the use of a playing field and most secondary schools have a gymnasium.
Organised games include tennis, cricket, football, hockey, lacrosse and netball.
The School Health Service (which became part of the reorganised National
Health Service in April 1974) provides for medical inspection of school
children and for advice and treatment of specific medical and dental problems
associated with children of school age.
Milk (normally one-third of a pint a day) is given free to children of 7 years
or under, to children aged between 7 and 12 if they have a medical requirement,
and to pupils in special schools for the handicapped. The School Meals
Service provides a mid-day meal at a subsidised charge (remitted where there
is need). About 70 per cent of pupils in England and Wales, 46 per cent of
pupils in Scotland and 54 per cent of pupils in Northern Ireland schools make
use of the service. Education authorities have a statutory duty under certain
conditions to provide free school transport; and have discretionary powers to
assist financially in the provision of transport for pupils between home and
school and for other school activities.
In Great Britain the Government has allocated resources under several schemes
for the improvement of educational facilities in ‘priority areas’. Educational
problems in these areas arising from poverty, overcrowding and old school
buildings were highlighted in the Plowden report (see Bibliography p. 473)
which made a number of recommendations on aid to what it defined as educa¬
tional priority areas. These recommendations led to the introduction of a
special annual increment for teachers employed in schools of exceptional
difficulty and to the allocation of additional funds for school building in these
areas. Before the proposals for a major expansion in nursery education were
announced in 1972, over 24,000 additional nursery school places in Great
Britain had been approved in areas of acute social need through the Urban
Programme (see p. 124). The educational share of the Urban Programme has
since been devoted to other uses, for example, the improvement of the links

between home and school, which was recommended in the report on the
educational priority area project (see Bibliography p. 473). This project
(sponsored jointly by the Department of Education and Science and the Social
Science Research Council) and the Community Development Project (spon¬
sored by the Home Office), have encouraged such innovations as community
schools, pre-school experiments and new approaches to adult education. The
education programme announced in 1972 (see p. 148), which included the
provision of more nursery education and the improvement or replacement of
old school buildings, also incorporated as an objective the need to give priority
to the deprived areas.
Nursery schools and classes provide informal educational and play facilities.
Only a small proportion of children between two and five years old attends
these schools but the major expansion of nursery education in Great Britain
announced in December 1972 is planned to provide, within ten years, nursery
education without charge to those children of three and four whose parents
wish them to have it. In Northern Ireland a commitment to a similar expan¬
sion was announced in September 1974. Compulsory education begins at five
when children in England and Wales go to infant schools or departments; at
seven they go on to junior schools or departments. At present the usual age of
transfer from primary to secondary schools is 11 in England, Wales and
Northern Ireland but an increasing number of local authorities in England
are establishing ‘first’ schools for pupils aged 5-8 or 10, and ‘middle’ schools
for pupils aged 8 or 9 to 12 or 13 and 10 to 13 or 14. In Scotland, the primary
schools take children from 5 to 12, normally having infant classes for children
under 7, although in some areas there are separate infant schools.
The content of curricula is very largely a matter for the schools themselves
(see p. 150). In England, Wales and Northern Ireland there are no compulsory
secular subjects but generally a curriculum includes the teaching of reading,
writing, mathematics, English, music, art and handiwork, science and nature
study, history and geography. French is taught in an increasing number of
schools. Additionally, in Wales, the Welsh language is taught. Where it is the
home language of the pupils, Welsh is used as either the main or a secondary
medium of teaching in many schools especially in nursery school and primary
school. Welsh is also used as a main medium of teaching in bilingual primary
and secondary schools throughout Wales. In Scotland the scope of the curricu¬
lum is similar and provision is made, where appropriate, for the teaching of
Gaelic and its use for the purposes of instruction.
The public or state system of education aims to give all children an education
suited to their particular abilities. Some 60 per cent of the maintained secon¬
dary school population in England and Wales attend some 2,270 comprehen¬
sive schools which take pupils without reference to ability or aptitude and
provide a wide range of secondary education for all or most of the children of
a district. They can be organised in a number of ways including schools that
take the full secondary school age-range from 11 to 18; the middle schools
whose pupils move on to senior comprehensive schools at 12 or 13, leaving
at 16 or 18; and the comprehensive school with an age-range of 11 or 12 to 16
combined with a sixth-form college for pupils over 16. Most of the remaining
children receive their secondary education in schools to which they are
allocated after selection procedures at the age of 11. Schools receiving pupils
on a selective basis are: about 850 grammar schools providing academic
education (including 175 direct-grant grammar schools); some 1,510secondary

modern schools giving a general education with a practical bias; a few secondary
technical schools offering a general education related to industry, commerce
and agriculture; and schools providing all three, or any two, types of education,
in separately organised streams and known as multilateral or bilateral schools.
In 1974 Government announced plans to encourage progress towards a
fully comprehensive system of secondary education including the phasing out
of the direct-grant system. A number of direct-grant schools have agreed to
end selection and join the state comprehensive system, while others have
announced their intention of becoming independent (see below).
Secondary education in Scotland is almost completely organised on compre¬
hensive lines and in 1974 3^3)4°5 pupils (about 98 per cent of all pupils in
education authority secondary schools) were in schools with a comprehensive
intake. The majority of schools are six-year comprehensive schools. Because of
local circumstances there are some comprehensive schools whose courses may
extend to four years or less and from which pupils may transfer at the end of
their second or fourth years to a six-year comprehensive school.
In Northern Ireland there are grammar schools and secondary (intermediate)
schools, the latter being the equivalent of the secondary modern schools in
England and Wales. Some comprehensive type schools exist, and arrangements
for transfer between the other types of schools are flexible. In 1975 the Govern¬
ment announced its intention to undertake a feasibility study on the reorganisa¬
tion of secondary education.
Special education is provided for children who require it because of physical
or mental disability, including maladjustment, either in ordinary schools or
special schools (including hospital schools). There are some 1,800 special
schools including hospital schools, day and boarding schools. There are also
boarding homes for handicapped children attending ordinary schools.
There are ten categories of handicapped pupils in England, Wales and
Northern Ireland and nine in Scotland for whom local education authorities
must provide special educational treatment; blind, partially sighted, deaf,
partially hearing, delicate, educationally subnormal (mentally handicapped in
Scotland), epileptic, maladjusted, physically handicapped and children suffer¬
ing from speech defects. There is no separate category for the delicate in
Scotland. As many children have multiple handicaps there is a growing
tendency to relate educational needs to over-all medical condition and to use
the system of categories for administrative purposes only.
Independent schools in England and Wales receive no grants from public
funds but all are open to inspection and must register with the Department of
Education and Science or the Welsh Office which has power to require them to
remedy any objectionable features in their premises, accommodation or in¬
struction and to exclude any person regarded as unsuitable to teach in or to be
the proprietor of a school. In default, the appropriate Secretary of State can,
in effect, close a school, but schools have a right of appeal to an Independent
Schools Tribunal against any of the requirements. The schools whose stan¬
dards are regarded by the Department or the Welsh Office as comparable with
those of well-run maintained schools are, on application, granted the status
of ‘recognised as efficient’. Such schools (1,379 °f 2>433 independent schools
registered) contain 76 per cent of the pupils in independent schools. In
Scotland where there are 105 registered schools, the position is generally the
154

same except that there is no ‘recognised as efficient’ status. In Northern
Ireland there are only four independent schools; these have to be registered
with the Department of Education for Northern Ireland and be open to
inspection. As in England and Wales they receive no grants from public funds.
Independent schools cater for pupils of all ages. The largest and most
important of them are the public schools,1 which accept pupils at about 12 or
13 years of age usually on the basis of a fairly demanding examination. There
are about 260 public schools, most of them still single sex (about half of them
for girls) and at least partly boarding; but there are some coeducational schools
and certain boys’ schools have recently begun to admit some girls direct to
their top forms. Combined tuition and boarding in the public schools are
usually between £1,100 and £1,400 a year, but some of this may be remitted
for children winning competitive scholarship. A number of preparatory
schools, day and boarding, coeducational and single-sex prepare children for
entry to the public schools.
Over the past decade there has been a large increase in the number of pupils
staying on at each age beyond the minimum school-leaving age, which was
raised from 15 to 16 in 1972.
There is no national school-leaving examination in England and Wales, but
secondary school pupils may attempt examinations, in various subjects, leading
to the Certificate of Secondary Education (CSE) or the General Certificate of
Education (GCE). The CSE is designed for pupils completing five years
secondary education and is normally taken at the age of 16. It is controlled by
14 Regional Examining Boards, consisting mainly of teachers serving in the
schools which provide the candidates. The highest grade in the CSE (grade 1)
is widely accepted as being of the same standard as at least grade C at GCE
‘Ordinary’ level. Control over the scope and standards of the examinations is
exercised by the Schools Council (see p. 150) to ensure national comparability.
The GCE is conducted at ‘Ordinary’ (O) and ‘Advanced’ (A) levels. Normally
candidates taking ‘O’ level are about 16 years of age, although some take it
earlier, at the discretion of their head teacher. Most pupils in grammar, direct
grant and independent schools take the ‘O’ level examination, and so do a
number of pupils in comprehensive and other secondary schools.
Grade C or above in various subjects at GCE ‘O’ level and the equivalent
CSE grade 1 are usually considered to be qualifications for entry to courses of
further education and training. Since the inception of the CSE the number
achieving the highest grade has increased steadily as the popularity of the
examination has grown while GCE ‘O’ level subject performances have also
improved. The ‘A’ level examination is at the standard for entrance to univer¬
sity and for entry to many forms of professional training. Since 1965 the
number of school-leavers obtaining two or more ‘A’ levels (the minimum
qualification for entry to first degree courses at university) has increased by
nearly 25 per cent. Entries for both levels of the GCE are accepted from
candidates at further education establishments and from candidates entering
privately.
In Scotland examinations are conducted by the Scottish Certificate of
Education Examination Board. School pupils in the fourth year of secondary
1 ‘Public schools’ are usually taken to mean those schools in membership of the Head¬
masters’ Conference, the Governing Bodies Association or the Governing Bodies of
Girls’ Schools Association. Some other schools, mainly direct grant, in England and
Wales and grant-aided schools in Scotland, are also represented on these bodies. They
should not be confused with the state-supported public schools in Scotland.

courses sit an examination at 16 years for the award of passes on the Ordinary
grade of the Scottish Certificate of Education, and pupils in the fifth or sixth
year are presented for the Higher grade. Passes at the Higher grade are the
basis for entry to university or professional training. For those who have
completed their main studies at the Higher grade but wish to continue their
studies in particular subjects there is a Certificate of Sixth Year Studies.
In Northern Ireland candidates may take the Northern Ireland General
Certificate of Education or the Northern Ireland Certificate of Secondary
Education, which are equivalent to those examinations in England and
Wales.
Local education authorities and voluntary bodies are responsible, under the
general supervision of the central departments, for providing the schools and
other buildings needed for public education in their areas. The central
departments decide on the size and nature of the authorities’ individual
programmes in the light of national priorities; they also offer guidance to
authorities by means of building bulletins and in other ways.
Since 1945 an extensive school building programme has been carried out
resulting in the completion of about 15,700 new schools in Britain, together
with extensions, alterations and remodelling of existing state schools; over
8'8 million new places have been provided.
Grants of up to 85 per cent of the approved cost are normally available from
the Department of Education and Science or the Welsh Office for the building
of new voluntary aided schools and for alterations and external repairs to
existing aided schools.
In Northern Ireland capital grants of 80 per cent are available for voluntary
schools managed by maintained school committees and voluntary grammar
schools which have entered into an agreement under the relevant statutory
provisions.
The school building programme has provided for new ideas and methods in
design and construction. Industrialised building techniques have been widely
adopted. New schools are designed to be light, airy and colourful as well as
to have enough teaching area and space for auxiliary activities and outdoor
games. Space is being used more flexibly, particularly in primary schools to
meet the needs of new teaching methods.
Teachers are appointed by local education authorities or school governing
bodies or managers. In 1974 there were about 506,000 teachers (including the
full-time equivalent of part-time teachers) in publicly maintained schools in
Britain. The expected fall in school population (see p. 148) will, in the longer
term, permit continued improvement in the pupil-teacher ratio (about 20 to
one) without further expansion of the teacher force.
In 1973 the Advisory Committee on the Supply and Training of Teachers
was set up to advise the Secretary of State for Education and Science on the
supply and training of teachers for maintained schools and establishments of
further education in England and Wales. In 1974 there were about 71,000
full-time teachers in grant-aided establishments of further education in
Britain, and many more part-time teachers. There is also an increased use of
teachers’ aides (helpers) particularly in primary schools, while the rapid
growth in the number of teachers’ centres has helped the spread of new ideas
in teaching practice. Most teachers in technical colleges have had industrial
and professional experience.
There are national salary scales for teachers in schools and other educational

institutions maintained from public funds in England and Wales, in Scotland
and in Northern Ireland.
Further education is a broad term which may be used to cover all post-school
education. However, it is more commonly taken to exclude universities, though
now including teacher training (see p. 162). There are full-time, part-time and
evening courses, many of which lead to qualifications ranging from degree and
professional equivalents, through technician level, to a variety of non-advanced
qualifications. In addition adults of every age make extensive use of wide¬
spread and varied facilities for educational, cultural and leisure activities.
In England and Wales there are about 600 major establishments of further
education including polytechnics (see p. 162), technical colleges, colleges of
commerce, colleges of art, and a number of agricultural establishments. They
provide both full-time and part-time courses up to the levels of first and higher
degrees while their premises, as well as school and other premises, are often
used for the wide range of ‘adult education’ (see p. 157). There are also about
100 recognised independent institutions, over half of which teach English to
foreign students.
In Scotland there are about 70 local further education colleges offering full-
and part-time day courses and a number of evening courses and 14 central
institutions for further education doing mainly advanced work.
In Northern Ireland there are 28 institutions of further education.
Since most further education establishments in Britain are either maintained
or aided from public funds, tuition fees are moderate, and nearly always
remitted for young people under 18 years of age. Where industrial training is
provided by the colleges, charges (the responsibility of the employer) broadly
reflect the economic cost of provision. Many full-time students are helped by
awards from local education authorities. The awards, generally based on the
results of the General Certificate of Education or a corresponding examination,
are assessed to cover tuition fees and a maintenance grant, but parents who
can afford to contribute towards the cost are required to do so. There are also
some scholarships available from endowments, and from particular industries
or companies for the most promising of their young workers.
In autumn 1973 there were some 345,000 full-time and sandwich-course
students in grant-aided and independent establishments (304,000 in England
and Wales, 28,600 in Scotland and 12,400 in Northern Ireland) and 1,659,000
part-time students in major establishments of further education (1-5 million
in England and Wales, 136,500 in Scotland and 23,000 in Northern Ireland).
The total number of students on advanced courses in England and Wales was
about 208,000, in Scotland 20,900 and in Northern Ireland 3,780.
The courses provided are full-time or sandwich (up to five years in length,
generally consisting of alternate periods of about six months of full-time study
in a polytechnic, central institution or college and supervised experience in
industry); part-time day; block release (short periods in college); day release
(generally attendance at a college for one day a week during working hours);
and evening only.
EDUCATION
Sandwich courses in higher education are becoming increasingly popular.
At the lower levels the numbers of day release and block release courses are
considerable and have to a large extent replaced evening classes in certain
vocational subjects. Many students attend courses in which further education
and industrial training are combined.
Technical Courses There is a wide variety of courses for young people in various trades and occu¬
pations, leading to appropriate qualifications at the end of a course of up to five
years. ^Other, more academic, courses lead to the National Certificates and
Diplomas awarded by joint committees consisting of representatives of edu¬
cation departments, teacher organisations and the appropriate professional
bodies. The Technician Education Council was set up in 1973 with over-all
responsibility for developing a unified system of courses for technicians in
England, Wales and Northern Ireland, leading to awards which will eventually
replace those of the joint committees. A similar council has been established
in Scotland. Courses are normally at two levels, ordinary and higher. The
Ordinary National Certificate (ONC) courses normally last two years part-
time and students usually follow them between the ages of 16 and 19; the level
of the certificate is generally considered to approach that of GCE ‘A’ level.
The Ordinary National Diploma (OND) courses are the full-time or sandwich
counterparts of the ONC but involve wider and deeper study. The Higher
National Diploma (HND), which requires a further two years’ full-time or
three years sandwich study, is recognised, within its more restricted field, as
approaching the standard of a pass degree; the Higher National Certificate
(HNC), after two further years’ part-time study, is lower in standard because
it is more narrowly based.
Business and Many colleges of further education offer courses in shorthand, typing, book-
Secretarial Courses keeping, and office studies. Higher level work, however, is generally concen¬
trated in polytechnics or other colleges with a department of business studies.
Much business education is related to the specialised examination require¬
ments of various professional bodies; and courses leading to them are pro¬
vided in many further education colleges, although numbers of the candidates
taking such qualifications do so through correspondence courses. A Business
Education Council was established in 1974 with the same functions as the
Technician Education Council (see above) in relation to courses of business
education. In Scotland, similar courses lead to the Scottish National Certifi¬
cate, the Scottish Higher National Certificate and the Scottish National
Diploma in Business Studies, awarded by the Scottish Business Education
Council. Courses leading to the certificate of business administration are
provided for students in junior administrative positions.
Adult Education Adult education is generally taken to mean courses of post-school education
outside the main areas of higher, professional and technical education. In 1974
nearly 3 million people registered for such courses which were provided by
local education authorities, various voluntary and statutory bodies, certain
residential colleges, and the adult education (‘extra-mural’) departments of
universities.
The residential colleges, the university departments and certain voluntary
bodies recognised as competent to provide adult education, receive govern¬
ment grants. So do various national bodies which promote educational
activities of a non-political kind, such as the National Federation of Women’s
i58
BRITAIN 1976: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Institutes and the National Council of Young Men’s Christian Associations.
Many of these bodies also receive grants from local education authorities for
services rendered locally.
A major part of adult education is financed by local education authorities
and provided mainly in their establishments, including schools (used for
adult evening classes). Most of the courses are part time and about 2-5 million
students attended such local authority adult education classes in 1974. In
addition local education authorities maintained or aided most of the short-term
residential colleges or centres, of which there are about 40 in England and
Wales, and which provide courses varying in length between a weekend and
a fortnight. Many of the courses are practical, but there are widespread
opportunities for academic study.
Long-term residential colleges (6 in England and Wales, 1 in Scotland)
which are grant-aided by the education departments, provide courses of one
or two years, some of which lead to a diploma. The colleges aim to provide a
liberal education and do not apply academic entry tests. Most students admit¬
ted to them are entitled to full maintenance grants at mandatory rates. The
extra-mural departments of the universities and the Workers’ Educational
Association (WEA), the largest of the recognised voluntary bodies, provide
extended part-time courses of more academic studies, though recently there
has been a tendency for more short courses organised for special (including
vocational) interests. Often the WEA provides the organisation and the
teaching is provided by the extra-mural departments, many of which have full¬
time staff appointed for this purpose and can also call on the services of other
departments of the university. In 1973-74 some 350,000 students attended
such courses. Similar work is promoted in some education authority centres.
A recent development has been the spread of community schools and
colleges and community centres. Community schools and colleges, which are
now found in urban as well as rural areas, are secondary schools planned as
cultural community centres, providing educational, social and cultural oppor¬
tunities for the whole community. Community centres have a more social
character and, though aided financially by the local education authorities, are
usually managed by voluntary community associations many of which are
affiliated to the National Federation of Community Associations.
The National Institute of Adult Education provides a national centre of
information, research and publication for adult education, as well as a channel
of co-operation and consultation for the many organisations in England and
Wales which are interested in this subject. It is mainly financed by contribu¬
tions from local education authorities and assisted by a grant from the Depart¬
ment of Education and Science. The National Institute of Adult Education
has created an Adult Literacy Resource Agency to administer additional
resources amounting to some £1 million which the Government is making
available until March 1976 to assist local education authorities and other
organisations working to combat adult illiteracy. The Scottish Institute of
Adult Education is the corresponding body in Scotland.
In Northern Ireland extra-mural departments of the Queen’s University of
Belfast and the New University of Ulster organise and staff adult education
classes which are supplemented by classes organised by various non-official
bodies. The Workers’ Educational Association is responsible for classes at
other than university level and receives grants from the Department of
Education and the education and library boards. The department has estab¬
lished a Council for Continuancy Education which will advise on the co¬
ordination of the work being done and assist planning for the future.

TECHNIQUES
EDUCATION
Broadcasting is a major resource for teachers in schools. About nine out of
ten schools can receive television, and almost all have radios. Nearly all
primary schools use educational programmes at some time, and some seven
out of ten secondary schools use educational broadcasts. All Independent
Television (ITV) and most British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) television
programmes are broadcast in colour, though comparatively few schools are
yet equipped to receive in colour.
On average one in three secondary schools now have video-taping facilities.
This has begun to influence the style in which programmes are made. Two
of the three television channels (see p. 447) are devoted to schools broadcasting
throughout the morning in term-time. Radio broadcasts are transmitted
nationally on one VHF channel morning and afternoon, and in addition many
local radio stations provide some appropriate local educational broadcasting.
Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland are also served with regional educa¬
tional television broadcasts by both BBC and ITV.
Adults are also provided for in a variety of programmes, often linked to a
range of supplementary publications and activities. Most BBC radio pro¬
grammes are grouped in hourly study sessions on five nights a week and week¬
end afternoons. Television programmes are shown on Saturday and Sunday
mornings and at midday and in the later evening on weekdays. Both BBC and
ITV provide programmes at successive intellectual levels from domestic,
social and craft skills to progressive vocational training. The BBC channels
and production teams are also used to produce radio and television pro¬
grammes in support of Open University courses (see p. 168).
A number of other audio-visual aids are in use throughout the educational
system. Most universities and a high proportion of colleges of education have
closed-circuit television; it is also available in many further education colleges
and schools. Use is made of language laboratories in schools and institutions
of further and higher education.
Schools and colleges co-ordinate different methods of audio-visual presenta¬
tion, including radio, television, films, colour slides, wall charts, maps, models
and tape recordings. For example, the BBC’s ‘Radiovision’ programmes for
schools use coloured film strips in conjunction with a tape recording of the
broadcast and a similar technique is used in support activities provided with
some ITV schools programmes. The Council for Educational Technology for
the United Kingdom and the Educational Foundation for Visual Aids advise
all bodies connected with education and with training in industry and in the
Services on the use of audio-visual aids.
HIGHER
EDUCATION
The system of higher education includes universities, polytechnics and central
institutions, colleges of education and advanced courses at colleges of further
education. There has been a rapid expansion in higher education in the last
decade; the numbers in full-time higher education in Britain increased
from 222,400 in 1962 to 490,000 in 1973-74. This expansion has been
achieved by increasing the number of universities; by concentrating much of
the advanced work in further education establishments in the polytechnics
and central institutions and thus providing opportunities for students to gain
a degree outside a university; by introducing new courses leading to a Bachelor
of Education (B.Ed) degree; and by the establishment of the Open University
which provides people, with or without formal qualifications, with the
opportunity of studying for a degree.
Universities
There are now 44 universities in Britain—without counting the Open
l6o BRITAIN 1976: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
University (see below)—compared with 17 in 1945. Although the Government
is responsible for providing about 90 per cent of universities’ income it does
not control their work or teaching nor does it have direct dealings with the
universities. The grants are distributed by the University Grants Committee,
a body appointed by the Secretary of State for Education and Science to
advise on state aid to the universities; its members are drawn from the
academic and business worlds.
The English universities are: Aston1 (Birmingham), Bath,1 Birmingham,
Bradford,1 Bristol, Brunei1 (London), Cambridge, City1 (London), Durham,
East Anglia,1 Essex,1 Exeter, Hull, Keele, Kent at Canterbury,1 Lancaster,1
Leeds, Leicester, Liverpool, London, Loughborough,1 Manchester, Newcastle
upon Tyne, Nottingham, Oxford, Reading, Salford,1 Sheffield, Southampton,
Surrey,1 Sussex,1 Warwick,1 and York.1 The federated University of Wales
includes five university colleges, the Welsh National School of Medicine, and
the University of Wales Institute of Science and Technology. The Scottish
universities are: Aberdeen, Dundee,1 Edinburgh, Glasgow, Heriot-Watt1
(Edinburgh), St. Andrews, Stirling,1 and Strathclyde1 (Glasgow). In Northern
Ireland there is the Queen’s University of Belfast, and the New University of
Ulster1 in Coleraine (see p. 163).
The Universities of Oxford and Cambridge date from the twelfth and
thirteenth centuries and the Scottish Universities of St. Andrews, Glasgow,
Aberdeen and Edinburgh from the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries. All the
other universities were founded in the nineteenth or twentieth centuries.
There are five other institutions where the work is of university standard:
the University of Manchester Institute of Science and Technology; the two
postgraduate business schools (see p. 163) which are supported jointly by
industry and the Government—the Manchester Business School and the
London Graduate School of Business Studies; Cranfield Institute of Tech¬
nology for mainly postgraduate work in aeronautics and other subjects; and
the Royal College of Art.
The Open University is a non-residential university which provides part-
time degree and other courses, using a combination of television and radio
broadcasts, correspondence courses and summer schools, together with a net¬
work of viewing and listening centres. No formal academic qualifications are
required to register for these courses, but the standards of its degrees (which
are awarded on a system of credits for each course completed) are the same as
those of other universities. The university is financed by fees and a direct
grant from the Department of Education and Science. The first courses began 1
in January 1971 and in July 1975 some 50,000 students were following courses.
In 1974, the Open University set up a consultancy service to make its advice
and facilities available on a fee-paying but non-profit-making basis to bodies
throughout the world interested in ‘teaching at a distance projects.
University Finance In spite of the large sums of public money spent on universities they have
remained autonomous institutions, due largely to the existence of the Univer¬
sity Grants Committee. The Committee acts as a link between the Government !
from which it receives a block grant and the universities to which it allocates
this grant. In all the Government contributes about 90 per cent towards
both the current income of universities and towards their capital programmes
for building work, purchasing sites and properties, professional fees and
furniture and equipment. Further sums are raised by the universities.

In Great Britain the recurrent grants for the academic year 1975—76 are
estimated to be about ^4^5 million, about six times as much as in 1963-64.
Capital grants are expected to be about ^15 million. The Comptroller and
Auditor General, a permanent officer of the crown (see p. 362), has access to
the books and records of the University Grants Committee and the universities
to check that the funds entrusted to the universities are efficiently administered.
He cannot question policy decisions or those reached on academic grounds.
Courses in arts and science are offered by most universities. Imperial College,
London, the University of Manchester Institute of Science and Technology
and some of the newer universities concentrate on technology although they
also offer a number of courses in social studies, modern languages and other
non-technological subjects. About 47 per cent of full-time university students
in Britain are taking arts or social studies courses and 38 per cent science and
technology: about 10 per cent are studying medicine, dentistry and health,
and the remainder agriculture, forestry, veterinary science, architecture and
town and country planning.
University degree courses generally extend over three or four years, though
in medicine, dentistry and veterinary science five or six years are required.
The first degree of Bachelor (Master in the arts faculties of the older Scottish
universities and in Dundee) is awarded on the completion of such a course,
depending on satisfactory examination results. Further study or research is
required at the modern universities for the degree of Master and by all
universities for that of Doctor. Actual degree titles vary according to the
practice of each university. A uniform standard of degree throughout the
country is ensured by having external examiners on all examining boards. In
the last decade there has been a tendency for degree courses to become more
broadly based in subject matter, particularly in the new universities. A recent
innovation has been the introduction of ‘modular’ degree courses which
provide more flexibility for students in their choice of courses.
University teaching combines lectures, practical classes (in scientific sub¬
jects) and small group teaching in either seminars or tutorials.
Most members of the academic staffs devote time to research and at all
universities there are postgraduate students engaged in research.
Admission to the universities is by examination and selection; there is no
religious test and no colour bar. Women are admitted on equal terms with
men but at Cambridge their numbers may be limited by ordinance. The general
proportion of men to women students is less than three to one; at Oxford it is
over four to one, and at Cambridge seven to one. Just under a half of all full¬
time university students in Britain are living in colleges and halls of residence,
over one-third are in privately rented accommodation, and the remainder live
at home.
Prospective candidates for nearly all the universities apply for places through
the Universities Central Council on Admissions. The only students to apply
directly are applicants to the Open University and British candidates who
apply only to the universities of Glasgow, Aberdeen and Strathclyde.
In 1973-74 there were about 244,500 full-time university students in
Great Britain, including about 27,700 postgraduates, and 24,400 part-time
students. Some 32,170 home and overseas candidates were also registered for
London University’s external first degree examinations.
In 1973-74 the1"6 were 37,000 full-time university teachers in Great Britain;

about icy per cent of them were professors. The ratio of staff to students was
about one to eight, one of the most favourable in the world.
Teachers in maintained schools must hold qualifications approved by the
education departments. In England, Wales, and Northern Ireland the majority
have qualified by under-taking a three-year course at one of some 150 colleges
of education, so as to obtain a teacher’s certificate. Since 1970 professional
training for newly qualified people with degrees and certain other specialist
qualifications, before then entitled to teach without further training, has
become mandatory for all school teachers except temporarily, mathematics
and science teachers in secondary schools. Such courses have been at colleges
of education and in university education departments.
From 1 st August 1975, the system of teacher training in England and Wales
is being basically reorganised. All higher and further education outside the
universities including teacher training is being assimilated into a common
system. A number of the existing colleges of education are to be merged
either with each other or with other colleges of further education, while some
are to discontinue completely the initial training of teachers. As the first
move towards a wholly graduate profession, three- and four-year degree
courses incorporating educational studies are being developed, although the
three-year certificate courses will also be maintained as long as they are
needed.
In Scotland all teachers in education authority and grant-aided schools
must be registered with the General Teaching Council for Scotland. Courses
in colleges of education lead to the award of a Teaching Qualification (Primary
Education) or a Teaching Qualification (Secondary Education). Graduates
and holders of specialist diplomas undergo a one-year course; courses in
practical and aesthetic subjects for non-graduates extend to two, three or four
years. For primary teaching the course extends to one year for graduates and
three for non-graduates. Most Scottish colleges of education also offer four-
year courses leading to the degree of Bachelor of Education.
The education departments, universities, local authorities and other bodies
provide a variety of short in-service training courses for practising teachers.
In 1973-74 about 230,000 students in Great Britain were taking advanced
courses other than in universities and colleges of education in a wide variety
of subjects including architecture, art and design (see p. 430), catering, engin¬
eering, natural sciences, social work and business and management studies.
An increasing proportion of the students were taking courses leading to the
awards of the Council for National Academic Awards. The council has power
to award degrees and other academic qualifications, comparable in standard
with those granted by universities, to students who successfully complete
approved courses of study in establishments which do not have the power to
award their own degrees. In the academic year i973_74 some 600 courses
were being followed by about 43,500 students. These courses ranged from
science and technology to the arts, social studies, business studies and law. In
1974 the council approved its first teacher training courses including some
leading to the B.Ed. degree.
In England and Wales higher education provision outside universities and
colleges of education is being concentrated within 30 major national institutions
named ‘polytechnics’. They are comprehensive institutions providing all types
of courses (full-time, sandwich, and part-time) at all levels of higher education.

EDUCATION
In Scotland similar provision is made in 14 central institutions and a few
further education colleges managed by education authorities.
Management studies are provided by polytechnics and other further edu¬
cation colleges, notably those designated as regional centres of management
education. Courses for the post-experience postgraduate Diploma in Manage¬
ment Studies are run by about 80 colleges; and some polytechnics run courses
leading to the Master’s degree of the Council for National Academic Awards.
In addition there is a wide range of other provision much of which is specific¬
ally designed to meet the needs of industry or of professional bodies.
Awards to enable students to undertake higher education are made under one
of the most generous grant systems in the world. It is national policy that no
school leaver should be prevented by lack of means from taking an advanced
course at a university or elsewhere. As a result, over 90 per cent of students in
higher education in Great Britain are aided from public funds.
In England, Wales and Scotland persons ordinarily resident in Britain can
obtain awards from public funds in order to attend full time at a university,
college of education or major further education establishment which has
accepted them as students. In England and Wales local education authorities
provide awards. In Scotland students’ allowances for advanced courses are
granted by the Scottish Education Department. The amount of these awards
depends upon the income of the student and his or her parents or spouse.
Grants for postgraduate study are offered annually by the Department of
Education and Science, the Research Councils and the Scottish Education
Department.
Two institutions provide university education in Northern Ireland—the
Queen’s University of Belfast and the New University of Ulster, Coleraine.
The New University consists of four schools (biological studies, social and
economic studies, physical sciences and humanities) and an education centre
with the status of a school. Technological studies are provided at the Queen’s
University of Belfast, in addition to a wide range of courses in other faculties.
In October 1974 there were 5,467 full-time students at the Queen’s Univer¬
sity and 1,589 at the New University. Government grants to the universities
are made by the Department of Education which first seeks the advice of the
University Grants Committee.
Higher education outside the universities is mainly centred in a new poly¬
technic called Ulster College which had 2,290 full-time and 2,144 part-time
students in 1974-75.
Teacher training takes place in the two university education departments,
three colleges of education, the Ulster College and one technical college. In
1974-75 there were about 3,300 students in training. The principal courses are
three-year (certificate) and four-year (Bachelor of Education) but there are also
one-year courses for graduates or holders of other appropriate qualifications.
University and further education scholarships are awarded by the education
and library boards and postgraduate awards and teacher-training scholarships
by the Department of Education, the conditions of award being the same as
those for Great Britain.
EDUCATIONAL Research into the theory and practice of education and the organisation of
EARCH educational services is supported financially by the education departments, local
education authorities, philanthropic organisations, universities and teachers’

associations. The Schools Council and the Social Science Research Council are
additional channels for government support.
The major institute undertaking research in education, outside the universi¬
ties, is the National Foundation for Educational Research in England and
Wales, an autonomous body which derives its income mainly from corporate
members, including local education authorities, teachers’ organisations and
universities and from an annual grant from the Department of Education and
Science. There are also the Scottish Council for Research in Education and the
Northern Ireland Council for Educational Research.
Some research is undertaken at colleges of education and polytechnics and
by a few independent research organisations.
There are many opportunities for overseas students to study in Britain and for
British students to study abroad and some British teachers serve overseas for a
period.
British membership of the European Community is creating closer educational
ties with other member countries. Both at school level and in the colleges and
universities there has been an expansion of interest in European studies and
languages. Post-to-post exchanges of teachers have been encouraged by
government-sponsored schemes which are administered by the Central
Bureau for Educational Visits and Exchanges. The bureau also makes appoint¬
ments available to European teachers wishing to teach in Britain and negotiates
posts on an in-service training basis for British teachers wishing to further
their experience in another European country. Britain has adhered to the
Statute of the European Schools (six of which have been established through¬
out the Community) to provide school education for children of people
employed in the European Community institutions. Negotiations are in
progress to promote recognition of professional qualifications which will
enable qualified people to practise anywhere in the Community.
Students come to Britain from countries throughout the world to study at
universities or other educational institutions or for professional training. In
the academic year 1973-74 there were about 95,000 overseas students in
Britain, of whom about 25,000 were at universities, another 27,000 at technical
colleges and the remainder learning English or training as teachers, nurses, for
the law, banking and accountancy, or in industry. About 61 per cent of all over¬
seas students were from the Commonwealth and about three-quarters were
from developing countries.
As part of British technical assistance to developing countries, the Ministry
of Overseas Development supports 12,000-14,000 students with subsistence
and fees, encourages the development of special courses of particular value to
students from developing countries and of advisory and welfare services to
meet their needs.
A wide range of public and private fellowships and scholarships for advanced
study in Britain are awarded annually to students and research workers from
other countries. Under the Commonwealth Scholarship and Fellowship Plan,
the governments of certain Commonwealth countries have made awards avail¬
able at their own institutions of higher education to men and women from other
Commonwealth countries. At the beginning of the academic year 1974-75,
711 scholarships and fellowships (including medical awards) were held in
Britain under the plan. The Commonwealth Education Fellowship Scheme
provides opportunities for further training, study and research for teachers and
EDUCATION !6^
others with appropriate experience. In 1974-75 there were 602 study fellow¬
ships tenable for periods of between three months and three years.
About 45 British Council1 scholarships tenable usually for one year in
Britain, and 25 British Council Fellowships tenable for two to three years, are
offered annually to graduates of overseas universities. Thirty Marshall Scholar¬
ships for two years study at any university in Britain are offered annually by
the British Government to graduates from the United States of America and
over 60 Rhodes Scholarships are awarded annually to Commonwealth and
United States graduates for two years of study at the University of Oxford. A
further two Rhodes Scholarships are awarded to graduates from the Federal
Republic of Germany. Other universities and colleges themselves offer many
scholarships for which graduate students of any nationality are eligible.2
Fellowships and training awards for study in British institutions are avail¬
able under the Central Treaty Organisation, the Colombo Plan, the Special
Commonwealth African Assistance Plan and British technical assistance
programmes for many countries. Over 1,400 awards for study or training in
Britain are also made under the United Nations Programmes of Technical
Assistance and by the United Nations specialised agencies such as UNESCO,
FAO, and WHO, and also under OECD and certain Council of Europe
schemes.
The Commonwealth Education Liaison Committee supplements normal
direct dealings on education between the countries of the Commonwealth, and
regular Commonwealth education conferences are held.
The national representatives in London (Office of the High Commissioner or
Embassy) of a number of countries accept certain special responsibilities for
their students in Britain. The British Council acts as an agent for the British
Government in matters affecting the welfare of overseas students, and provides
certain services, such as meeting on arrival, introduction courses, an accom¬
modation bureau and a student centre in London which organises a varied
programme of lectures, discussions and social and other activities and arranges
introductions of students to people who wish to invite them to their homes. In
the vacations there are courses in many parts of the country which offer oppor¬
tunities for getting to know more about British life in town and country. In
term time there are visits to various places of interest, and theatre and concert
parties are arranged.

The purpose of the British Council (founded in 1934) is defined in its Royal Charter as
the promotion of a wider knowledge of the United Kingdom and the English language
abroad and the development of closer cultural relations between Britain and other
countries. The council is governed by an executive committee of 30 members, broadly
representative of many elements of the life of Britain, and including eight members
nominated by ministers. It is financed almost entirely from public funds. The activities
of the council, which has staff in 78 overseas countries, are advising and assisting in
English teaching and other educational work including science; fostering personal
contacts between British and overseas people, especially in the educational, professional
and scientific fields, running, or helping to maintain, libraries of British books and
periodicals overseas; and presenting overseas British achievements and the arts. Its
work in Britain is concerned mainly with professional visitors and with the welfare of
overseas students.
2 The Association of Commonwealth Universities publishes two handbooks, Awards
for Commonwealth University Staff (see Bibliography p. 472) and Scholarships Guide
for Commonwealth Postgraduate Students, which include information about sources of
financial aid available for use in Britain. The association promotes co-operation between
Commonwealth universities. Its activities include the provision of publication and in¬
formation services, and ofsecretariats for various bodies affecting its member institutions
such as the Commonwealth Scholarship Commission and the Marshall Aid Commemora¬
tion Commission.

students are Rotary, Round Table, the Victoria League, the Royal Over-Seas
League, the Royal Commonwealth Society, the National Union of Students,
the English-Speaking Union and Churches of all denominations. The United
Kingdom Council for Overseas Student Affairs, established in 1968, is an
independent central body serving overseas students and organisations and
individuals concerned in overseas student affairs; it provides both a forum for
the exchange of ideas and machinery for consultation with government and
other authorities. In many London boroughs and in other large cities there are
committees which help students to make contact with local residents and
organisations. These organisations also help by entertaining overseas students
and many of them have established hostels with the financial help of the Over¬
seas Students Welfare Expansion Programme which is administered by the
British Council. By the beginning of 1975 grants had been approved for 150
projects, providing places for about 7,000 students.
British Students
Overseas
In 1974-75 27 awards were accepted by British students in Common¬
wealth countries under the Commonwealth Scholarship and Fellowship Plan
(see p 164). In addition the Study and Serve Scheme, administered by the
Inter-University Council for Higher Education Overseas, enables British
students to spend two years in a developing country, the time being devoted
equally to study, which may or may not lead to a postgraduate qualification,
and service, usually in the form of university employment in the country
concerned. , ^
The United States-United Kingdom Educational Commission (still some¬
times called the Fulbright-Hays Commission) offers travel and maintenance
grants for postgraduate study in the United States. Notable among
recently established scholarships are the Kennedy scholarships, to enable |
British students to study at three American universities, and the Churchill
travel scholarships, for men and women in all walks of life. British students are
also offered scholarships at institutions of higher education in many European
and non-European countries outside the Commonwealth.
Teachers
Serving
Overseas
Over 1 260 teachers were recruited in Britain during 1974 for posts in schools,
colleges of education, technical colleges and universities in developing
countries, including over 1,100 for posts in the developing countries of the
Commonwealth; almost all of them are supported by public funds. Recruit¬
ment is carried out by the Ministry of Overseas Development, the British
Council and the voluntary teacher recruiting agencies, such as Christians
Abroad. Some developing countries carry out their own recruitment of British
teachers through their offices in London.
During 1974 about 1,200 British teachers served in universities in developing
countries, most of them recruited through the Inter-University Council for
Higher Education Overseas and the Association of Commonwealth Univer¬
sities and the British Council. Government encouragement also includes sup¬
port for a number of schemes of assistance for overseas universities which are
administered by the Inter-University Council, including the scheme for Special
Commonwealth Awards, which are made to leading scholars from British
universities who are willing to work for a minimum of two years in important
posts in the universities of developing Commonwealth countries.
Outside these schemes, four voluntary organisations, co-ordinated under the
British Volunteer Programme (BVP), recruit graduate and qualified volunteers
and a few cadet volunteers for service overseas. Of the 1,904 overseas in

Schemes under which teachers in Britain exchange posts for a year with
teachers overseas include one with the United States and another with
Commonwealth countries involving each year about 200 British teachers.
Official exchange schemes also operate between Britain and several European
countries both for teachers and for temporary assistants’ posts for language
specialists. The largest of these schemes is the modern languages assistants’
scheme, administered by the Central Bureau for Educational Visits and
Exchanges, which enables students and young teachers to serve overseas,
particularly in Europe, and for their counterparts to serve in Britain.
Several schemes designed to assist interchange between institutions of higher
education in Britain and overseas countries through staff visits are adminis¬
tered by the British Council. Study and research visits by British and overseas
scholars are supported through programmes of the British Academy, the
Royal Society, the Science Research Council, and other British and inter¬
national bodies.
Britain provides, on request, assistance to the developing countries in several
other ways, including the loan of educational experts for specialist missions
and technical and consultant services. Areas of particular activity include the
introduction of new materials, methods and techniques. This assistance is
provided through various educational organisations, the Ministry of Overseas
Development and the British Council.
THE YOUTH SERVICE
The aim of the youth service is to help young people to broaden their interests,
to enjoy recreational pursuits, and to mix socially in their leisure time.
The service (which in Scotland forms part of the Youth and Community
Service) is provided by local education authorities and voluntary organisations,
in co-operation with the government education departments. Membership of
youth groups is voluntary and groups vary greatly in their activities, there
being no attempt to impose uniformity or to create anything in the nature of a
national youth movement.
Organised activities for young people were first promoted by voluntary bodies,
often of a religious nature, during the nineteenth century, and the number of
such organisations and the range of their activities have continued to grow
over the past 100 years. The involvement of local authorities and the education
departments in the youth service dates back principally to the 1940s when the
service first became recognised as part of the education system.
The education departments formulate broad policy objectives for the service
and encourage their achievements through financial assistance and advice. They
make known the Government’s attitude by means of circulars to local education
authorities and through qpntacts between departmental officials and representa¬
tives of the authorities and the voluntary organisations. The Scottish Educa¬
tion Department is advised by a council representing both statutory and
voluntary bodies concerned in youth and community work, while in Northern
Ireland the advisory body is a Youth Committee. Financially the education
departments assist voluntary organisations through grants towards their costs
for central administration and building projects.

Training of
Youth Workers
BRITAIN 1976: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Local education authorities assist local voluntary groups by lending premises
and equipment and by contributing to their capital and running costs. Many
authorities also construct and run youth centres and clubs; in Great Britain
there are several thousand youth centres fully run by local education authorities.
Most authorities have appointed youth committees on which official and
voluntary bodies are represented, and employ youth organisers to co-ordinate
youth work in their areas and to arrange in-service training. In Scotland these
committees and organisers are normally concerned with services for both
young people and adults.
Although the number of local education authority youth clubs and centres
is growing, national voluntary organisations still promote the largest share of
youth activities through local groups, which raise most of their day-to-day
running expenses by their own efforts; these have an estimated membership
of 5-5 million. Some 38 national youth organisations and 141 local co-ordinating
bodies are full members of the National Council for Voluntary Youth Services
(NCVYS), a consultative body which takes action only in the name and with
the consent of its member bodies; a further 18 organisations are observers. In
Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland there are similar representative bodies.
Among the largest of the voluntary youth organisations belonging to
NCVYS are the Scout and Girl Guides Associations (with about 600,000 and
800,000 members), the National Association of Youth Clubs (400,000), the
National Association of Boys’ Clubs (170,000) and the Youth Hostels Associa¬
tion (about 300,000 including Scotland and Northern Ireland).
Certain pre-Service organisations for boys, which provide facilities for
social, educational and physical development along with training for possible
entry to the armed forces, are also members of NCVYS; they are assisted
financially by the Ministry of Defence.
Local education authority youth groups in England and Wales normally cater
for young people of both sexes mainly in the 14-20 age-range.
Some voluntary organisations cater for young people on a single-sex basis
and their membership often covers a wider age-range. An official survey
published in 1972 on the Youth Service and similar provision (see Bibliography
p. 474) showed that some two-thirds of youngpeople aged 14-20 were members
of a club or association (including associations attached to schools, colleges and
universities, and places of work). The survey also indicated that 68 per cent or
more had at sometime been members of a youth club. A smaller proportion of
girls than boys takes part in youth club activities and the main involvement is
between the ages of 14 and 16.
There are about 3,000 full-time youth workers in Great Britain and these are
supported by many thousands of part-time workers, many of them unpaid.
Part-time workers usually have no professional qualification in youth work
but some have allied qualifications, for instance as teachers, and a large
number attend short courses and conferences on youth work. Qualified school
teachers are recognised as qualified youth workers.
In England and Wales, there is a basic two-year training for youth and
community workers. Provided at 'colleges of education and further education,
the course leads to a professional qualification. In addition a number of colleges
of education provide a study of youth work as a principal or subsidiary subject
within a teacher-training course. In Scotland one- and three-year courses are
provided at certain colleges of education and in Northern Ireland courses
are provided by the Ulster College.

There are in Britain a number of organisations, which, although primarily
concerned with the welfare and out-of-school pursuits of young people, operate
in a context broader than that of any individual youth movement. Among the
most important are the Sports Councils for England, Wales, Scotland and
Northern Ireland (see p. 454), which provide practical and advisory services
for many youth organisations; the National Playing Fields Association, which
advises local authorities and sports organisations on the acquisition, layout,
construction and use of sports grounds; and the Outward Bound Trust, which
maintains five schools in areas of outstanding natural beauty and offers full¬
time residential courses designed to encourage a sense of adventure, responsi¬
bility, confidence and achievement.
The Duke of Edinburgh’s Award Scheme, which operates through bodies
such as local authorities, schools, youth organisations and industrial firms, is
designed as a challenge to young people to reach certain standards in leisure¬
time activities with the voluntary assistance of adults. Some 200,000 young
people between the ages of 14 and 25 from Britain and other Commonwealth
countries took part in the scheme in 1974. There are three awards—Bronze,
Silver and Gold—for each of which young people must attempt activities in
four out of five sections: service; interests; expeditions; and either physical
activity or design for living.
The King George’s Jubilee Trust is a charitable body which, since its
creation in 1935, has distributed more than ^2 99 million in grants to voluntary
youth organisations and towards experimental youth projects.
The National Youth Bureau is a forum for association, discussion and joint
action for those concerned with the social education of young people. It
provides information services, training services and services to research and
experiment including the maintenance of a research register. The bureau also
has a specialist information unit on social work with young people. In Scot¬
land the Board for Information in Youth and Community Service undertakes
similar functions.
There has been considerable growth in voluntary service by young people to
those in need in the community, for example, the elderly, the sick, the mentally
ill and the handicapped. Organisations such as International Voluntary Service,
Task Force and Community Service Volunteers receive grants from the
Government, and through them thousands of young people are doing full¬
er part-time voluntary work for the community. Many schools organise
community service activities as part of the curriculum.
The Young Volunteer Force Foundation is an independent body which
advises interested organisations in England and Wales on methods of involving
young people in providing service to the community. The Foundation is grant-
aided by the Government and employs teams of young people who are available
on request to assist such bodies as local authorities, voluntary organisations
and hospital boards in encouraging and promoting voluntary service. In
Scotland, a similar organisation, ‘Enterprise Youth’, exists to co-ordinate
and promote voluntary service to the community.
8 Environmental
Planning
Over many years successive British Governments have taken action to manage
and protect the environment, and have established a legal and administrative
framework, particularly of planning law, to control development, to reduce
pollution and to encourage positive planning to ensure the wise use of land.
The basis of the modern system of land use planning—derived from legis¬
lation passed in 1947—is contained in the Town and Country Planning Acts of
1971 (for England and Wales) and 1972 (for Scotland). There is a centralised
planning structure under the Secretaries of State for the Environment, Scot¬
land and Wales, and compulsory planning duties are imposed on all local
planning authorities. Large scale strategic planning in England and Wales is
the responsibility of the county councils and the Greater London Council
while district councils and the councils of the London boroughs and the City of
London are responsible for most local plans and development control, the main
housing functions, and many other environmental health matters. The two
types of authority exercise concurrent powers over, for example, the acquisi¬
tion and disposal of land for planning purposes, development and redevelop¬
ment, parks, playing fields, open spaces and coast protection. In Scotland,
planning functions are undertaken by regional and district councils whose
responsibilities are divided on a basis broadly similar to that in England
and Wales. In the more rural regions and islands areas, all planning responsi¬
bilities are carried out by the regional and islands councils respectively.
In Northern Ireland the Department of Housing, Local Government and
Planning is responsible for planning matters through its local offices which
work closely with the district councils and the local offices of the Housing
Executive (see p. 182). District councils have local environmental health
responsibilities.
Development A planning system of structure and local plans was introduced in England
Plans and Wales in the late 1960s and is being progressively brought into operation.
The system is designed to reduce administrative delays, to emphasise positive
planning for the creation of a pleasant environment rather than a negative
control of undesirable development, and to enable the public to play a
greater part in the planning process. Structure plans are prepared by county
planning authorities and require ministerial approval. They set out broad
policies for the future use and development of land (including traffic manage¬
ment) and indicate ‘action areas’ where comprehensive development or im¬
provement is expected to start within a specified period. Local plans, which
have to conform with the structure plan, contain detailed proposals including
plans for ‘action areas’ and are normally prepared by district councils, though
sometimes by county councils. Local plans are adopted by the planning
authorities without being subject to ministerial approval unless the Secretary
of State calls in a plan for his own decision. All plans are under continuous

review and may be altered periodically. A similar planning system was intro¬
duced in Scotland in May 1975.
The local authorities have wide powers for undertaking development, in¬
cluding the compulsory purchase of land. With a few exceptions, all other
development (which includes most forms of construction, mineral extraction
and any material change made in the use of land or existing buildings) can be
carried out only after the local planning authority has given its permission.
Members of the public and interested organisations are given an opportunity
to express their views on the planning of their areas during the formative
stages of the structure and local plans. The local planning authorities must
ensure adequate publicity for matters proposed for inclusion in the plans;
representations may be made about them to the authorities. Where specific
proposals for development differ substantially from the intentions of a develop¬
ment plan, they must be publicised locally. Other schemes affecting a large
number of people are usually advertised by the local planning authority and
applications seeking permission for certain types of development must also
be advertised. There is a right of appeal to the appropriate Secretary of State
if planning permission is refused or granted subject to conditions; in England
and Wales some 75 per cent of appeals are transferred to inspectors for
decision. An appellant always has the right to put his case before an inspector
appointed by the Secretary of State.
The Secretary of State can direct that a planning application be referred to
him for decision. This power is exercised sparingly and only in respect of
proposals of national or regional importance. The applicant has the right to
be heard by a person appointed by the Secretary of State and a public inquiry
is normally held for this purpose. In the case of development schemes of
national or regional importance or of a technical or scientific nature and if an
ordinary inquiry is inadequate for the purpose, the ministers responsible may
decide to set up planning inquiry commissions to carry out investigations and
hold inquiries locally. Where highway development is proposed, the Secre¬
taries of State for the Environment, Scotland and Wales can hold such
inquiries as they consider appropriate.
Voluntary organisations are particularly active in ensuring that proposed
changes in the use of land take full account of the interests of the public and
considerations of amenity. The National Trust for England, Wales and North¬
ern Ireland, founded in 1895, is the largest private landowner in Britain and
has over 450,000 members. For the benefit of the public it owns and protects
from harmful development 440,000 acres (176,000 hectares) of land, 200
historic buildings and large stretches of coastline. Properties in Scotland
covering some 80,000 acres (32,000 hectares) are protected by the National
Trust for Scotland, an independent body founded in 1931, which has nearly
65,000 members.
The Town and Country Planning Association, founded in 1899, seeks to
improve the qualities of land use and planning in Britain, and helped to pro¬
mote, for example, the first new towns legislation. The Civic Trust, estab¬
lished in 1957, encourages interest in architecture and planning and makes
annual awards for good developments of all kinds. It supports and advises over
1,200 amenity societies.
Other voluntary societies concerned with amenity in town and country
include: the Council for the Protection of Rural England, the Council for the
Protection of Rural Wales, the Association for the Protection of Rural
Scotland and the Ulster Society for the Preservation of the Countryside; the

Association; the Society for the Protection of Ancient Buildings; the Georgian
Group and the Scottish Georgian Society; the Ulster Architectural Heritage
Society; the Victorian Society; the Pilgrim Trust; and the Historic Churches
Preservation Trust. The Committee for Environmental Conservation, com¬
prising many of the main voluntary organisations, acts as a liaison body and is
concerned with broader questions of amenity than those covered by individual
societies. In Wales, the Prince of Wales Committee promotes projects to
improve the environment and encourages a greater awareness of environ¬
mental problems.
Advisory machinery for regional planning has been set up by the Government.
Regional economic planning councils (see p. 195), regional economic planning
boards and local planning authorities jointly sponsor the preparation of
regional strategies. These are intended to advise the Government on the
problems of particular regions in relation to others, and to provide a frame¬
work for the preparation of structure plans by county councils.
Special provisions, in addition to the general town and country planning
measures, control the location of industry and offices (see p. 212). General
problems of industrial development are dealt with jointly by a number of
government departments, but each development scheme, as a rule, requires
the local planning authority’s consent. Financial incentives to encourage the
location of industry in particular areas have been made available by the
Government.
In Great Britain the New Towns Act 1946 and subsequent legislation (now
consolidated in Acts of 1965 and 1968) give the Secretaries of State for the
Environment, Scotland and Wales power to designate as the site of a new town
any area of land (which may include an existing centre of population). The
New Towns Act (Northern Ireland) 1965 makes similar provision for Northern
Ireland.
The appropriate minister must consult the local authorities concerned and
allow the public an opportunity to comment on the proposed designation. A
development corporation is appointed by the Government to create and plan
the growth of the town. It is responsible for the master plan, which is pre¬
pared in consultation with the appropriate minister, government departments,
and the local authorities in the area. Residents are given an opportunity to state
their views and, if necessary, a public inquiry is held. When the plan has been
agreed, the development corporation draws up detailed proposals for parti¬
cular areas and submits them to the responsible minister for approval which
(given after consultation with the local planning authorities) constitutes
planning permission. A development corporation has general powers to acquire
by agreement or compulsory purchase any land or property within the desig¬
nated area necessary for its purposes, and is empowered to provide houses,
offices, factories and other essential buildings, estate roads and, in certain
circumstances, the main services essential to the development of the town.
The capital cost of developing the new towns is advanced from public funds
and is repayable over 60 years. Under the New Towns Act 194^ Parliament
approved a fund of £50 million to provide for advances to the development
corporations for work on the new towns. This fund was increased by subse¬
quent Acts and now stands at £1,750 million; a total of over £1,400 million
had been advanced by March 1975. The corporations submit annual reports
(which include copies of their audited accounts) to Parliament.

BRITAIN 1976: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Of the 33 new towns designated in Britain since 194^) 23 are in England and
Wales, six in Scotland and four in Northern Ireland. Eleven of the new towns
in England and Wales (Basildon, Bracknell, Crawley, Harlow, Hatfield,
Hemel Hempstead, Milton Keynes, Northampton, Peterborough, Stevenage
and Welwyn) are designed to help to relieve housing problems in the Greater
London area. Of the others, Aycliffe, Corby, Cwmbran, Peterlee and Wash¬
ington are serving the special needs of their areas; Newtown is being developed
to stem rural depopulation in mid-Wales and create conditions for growth in
the area; Runcorn and Skelmersdale are helping to meet the overspill needs of
Liverpool and north Merseyside; Telford and Redditch are taking population
from Birmingham and the West Midlands conurbation; and Warrington aims
to attract people from the Liverpool and Manchester areas. Central Lan¬
cashire New Town has been designated to ease further the housing problems of
Liverpool and Manchester and to provide a growth point for the region’s
economy.
The six Scottish new towns (Cumbernauld, East Kilbride, Glenrothes,
Irvine, Livingston and Stonehouse) are helping to relieve congestion in the
Glasgow conurbation and are major growth areas in the central belt of Scot¬
land; the Stonehouse new town is to be managed by the development
corporation of East Kilbride new town. In Northern Ireland, Craigavon is
being developed as a new city and is rapidly becoming an area of major
industrial growth; Antrim and Ballymena are also becoming centres of eco¬
nomic growth; and Londonderry and the surrounding districts have been
designated as an area of special development.
Four new towns (Crawley, Hatfield, Hemel Hempstead and Welwyn) have
been substantially completed and are now the responsibility of the Com¬
mission for the New Towns, a government-appointed agency.
The new towns represent a notable achievement in positive land use. They
are generally recognised as one of the most successful post-war experiments,
both socially and industrially, and as a profitable long-term investment.
The population of the new towns in Great Britain is about i-8 million;
more than 850,000 people have moved into them since the late 1940s. Young
people form a higher proportion of new town populations than of the country
as a whole. An extensive building and civil engineering programme has
provided houses, flats, factories, schools, shops, churches, health centres
and libraries as well as public buildings including town halls and law courts.
Roads, water supplies, sewerage, gas and electricity, police, fire and bus
stations, postal, telegraph and telephone facilities have also been provided,
most of the towns are well equipped with parks and playing fields of various
kinds. All the new towns have become concerned with the increasingly high
level of car ownership of their inhabitants and are making more adequate
provision for parking and the segregation of pedestrians from motorists; a few
are creating special facilities for different modes of transport, for example,
roads for bicycles or buses only.
A number of the more developed towns are becoming regional centres and,
as the populations grow large enough to give the necessary support, offices,
hotels and department stores, as well as arts centres and full entertainment and
recreational facilities (skating rinks, dance halls, bowling alleys, swimming
pools, sports stadia, golf courses and youth centres) are gradually being pro¬
vided. The expansion of large existing towns such as Northampton, Peter¬
borough and Warrington has the advantage, among others, that many of these
facilities are already available.

I75
The Town Development Act 1952 makes provision for the relief of congestion
in large cities in England and Wales (such as London and Birmingham)
by encouraging the transfer of population, and industry where necessary,
to areas suitable for expansion. Schemes have been approved, providing some
160,000 dwellings in this way, of which about half have been built. Most of the
expanding towns (for example, Aylesbury, Basingstoke, Swindon and Thet-
ford) are well established and are providing homes, jobs and amenities for
people from large cities. The Housing and Town Development (Scotland)
Act 1957 makes similar provision for Scotland, where the only congested
area so far involved is Glasgow.
Urban Existing towns and cities are being renewed and re-shaped to improve the
Renewal environment and to meet the growth in population and traffic. Local authori¬
ties have extensive powers (often aided by government grants) to clear slum
dwellings, to improve individual houses or whole residential areas, to reclaim
derelict land, to secure clean air and to manage traffic. The Government
believes that greater integration of land use and transport planning is of basic
importance, and through the Department of the Environment (see p. 49)
ensures that a total strategic approach to environmental planning and protec¬
tion is adopted (see p. 170). Studies of six urban areas in England have been
undertaken by the Department of the Environment and local authorities to
emphasise this type of approach to urban problems. Three of the studies were
concerned with the problems of industrial towns. The other three studies are
investigating those of ‘inner city’ areas, in particular the nature of ‘urban
deprivation’ and ways of dealing with it.
Research into urban planning problems is also undertaken by a number of
institutes and university departments and by the Centre for Environmental
Studies, which is financed jointly by the Government and other sources, in¬
cluding the Ford Foundation.
Historic Lists of buildings of special architectural or historic interest are compiled, as
Buildings and required by the planning Acts, by the Secretary of State for the Environment
Monuments and the Secretaries of State for Scotland and Wales; nearly 235,000 buildings
are already listed. It is an offence to demolish or alter the character of any listed
building without special consent from the local planning authority or the
appropriate Secretary of State; where consent is given to demolish a building,
the Royal Commissions on Historical Monuments have an opportunity to
make a photographic record of the building. Emergency ‘building preserva¬
tion notices’ can be served by the local planning authority to protect buildings
not yet listed. The respective Secretaries of State (on the recommendation of
the appropriate Historic Buildings Council) can make grants and loans for the
repair or maintenance of buildings (or groups of buildings) of outstanding
interest, and local authorities can make grants and loans for any building of
architectural or historic interest even if it is not listed. About 3,000 buildings
in Great Britain have received grants and loans totalling over £13 million
under the Historic Buildings and Ancient Monuments Act 1953. Local plan¬
ning authorities have designated for special protection over 3,000 ‘conser¬
vation areas’ of particular architectural or historic interest. Studies have
been made in Bath, Chester, Chichester and York of the difficulties of preserv¬
ing features of historic interest in ancient towns in the face of commercial
development and increasing motor traffic. The Secretaries of State for the
Environment, Scotland and Wales are responsible for the maintenance of
royal parks and palaces and for the protection of ancient monuments of which

over 800 are in their care. Some 16-5 million people visited them in 1974. The
Royal Commission on Historical Monuments (for England), and similar
bodies for Scotland and Wales, survey monuments and specify those worthy
of preservation. In Northern Ireland 136 historic monuments are maintained
and protected by the State, and there is planning legislation on the listing of
buildings of special architectural or historic interest (over 600 have been listed
since work started in 1974). Grants for repairs and maintenance are made by
the Northern Ireland Department of the Environment, which is also respon¬
sible for the designation of ‘conservation areas’.
In order to restrict the further sprawl of large built-up areas, to prevent
adjacent towns merging into one another, and in some cases to preserve the
character of a town and the amenities of the countryside, ‘green belts’ (areas
where it is intended that the land should be left open and free from building
development and where townspeople can seek recreation) have been estab¬
lished or proposed around all or part of certain urban areas. They cover about
5,800 square miles (15,022 sq. km.) in England. About three-quarters of
London’s green belt is agricultural land or woodland, some of which can be
used for recreation. There are also country parks, public open spaces, playing
fields and golf courses specifically for recreational use. In Scotland there are
green belt areas around the main cities.
The maritime local planning authorities are responsible for planning land use
at the coast, for example, providing recreational facilities and amenities for
holidaymakers and local residents; at the same time they attempt to safeguard
and enhance the coast’s natural attractions and preserve coastal areas of
scientific interest.
A comprehensive study of the coastline of England and Wales was under¬
taken by the Countryside Commission in 1966-70 which recommended that
certain stretches of underdeveloped coast of particular scenic beauty should be
treated as heritage coast. Policies for these areas are being incorporated in the
planning authorities’ structure and local plans.
In 1965 the National Trust launched its Enterprise Neptune campaign to
raise funds for the nation to acquire stretches of coastline of great natural
beauty and recreational value. Some £2-5 million has been raised so far and,
as a result, the National Trust brought under its protection a further 171 miles
(275 km.) of coastline making a total of 359 miles (578 km.) in its care in
1975. The campaign has been extended with the aim of acquiring another
100 miles of coastline.
The protection of the coastline against erosion, for which the Department
of the Environment and the Welsh Office and the Scottish Office are centrally
responsible in Great Britain, presents difficult engineering problems and
heavy costs for the maritime local authorities. All sizeable coast protection
schemes drawn up by the authorities under the Coast Protection Act 1949
are investigated by government engineering staff. Substantial grants from
central funds (up to a maximum of 80 per cent) are made to authorities with
small resources. Protection against sea flooding where there is no question of
erosion is the responsibility of the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and
Food (see p. 296). To help to prevent the pollution of the coastline, inter¬
national regulations restrict the discharge of oil into the sea (see p. 312).
Local authorities are equipped to deal with oil discharges which reach the
shore and in-shore waters.

Two Countryside Commissions (one for England and Wales, the other for
Scotland) encourage the provision and development of facilities for open-air
recreation in the countryside. These include the provision by local authorities
(sometimes in association with other bodies) and private individuals of country
parks within easy reach of towns; the establishment of camping sites and picnic
areas; and the increased use of reservoirs, canals and other waterways for
bathing, sailing and other activities. By 1975 in country parks and 141 picnic
sites had been recognised in England and Wales by the Countryside Com¬
mission. In Scotland a large number of local authority schemes for the
provision of a variety of countryside facilities have been approved for grant
aid. The Countryside Commission for Scotland has approved six country
parks. The commissions are also responsible for encouraging and promoting
measures to conserve and enhance the natural beauty and amenity of the
countryside and may undertake research projects and experimental schemes,
working in consultation with local authorities and such bodies as the Nature
Conservancy Council (see p. 179) and the Sports Councils (see p. 454). In
England and Wales, the Countryside Commission may give financial assistance
to public bodies and individuals carrying out countryside recreation and
amenity projects.
The Countryside Commission (for England and Wales) replaced and assumed
the functions of the National Parks Commission set up under the National
Parks and Access to the Countryside Act 1949 select national parks and
areas of outstanding natural beauty’ and to make proposals for the creation of
long-distance footpaths and bridleways. Ten national parks have been estab¬
lished: Northumberland, the Lake District, the Yorkshire Dales, the North
York Moors and the Peak District in northern England; Snowdonia, the
Pembrokeshire Coast and the Brecon Beacons in Wales; Exmoor and Dart¬
moor in south-west England. They cover 5,256 square miles (13,613 sq. km.),
or 9 per cent of the area of England and Wales. Administration is based on
local authority representation, with a third of the members appointed by the
Government. By 1975 32 areas of outstanding natural beauty had been desig¬
nated, covering some 5,583 square miles (14,462 sq. km.).
The land in these designated areas generally remains privately owned, but
agreements or orders to secure additional public access may be made by local
authorities. Steps are taken to preserve and enhance the landscape’s natural
beauty by high standards of development control, and by positive measures,
for which grants are available, such as tree planting and preservation, and
the removal of eyesores. In the national parks, other measures for the benefit
of the public include the provision of car parks, camping and caravan areas,
and information centres. All national parks and some other designated
areas have warden services. Most local authority expenditure on national
parks is met by central government grants. Some 1,500 miles (2,414 km.) of
long-distance footpaths and bridleways had been approved by 1975. Large
stretches of these paths are already public rights of way. A number of the
routes are open and further routes are being established.
Under the Amenity Lands Act (Northern Ireland) 1965 the Ulster Country¬
side Committee advises on the establishment of national parks and the
designation of areas of outstanding natural beauty. Eight areas have been
designated. Five amenity areas, acquired by the Department of Housing,
Local Government and Planning, are being managed as country parks.
Although there are no national parks as such in Scotland, five large national
park direction areas are subject to special planning control under ministerial
Iyg BRITAIN 1976: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
supervision. The areas are: Loch Lomond—Trossachs, Glen Affric—Glen
Cannich-Strath Farrar; Ben Nevis-Glencoe-Black Mount; the Cairngorms;
and Loch Torridon-Loch Maree-Little Loch Broom. Over 98 per cent of the
land in Scotland has been designated as countryside within the jurisdiction of
the Countryside Commission for Scotland.
Forest Parks The Forestry Commission (see p. 305) has formed, and opened to the public,
seven forest parks in some of the finest country in Great Britain: Argyll, Glen
Trool, Glen More and the Queen Elizabeth Forest Park in Scotland; the
Forest of Dean and the Wye valley woods on the borders of England and
Wales; Snowdonia in Wales; and the Border Forest Park on the borders of
England and Scotland. The parks cover some 600,000 acres (243,000 hectares).
Camping and other recreational facilities provided in all the parks are used by
some 20 million holidaymakers each year. The historic New Forest, in Hamp¬
shire, although not a forest park, is also open to the public. In addition the
Forestry Commission welcomes the public to many parts of the three million
acres under its management. In Northern Ireland, the Department of Agricul¬
ture has established five forest parks—Tollymore Park, Castlewellan, Gortin
Glen, Drum Manor and Gosford Castle—and there are also five forest scenic
drives; in some 40 forests recreational facilities have been provided.
Local Under the National Parks and Access to the Countryside Act 1949 county
Footpaths and councils in most areas of England and Wales have prepared maps showing all
Open Country public rights of way, which must be kept free of obstructions and must
not be permanently disturbed. If a path is not shown on the map, a private
citizen can show that it is a public right of way if it has been used and re¬
garded as such without interruption for at least 20 years. Public footpaths are
maintained by local highway authorities who must also provide signposts and
supervise the duty of landowners to repair stiles and gates. Local authorities in
Great Britain can create paths and ways, close existing paths which are no
longer in public use, and divert paths to secure a more efficient use of the land
or simply a shorter route. Local planning authorities can convert minor roads
into footpaths or bridleways and provide recreational facilities.
The 1949 Act is also concerned with access to open country, which now
includes mountains, moors, heaths, downs, cliffs and foreshores, woodlands,
rivers and canals and their banks, but not farmland unless it is simply used for
grazing. There is no automatic right of public access to open country, but
local planning authorities can secure access by means of agreements with land-
owners ; if agreements cannot be obtained, authorities may acquire land or
make orders for public access. These powers were extended in 1967 to cover
Scotland.
Common land, a large proportion of which is open to the public, totals an
estimated 15 million acres (600,000 hectares) in England and Wales. (There is
no common land in Scotland or Northern Ireland.) This land is usually
privately owned, but people other than the owner have various rights on or
over it, for example, of pasture for farm animals. Commons are protected by
law and cannot be built on or enclosed without the consent of the Secretaries
of State for the Environment or Wales. The Commons Registration Act
1965 provided for the registration of all commons and village greens, and by
the close of the registration period in 1970 over 16,000 areas had been regis¬
tered. Under the Countryside Act 1968 local authorities can provide facilities
for enjoyment on any common land to which the public has access.
ENVIRONMENTAL PLANNING
I79
The Nature Conservancy Council (see p. 402) is the official body responsible
for nature conservation in Great Britain. At the end of March 1975 there were
140 national nature reserves, covering 282,980 acres (113,192 hectares). Some
40 nature reserves are run by local authorities; in woodland areas there are
nine forest nature reserves; in addition a number of reserves have been estab¬
lished by voluntary bodies. There are also 3,500 sites of special scientific
interest in Great Britain, notified because of their flora, fauna or geological
or physiological features: local planning authorities must consult the Nature
Conservancy Council before granting planning permission for development
affecting them. In Northern Ireland 43 sites have been scheduled by the
Department of Housing, Local Government and Planning and are subject to
special planning control. Some 18 nature reserves have been established by the
department on the advice of the Nature Reserves Committee.
Throughout Britain voluntary organisations co-operate in the conservation
of nature (and in many cases establish their own reserves or other specially
protected areas). These include: the National Trust, the Royal Society for
the Protection of Birds, the Society for the Promotion of Nature Reserves, the
County Naturalists Trusts and the Council for Nature (which consists of some
350 natural history and conservation societies).
and While specific measures have been adopted to ensure that the use of land in
towns and in the countryside is properly supervised, a growing concern for the
wider aspects of planning has meant that the restricted notion of protective
planning has evolved into a positive concept for the enhancement of the land
and of the enjoyment of the people who live and work on it.
In 1970 Britain became the first major country to establish a Department of
the Environment (see p. 49); all government departments in Great Britain
have a legal duty when exercising functions relating to land to keep in mind
the desirability of conserving the countryside’s natural beauty and amenity.
Many of the detailed aspects of planning for the environment are under¬
taken by local authorities. The local planning authorities have power to
preserve trees and woodlands in the interest of amenity by means of tree
preservation orders; when granting planning permission for development, a
local planning authority must impose conditions to secure the preservation or
planting of trees; and landowners are generally required to replace ‘preserved’
trees which die or are removed or destroyed. Outdoor display of advertise¬
ments is controlled by planning legislation; consent must be sought from the
local planning authority for most forms of outdoor advertising, and in rural and
other localities requiring special protection on grounds of amenity special
controls may be applied. In addition to the general town and country planning
controls over development, land may not generally be used as a caravan site
unless a site licence has been issued by the local authority.
Local authorities are responsible for reclaiming land so damaged by in¬
dustrial or other development that it is not capable of being used fully without
special treatment. Local planning authorities have powers for reclaiming land
in pursuit of the general well-being of their districts—for example, in the
course of providing open spaces and schools; they can acquire and develop
land and carry out restoration and improvement; and they can require an
owner of land which is damaging and offensive to the surrounding area to
improve its condition. Exchequer grants are available to cover half the cost of
individual restoration schemes, higher grants being available for clearance in
the designated areas (see map, p. 211) and in national parks and areas of
jgo BRITAIN 1976: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
outstanding natural beauty. New arrangements are being introduced under
which the entire cost of derelict land reclamation in the designated areas in
England will be met from the Exchequer. In Scotland and Wales, respon¬
sibility for financing and implementing reclamation schemes will be trans¬
ferred to the proposed Scottish and Welsh Development Agencies (see p.
213). Planning controls to prevent the spread of dereliction require that, when
permission is granted for mineral working, conditions are attached ensuring
various measures to minimise the disturbance caused by the work and to
secure whatever restoration is practicable when working ceases. The use of
land for tipping is also subject to conditions restricting height or requiring
treatment on completion.
Waste on Land The Litter Act 1958 made it an offence to leave litter on land to which the
public has free access, and in some cases the Dangerous Litter Act 1971
prescribes fines of up to j£ioo. Local authorities will be required under the
Control of Pollution Act 1974 to make comprehensive plans for disposal of
household, commercial and industrial waste and to ensure satisfactory
standards of disposal. Where possible, recycling and reclamation is en¬
couraged by the Government.
Clean Air Responsibility for clean air in towns and cities rests with local authorities,
who may, under the provisions of the Clean Air Acts 1956 and 1968, declare
‘smoke control areas’ within which the emission of smoke from chimneys
constitutes an offence; over half the premises in the conurbations are now
covered by smoke control orders. Central government is responsible through
the Alkali and Clean Air Inspectorate for controlling certain industrial
processes which give rise to particularly dangerous or offensive emissions
or which are technically difficult to control. Emissions from motor vehicles
are also controlled. The Clean Air Council (set up in 1956) and a similar
council for Scotland review the progress made in abating air pollution in
Great Britain. London no longer experiences dense (‘pea-souper’) fogs or
serious smogs and in central London winter sunshine has increased by
70 per cent since 1962.
Noise Local authorities are also responsible for the enforcement of the Noise
Abatement Act i960 which requires them to inspect their areas for noise
nuisances and to take action (which can be enforced by the courts) to secure
abatement. New measures against noise, based on recommendations of the
Noise Advisory Council, were included in the Control of Pollution Act 1974-
This improves and strengthens local authorities’ existing powers, and gives
them new powers to set up noise abatement zones within which they can
require existing noise levels to be held constant or reduced. Noise levels may
not be increased without their permission. The Act also contains special
provisions to control noise from construction and demolition sites.
Other Measures For measures to control pollution of the sea, see p. 312; to control inland
water pollution, see p. 282; and to safeguard the use of pesticides, see p. 299.
Monitoring In order to ensure effective pollution control there is a process of continuous
Pollution updating of information on environmental hazards. The Government is
advised by the Royal Commission on Environmental Pollution (see p. 404).
9 Housing
There are about 20 million dwellings in Britain: over million in
England and Wales, 1-9 million in Scotland and 500,000 in Northern Ireland.
Nationally the numbers of households and dwellings are about equal, but they
are unevenly distributed, and housing shortages persist in the more prosperous
commercial and industrial centres such as London and Birmingham.
Some 79 per cent of households in Great Britain occupied a whole house
according to the 1971 General Household Survey; 19 per cent lived in flats;
and the remaining few lived in accommodation rented with business premises
or mobile homes such as caravans.
Over half of all dwellings are owned by their occupiers, some 31 per cent
are rented from public housing authorities, and most of the remainder are
rented from private landlords (see diagram, p. 182). There are variations,
however, in the distribution of tenure between the different countries of
Britain—in Scotland more than half the dwellings are rented from public
authorities—and in different regions and areas of those countries. Private
rented accommodation is generally more common in the central districts of
large towns, while owner-occupation is more frequent in their outer suburbs
and in country areas.
New house construction in Britain is undertaken by both public and private
sectors. Of the 278,000 dwellings completed in 1974 some 52 per cent was
provided by private interests, about 44 per cent by public authorities, and
nearly 4 per cent by voluntary housing associations and societies. Public
housing authorities provide dwellings mainly for renting while private interests
build mainly for sale to owner-occupiers. The construction of private dwellings
to rent has dwindled to a very low level.
Over 8-5 million new dwellings have been built in Britain since 1945, and
two families in every five now live in a post-war dwelling (see diagram, p. 182).
There remain a large number of older dwellings, some of which have been
kept in good repair and modernised, but many others—particularly in the
centres of cities—are unsatisfactory by modern standards. The demolition of
slum dwellings, improvement of sub-standard houses and more advanced
standards for new house-building (particularly in the public sector) have,
however, led to significant improvements in the general quality of British
housing. A survey carried out in England and Wales in 1971 established that
the percentage of unfit dwellings fell from 117 per cent in 1967 to 7-3 per cent
in 1971.
Administration Responsibility for formulating housing policy and supervising the housing
programme is borne by the Secretary of State for the Environment in England,
by the Secretaries of State for Scotland and Wales, and in Northern Ireland
by the head of the Department of Housing, Local Government and Planning.
In Great Britain most of the public housing is provided by 459 local
housing authorities, which are responsible for ensuring that the supply of
housing in their areas is adequate. These are: in England and Wales (outside
London) the district councils; in London, the Greater London Council, the
London borough councils and the Common Council of the City of London;

and in Scotland, the district and island authorities. Other public housing
authorities in Great Britain are the new town authorities (see p. 172) and the
Scottish Special Housing Association (SSHA), which was established in 1937
to supplement building by local authorities in Scotland.
The central government departments specify certain standards for the con¬
struction and equipment of all new dwellings; these are enforced by the local
authorities. Subsidies are made available to the authorities to assist them with
housing costs, and guidance is given on design and layout.
Besides providing public housing, local authorities are involved in many
other aspects of housing policy, including paying house improvement grants to
the private sector, granting mortgages to owner-occupiers, and carrying out
slum-clearance and redevelopment programmes. A growing number are
establishing housing advisory centres to provide the public with information
on local housing opportunities in both public and private sectors.
In Northern Ireland all public housing, including that in new towns, is
the responsibility of the Northern Ireland Housing Executive, a public body
established in 1971. The executive is aided by a housing council representing
each local authority area.
The main objectives of government housing policy are to secure a decent home
for every family at a price within its means, and to ensure fairness between
one citizen and another in giving and receiving help towards housing costs.
Local authorities are encouraged to provide housing to meet local needs.
Government subsidies are available for local authorities to assist with the
cost of clearing slums and providing adequate public sector housing in areas
of housing shortage. The Government is concerned to ensure that best use is
made of the existing housing stock and subsidies are also available for the
improvement of older houses.
A national system of rent rebate and allowance schemes assists poorer
tenants in both the public and private sectors.

Environment, under the control of the Director General of Research. It is
carried out by the Building Research Establishment and the department’s
directorates of economics, statistics, and housing development. The Research
and Development Group of the Scottish Development Department also
undertakes research. Sponsored work is carried out in universities and local
authorities may also have housing research programmes. The Government
is advised on the need for, and application of, research and development by
the Construction and Housing Research Advisory Council. Advice on ways of
increasing productivity in house-building is also provided by the National
Building Agency.
Public housing authorities in Britain own some 6 million houses and flats
and in 1974 completed over 124,000 new dwellings. The number of houses
owned by each authority varies widely, some having a stock of well over 100,000
houses. Authorities plan their own building programmes within the framework
of government policy. In 1974 the Government authorised additional public
expenditure on housing to enable authorities to increase their building
programme for rent and to acquire unsold or completed houses in the private
sector; a start is also to be made on programmes for municipal ownership of
privately rented housing in the worst areas of housing stress.
Local authorities in Great Britain meet the capital costs of new house con¬
struction by raising loans on the open market or by borrowing from the Public
Works Loan Board (see p. 73). Current expenditure, including maintenance
costs and loan interest and repayments, is met from rents, supplemented
where necessary by subsidies from the Exchequer and sometimes (particularly
in Scotland) from the rates. Subsidies for public housing in 1974-75 totalled
some £796 million in England and Wales and about £97 million in Scotland.
The Housing Rents and Subsidies Act 1975 (for England and Wales)
introduced a new housing subsidy system. Local authorities are required to
charge their -tenants reasonable rents—which keep a balance between the
interests of tenants and ratepayers—without making a profit. The new subsidy
system has five main elements to aid new building, acquisition of land and
housing, and improvement of existing stock; and also to subsidise increases
in local authorities’ current housing debts. The Housing Rents and Subsidies
(Scotland) Act 1975 makes similar provision for Scotland.
Supplementary subsidies are available to assist local authorities throughout
Great Britain with slum clearance. In addition, there is a national system of
rent rebates and allowances covering most tenants. Payments are made by
local authorities and financed largely by government subsidy. The scheme
assists poorer tenants in meeting rents of accommodation suited to their
needs.
In Northern Ireland, the capital expenditure of the Northern Ireland
Housing Executive is financed by loans raised on the open market or borrowed
from the National Loans Fund. New dwellings completed by the executive
qualify for government subsidy at a rate which varies according to the number
of persons for whom each dwelling is designed.
In selecting tenants for new or vacant dwellings, local authorities normally
give preference to families living in overcrowded or unsatisfactory conditions,
but they are free to allocate houses according to their own schemes. Authorities
normally establish waiting lists and treat applicants (outside priority categories)
in order of application; some require applicants to fulfil residence requirements
before they are accepted on waiting lists.

BRITAIN 1976: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Although a number of authorities employ direct labour to build houses, most
building is undertaken by private firms under contract. Some authorities work
in consortia to make the best use of industrialised systems in their house¬
building programmes.
Dwellings are constructed to meet the needs of different sizes of household.
More than a quarter are of the single bedroom type suitable for smaller house¬
holds including the elderly, but the majority are designed for families and
have two or three bedrooms, two living rooms and a kitchen, bathroom and
lavatory. The standard of new local authority housing has improved, particu¬
larly in the floor space provided and the heating systems installed. In England
and Wales in 1973 some 93 per cent of new dwellings had central heating, and
houses built for families of four or five people had an average floor space of 958
square feet (89 square metres) and cost an average of about £6,200 to build.
In 1974 over 144,000 private sector dwellings were completed in Britain,
almost all of which were intended for owner-occupation. The number of
people owning their own houses has more than doubled in the last 20 years,
and the 10 5 million owner-occupied dwellings in Britain now account for over
half of the total housing stock. Although most owner-occupied houses were
built for that purpose, many private rented dwellings have also been sold for
owner-occupation. The Government also encourages voluntary housing
societies which provide co-ownership housing.
Loans to enable people to buy their own houses by a system of instalment
purchase are available from various sources, including building societies,
insurance companies, industrial and provident societies and local authorities.
Building societies (see also p. 376) are the most important of these agencies.
They do not build houses themselves but provide long-term loans on the
security of property bought for owner-occupation. They usually advance up to
80 per cent of their valuation of a house but it is possible to borrow up to 95 per
cent, or in rare cases, 100 per cent. Loans are normally repayable over periods
of 20 or 25 years (up to 30 or 35 years in certain circumstances) by equal
monthly instalments to cover capital and interest.1 The average price of new
houses mortgaged to building societies in 1974 was £II>IOO’> new houses in
London and the south-east of England cost some 38 per cent more than the
national average. In 1974 the societies advanced some £2,912 million.
Local authorities are encouraged to concentrate their mortgage resources on
helping people with housing needs who are unable to obtain loans elsewhere.
Their mortgage lending in 1974 amounted to £455 million.
Owner-occupiers are entitled to tax relief on their mortgage interest payments
on loans related to their principal private residences, and in 1974-75 this
amounted to about £680 million. An alternative form of assistance—the option
mortgage scheme—designed to help those with smaller incomes was introduced
in 1968. Under the scheme, borrowers receive, through the lending agency,
a subsidy (instead of tax relief) which reduces the rate of mortgage interest
which they pay by up to 4 per cent. Subsidy payments under the option
mortgage scheme in Great Britain amounted in 1974—75 to about £75 million.
Associated with the scheme is the option mortgage guarantee scheme, whereby
1 A scheme was introduced in May 1975 enabling people buying homes for the first
time (subject to certain conditions) to defer part of their mortgage payments in the first
five years until the eleventh and subsequent years.

mortgage loans of up to 100 per cent of the valuation of a house (not exceeding
12,000) may be made to those participating.
In Northern Ireland, the Government pays subsidies to private people who
build dwellings for owner-occupation or letting.
For building in the private sector the National House Building Council
(NHBC) sets standards and enforces them by inspection and certification.
Almost all new private houses are covered by the council’s scheme which
carries a ten-year guarantee against major structural defects. A two-year
guarantee is also given against faulty workmanship. Most lenders will not
grant mortgages on a new house unless it is covered by a NHBC certificate.
During the last 20 years there has been a steady decline in Great Britain in the
number of rented dwellings available from private landlords (including tied
accommodation) from nearly 52 per cent of the housing stock in 1951 to
about 17 per cent (3-3 million) in 1974. Major factors in this decline have been
the increased demand for owner-occupation, the greater availability of public
rented housing, and the operation of rent restriction. Privately rented dwell-
ings form a high proportion of Britain’s older housing and many have been
demolished under slum clearance programmes. While most landlords in
Britain are private individuals with limited holdings, a proportion of all
privately rented housing is provided by the small number of larger property
owners, including property companies.
Most privately rented dwellings are subject to rent restriction. Tenants
have a wide degree of security of tenure, and eviction from any dwelling (with¬
out a court order) and harassment of occupiers are criminal offences with
severe penalties.
About 80 per cent of all private rented accommodation in Great Britain
is let unfurnished. Most unfurnished accommodation is subject to either ‘rent
control’ or ‘rent regulation’. Rent control applies to about a quarter of the
unfurnished dwellings—those with a rateable value on 31st March 1972 of less
than £35 (£7° in London, £25 in Scotland) in which the tenant has lived
continuously since before 1957. Tenants of controlled dwellings enjoy security
of tenure during their lifetime and pay fixed rents determined by reference to
1956 rateable values or, in Scotland, to historic rent levels. These are very low
by comparison with other rents. Landlords of controlled dwellings whose
houses are of a satisfactory standard or who improve them to such a standard
are able to transfer them to the alternative system of rent regulation.
Rent regulation was introduced under the Rent Act 1965 and applies to
private unfurnished dwellings (but not while they remain controlled under
previous legislation) which fall within defined limits of rateable value up to
1973 values of £1,500 in London, £750 elsewhere in England and Wales, and
£200 in Scotland. Under the rent regulation procedure, a ‘fair rent’ may be
fixed for a tenancy by independent rent officers at the request of the landlord,
the tenant, or both. Factors taken into account by rent officers in determining
rents include the age, character and locality of the house. To eliminate any
artificial value derived from scarcity, the assumption is made that for similar
dwellings to let in the area demand does not substantially exceed supply. If
the landlord or tenant objects to the decision of the rent officer, the case is
referred to a rent assessment committee. Since 1965 some 733,000 fair rents
have been registered. Once determined, the rent is not normally reviewed for
at least three years. Tenants of controlled and regulated lettings enjoy security
of tenure.

Poorer tenants of private unfurnished accommodation are eligible for assis¬
tance with their rent under a national scheme of rent allowances. Operated by
local authorities, the scheme is financed mainly by government subsidies.
In Northern Ireland, houses of a 1939 rateable value of less than £50 are
subject to rent control with rents fixed by reference to their rateable value in
that year. However, prescribed increases were permitted in the rents of certain
controlled dwellings in 1951 and I95^> an<^ dwellings with a 1939 rateable
value of more than £26 of which landlords are in, or obtain, possession and
dwellings completed since 1956 are freed from rent control.
Under the Rent Act 1974, tenants of furnished accommodation whose land¬
lords do not live on the same premises have the same protection as tenants
of unfurnished property, and may apply to a rent officer for a fair rent
determination. Tenants of furnished accommodation with resident landlords
may refer their tenancy agreements to a local rent tribunal for determination
of a reasonable rent. Tribunals may grant tenants security of tenure for up to
six months with a possibility of further periods if they so decide.
Poorer tenants in furnished accommodation are helped with their rent by
a rent allowance scheme.
Since the early 1960s the Government has encouraged the growth of non-
profit-making housing associations and societies, which between them own
about 250,000 dwellings in Great Britain; some 17,000 were completed or
acquired in 1974.
Housing associations have long existed as voluntary bodies set up for the
purpose of providing low-rent housing for people in need. The associations
have in the past borrowed money to finance house-building, mainly from local
authorities, which may make up to 100 per cent loans. Encouragement to pur¬
chase and convert old houses into new dwellings was offered by the Housing
Act of 1969 which provides for a 20-year subsidy equivalent to half of all
charges (capital and interest) on loans raised for the purpose. Under the Hous¬
ing Finance Act 1972 housing associations, like co-ownership societies (see
below), are able to borrow from the Housing Corporation for new building, a
facility which was expanded by the Housing Act i974* Tbti rents of housing
association houses are based on fair-rent levels, and their tenants are entitled
to rent allowances (see p. 182). On new schemes where fair rents produce
insufficient revenue to cover the capital cost of a scheme, associations receive
a government grant covering the deficit.
Co-ownership societies build dwellings for co-ownership by a group of
occupants to let at unsubsidised rents. Following a pilot scheme introduced
by the Housing Act 1961, the Housing Corporation was set up under the
Housing Act 1964 to stimulate the formation of such societies. Half of the
money needed for approved co-ownership society schemes is advanced by
building societies, with the Housing Corporation providing the remainder.
Rented housing society dwellings where the tenants are not co-owners or
members of a co-operative are, like those owned by housing associations,
within the fair-rent and rent-allowance schemes.
Private owners in Great Britain can obtain grants from local authorities to
improve their houses by providing amenities such as baths, for carrying out
other works to modernise their properties, and for converting large houses or
other buildings into flats. Known as renovation grants, these are: ‘improve¬
ment grants’ which may be awarded on a maximum eligible expense of up to
HOUSING
187
£,3’200 (£3’70° Scotland); ‘intermediate grants’ on up to £joo for the
provision of standard amenities, and ^800 for associated repairs; ‘special
grants (not available in Scotland) depending on the number of standard
amenities to be provided in a house in multiple occupation; and ‘repairs
grants on up to £800 expenditure and available only in ‘housing action areas’
and general improvement areas’ (see below). The amount of the award
depends on the location of the dwelling: up to 75 per cent (sometimes 90 per
cent) of the cost in housing action areas; 60 per cent in general improvement
areas; and 50 per cent elsewhere. A government contribution amounting to
75 Per cent (90 per cent in housing action and general improvement areas) of
each grant is paid to the local authority. Aid on a similar basis is given by the
Government to local authorities and housing associations, but this can include
part of the cost of buying properties for conversion and improvement as well
as that of carrying out works.
Since improvement grants were first introduced in 1949, some 3 million
dwellings in England and Wales and some 355,000 in Scotland have been
improved with their aid; in 1974 house improvement grants were approved
for over 300,000 dwellings in Great Britain. Grants for house improvement
and conversion are also provided in Northern Ireland.
In order to tackle systematically the improvement of whole areas of older
housing, local authorities in England and Wales were given powers under the
Housing Act 1969 to declare ‘general improvement areas’. The aim in these
areas is to encourage householders to improve their dwellings with the aid of
grants, while the local authority uses its comprehensive powers to improve
the environment. A government contribution is available of half the local
authority’s expenditure on environmental improvements on costs of up to
£200 a dwelling. There are similar grants in Scotland and Northern Ireland
for the improvement of residential areas. Under the 1974 Housing Act local
authorities in Great Britain are empowered to declare ‘housing action areas’
in places of housing stress. In such areas authorities have powers to compel
owners to improve their houses to a given standard and preferential rates of
renovation grant are payable. Compulsory powers are also available to local
authorities in general improvement areas.
Slum Clearance About 3 million people have been rehoused in England and Wales since the
mid-1950s as a result of slum clearance programmes and during 1974 some
53,000 houses were demolished or closed in Great Britain as a result of slum
clearance and other action. Some housing authorities have eliminated all their
slums and others expect to achieve this within a few years, but in inner London
and in certain of the older industrial towns, clearance will take longer. Local
authorities receive special financial assistance from the Government if they
incur a loss on slum clearance operations.
Housing authorities are obliged to see that other accommodation exists, or
can be provided by them, for people displaced by slum clearance. Owners
of land compulsorily acquired during slum clearance programmes receive as
compensation either the full market value or, if the land consists of unfit
houses, a sum based on the value of the cleared site; additional payments are,
however, made to most owner-occupiers of unfit houses to bring their com¬
pensation up to market value.
10 The Churches
The Church of
England
Every person living in Britain has the right of religious freedom and may mani¬
fest his faith in teaching, worship and observance without interference from
the community or the state. Churches and religious societies of all kinds may
own property, conduct schools, and propagate their beliefs in speech and in
writing. There is no religious or denominational bar to the holding of public
office.
In the services administered by the state, such as the armed forces, the
national hospitals and the prisons, the clergy of the established Church of
England or the Church of Scotland provide the principal ministrations and
are paid a salary by the state for this part of their work. Clergy of other de¬
nominations may also be appointed as required. Voluntary schools (see p. 151)
provided by churches of any religious denomination may be wholly or partly
maintained from public funds.
There is no precisely accurate or uniform method of assessing the number
of adherents to the various churches in Britain, since no inquiries are made
about religious beliefs in population censuses1 or other official returns, and
each church adopts its own criteria in counting its members. The membership
figures given in this chapter are therefore approximate.
The Church of England’s status as the established church of the land derives
from the Reformation in the sixteenth century. The Church’s relationship with
the state2 is one of mutual obligation—privileges accorded to the Church
balanced by certain duties which it must fulfil. The Sovereign must always
be a member of the Church, and promises on his or her accession to uphold it;
Church of England archbishops, bishops and deans are appointed by the
Sovereign on the advice of the Prime Minister3; all clergy take an oath of
allegiance to the Crown; the Church must obtain Parliament’s consent to
change its forms of worship (which are contained in the Book of Common
Prayer of 1662), although it has temporary powers to use alternative forms
without the need for parliamentary approval; and the two archbishops (of
Canterbury and York), the bishops of London, Durham and Winchester, and
21 other bishops (according to their seniority as diocesan bishops) have
permanent seats in the House of Lords (see p. 30). Clergy of the Church of
England (together with those of the Church of Scotland, the Church of
Ireland and the Roman Catholic Church) are legally disqualified from sitting
in the House of Commons (see p. 31).
1 In Northern Ireland, recent full censuses have contained an optional question about
people’s religious professions.
2 A church commission set up to consider the relationship between the Church of
England and the state has recommended in a report, Church and State (see Biblio¬
graphy p. 475), that, while the establishment of the Church should be maintained, the
Church should be given final authority over its forms of worship and doctrine; altera¬
tions should be made in the present procedure for the appointment of bishops; ministers
of all churches should be permitted to stand for election to the House of Commons and,
if elected, to take their seats; and leading members of other churches should be invited
to sit alongside Church of England bishops in the House of Lords.
3 The Church of England has recommended that it should take over responsibility for
this function.

THE CHURCHES ^9
The Church is organised into 43 dioceses, grouped into two provinces:
Canterbury, comprising 29 dioceses, and York, 14 dioceses. The dioceses are
subdivided into ecclesiastical parishes, of which there are some 14,260. The
Archbishop of Canterbury is styled ‘Primate of All England’, and the Arch¬
bishop of York is ‘Primate of England’. Of the population born and resident in
the two provinces (roughly 46 million), about 60 per cent are baptised into the
Church and some 20 per cent are confirmed members.
The central governing body of the Church, the General Synod, is invested
with both spiritual authority and legislative and administrative powers; and
bishops, clergy and lay members are involved in decisions affecting the
whole range of the Church’s concern. In the dioceses, diocesan and deanery
synods are linked both with the General Synod and parish organisations.
Certain important issues must be referred for the approval of the dioceses
before they are finally decided by the General Synod. Lay members of the
Church are associated with church government in the parishes through
parochial church councils on which are members appointed by baptised
members of the Church over the age of 17 who are on the church electoral roll
of their local parish.
The General Synod is the centre of an administrative system dealing with
various aspects of the Church’s work—such as education, recruitment and
training for the ministry, and church work at home and overseas. It is con¬
cerned with the Church of England schools (attended by about 11 per cent
of the 9’ 1 million pupils in the publicly maintained schools of England and
Wales in 1974); a number of direct grant and independent schools; church
colleges of education in England and Wales; theological colleges; and establish¬
ments for the training of women in pastoral work.
The Church has its own courts whose jurisdiction today extends only to
matters of purely ecclesiastical concern.
Church finance is administered locally by the parishes and the dioceses, with
contributions to a central General Synod Fund which the Central Board of
Finance administers for the maintenance of central services, including capital
expenditure on training and theological colleges and grants for training can¬
didates for ordination. (Although the state pays for or contributes towards
some services provided by the Church—see p. 188—it makes no direct financial
contribution to church expenses as such.) The Church’s endowment income
(from its assets amounting to over ^617 million in land and investments) is
mainly administered by the Church Commissioners, the body largely respon¬
sible for the payment of clergy stipends and the provision of finance for
pensions. The total net income (£32-2 million in 1973-74) has greatly increased
in recent years—in broad terms this has meant a rise in the stipends of the
poorer clergy and the introduction of schemes for better parsonage houses, for
church buildings in new areas of population, and for better pensions for clergy¬
men and their widows.
The Anglican Communion comprises 22 autonomous Provinces in Britain and
overseas and three regional councils overseas with a total membership of about
67 million. In the British Isles, there are four Provinces: the established
Church of England and the unestablished Church in Wales, Episcopal Church
of Scotland, and Church of Ireland.
Every ten years (most recently in 1968) the Lambeth Conference meets for
unofficial consultation between all Anglican bishops; presided over by the
Archbishop of Canterbury, it has no executive authority, but enjoys great

prestige, and its findings on doctrine, discipline, relations with other com¬
munions, and attitudes to political and social questions are widely studied.
The Anglican Consultative Council—an assembly of laymen and clergy as well
as bishops which meets every two years—is designed to provide consultations
within the Anglican Communion and to serve as an instrument of common
action. The council will meet in 1976 in Trinidad.
The Church of Scotland, established by law, has a presbyterian form of
government. It has been described as ‘the supreme example of a church which
is established and yet is free’. It derives its status from the Treaty of Union
1707 and the Church of Scotland Act 1921 which confirmed its complete
freedom in all spiritual matters. The Church appoints its own officers and its
decisions on questions of doctrine and discipline are not subject to parliamen¬
tary discussion or modification.
All ministers of the Church of Scotland are of equal status, each of some
2,000 churches being governed locally by the Kirk Session, consisting of the
minister and the elected elders of the church; above the Kirk Session is the
Court of the Presbytery, then the Court of the Synod, and finally the General
Assembly, consisting of elected ministers and elders, which meets annually
under the presidency of an elected moderator who serves for one year. The
Sovereign is represented at the General Assembly by the Lord High Com¬
missioner.
The training for the ministry (to which women may be admitted) has given
the Church a high reputation for scholarship and has in turn influenced the
standard of education in Scotland. The adult communicant membership of
the Church of Scotland is estimated at over one million.
The phrase ‘Free Churches’ is commonly used to describe the ‘nonconformist’
churches of England (which dissent from certain practices of the established
church and, generally speaking, have distinctive convictions regarding organi¬
sation and worship) and Protestant churches in other parts of Britain (apart
from the established Church of Scotland). Certain other churches and religious
associations have links with the main Free Churches.
The Methodist Church, the largest of the Free Churches with some 600,000
adult full members, originated in the eighteenth century following the evan¬
gelical revival by John Wesley, and is nowadays based on a 1932 union of most
of the separate Methodist Churches. The Methodist Churches which did not
join the union include the Independent Methodists (5,950 members) and the
Wesleyan Reform Union (with some 4,350 members).
The United Reformed Church, with some 190,000 members, was formed
in 1972 when the Congregational Church in England and Wales (the oldest
community of dissenters in Britain) and the Presbyterian Church of England
merged—the first transdenominational union of churches in Britain since the
Reformation in the sixteenth century.
The Baptists are nearly all grouped in associations of churches, most of
which belong to the Baptist Union of Great Britain and Ireland (formed in
1813), within which 2,182 churches have a total membership of about 187,000;
in addition there are separate Baptist Unions for Scotland, Wales and Ireland
and other Baptist churches.
Among the other Free Churches are the Presbyterian Church in Ireland
(with some 137,000 regular communicants in Northern Ireland); the Pres¬
byterian (or Calvinistic Methodist) Church of Wales, which arose from the
revivalist movement led in 1735 Howell Harris and now numbers over

United Free Church of Scotland; the Free Presbyterian Church of Scotland;
the Reformed Presbyterian Church of Scotland; the Reformed Presbyterian
Church of Ireland; and the Non-Subscribing Presbyterian Church of Ireland.
Other Protestant denominations in Britain include: the Unitarian and Free
Christian Churches; the Churches of Christ (known also in the United States
of America as Disciples of Christ), which have been an organised community
in Britain since early in the nineteenth century; the British Province of the
Moravian Church, which is an international missionary church; the Free
Church of England (or Reformed Episcopal Church), which was formed in
1844 as a direct result of the Oxford Movement; and the Congregational
Federation which was formed from Congregational churches which did not
enter the United Reformed Church. The Society of Friends (Quakers)—with
over 21,000 members in Britain—came into being in the middle of the
seventeenth century under the leadership of George Fox and works for peace
and the relief of suffering in many parts of the world.
The Salvation Army, founded in Britain in 1865, has since spread to 82
other countries. Within Britain it has some 178,000 active members operating
from more than 1,000 centres of worship and a total community strength of
nbout 350,000. Believing in a very practical expression of Christian concern,
the Salvation Army also has 192 centres providing help for some 30,000 people
in need.
There are also a number of other religious organisations with churches or
assemblies in Britain, including the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day
Saints (the Mormon Church); and the Christian Scientists with some 300
branch churches and societies in the British Isles.
The Roman Catholic hierarchy in England and Wales, which became tem¬
porarily extinct during the sixteenth century, was restored in 1850; the Scottish
hierarchy became extinct in the early seventeenth century and was restored in
1878. There are now 6 Roman Catholic provinces in Great Britain, each under
an archbishop, 26 episcopal dioceses, and some 3,000 parishes. In Northern
Ireland, there are 9 dioceses, some of which have territory partly in the Irish
Republic. It is estimated that there are some 5-5 million adherents (including
children) to the Roman Catholic faith in the whole of Britain.
The Roman Catholic Church attaches great importance to the education of
its children and requires its members to try to bring up their children in the
Catholic faith. Many schools for Roman Catholic children in Britain are
staffed by members of the religious orders for men and women, who also
undertake other social work such as nursing, child care, and the conduct of
homes for old people.
Jews first settled in England at the time of the Norman conquest, but were
expelled at the end of the thirteenth century by an edict of Edward I. The
Anglo-Jewish community in Britain dates from 1656; consisting of some
410,000 people, including both Sephardi (originally from Spain and Portugal)
and Ashkenazi (from Germany and Eastern Europe), it has become one of the
largest groups of Jews in Europe. The community is divided into two schools
of thought—the Orthodox, to which about 80 per cent of practising Jews
belong; and the Reform, which originated in 1840 and was followed in 1901 by
the Liberal Jewish movement. The Chief Rabbi is the head of the largest group
(Ashkenazi) within Orthodox Jewry; the Haham is the head of the Sephardi
group. Jewish congregations in Britain number about 450. There has been an

increase in the number of Jewish denominational schools, which are now
attended by about one in five Jewish children.
Immigrants to Britain from Commonwealth and foreign countries have estab¬
lished centres of worship, especially in London, for their own communities.
Among the Christian communities represented are Orthodox, Lutheran and
Reformed Churches of various European countries and the Armenian Church.
The principal non-Christian communities in Britain, apart from the Jews,
are the Muslims, Buddhists, Hindus and Sikhs. It is estimated that there are
nearly one million Muslims in Britain; there are mosques or Islamic centres
in London, Manchester, Liverpool, Bradford, Cardiff and in many of the
other large cities in Britain. The community’s headquarters are at the London
Central Mosque and Islamic Cultural Centre. The Buddhist Society has its
headquarters in London, with a Shrine Room and a Buddhist library claimed
to be one of the finest in Europe; there are also Shrine Rooms in the three
Viharas in London, one of which is run by Thai monks and supported by the
Thai Government. In Scotland there is a Shrine Room at the Tibetan Centre.
Hindu and Sikh temples have been established in many areas where Asian
immigrants have settled.
The British Council of Churches, composed of representatives or consultant
observers from all the main Christian churches in the British Isles, facilitates
common action among the churches and seeks to further Christian unity. It
works with the Conference of Missionary Societies of Great Britain and
Ireland.
The Free Church Federal Council (which has a concordat with the British
Council of Churches) comprises most of the Free Churches in England and
Wales and aims to promote unity and joint action among the Free Churches
and to provide a channel for communication with central and local govern¬
ment authorities.
The Permanent Anglican-Roman Catholic Commission explores points of
possible unity between the two Churches.
The Anglican and the main Free Churches in the British Isles also partici¬
pate in the World Council of Churches (of which the British Council of
Churches is an associated national council) which links together some 250
churches in over 80 countries for co-operation and the study of common
problems. The Council of Christians and Jews works for better understanding
among members of the two religions and deals with problems in the social
field.
The New English Bible, a translation into modern English completed in
1970, is the result of co-operation among many of the Christian churches in
Britain.
The Sharing of Church Buildings Act 1969 enables agreements to be made
by two or more churches for the sharing of church buildings.
11 The National
Economy
Earlier Develop¬
ment of the
Economy
Britain s economy is characterised by the contribution of manufacturing
industry and services1 to national output—accounting, respectively, for about
30 and 45 per cent of total domestic income—and the importance of interna¬
tional trade (exports of goods and services, that is, visible and invisible
exports, equal about 26 per cent of gross domestic product). Britain ranks
fifth in world trade (after the United States, the Federal Republic of Germany,
Japan and France) and accounts for 6 per cent of total trade between the
market economies. It takes about 9 per cent of the world’s exports of primary
products, and contributes almost 9 per cent to the main manufacturing
countries’ exports of manufactured goods.
The discovery and exploitation of North Sea oil and gas resources is having
a fundamental effect on the economy.
As a result of a high level of agricultural productivity, Britain provides just
over half the food it needs from its own soil, although only 2-8 per cent of the
working population are engaged in agriculture—a lower proportion than in
any other major industrial country. The remaining agricultural supplies are
imported, Britain being among the world’s largest importers of such products
as wheat, meat, butter, fodder grains, fruit, tea, tobacco and wool. Other
imports include raw materials (such as metallic ores, crude oil and timber) and
semi-manufactures (for example, chemicals and textile yarns), as well as manu¬
factured products.
The imports are paid for by exports of (mainly) manufactured goods and by
invisible transactions—earnings on overseas investment (Britain is the world’s
second largest overseas investor, after the United States), travel, civil aviation,
British-owned shipping, and financial, banking, insurance and other services.
Britain is one of the world’s largest exporters of aircraft, motor vehicles, elec¬
trical equipment, finished textiles and most types of machinery. The country’s
competitive ability strongly influences the economic growth rate and the stan¬
dard of living. The gross domestic product per head of population rose in real
terms by about 23 per cent between 1964 and 1974.
The significant contribution made to export earnings by invisibles is in large
measure a reflection of Britain’s position as a major financial centre. Its banks,
insurance underwriters and brokers and other financial institutions provide
worldwide financial services. The City of London contains perhaps the most
comprehensive and advanced capital market in the world.
As a result of the ‘Industrial Revolution’ during the eighteenth and nineteenth
centuries (when a series of inventions led to a complete change in the character
of production), Britain emerged as the first great industrial nation and as a
pioneer of new methods in transport, communications and technology. It
1 Services in this context cover transport, communication, distributive trades, insurance,
banking, finance and business services, public health and education, and other services
excluding public administration, defence and ownership of dwellings.

The Second World
War and After
BRITAIN 1976: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
occupied a leading position as world manufacturer, merchant, carrier, banker
and investor, and its fast-growing economy supported a rapidly increasing
population. In the period from 1870 to 1890 British industry had a clear lead
over that of other countries. Between 1890 and 1914, industrial competition
from Europe and North America grew, but its effects on Britain’s export
industries, particularly cotton textiles and coal, were offset by a number of
factors including the rise in world trade and the returns on Britain’s large
overseas investments.
Following the first world war Britain’s older industries met increasing com¬
petition, for example, in coal and iron and steel from other European countries
and in textiles from some eastern countries where labour was cheaper. The
difficulties were increased by the world economic depression which began in
1929 and the associated attempts by many countries to reduce imports. The
result in Britain, as in many other countries, was heavy unemployment.
After 1932 levels of production and employment rose. The decade saw a
strong expansion in the vehicles, electrical, chemical and aircraft industries,
while the construction of 3 million houses brought about a large growth in the
building and ancillary industries.
During the second world war (i939-45) rapid and far-reaching re-orientation
of the economy towards the war effort was secured by central planning. The
Government involvement in the economy which this implied has remained,
in a modified form, a permanent feature of the British economic system.
In spite of generous aid from the United States and Canada, the war ran
down British domestic capital by about £3,000 million, through shipping
losses, bomb damage, and arrears of industrial maintenance and replacements.
Some £1,000 million worth of overseas investments were sold, nearly half in
North America, and new external debts of £3,000 million were accumulated,
while exports were greatly reduced.
After the war rationing and other controls were relaxed gradually as civil
production expanded and trade recovered. Quantitative restrictions on most
imports were gradually removed, exchange controls on transactions between
the sterling area and the rest of the world were also for the most part lifted,
and convertibility of sterling on current account was introduced for non¬
residents.
ECONOMIC MANAGEMENT
The objectives of the Government in managing the economy are to achieve
a steady rate of growth, rising exports and investment, a high level of employ¬
ment and a more equitable distribution of income. Its policies are carried out
by the main government departments with economic responsibilities on a
national scale: the Treasury, the Departments of Trade, Industry, Employ¬
ment, Energy, Prices and Consumer Protection, and the Environment, and
the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food.
An important advisory body on general economic policy is the National
Economic Development Council, which brings together representatives of
government, management and trade unions under the chairmanship of the
Prime Minister. It has an independent but publicly financed secretariat and
has established a number of economic development committees dealing with
different industries and services and different aspects of industry. Other bodies
responsible for advice on specific aspects of policy include the Monopolies and
Mergers Commission (on action to prevent the abuse of monopoly power, see

Economic
Planning
Machinery
Guidance of the
Economy

p. 209) and the Office of Manpower Economics (which provides the secretariat
for the three pay review bodies, see p. 348).
On matters of major public policy such as the broad economic strategy, and
problems such as inflation and industrial relations, the Government makes
known its purposes, and keeps in touch with developments throughout the
economy, by means of informal and continuous links with the chief industrial,
financial, labour and other interests. Final responsibility for the broad lines of
economic policy rests with the Cabinet (see p. 43).
The Secretary of State for the Environment has responsibilities for regional
planning in England, which is carried out with the help of the Regional
Economic Planning Councils and Economic Planning Boards. There is a
council and a board in each of the eight economic planning regions: Northern,
Yorkshire and Humberside, East Midlands, East Anglia, South East, South
West, West Midlands and North West. The councils, which are advisory
bodies, comprise part-time members with wide experience of their regions.
They help in the preparation of broad economic and land-use strategies which
provide a regional framework for national and local planning and investment
decisions. The boards consist of senior officials in the regions of the govern¬
ment departments concerned with aspects of regional planning. They co¬
ordinate the regional work of departments and provide the councils with
information and advice.
Scotland also has an Economic Council and an Economic Planning Board;
there is a Welsh Council and a Welsh Planning Board; and Northern Ireland
has an Economic Council.
The period after 1945 was one of rising production and, until 1970, a low
level of unemployment (generally 2-5 per cent or lower); but economic
growth, which averaged 2 to 3 per cent up to 1971, was rather slower and more
intermittent than in most other western European countries. There were also
certain persistent economic problems, such as periodic difficulties with the
balance of payments especially during periods of relatively high pressure of
demand. In spite of the contribution from invisibles, there were substantial
deficits on current account in a number of years.
In the 1960s successive governments sought to deal with these problems
in a number of ways, sometimes restraining the growth in home demand and
implementing policies designed to hold down rises in incomes and prices.
Following the devaluation of sterling in 1967, from $2.80 to $2.40 = £1,
exports recovered, leading to a substantial surplus on visible trade and a record
current account surplus by 1971.
In July 1971 the then Government embarked on a policy designed to raise
the economic growth rate and so reduce the unemployment rate, which had
begun to rise rapidly. Consumer demand was strongly stimulated; other
measures over the following 18 months included an increase in investment
incentives (see p. 210), changes in the administration of regional policy (see
p. 210) and in the taxation system (for the present system see p. 365) and the
establishment of a new system of control over money and credit (see p. 370).
In 1973 as a whole the economy achieved an annual growth rate of about
5 per cent; growth slackened, as the year went on, from the 8 per cent annual
rate reached in the first quarter. With the onset of the world energy crisis
towards the end of the year, however, and a prolonged dispute in the mining
industry, special measures were necessary for a time to conserve energy; this
had the effect of reducing production temporarily. During 1974 the world
196
BRITAIN 1976: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
economy entered a phase of recession, caused mainly by accelerating inflation
and the large increases in the cost of oil (see p. 381).
The Budget presented to Parliament in November 1974 (following a full
Budget in March and budget-type measures in July) was designed to improve
employment prospects in 1975 by relieving financial pressures bearing on firms
and to steer resources from personal or public expenditure into exports and
investment, while helping those least well placed to protect themselves against
the effects of rising prices. At the time of the Budget of April i975> ^ace
of a large balance-of-payments deficit—caused mainly by the rise in oil prices
and financed by external borrowing—and in the expectation of growth in
world trade during 1976, the Government took measures designed to release
resources for exports, strengthen Britain’s industrial base and reduce the
public sector borrowing requirement as a percentage of gross national product.
Control of Inflation Inflation, which began to gather momentum in the 1950s and 1960s, has con¬
tinued to rise in Britain, as in most other developed industrial countries, in the
1970s. Britain’s inflation rate accelerated during 1973 and 1974 because of
rapid increases in world prices of food and raw materials (especially oil) which
it must import in large quantities. Rises in commodity prices began to
moderate in 1974, however, and in 1975 the Prices °f rnany commodities fell,
leaving continued increases in wage rates as the main cause of inflation during
the first half of the year; these increases were expected to slow down as a
result of the policy introduced in July (see below). Table 8 gives a broad
indication of the rate of inflation since 1964.

Since the second world war successive governments have adopted policies
—some including statutory controls of pay or prices or both—to slow down
the rate of inflation. The present policy follows from the ‘social contract’—an
agreement originally reached between the Labour Party and the Trades Union
Congress (TUC, see p. 000) in February 1973 on measures necessary to con¬
trol inflation and achieve sustained growth in the standard of living. The
Labour Party undertook to maintain free collective wage bargaining without
statutory control, to control prices, to help the lower-paid and pensioners
and to aim at full employment; while the TUC acknowledged that, in
the absence of a statutory incomes policy, trade unions have loyalties not only
to their own members but to other members of the community, and should
therefore aim to keep pay increases in step with the cost of living.
In June 1974 the TUC issued a policy statement, Collective Bargaining and
the Social Contract, reviewing the situation and containing recommendations
(or ‘guidelines’) to unions and negotiators about the conduct of collective
bargaining in the period ahead. The statement was a response to the Govern¬
ment’s commitment to, and implementation of, a wide range of economic and
social policies (which have included the payment of subsidies on essential
foods such as milk, butter, household flour and certain kinds of bread, cheese
and tea,1 a standstill on housing rents until 31st March 1975, followed by a
controlled rise, and higher pensions and other social benefits).
Money Supply

Enterprise
THE NATIONAL ECONOMY Igy
While the majority of wage negotiations during the 1974-75 PaY round took
account of the guidelines and thus helped limit the size of pay settlements,
rises in the rate of inflation led to a further development of the policy in mid-
I975 after consultations between the Government, the Confederation of
British Industry (CBI, see p. 351) and the TUC which concluded with a broad
measure of agreement. The new policy combined the continued control of
prices (under a Price Code administered by an independent statutory agency,
the Price Commission) with a limit of ^6 a week on pay increases (no increases
on earnings over £8,500 a year) and a 10 per cent limit on dividend increases.
The £6 pay limit was introduced on 1st August 1975, for a year in the first
instance, having been announced in a government policy statement, The Attack
on Inflation (see Bibliography p. 476). This included (with some modification)
new pay guidelines contained in the TUC document, The Development of the
Social Contract. The Government also intends to reinforce control of public
expenditure in 1976—77 by making more extensive use of cash limits.
In controlling the money supply the Government has been concerned to
ensure sufficient liquidity to support the growth of output but at the same time
to avoid excessive monetary expansion in a period of inflationary pressures.
In 1972 and 1973 the money supply expanded rapidly, as a result of the
structural changes following the introduction in 1971 of a new system of credit
control (see p. 37®) and the increased bank lending in sterling to the private
sector. As the economy approached full capacity in 1973, successive steps were
taken to restrain the increase in money and credit, including calls by the Bank
of England for special deposits from the banking system (which reduce its
reserve assets base). At the same time banks were requested to restrict in¬
essential lending so that priority could be given to finance for essential pur¬
poses, such as investment and exports. In 1974 tbe pace of the monetary
expansion slackened substantially. Interest rates had reached high levels, as in
other countries, but there was some easing of short-term rates following
repayments of special deposits to the banks. In the early part of 1975 the lower
rate of expansion was maintained and most interest rates fell.
In Britain’s mixed economy, direct state intervention in industry and com¬
merce (as well as in social, cultural and other affairs) is often effected through
special public corporations set up, usually by statute, to deal with a particular
activity. Though not a part of a government department, the corporations are
under varying degrees of public control. The most important are those which
in the public interest operate major nationalised industries—including coal,
electricity, gas, steel, railways, airports and air transport, commercial road
transport and postal services. These industries and services are described in
their relevant sections. Altogether about 8 per cent of all employees work for
these bodies. (The public sector as a whole employs about a quarter of the
working population.) In 1974 the Government published proposals for com¬
munity ownership of development land, the establishment of the British
National Oil Corporation through which the Government would exercise its
participation rights in the exploitation of Britain’s offshore oil resources, the
nationalisation of the shipbuilding and aircraft industries, and the bringing of
privately owned commercial ports and cargo handling activities under public
ownership and control.

BRITAIN 1976: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
The managing boards and staffs of the nationalised industries are chosen for
their experience and competence in a particular field; they are not civil ser¬
vants, and, although accountable to Parliament for their actions in a variety of
ways ’ it is they and not the ministers of the sponsoring departments who are
responsible for management. Certain of the nationalised industries are self-
supporting; others receive Exchequer grants to help them to carry out duties
with which they have been charged. . .
The extent to which the responsible minister has power over the working
of the boards which have been set up to run the nationalised industries varies
from industry to industry, but two features are common to almost all of them.
First, the minister appoints (and may dismiss) the chairman and members of
each board, and, secondly, he has power to give general directions as to how
the industry should be run, but does not interfere in day-to-day management.
It is usually also laid down that the board shall give to the minister any in¬
formation, statistics and financial accounts which he may require. In practice,
as the responsible minister is kept fully informed and major policy decisions
are reached in consultation with him, there is very seldom occasion for him to
issue a formal directive. ™ ,
The minister also has financial powers and responsibilities. The usua
statutory requirement is that the board is required to conduct its business
so that receipts at least balance outgoings over a period. However, financial
targets have been agreed by the Government with the different industries (or
are under discussion) ranging from 12-4 per cent gross return on capital
employed to ‘breaking even’ after interest and depreciation have been allowed
for In addition the industries are expected to apply a test discount rate of 10
per cent for new investment. The responsible minister is usually empowered,
subject to Treasury approval, to say what shall be done with any surplus
revenues which may accrue. As regards finance for capital expenditure, the
present system is that finance which cannot be met from internal sources is
provided mainly by interest-bearing loans from the Exchequer and in certain
cases by borrowing from abroad. ^ ^ ,
It is usual for the minister responsible for each nationalised industry to be
required by statute to take steps to see that the interests of the industry s
customers are protected. This is generally done by the establishment of repre¬
sentative consumers’ councils to consider complaints and suggestions made
to them, and to advise the board or the minister on the changes they think
deGoavernment policy towards the nationalised industries is subject to the
approval of Parliament. Opportunities for parliamentary discussion are
afforded by debates, including debates on their annual reports and accounts,
and by answers to parliamentary questions, which, in principle, are admissible
only if concerned with policy rather than details of administration. A sessional
House of Commons Select Committee on the Nationalised Industries examines
the reports and accounts of the nationalised industries. (Its powers of investiga¬
tion also include several other public corporations such as the Independent
Broadcasting Authority, Cable and Wireless Limited and certain activities of
the Bank of England.) .
Apart from public corporations, state participation and intervention in
industry takes several other forms, described on pp. 208-14. Under the
. Industry Bill, introduced in 1975, the Government is to set up a National
Enterprise Board. One of the board’s functions would be to execute the
Government’s policies in relation to state shareholdings in the private sector
(see p. 208).

The main economic adjustments provided for in the Treaty of Accession to
the European Community are set out in Chapter 3 and in other relevant

THE EXTERNAL POSITION
In the years following devaluation in 1967 exports of goods and services
increased rapidly in real terms. Helped by a record surplus on current trans¬
actions of over £1,000 million in 1971, and by massive capital inflows, the
reserves stood at the high level of just over £2,740 million by the end of May
1972, after the repayment of all official short- and medium-term debt.
In 1972 the trade balance began to deteriorate; imports were swollen by the
rapid growth of domestic demand, and exports were affected by various factors
including the slower growth of world trade. This deterioration, together with
growing fears about inflation, led to a large outflow of short-term speculative
capital in June 1972, and the Government decided to allow the pound to float
and applied exchange control to transactions with the overseas sterling coun¬
tries (see p. 200). The lower sterling exchange rate made Britain highly com¬
petitive, and the volume of exports, which had not changed from 1971 to 1972,
increased by almost 12 per cent in 1973 and by 7 per cent in 1974. Nevertheless,
mainly as a result of rising prices of imports, including oil (see pp. 380-1), and
despite the positive invisible balance, there was a large deficit on the current
account in both 1973 and 1974. The balance of payments improved during the
course of 1975 (see p. 391). In future years increasing supplies of oil from
the North Sea (see p. 267) can be expected to bring considerable advantage
to the balance of payments. (For details of overseas trade and payments see
Chapter 18.)
In December 1971, following a period of uncertainty ininternational exchange
markets, particularly affecting the United States dollar, a general international
realignment of exchange rates was agreed at a meeting held in the Smithsonian
Institute in Washington, in which all the main currencies were in effect re¬
valued against the dollar. (The rates of exchange fixed in that agreement are
called Smithsonian parities.) As part of this realignment, the sterling rate for
the dollar moved up by just over 8| per cent, the new middle rate being
$2.60571 compared with the old par value of $2.40. This was the direct result
of the US decision to raise the dollar value of monetary gold from $35 to $38
per fine ounce.
The exchange markets continued to be unsettled during 1972 and early
1973, causing a number of further adjustments and flotations including the
floating of the pound (see above). By the end of March 1973, the dollar had
been devalued by a further 10 per cent against gold, thus raising the official
price of gold to $42.22 a fine ounce and increasing the parity rate of the pound
to $2.89524. At the end of August 1975 the effective depreciation of sterling
in relation to the Smithsonian parities structure (the effective rate) was about
27 per cent, and the market rate was £1 = $2.1102.
Six member countries of the European Community (Belgium, Denmark, the
Federal Republic of Germany, France, Luxembourg and the Netherlands), as
well as Sweden and Norway, maintain a scheme, usually called the ‘snake’,
under which rates between any two of their currencies cannot diverge from
their cross parities by more than 2J per cent.

countries tended to use sterling as their currency for international transactions.
As trade and payments arrangements have become more diversified in recent
years, the international use of sterling has declined relatively. However, a
number of countries hold sterling balances in Britain. The term sterling
area' applies to those countries which link their currencies to sterling and
keep most of their exchange reserves in the form of balances with the Bank
of England. The area includes all the Commonwealth countries (see p. 23)
and their dependencies except Canada and Rhodesia, together with Bahrain,
Iceland, the Irish Republic, Jordan, Kuwait, The Maldives, Oman, Pakistan,
Qatar, South Africa, Namibia (South West Africa), The United Arab
Emirates and the People’s Democratic Republic of Yemen. The overseas
sterling countries comprise the sterling area countries except for the United
Kingdom, the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man, the Irish Republic and
Gibraltar.
The Committee of Twenty (representative of the major industrial and the
developing countries), which had been set up within the International
Monetary Fund (IMF) framework, concluded its work on the reform of the
international monetary system in June 1974. The committee agreed on a
method of valuation of the special drawing right (SDR—an international
reserve asset) for an interim period, recommended guidelines for the manage¬
ment of floating exchange rates, and agreed on some principles of corrective
action for countries with balance of payments disequilibria.
The work on international monetary reform is being continued by the IMF’s
Interim Committee and the joint Development Committee of the IMF and
the World Bank. Following the large increases in oil prices the IMF set up a
borrowing arrangement, called the oil facility, through which countries can
draw on funds lent mainly by oil-exporting countries. In September 1975
agreement was reached, subject to ratification, to remove from the articles
of the IMF any special status accorded to gold in the world monetary affairs.
The agreement provides for the abolition of the official gold price and of gold
transactions between member countries and the IMF. The IMF s gold
holdings would be gradually disposed of and part of the proceeds used to help
developing countries.
In April 1975 a Financial Support Fund was set up within the Organisation
for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD—a group of 24
developed countries) as a safety net for its members in case other international
measures prove inadequate to deal with their financial problems.
NATIONAL INCOME AND EXPENDITURE
The following sections sketch briefly the structure and disposal of Britain’s
national income in recent years.
In 1974 Britain’s gross national product at factor cost (the measure of the total
value of goods and services produced at home and net income from abroad) is
estimated to have amounted to £73,977 million. After allowing for price
changes, the increase over the 10 years since 1964 was nearly 27 Per cent*
About a third of total output can be attributed to manufacturing industry
and this proportion has remained more or less constant for a number of years.
The expanding industry groups in recent years (in relation to the economy as
a whole) have been most of the services, particularly insurance, banking and
finance, public administration and health and educational services. Agri¬
culture, forestry and fishing have accounted for a small and slowly declining

share, and mining for a small and more rapidly declining share. The relative
contribution of the distributive trades has also declined. Table 9 summarises
the contribution of each industry group.

Table 10 shows the distribution of total supplies of goods and services in
1964, 1969 and 1974 at 1970 market prices, divided between personal con¬
sumption, public expenditure on goods and services, investment and exports.
The main trends since 1964 are a fall in the proportion of total available
output devoted to personal consumption and to public authorities current
expenditure and a significant rise in the proportion devoted to exports.
Personal incomes before tax at current prices rose rapidly and fairly steadily
from over £27,500 million in 1964 to over £74,800 million in 1974 a com"
pound rate of about 10 per cent a year. The increase in consumer expenditure
at constant prices has, however, been only about 2 5 Per cent a year. The
difference is accounted for mainly by rising prices and to a lesser extent by a
higher incidence of direct taxation and increased personal savings.
Income from employment in 1974 totalled £52,000 million and accounted
for about 69 per cent of total personal income (compared with about 72 per
cent in 1964). The three other main sources of personal income were self-
employment (11 per cent), income from rent, dividends and interest (9 per
cent), and grants from public authorities (10 per cent). The general pattern
of income distribution is thus dominated by income from employment.
The combined effect of taxation and transfer payments and benefits in
kind1 is to redistribute income on more egalitarian lines. According to studies
by the Central Statistical Office, the effect in 1973 was to raise the highest
income among the poorest fifth of households (that is, the income at the
lowest quintile) from 25 to 54 per cent of the median income of all households.
Similar conclusions about income redistribution were reached by the standing
Royal Commission on the Distribution of Income and Wealth (see p. 347),
in its first report (see Bibliography, p. 47^)‘ Illustrating trends in income over
a period the report also shows a continuing decline in the share of the top 5
per cent of income recipients after tax from 17‘7 per cent in 1949 to 14 2 per
cent in 1972-73. The second report, on income from companies, shows that

rather more than one-third, of dividends, indirectly, go to about 11 million
members of occupational pension schemes, 2-25 million taxpayers receiving
occupational pensions and 14 million taxpayers who save through life assur¬
ance; these groups include many people of moderate means.
The rise in the volume of consumers’ spending has been accompanied, in
Britain as in other advanced industrial countries, by changes in its pattern.
The proportions of expenditure devoted to food, tobacco and clothing have
been falling while the proportions spent on housing, alcoholic drink, and the
running costs of motor vehicles have risen. These and other changes are
shown in Table 11.

Discrepancies between totals and their constituent parts are due to rounding.
Current expenditure on goods and services by the central Government and
local authorities rose by about 28 per cent at 1970 market prices over the
period 1964 to 1974 when it amounted to about 22 per cent of the gross
domestic product. The main cause of this increase was the continuing growth
of the social services, especially education. Defence has recently accounted for
a declining share of public expenditure on goods and services—23 per cent in
1974 compared with 36 per cent in 1964 and a peak of 48 per cent in 1953.
In addition to their expenditure on goods and services, public authorities
transfer large sums to other sectors, mainly the personal sector, by way of
national insurance and other social security benefits, grants, and interest and
subsidies (see pp. 127 and 183). The Government also makes grants to local
authorities to finance about 50 per cent of their current expenditure.
Gross domestic fixed capital formation represents about 22 per cent of the
gross domestic product at factor cost. The total value of fixed assets in Britain,
valued at constant replacement cost, is estimated to have increased by 47 per
cent between 1964 and 1974 when their current replacement value, net of
depreciation, was some £254,000 million, of which about two-thirds was
accounted for by buildings and one-third by plant and machinery, and vehicles.
204
Saving and
Lending
BRITAIN 1976: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Within the total of gross domestic fixed capital formation in 1974 (£9,805
million compared with £9,191 million in 1969 at constant prices) private
sector investment accounted for i2’i per cent of the gross domestic product
at factor cost (12-2 per cent in 1969) and the public sector for 8-4 per cent
(9-4 per cent). The approximate shares of industry groups in total fixed
investment in 1974 were (1969 figures in brackets): manufacturing, 21 per
cent (22 per cent), gas, electricity and water, 6 per cent (9 per cent), transport
and communications, 13 per cent (12 per cent), distributive trades, 6 per cent
(5 per cent), dwellings, 17 per cent (19 per cent), social and other public
services, 15 per cent (14 per cent), and other industries, 23 per cent (18 per
cent). There is a marked cyclical pattern in the flow of investment by manu¬
facturing industry; it was at a low point in 1967 an<^ I972 but rose in 1973
and 1974. Among the trends over recent years have been increases in invest¬
ment in agriculture, mining (other than coal mining), shipping and retail
distribution.
Saving has made a significant contribution to the rising levels of investment
in all the main sectors of the economy. The extent to which each sector con¬
tributed on balance, by way of lending, to the capital formation of the other
sectors (and to net investment abroad) in 1972-74 or drew on the saving of
the other sectors is shown by the sector’s net acquisition of financial assets
(see Table 12).
The main features of 1974 were the large financial deficit of the public
sector and the large financial surplus of the overseas sector (which equals net
overseas investment in Britain).

The public sector’s financial deficit (a negative net acquisition of financial
assets) increased substantially in 1974 to some £5,079 million, 81 per cent
above 1973. Much of the public sector’s deficit in 1974 was financed by
borrowing overseas. Local authorities and nationalised industries accounted
for most of the £2,606 million borrowed from overseas under the exchange
cover scheme which safeguards public sector borrowers against the risk of loss

resulting from changes in the exchange rate. Rather more than half of the
central Government’s borrowing requirements was covered by sales of debt
to the non-bank public. The public sector’s capital formation at current prices
was some £1,549 million higher, and saving by both central Government and
local authorities was reduced as a result of the rapid increase in current
expenditure overtaking a more modest growth in revenue. Public corporations
had a slightly greater surplus on current account. The company sector was in
deficit in 1974 (following a smaller deficit in 1973) as company stocks rose
sharply—largely because of the much higher stock appreciation—and fixed
capital formation increased. The personal sector increased its net acquisition
of financial assets mainly by increasing its saving and reducing gross domestic
fixed capital formation.
12 Industry
Production industries (mining and quarrying, manufacturing, construction
and gas, electricity and water) and distributive trades together account for
more than half of Britain’s gross domestic product, manufacturing for some
34 per cent and distributive trades n per cent. About 55 per cent of Britain’s
employed labour force is engaged in these sectors, while over 80 per cent of
Britain’s visible exports consists of manufactured or semi-manufactured pro¬
ducts. The following sections discuss general industrial topics—such as
investment, productivity, location and the Government’s relations with
industry—together with manufacturing industry, construction and distributive
and service trades. For the energy industries (coal, gas, petroleum and
electricity) see Chapter 13.
ORGANISATION AND PRODUCTION
Structure The pattern of ownership and organisation in industry is varied. Personal,
corporate, co-operative and public enterprise all assume a number of different
forms, and all are important in the economy. Industrial enterprises vary from
such large-scale organisations as the General Electric Company (201,000
employees) and Imperial Chemical Industries (199,000), and the public
corporations such as the National Coal Board with about 337,000 employees,
to the many thousands of small firms, which nevertheless account for some¬
thing like one-fifth of the gross national product. Most manufacturing is in the
hands of private enterprise, but it is government policy to increase control
where public funds are involved. It is proposed to take into public ownership
a large part of the aircraft and shipbuilding industries and of the North Sea oil
resources (see p. 267) and to extend the role of public enterprise in the road
haulage and construction industries. Most iron and steel production is already
in public ownership. Other state-controlled products include a small range of
chemicals from the plants of the British Steel Corporation; aero-engines made
by Rolls-Royce (1971) Ltd.; locomotives and rolling-stock built in the work¬
shops of British Railways; military equipment and supplies made in establish¬
ments of the defence services and fissile materials and radioactive isotopes,
made by two statutory companies (see p. 235). Certain factories giving employ¬
ment to the severely disabled are operated by Remploy Ltd., a non-profit-
making public company partly financed by the Department of Employment.
In addition the Government has a major holding in British Petroleum Limited,
and has an interest in a number of other companies.
The most recent complete analysis of the size distribution of establishments
and enterprises in manufacturing industry, and of the degree of concentration,
is contained in the Report on the Census of Production i()68. This shows that
some 64 per cent (59,000) of the 92,000 or so establishments which submitted
returns had fewer than 25 employees each, and accounted for 7 per cent of
total employment; some 28,000 establishments, nearly one-third of the total,
had between 25—500 employees, and accounted for over two-fifths of the total
labour force; 2,400 establishments, each with between 500 and 2,000 em¬
ployees, were responsible for 28 per cent of employment; while 21 per cent
was in the hands of the 409 leading groups each with over 2,000 employees. A
high proportion of the biggest establishments were in the heavy industries;
INDUSTRY
Industrial
Association
207
the average size of establishments in industries making consumer goods was
smaller than in manufacturing industries as a whole. An enterprise, as defined
in the 1968 census, normally consists of either a single firm or a parent
company together with its subsidiaries. Just over 34 per cent of all employment
in British manufacturing industries in 1968 was accounted for by more than
1,000 large private enterprises employing 1,000 or more people, the largest 100
or so accounting roughly for a third. A further indication of company size is
the value of capital employed (net assets). In the case of three companies, the
Imperial Chemical Industries group, British Petroleum and Shell Transport
and Trading, the figure exceeds £2,000 million; about 100 companies regis¬
tered in Britain have over j£ioo million net assets. Of the top 20 industrial
groups in Europe in terms of annual sales, five are British.
With intensified competition in the economy and, in many branches of
industry, the growing dependence of profitable operation on concentration and
economies of scale, the trend towards mergers and regrouping has gathered
momentum in recent years, although it was considerably less marked in 1974.
Larger units of control have been established in almost all the leading indus¬
tries and in some a small number of big companies and their subsidiaries are
responsible for a very large proportion of total production. Examples are oil
refining, non-ferrous metal smelting, motor vehicles and aircraft, heavy
electrical engineering, electronics, machine tools, brewing, textiles, basic
chemicals, tobacco and magazine publishing. Shares in these companies are,
however, usually distributed among a great number of holders or are held by
insurance companies or pension funds representing a broad cross-section of
the community, and it is rare for a few large holders to have a controlling
interest. For example, more than 40 of the largest public companies each have
more than 100,000 shareholders.
Private industrial undertakings have increasingly entered into voluntary
association for a number of different purposes, including the provision of
common services, the exchange of information and representation of their
members’ point of view; the regulation of trading practices; and negotiation
with trade unions on wages and conditions of work. Associations for these
purposes cover, with varying completeness, most of British industry. Trade
associations, concerned mainly with representation to the Government, the
provision of common services and the regulation of trading practices, are
normally composed of firms manufacturing a particular product or group of
products. Employers’ organisations which deal with employment matters
usually consist of firms engaged in the same type of operation or manufacturing
process. In an industrial sector concerned wholly with an allied group of
products, a single association may undertake all the required functions.
There are about 50 national federations and some 1,100 employers’
organisations (mostly regional or local, and members or branches of the
national federations) concerned with negotiation of wages and conditions of
work (see p. 350). The number of manufacturers’ associations concerned
with providing common services is not known precisely but is thought to
total some 1,200 varying greatly in importance, structure and activities.
The central body representing British industry nationally is the Confedera¬
tion of British Industry (CBI), recognised by the Government as a channel for
consultation between government departments and representatives of private
employers as a whole. For its members it acts as an advisory and consultative
body providing them with information and statistics, ascertaining their col¬
lective views and representing them nationally to the Government and the
2o8
BRITAIN 1976: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
public and also internationally, for example in the Council of European
Industrial Federations. CBI representatives sit on the National Economic
Development Council, the Manpower Services Commission, the Health and
Safety Commission and other official advisory committees and voluntary
bodies concerned with matters affecting industry.
The CBI membership consists of some 12,000 companies and about 230
employers’ organisations and trade and commercial associations. Nationalised
industries have joined as industrial associates. The CBI has a regional organisa¬
tion in Britain and is widely represented abroad. In matters of common concern
the CBI often acts jointly with the chambers of commerce. These are open to
all kinds of producers and traders and exist to promote the interests of local
industry and commerce. The Association of British Chambers of Commerce,
founded in i860, is the central organisation to which approximately 100 local
chambers of commerce (together with 20 British Chambers of Commerce
operating abroad) are affiliated, d hese chambers have a membership of about
50,000 firms. In Scotland there is an additional central organisation, the
Scottish Chamber of Commerce, and in Northern Ireland the Northern
Ireland Chamber of Commerce and Industry to which local chambers are
affiliated.
The
Government
and Industry
Within the framework of economic and social policy as a whole it has been a
continuing aim of government policy to promote the expansion and modernisa¬
tion of industry and at the same time to develop an effective solution to the
problems of regional imbalances. The Government has traditionally sought to
influence industrial activity in a number of ways—through fiscal and monetary
policy, through the level of public expenditure, by incentives for industrial
investment and by the provision of services, information and advice. Legislative
arrangements have been developed to control aspects of employment, mono¬
polies, mergers and restrictive practices and new industrial and office building
and changes in land use.
The aims of the new Industry Bill introduced in 1975 are to encourage
investment in manufacturing industry, extend public ownership in profitable
industrial firms and increase industrial democracy by closer dialogue between
Government, management and the trade unions. The National Enterprise
Board, a public corporation to be established under the Bill with funds
totalling £1,500 million, will provide a new source of public investment
capital. It will establish new industrial enterprises and give selective financial
assistance, extend public ownership by acquiring individual firms and adminis¬
ter government shareholdings in industry. In Scotland and Wales, regional
functions of the National Enterprise Board will be the responsibility of
Scottish and Welsh Development Agencies (see p. 213). Planning agreements
between Government and leading firms and the disclosure of information by
certain firms to the Government and the relevant trade unions are the other
main provisions of the Bill. It also amends certain provisions of the Industry
Act 1972 (see p. 212) concerning selective financial assistance to industry.
The Department of Industry (see p. 51) is responsible for industrial policy
as a whole on both a national and regional level; 1975 marked the devolution
of certain responsibilities towards industry in Scotland and Wales to the
Scottish and Welsh Offices respectively (see pp. 56 and 55). In Northern
Ireland the Department of Commerce (see p. 58) deals with industry and
industrial development. Related responsibilities (for example, those of the
Department of Employment for manpower affairs) are discussed in the
appropriate chapters.

209
In addition there is close association between industry and the Government
through such channels as the National Economic Development Council, the
main forum for consultation between the Government, management and the
trade unions, and the Economic Development Committees (EDCs) which cover
particular industrial sectors.
The EDCs bring together leading representatives of government, manage¬
ment and unions to study, and make recommendations on, the efficiency and
prospects of individual industries.
Competition
Policy
European
Community
Monopolies
and Mergers
Competition policy has led to the development of machinery for scrutinising
monopolies, mergers and restrictive trade practices and of powers to regulate
any structural changes or uncompetitive practices which operate against the
public interest. The relevant statutes are the Fair Trading Act 1973 which
contains all current legislation on monopolies and mergers; it also sets out
recent changes and additions to the restrictive practices legislation, of which
the basis is the Restrictive Trade Practices Acts 1956 and 1968. The Director
General of Fair Trading has certain statutory responsibilities in respect of
monopolies, mergers and restrictive practices, in addition to his work on
consumer protection.
The objective of the competition policy of the European Community is to
promote free and fair competition throughout the nine member countries.
The Community’s rules of competition, which are set out in the Treaty of
Rome, ban practices which prevent, restrict or distort competition and pro¬
hibit the abuse of ‘dominant positions’. These rules apply where trade between
member countries may be affected. Agreements which fall within the rules
must be notified to the Commission of the European Community; they have
limited powers to exempt agreements which, though restrictive of competition
between member countries, benefit the Community in defined ways.
Monopoly situations can be referred—by the Secretary of State for Prices and
Consumer Protection or by the Director General of Fair Trading—for
investigation by the Monopolies and Mergers Commission. The market share
by reference to which monopoly is defined is one-quarter; local monopolies
and monopolies in public sector industries can also be referred to the commis¬
sion. If the commission finds that monopoly conditions operate against the
public interest (for example, the commission must take into account the need
to maintain and promote the balanced distribution of industry and employ¬
ment in Britain) the Department of Prices and Consumer Protection has
powers to make orders and otherwise to remedy or prevent the harm which the
commission considers may result. These powers are, however, not available to
implement reports by the commission on general references or references of
restrictive labour practices. The Director General of Fair Trading also has the
duty, when requested by ministers, of negotiating undertakings with the firms
concerned following a commission report, of advising on the use of the order¬
making power and of supervising the observance of undertakings or orders.
A merger may be referred to the commission by the Secretary of State for
Prices and Consumer Protection if it results in, or intensifies, a monopoly
situation, or if the value of gross assets taken over exceeds £5 million. There
are special provisions relating to newspaper and certain other mergers. The
Director General of Fair Trading has the same task of advising on the action
to be taken following a commission report on a merger reference that he has in
relation to monopoly reports.

The Restrictive Trade Practices Acts 1956 and 1968, as amended by the Fair
Trading Act 1973, require the entry in a public register of the particulars of a
wide range of restrictive agreements (including those relating to common
prices, approved lists of dealers and the limitation of production) which affect
the supply of goods or commercial services for the British market. Such agree¬
ments must be notified to the Director General of Fair Trading who is res¬
ponsible for bringing registered agreements before the Restrictive Practices
Court. The court, which was set up under the 1956 Act, has powers to prohibit
the operation of agreements which it decides are contrary to public interest.
Registration and judicial examination has applied to agreements relating to
goods since 1956. Under powers provided in the Fair Trading Act, they will
be applied to commercial services in 1975. Not all restrictive agreements are
taken before the court; there is a frequently used procedure by which those
containing only insignificant restrictions may effectively be exempted. The
Secretary of State for Prices and Consumer Protection may exempt proposed
agreements of substantial importance to the national economy or agreements
designed to keep prices down. Restrictive agreements relating exclusively to
exports are not subject to registration but they must be notified to the Director
General of Fair Trading (and to the Commission of the European Community
if they fall within its rules of competition).
Britain has a generous system of national incentives for industrial development
which compares favourably with the incentives offered by other member
countries of the European Community or the United States. Under the
Finance Act 1972 incentives to encourage capital expenditure in plant and
machinery take the form of a system of free depreciation enabling the whole of
such expenditure to be written off against profits for tax purposes in the year
in which it is incurred; there is in addition a 54 per cent initial allowance on
new industrial buildings and structures and an annual writing down allowance
of 4 per cent thereafter. Direct investment from overseas is also encouraged,
and overseas firms are offered the same facilities and incentives as those apply¬
ing to British-owned companies.
Economic imbalance between different parts of the country is due partly to
the steady decline over the years of older industries, such as coalmining and
shipbuilding, causing a high level of unemployment in certain regions and such
adverse factors as poor amenities, derelict buildings and land and net outward
migration. In addition, the newer and expanding industries have tended to
develop mostly in the Midlands and the South East, and unemployment has
remained a persistent problem in Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland and some
parts of England, particularly the North and Merseyside. The ending of
regional imbalance has been an objective of successive Governments. Finan¬
cial and other aid to areas of high unemployment began in the 1930s and has
been expanded considerably over the years.
The map (see p. 211) shows those parts of the country where preferential
assistance is offered by the Government to encourage industrial development
and the movement of office and other service employment. The assisted
areas cover the whole of Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland and the North
Yorkshire and Humberside regions; almost all of the North West Region;
parts of the South West and East Midlands regions; and Oswestry in the West
Midlands. There are three different categories of assisted area; special develop¬
ment areas, where the economic situation and consistently high rates of

unemployment give rise to the most urgent need for assistance, development
areas with similar but rather less severe problems, and the intermediate areas,
where some assistance is necessary but where the need is relatively less acute
than in the other types of area. Under the Industry Act 1972 regional develop¬
ment grants are available in the assisted areas to help meet the cost of buildings
and works on premises used wholly or mainly for specified activities in manu¬
facturing, construction and mining and, in the special development and develop¬
ment areas only, towards the cost of plant and machinery as well. These
grants are not limited to projects creating employment, and are thus available
to help with improvements and modernisation. In addition, they are not
treated as reducing the capital expenditure which qualifies for tax allowances.
The Industry Act also provides for selective financial assistance for projects
which are likely to provide, maintain or safeguard employment in any part of
the assisted areas. Assistance may be provided in a number of forms, the usual
forms for employment-creating projects being loans at concessionary rates of
interest, interest relief grants and removal grants. In the year ended 31st
March 1975 some £213 million was paid in regional development grants under
the Industry Act, and £69 million was offered in regional selective assistance.
Regional selective assistance is expected to lead to the creation of 58,000 new
jobs in the next five years.
Under the Finance Act 1967 a regional employment premium is payable to
firms with manufacturing establishments in the development and special
development areas.
It is planned that Britain should receive nearly 28 per cent of the funds
allocated to the European Regional Development Fund, set up in 1975. For
the period 1975-77 the fund has been allocated some £550 million to spend m
regions of the Community suffering from problems of a preponderance of
agriculture, industrial change and structural under-employment. Britain’s
gross share of the fund should be £30 million in 1975 and £60 million in both
following years, but the net receipts after deducting payments into the fund
should be about £20 million a year. Loans are also available on favourable
terms from the European Investment Bank and the European Coal and Steel
Community. (See p. 78.) r j r
Other forms of assistance available include the provision of modern factories
for sale or rent on favourable terms in the development and intermediate areas,
and grants to ease the transfer or establishment of a business and its keyworkers
in the development and intermediate areas. Factory building and estate manage¬
ment formerly undertaken on the Department of Industry’s behalf by the
English, Scottish and Welsh Industrial Estates Corporations, are in Scotland
and Wales to become the responsibility of the Scottish and Welsh Develop¬
ment Agencies. The Government also influences the location of industry by
requiring industrial development certificates (IDCs), for the building of new
factories outside the development areas. The purpose of this control is to
direct potentially mobile projects towards the areas of greatest employment
need. From 1st July 1975 the administration of regional selective financial
assistance, formerly the responsibility throughout Great Britain of the Depart¬
ment of Industry, became the responsibility in Scotland and Wales of the
Secretaries of State for these countries and is carried on by the Scottish
Economic Planning Department and the Welsh Office respectively.
Within the Department of Industry an Industrial Development Unit helps
with the appraisal, negotiation and monitoring of projects referred to it. I his
unit will continue to provide advice on request to the Scottish and Welsh
INDUSTRY
Development
Agencies
Northern Ireland
213
Offices. An Industrial Development Advisory Board, made up of members
prominent in industry, banking, accounting and finance and international
industrial investment, advises generally on industry-wide problems and
priorities, and considers specific major cases for selective assistance. Scottish
and Welsh Industrial Development Advisory Boards are being established on
a statutory basis to advise on projects which are the responsibility of the
Secretaries of State for Scotland and Wales.
The Department of Industry’s regional organisation in England has an
important degree of authority for dealing with applications for selective finan¬
cial assistance. Regional industrial development boards operate in the North,
North West, Yorkshire and Humberside and South West regions. Regional
Industrial Development Boards have been set up in Scotland, Wales, the North,
North West, Yorkshire and Humberside and South West regions. The boards
advise generally on regional industrial opportunities and on applications for
selective financial assistance for the development of industry in their regions.
The links between Regional Economic Planning Councils and Boards and the
department’s regional offices have been strengthened so that the process of
industrial regeneration in a region and the planning of its land use and other
physical resources can be properly co-ordinated.
The Government intends to establish Scottish and Welsh Development
Agencies for providing new machinery to assist in the economic and environ¬
mental development of these countries. The agencies will be responsible to the
Secretaries of State for Scotland and Wales respectively and will perform
functions similar to the regional functions of the National Enterprise Board
as well as taking over responsibility for industrial estates and factories (see
p. 212) and the tasks of removing industrial dereliction and undertaking
projects to improve the environment, with an emphasis on areas in need of
both economic and environmental redevelopment.
Under separate legislation capital grants are available at 30 per cent of the cost
of new buildings, machinery and equipment for the manufacturing, construc¬
tion and extractive industries in Northern Ireland. Total expenditure inclu¬
sive of grants qualifies for tax allowances. There is also provision for assisting
firms by means of loans to carry out major schemes of re-equipment, to move
to another area in particular need of industrial development or to undertake a
rehousing of their business in association with a major scheme of modernisa¬
tion and reorganisation. Help under the capital grants legislation is given
without regard to the number of jobs created.
As an alternative means of assistance in Northern Ireland comprehensive
and flexible powers are offered under the Industries Development Acts for
projects which offer a reasonable amount of employment. In such cases
industrial development grants of up to 40 per cent of expenditure on new
buildings, machinery and equipment are available, with tax allowances as
above. For those projects which offer exceptionally attractive returns in em¬
ployment or location within Northern Ireland, the assistance offered can
include tenancy of a government-built factory at low rent (including possibly
a rent-free period), grants towards operating costs in the initial stages, and
grants towards costs of removing existing machinery and installing it'in a
factory in Northern Ireland.
Since 1945 nearly 200 new firms have been established in Northern Ireland
and others expanded with government assistance, and the number of people now
employed in grant-aided industry totals over 75,000. A Finance Corporation
214
BRITAIN 1976: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
with an initial capital of £50 million was formed in 1972 to aid industrial and
commercial concerns which have short-term liquidity problems but long¬
term prospects of viability.
Certain regions and areas in England have industrial development associations
concerned with promoting local industry and sponsored mainly by local
authorities, trade associations and individual firms.
Several voluntary associations are concerned with Welsh industry, the
Development Corporation for Wales, founded in 1959, being the most
prominent. In Scotland, the Highlands and Islands Development Board, a
statutory body, works to stimulate the economic and social development of
the seven ‘crofting’ counties (see p. 295). It provides grants and loans to
industrial, commercial and other enterprises; it may also acquire land, provide
management and other advisory services and set up and carry on businesses.
The Scottish Council (Development and Industry), a non-profit-making body,
works to promote the general economic development of Scotland.
Encouragement is also given to the development of rural industries. Much of
this work is done under the aegis of the Development Commission. In
England and Wales this service is provided by the Council for Small Industries
in Rural Areas acting in consultation with the rural community councils
through their small industries committees in the counties; in Scotland by the
Small Industries Council for Rural Areas of Scotland; and in Northern Ire¬
land by the Local Enterprise Development Unit (LEDU). All these agencies
provide advice and guidance to small businesses in rural areas and country
towns, finance for small factories to stimulate rural industries and (except
LEDU) loans for assistance to tourism in the rural parts of development areas.
Small Firms Within the general arrangements for promoting industrial expansion and
modernisation, smaller firms, which account for about one-fifth of manu¬
facturing output and about one-third of employment, have recently received
more government attention. In the Department of Industry there is a minister
with special responsibility for the small firms sector and a separate division
responsible for the development, inter-departmental co-ordination and im¬
plementation of policy towards small firms and for the administration of t e
official services provided for them. The most important of these is the network
of ten small firms information centres in Great Britain, which work in co¬
operation with Chambers of Commerce, trade associations and other organisa¬
tions and are provided with a comprehensive data bank in order to guide small
firms towards appropriate sources of information and assistance.
The following is a broad summary of the locational distribution of British
industry, grouped according to the eight standard regions of England, plus
Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland.
London is Britain’s capital and main communication centre, and is probably
still the world’s most important financial centre. Lying at the head of ocean
navigation on the Thames estuary it is one of the world’s largest cities an
largest ports, though much deep-sea-going traffic has moved down-river to
Tilbury docks. It is the main centre in Britain of printing and the manufac¬
ture of clothing, food and drink, furniture, materials for the arts, precision
instruments and many other specialised products. Small firms predominate in
many of these industries and the average size of manufacturing firms (parti¬
cularly in the central area) is well below the national average. London is also

important, especially in its outer ring, for light engineering, chemicals and
consumer goods and has some heavy engineering plants and a number of
leading research establishments. There has been in recent years, however, a
considerable drop in employment in manufacturing industry in London, due
mainly to increasing shortages of labour and the rising cost of land.
Towards the periphery of Greater London and in the surrounding Outer
Metropolitan Area, industry, particularly the electronics and consumer goods
industries, has expanded greatly; some of the largest aircraft plants are in these
areas, for example at Weybridge and Hatfield, as well as two of the four main
motor vehicle manufacturers at Dagenham, Luton and Dunstable. There are
other major motor vehicle manufacturing plants at Cowley, Oxford, some 50
miles north-west of London. Along the lower Thames and Medway estuaries
there are large oil refineries as well as some smaller shipyards, engineering
works and major concentrations of the paper and pulp and cement industries.
There are centres of manufacturing industry at Crawley, Basingstoke, in the
Medway towns and the Aldershot-Farnborough area.
A great part of the Channel coast eastwards from Southampton consists of
built-up areas, which from Brighton eastwards are partly dormitories for
people working in London. Holiday resorts fringe the coast. Portsmouth is a
naval port with some shipbuilding and general manufactures. Southampton is
one of Britain’s leading ports for both passengers and freight; its industries
include ship repairing, oil refining, cable-making, electronics and synthetic
rubber. Dover, Folkestone and Newhaven are ferry ports.
Though famous for its tourism, leisure industries and agriculture, the south¬
west of England has a busy manufacturing sector. Bristol, the region’s admini¬
strative and commercial centre, is a leading port and the largest industrial
city, having food processing, tobacco, packaging materials, printing, aerospace,
machinery and a wide range of other industries; there are extensive modern
docks at Avonmouth, an industrialised suburb with important basic chemicals
and non-ferrous metal plants. Plymouth, with the naval dockyard and electri¬
cal and other industries, is an important manufacturing centre. The towns of
Gloucester, Poole, Christchurch, Cheltenham and Bath are major producers of
machinery, instrumentation and other engineering products. Swindon has
vehicle, electrical and electronic engineering. Clothing, footwear, and other
textile products are made at several centres. In the Camborne, Redruth,
Falmouth and St. Austell areas, Cornwall has china clay and tin mining, and
machinery manufacture, ship repairing and other forms of engineering.
Although the smallest of the regions East Anglia has been rapidly growing in
terms of both population and employment. A major contribution to this growth
has been made by the nine towns receiving overspill of population and industry
from London. The area is one of the most productive agricultural regions in
the world and this has provided a firm base for the growth of the food pro¬
cessing industry, which is concerned mainly with canning, and more recently
freezing local produce. Cambridge is a major centre of research-based
industry; Ipswich and Peterborough are noted for diesel engines, agricultural
machinery and engineering generally and Norwich for footwear and food
manufacture. The east coast ports of Great Yarmouth and Lowestoft have
become important bases for companies associated with oil and natural gas
exploitation in the North Sea.
The main concentration of industry is in the West Midlands metropolitan
county which includes the districts of Birmingham, Coventry, Dudley,
2l6

Sandwell, Solihull, Walsall and Wolverhampton. The economy is dominated
by metal-using industries and, in particular, by motor vehicle manufacture.
Some other notable industries are mechanical and electrical engineering,
machine tools, castings and tubes, locks, jewellery, domestic metalware and
rubber manufactures.
In north Staffordshire, a smaller conurbation centred upon Stoke-on-Trent
is the centre of the British pottery and china industry and the region’s major
coalmining area. Other industries are rubber and electrical products. Coal
mining is also important in the Cannock Chase and North Warwickshire areas.
Other important centres include Stafford, with heavy electrical and other
engineering; Worcester, mechanical engineering and pottery; Burton-on-
Trent, brewing and rubber; Kidderminster, carpets; and Rugby, electrical
engineering. Stratford-upon-Avon, the birthplace of William Shakespeare, is
an international tourist centre.
The two major new towns, Telford and Redditch, have large metal-based
industries.
The industrial cities and towns of the East Midlands include Leicester noted
for hosiery and knitwear, shoes and a diversity of engineering products;
Derby for general engineering, aero-engines and man-made fibres; Notting¬
ham for hosiery, cycles and a variety of other engineering products, lace,
pharmaceutical products and tobacco; Northampton, footwear and engineering;
and Chesterfield, engineering. Northampton was designated a new town in
1968. Corby, a new town in Northamptonshire, has a large integrated steel
works. Part of Britain’s richest and most highly mechanised coalfield lies under
the north-east of the area. Some of the towns on the coalfield, such as Mans¬
field, have important manufacturing industries, particularly textiles. Lincoln
is noted as an engineering centre.
The North-West comprises the metropolitan counties of Greater Manchester
and Merseyside and the counties of Lancashire and Cheshire. Manchester is
Britain’s second most important commercial and financial centre and a major
port. It is one of the chief centres for electrical and heavy engineering and for
the production of a wide range of goods including computers, electronic
equipment, petrochemicals, dye-stuffs and pharmaceuticals. Manchester s
traditional role as the centre for the Lancashire textile industry is only a small
part of its present-day activities. The textile towns, while adapting to the
increasing use of man-made fibres and moving into new textile products, such
as carpets, have seen engineering outgrow the textile industry. The largest
towns, Bolton, Stockport, Oldham, Blackburn, Preston, Rochdale, Burnley
and Bury, have diversified into such industries as printing, paper-making,
textile and electrical machinery, light engineering and consumer goods,
electronics, aircraft and heavy commercial vehicles.
The Manchester Ship Canal, which carries a substantial volume of export
traffic, links Manchester and Merseyside. It passes through Warrington,
with its metal industries (such as wire-drawing), Widnes, Runcorn with the
chemical industry, and Ellesmere Port with its oil refinery installations, before
reaching the Mersey estuary. St. Helens, to the north of the canal, is famous
for glass manufacture. Liverpool, with its modernised dock system is one of
Britain’s leading seaports and, after London, the largest centre for processing
imported foodstuffs and raw materials (flour milling, soap, sugar refining and
rubber products). While it has grown to be a significant service centre its
industrial strengths have changed from the older industries such as ship-

building and repair across the river at Birkenhead to the newer industries,
including electrical engineering, heavy industrial plant and motor vehicles.
University research facilities in the region are closely linked with the
region s industries. Industrial research units serve most industries and are of
major importance in the region’s development.
The North-West has international airports at Manchester (Ringway) and
Liverpool (Speke), and a well-developed rail system. An advanced motorway
network provides rapid access to the rest of the country and to Europe through
Leeds and Hull.
Though some parts of Yorkshire and Humberside are heavily industrialised,
more than four-fifths of the region is open country, including the Yorkshire
Moors National Parks and part of the Peak District.
The region’s industrial structure is diverse. Important industries include a
wide range of engineering products, mechanised handling equipment, plastic,
packaging and printing machinery, vehicle components and electric motors,
metals and metal goods, coalmining, food-processing, drink, clothing, carpets,
chemicals and glass containers. About 70 per cent of Britain’s worsted and
woollen industry is located in West Yorkshire. Bradford is the commercial
centre of the wool trade. The metropolitan district of Leeds includes about half
a million people in the city of Leeds, which is an important commercial centre
and also has a variety of industries including men’s clothing and various
engineering industries. In the south, the steel centre based on Sheffield and
Rotherham is noted for alloy and special steels, tools and cutlery. Yorkshire’s
coalfield is particularly important and production is to be extended to the
Selby area, where major new reserves have been discovered. The main centres
in the coalfield (Doncaster and Barnsley) are well positioned in relation to com¬
munications, particularly to motorways, which makes them natural growth
points.
York, a leading tourist attraction, is also noted for chocolate and confec¬
tionery manufacture. It is an important railway centre and has substantial rail¬
way workshops. Humberside, with four ports, offers varied trading outlets to
overseas markets, particularly to continental Europe. Kingston-upon-Hull, the
other principal city in the region, has, in addition to port activity, industries
engaged in engineering, vegetable oil-processing, chemicals, sawmilling and
food-processing. The ports of Grimsby, Immingham, and Goole, the steel
town of Scunthorpe, and a variety of industries, including oil-refining, on
Humberside are of importance. The completion of the west-east motorway
system and the Humber Bridge should assist the economic growth of the
region.
The greater part of this region (the metropolitan county of Tyne and Wear
and the counties of Northumberland, Durham, Cleveland and Cumbria) is an'
area of hills, lakes and moorland and is relatively thinly populated. Most of the
population is concentrated in the eastern coastal strip stretching from the
coalfields north of the Tyne to the Tees. Within this area the main centres are
Newcastle upon Tyne, Gateshead, South Shields, Sunderland, Darlington,
Middlesbrough, Stockton, and Hartlepool. The main towns of Cumbria are
Carlisle, Workington and Barrow-in-Furness.
The region is relatively more dependent than other parts of England on the
long-established heavy industries, notably coalmining, iron and steel manu¬
facture, shipbuilding and repairing and chemicals (the complex of chemical
plants on both banks of the Tees is probably the most extensive in Europe),
2l8
Wales
Scotland

which together employ about one-quarter of the male workers. Europe’s
largest steelmaking complex is being developed in the Teesside area. At the
same time other types of industry have been successfully established in the
region. It is one of the most important areas for the manufacture of electrical
plant, and the many other industries include mining machinery, rolling mill
plant, earth-moving equipment, machine tools, ropes, paint, glass, clothing
and scientific instruments. An aluminium smelter is operating on the North¬
umberland coast. Atomic energy is important in Cumbria, with two nuclear
power stations and other installations.
Nearly two-thirds of the population (which totals 27 million) live in industrial
South Wales. Coalmining remains a major industry; although the numbers
employed have declined substantially, the area still produces virtually all
Britain’s anthracite and much of its steam and other specialised coals. There
are plans for the further rationalisation and modernisation of steel, the other
traditional industry of South Wales, which already supplies all of Britain’s
output of tinplate and much of its sheet steel. In the past 35 years many new
industries, including mechanical and electrical engineering, motor vehicle
components, plastics, chemicals and textiles have been established throughout
the former coalmining valleys and on the coastal plain. Cardiff, Newport, and
Swansea are the major urban centres and, with Barry and Port Talbot, are also
the major ports of the region, the latter with one of Britain s largest steel¬
making plants and a deepwater harbour for importing iron ore. Inland the
main concentrations of population are Rhondda and Merthyr Tydfil, the
largest centres in the coalmining area.
The other main industrial area is in North Wales. Here also coalmining
has declined, but the sheet steel, chemical and man-made fibre industries are
important employers. In addition, and particularly in the Wrexham area,
newer light industries, including domestic electrical appliances, have been
introduced and on Deeside there is a large aircraft manufacturing plant.
The remainder of Wales is predominantly rural, and sparsely populated,
although light industry has been introduced in many areas. Milford Haven
is one of the finest natural deepwater harbours in the world and has developed
as Britain’s major oil importing port. It has four major oil refineries and also
an ocean terminal which links it with Wales’ fifth refinery at Llandarcy near
Swansea. These five refineries together account for more than one-quarter
of Britain’s total capacity. Offshore, in the Celtic Sea, there is increasing
interest in exploration for oil and gas. Wales as a whole is important as a
holiday and recreational centre.
About three-quarters of Scotland’s population of 5'2 million is concentrated in
the central lowlands between the Firth of Clyde and the Firth of Forth. The
principal cities in this area are Glasgow, a major commercial centre, and
Edinburgh, Scotland’s capital, an administrative and cultural centre. Clyde¬
side, which includes Glasgow, is a major shipbuilding and marine engineering
centre; it produces a great variety of general engineering products, which
include modules for the oil industry; the world’s largest oil production plat¬
form yard is situated at Ardyne Point in the Firth of Clyde. Clydeside is also
an important centre for food, drink and tobacco manufactures. The steel
industry, sited mainly in Central Strathclyde, produces a wide range of
products. The widely dispersed electronics equipment industry is represented

Kilbride and other parts of Strathclyde, Fife and Dundee, as well as in

Edinburgh, where this and other modern industries are expanding alongside
the long-established engineering, printing and brewing industries. Large-
scale plants producing cars in Linwood, near Paisley, and commercial vehicles
in West Lothian and the Scotstoun district of Glasgow are well established,
while heavy earth-moving equipment and tracked vehicles are produced in
Uddington and Airdrie. The Firth of Clyde provides central Scotland with
valuable deepwater facilities.
Outside the central belt there is considerable industrial concentration in
and around Dundee and Aberdeen and a number of towns outside these areas
have attracted light industries in recent years. Dundee’s traditional manu¬
facture, jute, has been supplemented by office machinery, clocks and watches,
refrigerators and electronic products.
North-east Scotland has the largest concentration of whisky distilleries,
while the paper industry and food and fish processing are also important. The
major oil discoveries in the North Sea (see p. 262) have led to many oil-related
projects being set up in that area: Aberdeen in particular has become a major
oil centre.
Most of northern Scotland is mountainous and much of southern Scotland
is hilly and rugged. These areas are sparsely populated, but the Scottish
Highlands possess significant resources of hydro-electric power (see p. 274).
There are high-quality tweed and knitwear industries both in the valley towns
of the Borders and in the Highland and Western Isles region. Small engineer¬
ing and electronics industries have recently been established in towns in the
Borders and the south-west. Small-scale manufacturing has also been intro¬
duced in the Highlands, and larger enterprises include the experimental and
prototype fast nuclear reactors at Dounreay, the aluminium smelter at
Invergorden and the pulp mill at Fort William. There is also large-scale
development in oil-related industries—particularly the construction of oil
production platforms—in the Moray Firth and Cromarty Firth areas.
Although the area of Northern Ireland is relatively small and lacking in
minerals, there is substantial and growing industrialisation, particularly in and
around Belfast, the capital city. Britain’s largest single shipyard is in Belfast;
other well-established activities include the manufacture of aircraft, textile
machinery and a wide range of other engineering products, ropes, tobacco
and clothing. Northern Ireland has also long been an important centre for
textiles—it is particularly well known for linen. The textile industry is, how¬
ever, extensively diversified and Northern Ireland is one of the most important
areas in Europe for man-made fibre production. There has also been extensive
development in vehicle components, oil-well equipment, electronic instru¬
ments, telecommunications equipment, carpets and synthetic rubber.
Industrial production as a whole (mining and quarrying, manufacturing, con¬
struction, and gas, electricity and water) was in 1974 slightly lower than a year
previously, but 6 per cent higher than in 1970 and more than double the level
in 1948. Since 1970 manufacturing production has grown by 8 per cent and
since 1948 by more than 130 per cent.
Over the last decade output among manufacturing industries rose fastest
in chemicals and allied industries, in coal and petroleum products and in
engineering, where instrument engineering and electrical engineering were the
fastest growth areas.
In the period 1970-74 output grew fastest in chemicals and allied industries
(28 per cent), engineering (10 per cent, the fastest growing sector being

The size of the labour force employed in industry has fallen steadily in the last
six or seven years and substantially in the period 1970-74. The increases in
production have been due mainly to a variety of factors influencing produc¬
tivity, including advances in products, machinery, processes and methods of
work; the rate of fixed capital formation; more intensive competition and sales
promotion; and improved management. Output per head (a basic measure of
labour productivity) increased by 11 per cent in production industries between
1970—74, the increase for manufacturing industry being 14 per cent.
Both the long-term and the short-term growth of productivity depend most
directly on the decisions of individual undertakings. However, government
departments and educational and research establishments also make an im¬
portant contribution. The Department of Industry is responsible for the co¬
ordination of activities related to the improvement of industrial productivity.
It is represented on the EDCs (see p. 209) which are concerned with the
removal of obstacles to efficiency. The department also works to forward the
introduction of advanced machinery and techniques into industry, provides
technical advisory services and sponsors the Computer Aided Design Centre
and the National Computing Centre. It is concerned directly with research
into such factors as productivity measurement techniques, group technology
and production engineering. The Department of Employment advises firms
on aspects of productivity connected with manpower utilisation and industrial
relations.
Within industry, employers’ organisations often provide technical assistance
and support schemes of vocational education and training, as do many trade
unions. The British Productivity Council is one of many specialist institutions,
both public and private, concerned with various aspects of productivity. The
council gives primary attention to manufacturing industry through a national
Investment
INDUSTRY 22I
network of more than 50 local associations and provides information and
advisory services, seminars, conferences and courses, inter-firm visits and
industrial films among its services.

Productivity is particularly dependent on the quantity and efficiency of the
capital assets which the labour force has at its disposal. Investment in manu¬
facturing industry tends to reflect the level of demand in the economy as a
whole, with some time lag between the start of an increase in output and the
implementation of investment plans. There is thus a marked cyclical pattern
in the flow of investment by manufacturing industry, and since 1961 there have
been three discernible cycles. Investment fell from a peak in the third quarter
of 1961 to a low point at the beginning of 1963, then rose to a new peak in early
1966. It then fell again in 1967 before rising to a new peak at the end of 1970,
when the present cycle began. Details of investment in the period 1965—74 are

contained in Table 15. In 1974 fixed capital expenditure in manufacturing
industry (at 1970 prices) totalled £2,133 million, an 11 per cent increase on the
previous year. Analysed by industry group, investment in the food, drink and
tobacco group was £302 million 5 coal and petroleum products totalled £46
million; chemicals £262 million; metal manufacture £272 million; engineering,
shipbuilding and metal goods £523 million; vehicles £145 million; textiles,
leather and clothing £186 million; paper, printing and publishing £135 million;
and other manufacturing industries £262 million.
Of the 1974 total some 76 per cent represented investment in plant and
machinery. Part of this rising investment is associated with the introduction of
new techniques and equipment and in particular of machines and instruments
which lessen the demand for human supervision, though they may require
more skill from fewer people. This process of automation is giving rise to far-
reaching changes in the pattern and organisation of industry and has already
been responsible for substantial increases in production and efficiency which,
in the long run, are likely to be very large. Much investment, however, still con¬
sists of replacements, additions and improvements of a more traditional kind.
In Britain, as elsewhere, management is recognised as a subject requiring
special skills and training, as is reflected in the increased educational qualifica¬
tions of managerial recruits and in the spread of systematic education for
management. The large number of professional people working as manage¬
ment consultants indicates the concern for improved management performance
in Britain. Such consultancy services are being increasingly used by overseas
clients.
The British Institute of Management (BIM) is the central national manage¬
ment body, independent, non-political and non-profit-making. Its purpose is
to study and promote scientific management, including management educa¬
tion and training, throughout industry, commerce and public administration.
The Industrial Society, also an independent self-financing organisation, has
a membership representing trade unions, employers and their associations. It
works to promote better use of human resources; it advises members and
conducts conferences and courses.
Management studies and education for management are expanding rapidly
in Britain and have become a recognised feature of higher education (see
p. 163). Training courses for higher management are held at several univer¬
sities and colleges, including the Administrative Staff College, Henley-on-
Thames, and Ashridge College of Management, Berkhamsted. There are
graduate business schools in London and Manchester and in Scotland, there
are nearly 50 graduate management courses and half that number of under¬
graduate courses at universities. The Council of Industry for Management
Education, jointly sponsored by the CBI, the BIM and the Foundation for
Management Education, works to foster the development of business and
management education. The larger firms, especially those with wide responsi¬
bilities, often provide general management courses for senior executives, and
systems of informal training within an organisation are numerous. 1 here are
also a number of bodies concerned with specialised branches of management,
for example, the Institute of Personnel Management, the Institution of Works
Managers, the Institute of Administrative Management and the Institute of
Marketing.
The improvement of industrial design is also recognised as an important factor.
The Design Council is sponsored by the Government with the purpose of
INDUSTRY
223
improving the design of goods manufactured by British industry. The council
receives an annual grant from the Department of Industry and members are
appointed by the Secretary of State. They include industrialists, engineers,
retailers, architects, designers, educationists and trade unionists. In Scotland
the council’s activities are guided by a separate Scottish committee whose
members are similarly appointed.
The council keeps in close contact with British industry through officers who
analyse and advise on design. A designer selection service for companies who
wish to contact experienced industrial designers is also operated. Permanent
displays of modern British consumer products are maintained at the Design
Centres in London, Glasgow and Cardiff. All products on display in the
Design Centres are drawn from Design Index, the council’s photographic
and sample record of some 10,000 current British products selected by
independent committees for their good design, safety and performance. The
Design Centres mount special exhibitions on particular design themes, and
the council also helps manufacturers who wish to exhibit their products
overseas at trade fairs or special displays of British design. Manufacturers of
outstanding products in consumer goods, engineering products and com¬
ponents, medical equipment and motor vehicle industries, may receive one of
a number of annual Design Council Awards.
In addition, the council organises a comprehensive programme of courses,
conferences and seminars on design for various audiences and it also plays an
important part in promoting better design education. It publishes two monthly
magazines, Design and Engineering, and a range of books, slide packs, leaflets
and catalogues. It also has a photographic slide library.
Other bodies concerned with industrial design include the Royal Society of
Arts (see p. 406), the Society of Industrial Artists and Designers, which is the
representative professional body in Great Britain of industrial designers and
the Design and Industries Association, a voluntary association of industrial
companies, designers, and others interested in the promotion of good design
in industry. The Crafts Council of Great Britain, the Crafts Centre of Great
Britain and the Scottish Craft Centre are all grant-aided and work to improve
craft design and to promote closer relations between craftsmen and industry.
The British Standards Institution (BSI) is a voluntary non-profit-making
body incorporated by Royal Charter. It prepares and promulgates standards
in respect of, among other things, quality, performance, dimensions, testing
methods and codes of practice. Voluntary acceptance of such standards by
manufacturers, buyers and sellers reduces unnecessary variety and simplifies
the specification of requirements. The BSI is governed by a council consisting
of representatives of the main organisations of employers and workers, pro¬
fessional institutions and the larger government departments.
MANUFACTURING INDUSTRIES
The following sections describe individual manufacturing industries in more
detail. (For coal and petroleum products see Chapter 13.) Production figures
in Table 16 and on p. 219 show the relative importance of broad sectors of
manufacturing industry. Expansion has been particularly marked in those
industries using advanced technologies such as electronics, the newer branches
of mechanical engineering, instrument engineering, most sectors of the
chemical industry and man-made fibres. At the same time other long-
established industries, such as shipbuilding and marine engineering and
224
Statistics
METAL
MANUFACTURE
Iron and Steel
BRITAIN 1976: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
electrical engineering, have been undertaking continuing reorganisation, re¬
equipment and modernisation. A major stimulus has been provided by the
various needs of the offshore oil and gas industries.
The main source of statistical information on industrial topics is the Business
Monitor series produced by the Business Statistics Office of the Department of
Industry (see p. 45), and compiled from returns made by firms in industry.
Monthly and quarterly Production Series Monitors cover some 150 manufac¬
turing industries and their products, with information on output and overseas
trade concerning some 5>000 commodities. Annual Census of Production
Reports give total industrial figures for production, capital expenditure, stocks,
wages, salaries and employment. Information is also available in a number of
other publications. The Overseas Trade Statistics of the L nited Kingdom
contain detailed information on overseas trade, the December issue carrying
cumulative totals for the whole calendar year. The five-yearly Census of
Distribution is published in special reports; and short-term statistics on service
and distributive trades appear in a separate series of Business Monitor. The
weekly publication Trade and Industry includes regular statistics and com¬
mentary on industrial output, investment, retail sales and overseas trade, and
employment statistics are published in the monthly Department of Employment
Gazette. Many of the figures are brought together in summary form in the
Monthly Digest of Statistics and the Annual Abstract of Statistics.
In the subsequent sections, employment statistics refer to numbers in
Britain at June 1974, sales and output figures are taken from the latest available
Business Monitor and export figures from the Overseas Trade Statistics. Unless
otherwise stated, export and production figures include parts. Some production
figures are given in metric terms, where statistics for an industry are normally
published in this form. Conversion tables are on p. 463.
The metal manufacturing industries employ 507,000 people. Of these,
244,400 are in the iron and steel industry, and 85,900 in the manufacture of
iron castings, 54,300 in the manufacture of aluminium and aluminium alloys,
and 71,100 in the copper, brass and other base metal industries. Exports of
iron and steel products and non-ferrous base metals in 1974 had an aggregate
value of £1,242-9 million.
Britain, responsible for most of the early developments in iron and steel
production, is today the world’s eighth largest steel producing nation. Output
of crude steel in 1974 totalled 22-4 million ingot tonnes. Pig iron production
in 1974 totalled 13-9 million tonnes, while net deliveries of finished steel
amounted to 21 5 million tonnes in 1974. Exports of iron and steel products
(including iron castings) were worth £553‘5 million; the United States (£84 3
million), Sweden (£32 million), and Canada (£29-7 million) were the main
overseas buyers. . . .
The Iron and Steel Act 1967 brought into public ownership 13 major steel
companies (together producing over 90 per cent of Britain’s crude steel and
employing some 70 per cent of the manpower in the industry) and created
the British Steel Corporation (BSC). The remaining privately owned com¬
panies are represented by the British Independent Steel Producers’ Associa¬
tion The private sector is particularly strong in the manufacture of alloy and
stainless steels and of finished products for the engineering industry. The main
producing districts are: Wales (30 per cent of total crude steel output); York¬
shire and Humberside (29 per cent); the North region (16 per cent); an
Scotland (12 per cent). Wales concentrates mainly on the manufacture of flat

Discrepancies between totals and their constituent parts are due to rounding.
products, especially sheet steel and tinplate; the output of the north-east
coast and Scotland is predominantly of heavy steel products (plates, sections
and rails), but a wide strip mill for sheet production is also in operation in
Scotland. Production of special alloy and stainless steels is centred on Sheffield,
while Scunthorpe concentrates on heavy and medium products. The emphasis
in investment by the BSC has been on improving efficiency rather than
raising total capacity, and production in Britain is being concentrated on the
basic oxygen steel-making (BOS) and the electric furnace processes. Output
per blast furnace has risen markedly in recent years through improvements in
efficiency, such as better preparation of raw materials and improvements to
blast furnace design. The BSC’s research and development expenditure in
I974-75 was jCh million. A number of private sector companies have their
own research facilities.
The corporation in 1972 adopted a ten-year development programme.
Expansion and modernisation will take place at sites in Wales at Llanwern
and Port Talbot (the full development of which is still under consideration),
at Ravenscraig in Scotland, at Scunthorpe and in the Teesside area where
a high-capacity blast furnace, the first in Britain, will be built and the existing
Redcar/Lackenby works expanded to create one of the largest and most modern
steelmaking complexes in Europe. Development projects completed in the
last few years include a large-scale BOS plant and a deep-water harbour/ore
terminal at Port Talbot, and a major new steelmaking and finishing complex
at Scunthorpe.

Some 700 firms are today engaged in the production of iron castings. Fewer,
more highly developed units are replacing the numerous small foundries and
a small number of large firms are responsible for more than a quarter of total
output. In 1974 output of castings was just under 3-2 million tonnes, of which
145,000 tonnes (apart from substantial tonnages of machined castings
included in other industry statistics) were exported. The main users of iron
castings are the motor vehicle industry, accounting for nearly one-third of
the total tonnage sold, the general engineering industry, the manufacturers of
pressure pipes and fittings, the building and associated industries and the steel
industry.
Britain’s non-ferrous metal processing and fabricating industry is one of the
largest in Europe. Output in 1974 included: aluminium, 293,000 tonnes of
virgin metal and 207,000 tonnes of secondary metal; refined copper, 69,000
tonnes of virgin copper and 91,000 tonnes of secondary metal; lead, 277>000
tonnes; and zinc, 84,000 tonnes of slab metal. Britain is also a major producer
of the newer specialised metals including uranium, zirconium and beryllium
for the nuclear energy industry; niobium for aircraft production; and selenium,
silicon, germanium and tantalum for electronic apparatus.
Nearly half of the industry is situated in the Midlands; other centres include
south Wales, London, Tyneside and Avonmouth, where a zinc smelter, with a
capacity of some 100,000 tonnes a year, operates. Three large-scale aluminium
smelters provide over half of Britain’s requirements for primary aluminium.
Firms are engaged in smelting, casting and fabrication by rolling, extrusion
and drawing and advanced techniques of powder metallurgy and pressure
diecasting are also employed. Scientific and technological research for the
industry as a whole is conducted by the British Non-Ferrous Metals Research
Association. . .
In 1974 exports of non-ferrous base metals were valued at £689-4 million.
Exports of silver, platinum and other metals of the platinum group totalled
£228 million. The main products exported, including alloys and semi-finished
products, were copper (£182-6 million), nickel (£9J '5 rnillion), aluminium(£75
million), lead (£41 million), tin (£38-5 million) and zinc (£8-8 million). The
United States (£127-4 million) and the Federal Republic of Germany (£88-8
million) were the largest purchasers in terms of value.
Mechanical engineering, employing some 976,200 people, comprises a group
of industries including all types of machinery, machine tools, industrial
engines, mechanical handling equipment, construction equipment and indus¬
trial plant. The aggregate value of sales was over £6,000 million in 1974.
Exports of non-electric machinery were valued at £3,081 million in 1974.
There are over 500 firms manufacturing agricultural machinery with six
large firms predominating. Products include machinery for soil preparation
and cultivation, harvesting and crop handling (including milking machinery).
(For tractors see p. 232.) In 1974 sales were valued at £133 million and exports
at £80 million. The main overseas markets were European Community
countries, the United States and Australia.
Britain was the birthplace of the modern machine tool industry and the
British industry is today one of the most advanced in the world. Output
ranges from simple metal-working centre lathes to the sophisticated numeri¬
cally controlled machine centres. Equipment using new electrical machinery

techniques is also produced. The industry consists of about 250 firms headed
by ten large companies which account for about half of total deliveries. Centred
mainly in the Midlands, South East, Yorkshire and North and North West
areas, the industry employs about 66,900 people. The Machine Tool Trades
Association represents most of the manufacturers and importers and is
responsible for the international machine tool exhibition held in Britain every
four years, the next being due in 1976. The industry is also served by its own
research organisation, the Machine Tool Industry Research Association.
The pattern of machine tool orders and production is highly cyclical. Sales
in 1974 were valued at £350 million including numerically controlled machine
tools worth £15 million. Exports of metalworking machine tools in 1974 had
a value of £260 million.
The European Community imports about one-quarter of the machine tool
industry’s production. In 1974 the United States (^13 million) and South
Africa (£8-4 million) were the two largest individual overseas markets. At tie
end of 1974 the industry had orders on hand valued at £309 million of which
50 per cent was for export.
Industrial pumps and valves controlling the movement of liquids and gases are
vital components in many industrial processes particularly in the chemicals,
oil and electric power industries. The total work force is some 85,600 and
there are 470 companies of which 11 employ more than 1,000 people each. In
1974 sales of pumps and valves were estimated at £258 million and those of air
and gas compressors and fluid power equipment at £82 million and £135
million respectively. Exports of all types of equipment totalled £158 million.
The textile machinery industry produces machines and accessories for the
manufacture and processing of yarns and fabrics from all types of natural and
man-made fibres. Comprising about 450 firms, four of which account for
about one-half of total output, the industry has some 39,600 employees and is
situated mainly in the North West, East Midlands, Yorkshire and Humber¬
side and Northern Ireland. In 1974 the industry’s sales totalled £233 million
and exports £195-8 million. Principal markets were the European Community
(jCu million), and the United States (£27 million). Exports of sewing machines
totalled a further £22-5 million.
Almost the whole range of plant required by the construction industry is
produced, including excavating, earth-moving and road-making equipment,
pile drivers and quarry crushing and screening plant. Five large firms are
responsible for more than a third of total output; the labour force numbers
39,80°.
The value of sales by the industry was £414 million in 1974. Exports of
construction and mining machinery totalled £219-8 million, France (some
£18 million) being the major market.
Almost every industry makes use of mechanical handling equipment, which
extends from individual units and accessories to complete operating systems.
There are some 550 firms in the industry, the ten largest being responsible for
over a quarter of total output; the labour force totals 63,300. The value of
output in 1974 was some £500 million, the main products being cranes and
bridge transporters, lifts, escalators, conveyors, elevators, hoists and powered
industrial trucks. Exports of mechanical handling equipment (including

industrial and works trucks) in 1974 were valued at £ 170-1 million, European
Community countries forming the largest market (£49’6 million).
The office machinery industry comprises some 80 firms, nine of which
account for over three-quarters of total output. British subsidiaries or asso¬
ciates of overseas firms are prominent in some sectors of the industry. There
are 29,700 people employed.
Sales have been expanding rapidly and in 1974 were valued at £146
million (including non-electronic data processing and handling equipment and
electronic calculators). Exports of all office machinery (excluding electronic
computers and data processing equipment, see p. 231) were valued at £91-5
million. The most important overseas purchasers were European Community
countries and the United States.
The refrigerating machinery industry (excluding domestic equipment) has
a wide application, covering plant for ships and vehicles, food and drink
processing and supermarket stores. Some six firms account for over half the
industry’s 1974 output of £80 million, of which £24 million was exported
with numerous smaller firms completing the balance. About half of the actual
output comprises compressors and condensing units; other important products
are equipment for conserving drinks, food and ice-cream.
British industry manufactures almost every type of industrial (including pro¬
cess) plant and steelwork. The industry, which comprises both equipment
manufacturers and contractors responsible for the design, engineering, con¬
struction and commissioning of complete plants for process industries, has
some 1,480 firms, including nine with over 1,500 workers each, responsible for
over one-third of total output, and in all employs 162,500 people. For nuclear
power station construction see Chapter 13. In 1974 the estimated value o
equipment sales was £955 million, of which £125 million was for overseas
markets. Of particular importance are chemical and oil refining (process)
plant, steam-raising boilers, sintering plant, metallurgical furnaces and plant,
lime and cement kilns, nuclear reactors, water and sewage treatment plant,
and fabricated steelwork for bridges, buildings, and industrial installations.
Substantial new business has been generated by the North Sea oil and gas
explorations. ....
In 1974 sales of boilers and boilerhouse plant totalled £120 million;
exports totalled £20-5 million. Water tube boilers of advanced design and of
large steam-raising capacity are produced for power stations, together with
shell boilers for steam-raising and heating in factories and other buildings.
Sales of fabricated iron and steelwork totalled £240 million in 1974 and
constructional steelwork £288 million; exports totalled £38 million and £26
million respectively. Other industrial plant produced includes, furnaces and
kilns (£62 million), refuse disposal and other plant (£32 million), and water,
effluent and sewage treatment plant (£41 million). Exports amounted to £37
million in 1974. . . . . .
The design, engineering, construction and commissioning of complete
process plants for the chemical, petrochemical, oil refining and gas industries
has expanded rapidly in recent years. There are some 30 process plant con¬
tracting groups in Britain, half of which are United States subsidiaries. In 1974
expenditure on complete process plants and constructional steelwork totalled
£1,800 million. British firms are carrying out major plant projects in many
overseas countries.

In addition to the mechanical engineering products described in the preceding
sections there are some 2,500 enterprises producing other types of machinery
and employing some 226,100 workers. The main products include: mining
machinery (sales worth j£i72’5 million in 1974); printing, bookbinding and
paper goods machinery (£129 million); ventilating and air-conditioning
equipment (£114 million); food and drink processing machinery (£78 million);
packaging and bottling machinery (^65 million); portable power tools (£72
million); and miscellaneous non-electrical machinery (some £487 million).
Behind the firms manufacturing the major products outlined in this section
are about 5>300 enterprises, employing 180,000 people, whose main functions
are to supply parts and components and to undertake general sub-contracting,
fabricating and repair work. (Some enterprises are included because the mixed
character of their work precludes their classification under any single mechani¬
cal engineering group.) The sector includes 14 large undertakings with more
than 1,500 employees and responsible for about one-quarter of total output.
Ball, roller, needle and similar bearings and transmission and other precision
chains, are particularly important products. In 1974 sales of ball and other
bearings totalled £175 million and precision chains and other mechanical
engineering products £479 million. Exports of bearings totalled £40-6
million and chains and other mechanical engineering products £120 million.
With products extending from scientific and industrial instruments to photo¬
graphic equipment and timepieces, instrument engineering is a particularly
important sector of the engineering industry. Electronic techniques, parti¬
cularly in the industrial instrument sector, are of growing importance. Aggre¬
gate output was valued in 1974 some ^741 million and has increased, in
current price terms, by over 270 per cent since 1963. In all, some 160,600
people are employed in this sector.
There are some 930 firms in the scientific and industrial instruments industry,
which has a labour force numbering 102,200. The industry is represented by
the Scientific Instruments Manufacturers Association (the Sira Institute
conducts research on behalf of the industry) and the Control and Automation
Manufacturer’s Association. Output of instruments in 1974 totalled £477
million, including optical instruments and appliances (£31-9 million), process
measuring and control instruments (£53-7 million) and electrical measuring
and control instruments (£64 9 million). Exports totalled £215-2 million.
Sales of photographic and cinematographic cameras, projectors and other
equipment (including document copying machines) in 1974 totalled £105-3
million, and exports totalled £110-7 million.
There are some 70 firms in the watches and clocks industry, which employs
15,000 people; five relatively large employers are responsible for over three-
quarters of total output. Deliveries in 1974 included watches and parts (£25-2
million), clocks and parts (£15-8 million) and time recorders (£2-6 million)
and the industry’s total sales were valued at £46-6 million; export sales were
valued at £27-3 million.
With 730 firms in the industry (ten relatively large employers being responsible
for nearly one-third of output) deliveries of surgical instruments and ap¬
pliances and related products totalled £112-4 million in 1974, exports totalled
£57-1 million. The industry employs 30,700 people.

BRITAIN 1976: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
The electrical engineering industry, with a labour force of 843,000 is engaged
in the manufacture and installation of a wide variety of electrical and elec¬
tronic equipment, including all types of generating, transmission and dis¬
tribution equipment; motors; telecommunications and broadcasting apparatus,
television and radio receivers; computers; specialised electronic equipment;
and domestic electrical appliances. The total value of production in 1974 was
almost £4,864 million.
Exports of electrical machinery, apparatus and appliances (not including
electronics products such as computers, see p. 231) in 1974 were valued at
£1,1317 million. Products are exported to all parts of the world; in 1974 the
Federal Republic of Germany (£69-3 million), France (£65-1 million), South
Africa (£63-8 million), and the United States (£62-3 million) were among the
principal markets.
The industry’s leading representative organisations are the British Electrical
and Allied Manufacturers’ Association, the Association of Manufacturers of
Domestic Electrical Appliances, the Electronic Components Board, and the
Electronic Engineering Association; industry-wide scientific and technological
research is carried out by the Electrical Research Association.
Electrical British scientists and engineers were responsible for many of the basic
Machinery advances in the generation and transmission of electric power and British
firms have continued to be important suppliers of machinery and equipment.
Although about 680 firms manufacture machinery, mergers have led to the
creation of one of the leading electrical and electronic engineering groups in
Europe for generating, transmitting and distributing electric power, while a
number of smaller firms have been reorganised into larger units. Nine firms
with more than 2,000 employees are responsible for over one-third of total
output. The total labour force numbers 144,700.
In 1974 output of electrical machinery was valued at £805 million, including
£278 million worth of generating equipment, and £226 million worth of
switchgear and control gear. Exports of electric power machinery (generators,
motors, converters, transformers and rectifiers) amounted to £138-4 million in
1974 and exports of switchgear, starting and control gear amounted to £87-9
million. The main purchasers were South Africa, Canada and Australia.
Insulated Wires The industry produces cables and wires for the distribution of electric power,
and Cables for telecommunications networks and for many other purposes; its products
include submarine cables and cables insulated by a great variety of materials.
About half of the industry’s labour force of 46,100 are employed in four major
groups responsible for more than half of total output. The value of output
in 1974 was £535-5 million. Exports of insulated wire and cable and electrical
insulating equipment were worth £100 million; Commonwealth countries
are the largest purchasers.
Electrical Goods Output of other electrical goods in 1974 included domestic electric appliances,
and Domestic £392-7 million; electrical equipment for motor vehicles and aircraft^ £242
Appliances million; accumulators, £95-5 million; and electric lamps and light fittings,
£259-4 million. In terms of volume, sales included: 1-4 million electric
blankets, i-8 million domestic vacuum cleaners, 1 million domestic washing
machines, 2-3 million electric irons and 3-6 million kettles. In 1974 exports of
domestic electrical equipment included heating and cooking equipment (£22-8
million), washing machines and dryers (£17 million), refrigerators (£8-8 million)
and vacuum cleaners (£18 million); the main markets were European
INDUSTRY

Community countries, particularly the Federal Republic of Germany, the
Netherlands and the Irish Republic. Exports of batteries and accumulators
in 1974 were valued at £31-9 million, electric lamps and light fittings ^46-4
million, and electrical equipment for motor vehicles and cycles £27 million.
There are about 270 firms producing domestic electric appliances (four large
employers producing over one-third of output) and about 900 firms producing
other electrical goods (three very large firms producing nearly one-third of
total output). The industry has a labour force of 208,900.
Production of electronic equipment is one of the most rapidly expanding
industries in Britain. British scientists and companies have made a number of
important contributions to the industry’s technology. There are numerous
firms in the industry, although in most sectors—telecommunications, com¬
ponents, consumer goods, computers and communications and capital equip¬
ment there are a few large-scale enterprises. Total deliveries in 1974 were
valued at some £2,409 million (not including electronic process control and
industrial instrumentation, see p. 229) and export deliveries at £811 million.
The industry employs some 443,300 people.
Only a part of the telecommunications industry is concerned with electronic
equipment, but it is normally considered as a sector of the electronics industry.
The degree of involvement in electronics is, however, increasing and will
continue to do so with the advent of new switching systems. Total sales of
telegraph and telephone apparatus were valued at £418-5 million in 1974 in¬
cluding sales to the Post Office of £270 million. Britain is a major exporter
of telecommunications equipment, with overseas sales valued in 1974 at
£56-8 million. Research and development work is done by firms in the industry,
in co-operation with the Post Office. The industry employs 91,400 people,
and three firms are responsible for almost all the output.
The components sector (in which there are about 830 firms) manufactures
the whole range of active and passive electronics components, including
integrated circuits (in which many circuits are accommodated on a single chip
of silicon), mainly for the electronics equipment industry. Deliveries of
components in 1974 comprised active components valued at £162 million
and passive components valued at £432 million: output of integrated circuits
totalled £46-9 million. Exports were valued at £182-3 million.
The consumer goods sector of the industry manufactures radio and tele¬
vision sets, radiograms, high fidelity audio equipment, tape recorders and
similar products. The industry is dominated by several large firms. The
sector’s output had a total value of £421-7 million in 1974; output included
2-6 million televisions, 1 million radios and o-6 million radiograms and record
players. Exports were valued at £43-1 million.
The computer sector manufactures the complete range of control processes
and peripherals from large, main frame computers for large-scale data pro¬
cessing and scientific work to mini-computers for use in control and automa¬
tion systems and in communications systems. The industry complements
‘hardware’ by the production of appropriate programmes and associated
services (software). Total output in 1974 was valued at £421-7 million and
exports at £269-5 million.
The other major sector of the electronics industry manufactures radio
communications equipment, radar and navigational aids, public broadcasting
equipment and other capital equipment. Such British equipment is exten¬
sively used throughout the world. The sector’s total output in 1974 was valued
at £482-8 million, including radio communication equipment £93-8 million,

radar equipment £112-5 million and navigational aids £65-4 million. Exports
totalled £1597 million.
The industries which manufacture vehicles and aircraft are a particularly
important source of overseas earnings; exports of transport equipment in 1974,
valued at £1,839 million, formed some n-2 per cent of total exports. The
labour force numbers 977,300 and includes: 496,600 in motor vehicle manu¬
facture, 210,000 in aerospace construction and repairing, 185,300 in ship¬
building and marine engineering, 40,300 in the manufacture of locomotives
and railway wagons and carriages, 30,600 in wheeled tractor manufacturing
and 14,500 in the making of cycles and motor cycles.
The largest section of the vehicle industry comprises the manufacture of cars
and commercial vehicles. Car and commercial vehicle output is dominated by
four large firms—British Leyland, Ford, Chrysler United Kingdom and
Vauxhall—which account for over 95 per cent of car and commercial vehicle
production; the remainder is in the hands of smaller, specialist producers of
heavy commercial vehicles, buses, coaches, limousines and sports cars. At one
time located mainly in the Midlands and the London area, the industry,
during the last decade, has built manufacturing and assembly plants on
Merseyside, in Wales and in Scotland. The principal trade association is the
Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders, which holds a motor show
annually in London and a commercial vehicle exhibition every two years.
The Motor Industry Research Association carries out collective research on
vehicles and components.
Output of passenger cars in 1974 totalled 1-534 million units. Exports in
1974 amounted to 569,442 cars, whether or not assembled, valued at £425-9
million. The United States (£101-3 million) was the largest single purchaser,
followed by New Zealand (£37-9 million), Iran (£34-1 million) and South
Africa (£26-4 million). Production of commercial vehicles totalled some
402,560 in 1974. Britain is one of the world’s largest exporters of commercial
vehicles. Exports in 1974 numbered 155,566 worth £235-3 million. South
Africa (£17-1 million), the Irish Republic (£11-7 million), and Australia
(£11-4 million) were the main markets. Exports of bodies, chassis and parts
for cars and commercial vehicles had a value of some £619-8 million in 1974.
Caravans and trailer exports totalled £58-9 million.
Agricultural tractors account for the bulk of British production of wheeled
tractors. Production is dominated by two large firms with three others re¬
sponsible for almost all the remainder. Some 119,200 wheeled tractors were
delivered in 1974. Exports were valued at £186-1 million in 1974; South
Africa (£16 million) and Australia (£13-7 million) were the major buyers.
Sales of motor cycles and parts amounted to £14-2 million in 1974. Exports of
motor cycles and parts totalled £17-1 million in 1974 with the United States
(£10-4 million) by far the biggest market. Deliveries of bicycles amounted to
1-9 million. The bulk of British bicycles are manufactured in the Nottingham
area.
The British Railways Board (see p. 316) and a small number of firms in the
private sector build locomotives, carriages and freight wagons for British Rail,
for industrial users and for export. Output in 1974 had a total value of £190

million. The value of exports of railway vehicles and parts was £26-1 million;
Commonwealth countries were the largest purchasers.
Britain s aerospace industry is one of the largest and most comprehensive in
the world, producing civil and military aircraft, helicopters, guided weapons,
hovercraft and space vehicles. The construction of aircraft is dominated by two
large airframe manufacturers and one helicopter concern; outside these groups
are a few important smaller companies and a large number of components and
systems suppliers. The Government intends to take into public ownership
four companies, the British Aircraft Corporation, Hawker Siddeley Aviation,
Hawker Siddeley Dynamics and Scottish Aviation, under a new corporation,
British Aerospace. Almost all aero-engine manufacture is in the hands of
Rolls-Royce (1971) Ltd., a publicly owned company to which the essential
assets of Rolls-Royce Ltd. were transferred in I971- Besides extensive research
and development work by the industry itself, research on a substantial scale is
carried out by a number of government research establishments. The industry
is represented by the Society of British Aerospace Companies. The society
organises a major international air show and exhibition at Farnborough,
Hampshire, every two years.
Total sales of aerospace products and work done in 1974 were valued at
£i>234 million, including ^326-5 million for aircraft and parts, £395 million
for engines and parts and some ^92 million for guided weapons and parts.
Exports had a total value of £631 million, including £293-6 million for aircraft
and parts and £296-8 million for engines and parts. The leading markets in
1974 were the United States (£191-5 million) France (£82-1 million) and the
Federal Republic of Germany (£60-9 million). Sales to the People’s Republic
of China were also prominent.
Current production includes such civil aircraft as the Hawker Siddeley
HS 748, Trident, and 125 executive jet, the BAC One-Eleven and the Shorts
Skyvan and Britten-Norman I slander j Trislander light transports. The Anglo-
French Concorde supersonic transport is expected to start in commercial
service early in 1976. New projects include the Short’s SD 3-30, commuter
airliner. Military programmes include the unique Hawker Siddeley Harrier
vertical/short take-off and landing aircraft (which has achieved extensive
sales to the United States), the Hawk advanced trainer aircraft, and the Multi-
Role Combat Aircraft, a collaborative development by Britain, the Federal
Republic of Germany and Italy. The Puma, Gazelle and Lynx helicopters are
collaborative developments by Britain and France, together with a number
of guided-missile projects. The industry is also extensively involved in the
development and manufacture of space systems, including satellites for com¬
munications, and in research and other European collaborative programmes.
Britain is in addition the world’s leading producer of hovercraft, the Winchester
(SRN6) and Mountbatten (SRN4) classes having been sold extensively overseas.
British aero-engines are also in world-wide use, recent developments including
the Pegasus vectored-thrust engine for the Harrier and similar aircraft and
the advanced technology RB 211 ultra-quiet engine, and its more powerful
derivative, the RB211-524, an engine developed for aircraft with a longer
range.
Britain has a long-established tradition in shipbuilding and its industry is
among the most important in the world. In the past decade the major shipyards
have embarked on extensive programmes of reorganisation and modernisation.
A series of mergers has led to the creation of two major groups on Clydeside,

three in north-east England, one in eastern Scotland and one in southern
England. Together with one firm on Merseyside and one in Belfast—where
the world’s largest building dock is operational—they account for more than
nine-tenths by gross tonnage of the industry s merchant shipDuilding opera¬
tions. In addition numerous yards around the coast build smaller % esseb such
as naval ships, fishing and harbour craft, and oilrig supply vessels, this being
a particularly rapidly growing area of activity. Co-operative research into
shipbuilding and marine engineering is undertaken by the British bhip
Research Association.
In 1974 completions of merchant ships of 100 gross tons and over totalled
134 vessels of I'lp million gross tons and an estimated value of £22 _ 9 million,
of which 31 vessels of 235,000 gross tons with an estimated value of £61-7
million were for overseas registration. At the end of that year orders w ere on
hand for 381 ships of 6-2 million gross tons with an estimated value of £i,538
million, of which no vessels of i'6 million gross tons and an estimated \alue
°f £474 million were for overseas registration. Deliveries of pleasure craft
were valued at £2^ 2 million. Exports of ships and boats had a total \alue of
£120-4 million in 1974.
Some of the larger shipbuilding firms also carry out repair work in addition
to a number of specialist ship repair firms. Ship repair, maintenance, con¬
version and refitting by the whole industry had a value of £264-9 mi!llon m
1974. A number of specialist firms construct and fit various types of marine
diesel engines, steam turbines and gas turbines. Completions and deliveries of
marine engines and machinery totalled £120-3 million in 1974. Direct exports
of marine propulsion diesel engines had a value of £i5'9 nailhon.
The Government intends to take into public ownership the larger ship¬
building, ship repairing and marine engineering companies, which are to be
reorganised under a new public corporation, British Shipbuilders.
The group of industries manufacturing metal products not already described
consists of a very large number of firms with a total labour force of 581,700
in 1974. The main groups are engineers’ small tools and gauges (67.000
persons), bolts, nuts and screws (38,900), wire and wire manufactures (40,800)
cans and metal boxes (31,700), jewellery, plate, and the retining ot P^aou"
metals (22,400), hand tools and implements (21,200), cutlery 114.600) and
other metal industries (345>°00)- The total value of ^P0*5 m 1974 WaS ab°Ut
£471 million.
The manufacture of engineers’ small tools (used with metal-working machine
tools) is an expanding industry. Small firms predominate. Sales totalled £218
million in 1974, including jigs and fixtures (£18-9 million) press tools and
moulds (£477 million), hard metal-tipped tools (£25-5 million) and other metal
cutting tools (£76 million). Exports totalled £41'5 million.
The production of cutlery and tableware (including safety- razors and blades)
is centred mainly in Sheffield and the Midlands. The industry’s reputation has
been built on the skill of its craftsmen, although, except in the case ol the
highest quality wares, mass-production methods are extenshc.y u^ .
though small firms predominate, seven relatively large employers are respon¬
sible for over half of output. The value of sales of cutlery in 1974 was £30
million and of safety razors and blades £29 million. Exports of cutlery, razors
and razor blades totalled £30-3 million.

About 220 firms produce a wide range of domestic utensils, such as saucepans,
buckets and dustbins, mainly from aluminium and wrought steel, together
with industrial hollow-ware such as kegs, drums and barrels. The value of
sales in 1974 was ,£130-3 million. Exports of domestic utensils were valued
at £14 million.
The manufacture of hand tools, such as files, saws, hammers, axes and spades,
is a long-established industry7. There are about 350 firms, four relatively large
employers being responsible for over one-quarter of output. Sheffield,
Birmingham and other Midland towns are the most important centres. The
value of sales of hand tools and implements was £87 million in 1974: exports
totalled ^46-7 million.
The making of jewellery7, gold and silver ware and the refining of precious
metals is an industry in which British craftsmen are world renowned. Most
firms in the industry7, which is mainly centred on Birmingham, are small,
although five relatively large firms are responsible for nearly three-fifths of
total output. The total value of sales of jewellery, goldsmiths’ and silver¬
smiths' wares, including coins and medals, and electro-plated nickel silver
wares in 1974 was ,£130-9 million, of which ,£16-8 million was for export.
The chemicals industry, with a labour force of 434,700 comprises the manu¬
facture of: general chemicals (133,600 employees), pharmaceutical chemicals
and preparations (76,600), toilet preparations (27,100), paint (27,500), soap
and detergents (15,900), synthetic resins, plastics materials and synthetic
rubber (50,400), dyestuffs and pigments (23,400), fertilisers, (12,200), and other
chemical products (68,000). This is one of the fastest growing sectors of
British industry, and an important contributor to overseas earnings. The value
of exports in 1974 was ,£2,146 million, or 13 per cent of total British exports.
About one-third of the output of the general chemicals industry consists of a
limited number of relatively simple inorganic chemicals, such as sulphuric
acid and metallic and non-metallic oxides, serving as basic materials for
industry. Substantial quantities of inorganic chemicals are used in the manu¬
facture of such products as fertilisers, detergents, paint, glass and metals.
Sulphuric acid has the largest production of any chemical and 3-9 million
tonnes were produced in 1974. The remaining output of this sector consists of
a very wide range of chemicals. The chemical industry is highly capital
intensive, so that employment figures for firms do not adequately reflect the
size of undertakings. Four large firms are responsible for half of total output
of inorganic chemicals.
Petroleum-based chemicals account for over four-fifths of the total output
of organic chemicals. The most important products (by weight) in 1974 were
ethylene (1-3 million tonnes), propylene (663,000 tonnes) and benzene
(696,000 tonnes). The main outlets for organic chemicals are plastics materials,
solvents, synthetic rubber, man-made fibres and detergents. Three large
firms are responsible for almost two-thirds of total output of organic chemicals.
Output of general chemicals totalled £2,534 million in 1974 and exports
£550-3 million; European Community countries and the United States are
the principal purchasers.
Sales of radioisotopes from the Radiochemical Centre Ltd. in 1974 were
valued at over £9 million of which 58 per cent represented exports.

The whole range of drugs is produced in Britain, where many of the basic
products were discovered and developed. These include antibiotics, sulphona-
mides, anti-malarial drugs, anti-histamine products, anaesthetics, vaccines,
sera and naturally occurring drugs.
Seventeen firms are responsible for almost two-thirds of total output;
several of the larger pharmaceutical companies are subsidiaries of overseas
firms.
In 1974 sales of pharmaceutical chemicals and preparations totalled ^7°7
million. Exports of medicinal and pharmaceutical products totalled £301-6
million, of which £39 million worth were antibiotics. The largest purchasers
were Belgium (£19-6 million) and the Irish Republic (£18-7 million).
Many of the basic discoveries in plastics, including polyethylene, were made in
Britain. Plastics manufacture is one of the fastest growing sections of industry.
Expansion in recent years has mainly been in thermoplastic materials, of
which the most important are polyethylene (used in coverings and packaging
notably for foodstuffs), polyvinyl chloride (known as PYC and used for a wide
range of industrial purposes and consumer goods) and polystyrene (a material
used for toys, light mouldings and many consumer goods). One of the newer
thermoplastic materials is polypropylene, which can be fabricated as mould¬
ings, films and fibres. A new family of plastics materials reinforced with
carbon fibres is also in commercial production in Britain; they have up to three
times the strength but are only half the weight of steel. High styrene rubbers
for shoe soles and flooring, and nitrile rubbers for use where oil resistance is
required, are also in large-scale production, together with neoprene rubber.
There are about 250 firms in the industry; four large enterprises are respon¬
sible for about two-fifths of output. In 1974 sales of synthetic resin and plastics
materials totalled £949-8 million; sales of synthetic rubber a further £158-4
million. Exports of synthetic resins and plastics materials totalled £366-8 mil¬
lion, the main purchasers being Australia (£28-3 million), and Sweden (£27-8
million). Exports of synthetic rubber totalled £46^6 million.
The development of chemical fertilisers owes much to the pioneer work of
British scientists. Production is dominated by three firms, together with a
number of firms marketing compound fertilisers from the principal consti¬
tuents—nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium—and is almost entirely for the
domestic market. Sales of fertilisers were valued at £292-7 million in 1974.
The use of ammonium nitrate (35 per cent nitrogen), ammonium phosphate,
and urea (mostly 45 per cent nitrogen), is resulting in more concentrated
fertilisers. The value of exports of manufactured fertilisers was £45-7 million
in 1974, European Community countries forming the largest market.
Notable discoveries by the British crop protection industry include the
insecticidal activity of BHC (benzene hexachloride), the first selective hor¬
mone weed-killer, MCPA, and Gramoxone, a non-residual general herbicide.
Three relatively large firms are responsible for more than a third of total
output. Sales of pesticides and allied products were valued at £111-2 million in
1974; herbicides (£51 million) were the largest single category. Exports of
insecticides, fungicides and disinfectants in 1974 totalled £60-7 million.
Manufacturers’ sales of paint and varnish during 1974 amounted to some
611-3 million litres (including 142-9 million litres of emulsion paint) valued
at £325 million. In recent years many improved techniques have been

introduced, including new ranges of synthetic resins and pigments, non-drip,
quick-drying paints and paints needing only one application. About 360 firms
are involved in this sector, six relatively large firms being responsible for
almost half of total output. Britain is one of the largest exporters of paints in
the world; exports of pigments, paints, varnishes and related products in 1974
amounted to ^xio-5 million.
Sales of toilet preparations totalled ^294 million in 1974 <md sales of soap and
detergents ^35^ million. About 220 firms, including three large enterprises,
are involved in the toilet preparations industry and about 200 in the soap and
detergents industry. Exports of perfumery and toilet preparations, soap and
associated products were valued at £ 104-4 million.
Sales of other chemical products in 1974 included formulated adhesives (£91-5
million), printing ink (^54'3 million) and photographic chemical materials
(£146-6 million). Sales of polishes in 1974 were valued at £49 3 million, includ¬
ing floor and furniture polishes worth £13-8 million. Exports in 1974 included
additives for improving viscosity and similar products (£89-9 million) and
glues and starches (£22-8 million).
The boundaries between the various fibre-based sectors of the textile industry
have now become indistinct and considerable vertical integration has taken
place, connected with the rapidly developing technology of man-made fibres.
The industry’s main research bodies are the Cotton, Silk and Man-made
Fibres Research Association, the Wool Industries Research Association, the
Hosiery and Allied Trades Research Association, the International Wool
Secretariat and the Shirley Institute.
The industry has a labour force of 585,3°° half of whom are women; 47,700
are engaged in the production of man-made fibres, 118,600 in the spinning,
doubling and weaving of cotton, flax and man-made fibres, 102,200 in the
woollen and worsted trades, and 132,400 in hosiery and knitted goods. The
total value of textile exports in 1974 was £745-8 million.
Much of the early development of man-made fibres took place in Britain.
Production is spread throughout the country with Northern Ireland of notable
importance. Large firms predominate in the industry. Development started
with the cellulose fibres such as rayon (made from natural polymers) and later
moved on to the more complicated fully synthetic fibres (the polyamides)
such as nylon, produced from chemical substances. These are still the two
main types of man-made fibre.
Extensive research by the industry has enabled the range of man-made
fibres to increase annually. Terylene, a polyester fibre, invented in Britain
during the second world war, is particularly suited to blending with wool.
Acrylic fibres, including Courtelle (a British discovery) and Acrilan, are of
growing importance. Production also includes elastomerics of spandex fibres,
which have inherent properties of stretch and recovery, anti-static synthetic
yarns, embedded with carbon, new fire-resistant yarns, and another British
development, melded fabric, in which the weaving and knitting stages are
omitted, producing a non-woven fabric. Output, which has expanded rapidly
in recent years, totalled 599,000 tonnes valued at £475 million in 1974, con¬
sisting of 364,100 tonnes of staple fibre and 234,600 tonnes of filament yarn.
Of the continuous filament yarn 115,800 tonnes were polyamide yarns. Output
of woven man-made fibre cloth totalled 435 million linear metres valued at
£186 million.

Exports of synthetic and artificial yarns had a value of £165 million in
1974 and synthetic and artificial fabrics j£68-6 million. The Irish Republic
was one of the most important purchasers, along with several other members
of the European Community.
The British wool textile industry, important since medieval times, is one of the
largest in the world. There are two main branches—woollen and worsted and
in recent years an increasing amount of man-made fibre has been blended with
wool. The small or medium-sized business predominates, with only a few
large firms. While West Yorkshire is by far the most important producing area,
Scotland and the west of England remain famous as specialised producers of
high-quality cloth.
In 1974 sales of woollen and worsted products had a total value of ^7^9
million. Production of tops amounted to 98-7 million kg., of which the wool
and hair content composed 43'8 million kg. Deliveries of worsted and semi¬
worsted yarn amounted to 87 million kg. and of woven fabrics to 175 rnillion
square metres, of which woollen comprised 92 million square metres and
worsted 83 million square metres. In addition, large, but declining, quantities of
raw wool are scoured and cleaned in Britain. Consumption of raw wool in 1974
was 113 million kg. Exports in 1974 included wool yarns (£36-5 million) and
fabrics (£106-6 million). By far the largest market for woollens and worsted
fabrics was Japan (£31'8 million). Raw wool (cleaned or scoured in Britain)
and other animal hair and tops exported had a value of £67-3 million.
Cotton was Britain’s chief consumer goods industry and cotton piece-goods
its largest export during the nineteenth century. Increasing low-cost competi¬
tion has cut progressively into British markets but the industry has responded
with extensive reorganisation, modernisation and the introduction of new
techniques. Most of the industry is located in Lancashire, the north-east of the
county being mainly concerned with weaving and the south-east with spinning.
Output in 1974 consisted of: 81 million kg. of single cotton yarn, 88
million kg. of spun man-made fibre and mixture single yarn, 75 million kg. of
doubled cotton yarn, 409 million linear metres of woven cotton cloth, and 505
million linear metres of man-made fibre and mixture cloth. In 1974 exports of
cotton yarn were worth £22 million, exports of woven cotton fabrics were
valued at £52 million, with the Irish Republic and Commonwealth coun¬
tries the most important markets.
The hosiery and knitwear industry is predominantly one of small-scale
enterprises. Although widely distributed, the industry is centred in the east
Midlands, the north-west of England and in Scotland. Sales of hosiery and
other knitted goods totalled £602 million in 1974 including £238 million
worth of outerwear, £122 million worth of socks, tights and stockings and
£144 million worth of knitted fabrics. Exports of knitted or crocheted clothing
and accessories were valued at £83'9 million in 1974) the largest buyers were
the European Community countries who bought ^29-3 million and the United
States (^8-4 million). Exports of knitted and crocheted fabrics amounted to
^44-9 million.
The linen industry is centred in Northern Ireland which concentrates on
yarns and the lighter types of fabrics, with most of the remainder in Scotland.
Northern Ireland manufacturers produced 17 million linear metres of cloth in
1974, while weavers in Britain delivered 18 million square metres including

Manufactures
Jute products are manufactured on a large scale in the Dundee area; jute yarn
is used in the manufacture of carpets, cordage, ropes and woven into fabrics
for a wide range of applications in the packaging, carpet, upholstery, building
and motor car industries. New uses for jute, as a plastics reinforcement for
example, have also been developed. In 1974 output included 48,000 tonnes of
jute yarn and 18,900 tonnes of woven jute cloth. Total sales of the main
products of the jute industry were valued at ^5^'^ million including exports
of £3-2 million.
Sales of finished lace goods amounted to £23 million in 1974. The most
important lace product is manufactured on warp knitting machines, with
sales valued at ^9'^ million. Exports of principal products were worth £4-4
million in 1974.
In addition to the products mentioned above, British textile firms manufacture
a wide range of other goods, including many special yarns and fabrics, net,
household textiles such as blankets, tablecloths and curtains, and carpets
and other floor coverings. Sales of floor coverings of linoleum, vinyl and other
synthetic materials were valued at over £124 million in 1974; just under one-
sixth was for export. The cordage industry is one of the largest in Europe.
Exports of ropes, cordage, nets and netting in 1974 were valued at £8-6
million.
Carpets Some 135 enterprises are engaged in the manufacture of carpets and rugs,
including six large groups. The principal manufacturing centres include
Kidderminster, Halifax and Bradford, Glasgow and Kilmarnock and several
towns in Northern Ireland. About one-quarter of the carpets produced (by
quantity) are made predominantly of wool and a growing proportion of tradi¬
tional woven carpets contain some man-made fibre. Total sales in 1974
amounted to some 151 million square metres worth about £382 million.
Some two-thirds of output is accounted for by tufted carpets, in the produc¬
tion of which the pile, usually with a high man-made fibre content, is inserted
into a pre-woven backing; woven carpets, such as Axminster and Wilton, make
up most of the remainder of sales, and form the bulk of exports which totalled
£85 million in 1974.
CLOTHING,
LEATHER AND
FOOTWEAR
There are 469,300 employees in the clothing, leather and footwear industries.
Some 340,400 are in the clothing industry, 86,100 in the footwear trade and
42,800 in leather, leather goods and fur manufacture.
Clothing The British clothing industry is the largest in Europe. The typical firm in the in¬
dustry is small, although there are some large firms employing mass-production
methods on an extensive scale. The principal manufacturing centres are
London, Leeds and Manchester, but some firms are also situated on industrial
estates throughout the country. The Clothing Export Council, representing
some 220 companies, organises promotions for various sectors of the industry.
Exports of clothing in 1974, including knitted goods but excluding fur clothing,
were valued at £223-6 million; the Irish Republic (£28 million) was the main
purchaser.

Leather tanning and leather goods manufacturing is another of Britain’s long-
established industries.
Tanneries are situated in most parts of Britain, but there are important
concentrations in Lancashire, Cheshire, Yorkshire, the north Midlands and
the London area. All types of leather (including heavy types for industrial use)
and leather goods are produced. Collective research is carried out by the
British Leather Manufacturers’ Research Association. In 1974 the industry’s
output totalled £231-6 million; exports were valued at £53-8 million. The
United States (£7 million) is the largest single market.
The British footwear industry is among the largest in the world. There are
about 520 firms in the industry, with three large firms being responsible for
about one-fifth of total output. Factories are located throughout Britain. Some
areas concentrate on production of particular types; for example, the Rossen-
dale valley region of Lancashire on slippers, and Leicester and Norwich on
women’s and girls’ shoes. In 1974 manufacturers’ sales of footwear totalled 177
million pairs with a value of £379-2 million. Exports of all types had a value of
£47-3 million; the Irish Republic (£8-8 million) was the largest market.
The food, drink and tobacco industries employ 765,900 people in the pro¬
duction of a great variety of goods. The value of their combined exports in
1974 was £989-6 million. Exports of alcoholic beverages accounted for £381
million; sugar, sugar preparations and honey for £59-2 million; cereal and
cereal preparations for £76-8 million; fruit and vegetables for £52-8 million;
dairy products and eggs for £41 million; and coffee, cocoa, tea and spices
for £54-9 million.
Many of the industry’s leading firms have been involved in mergers in
recent years.
Bread production is increasingly concentrated in large mechanised bakeries
most of them using a process developed by the industry’s main research
organisation (the Flour Milling and Baking Research Association) now also
widely used in other countries. About two-thirds of bread is made in these
bakeries. Three groups have a dominant position. In smaller bakeries produc¬
tion of cakes and other flour confectionery is usually allied to bread production.
There are 116,100 employees in the bread and flour confectionery industry
and a further 22,700 in grain-milling. Output of bread totalled 2-19 million
tons in 1974; sales of bread, flour confectionery and other bakery products had
a total value of £670-7 million.
There are 43,500 employees producing biscuits and related products. Out¬
put of biscuits totalled 622,000 tons in 1974; sales of biscuits and related
products had a total value of £305 million. British biscuits have gained a
world-wide reputation, and exports in 1974 were valued at £30-3 million.
The cocoa, chocolate and sugar confectionery industry, which has 75,400
employees, is composed of a small number of very large manufacturers and
many medium-sized and small firms. The main ingredients used by the
industry are sugar, cocoa beans, glucose, milk, nuts and fats. Production of
cocoa, chocolate and sugar confectionery and related products totalled 935»500
tons in 1974, with a total value of £603-6 million. A substantial proportion of
total world exports of chocolate and sugar confectionery come from Britain,
the world’s largest exporter of these products; exports totalled £72-5 million
in 1974.

of jams and marmalade totalled 175 million tons in 1974 and exports were
valued at ,£3•7 million. In 1974 839,000 tons of canned vegetables were pro¬
duced. In addition, output in 1974 included 90,000 tons of canned and bottled
fruit. Nearly 361,000 tons of vegetables were processed by quick freezing in
I974-
The industry comprises the curing of bacon and ham, the canning and pre¬
serving of meat and fish, the manufacture of sausages and pies and the
preparation of extracts and pastes. The labour force numbers 117,700. Output
of canned meat and canned meat products in 1974 totalled 135,031 tons, and
239>000 tons of bacon and ham were cured. Quick-frozen fish output amoun¬
ted to some 79,900 tons in 1974; small quantities (7,000 tons in 1974) are also
canned. Exports of fish and fish preparations had a value of ^51-8 million in
I974 and those of meat and meat products were worth £8o-i million.
The industries producing beer, spirits, wines, cider and soft drinks have a
labour force of 135,600.
Exports of whisky (almost all of it Scotch whisky) totalled 87-6 million proof
gallons with a value of £326-4 million in 1974; almost half went to the United
States which imported £145‘6 million worth of distilled alcoholic beverages
from Britain in 1974. Scotch whisky was first distilled in the fifteenth century.
It is blended from 20 or more different types, some from malted barley and
some from other grains. Whisky requires several years to mature, and the
Scotch whisky produced in the 1974 distilling year will not be on sale for some
years. Stocks of whisky amount to more than 1,000 million proof gallons.
About four-fifths of annual sales are to overseas buyers.
Production of gin in Britain has risen steadily since the early 1950s. The main
distillers are in London and one company accounts for a large proportion of
total output. Although the larger manufacturers also own distilleries abroad,
exports had a value of £28-9 million in 1974.
There are 71,100 employees in the brewing and malting industry.
Seven major brewery groups market their products throughout the country
together with a number of smaller enterprises. Firms have introduced new
production methods, including continuous brewing processes, and automated
batch production plants are well established. In 1974, 38-5 million bulk
barrels of beer were produced. Exports in 1974 of malt beer were 444,000 bulk
barrels, worth £7-4 million.
The main raw materials used in brewing are malt, hops and some sugar.
Malt is made almost entirely from home-grown barley. Some brewers make all
or part of their own malt, others purchase it from independent maltsters who
also supply distillers, vinegar brewers and malt extract manufacturers. British
malt is used by brewers throughout the world, and exports in 1974 amounted
to 130,400 tons, worth £12 million.
The soft drinks industry has expanded markedly in the last decade. Total
exports of non-alcoholic beverages and fruit juices were £5-3 million in 1974.
There are two very large firms among about 20 producing brands which are
marketed on a national scale together with about 250 firms supplying regional

markets. There is also some degree of specialisation by firms in the production
of various types, such as carbonated drinks, cola-based drinks, squashes and
cordials, tonic waters and ‘mixers’, fruit juices and health drinks. Sales in
1974 included 95‘5 million gallons of concentrated soft drinks, and 37^ 3
million gallons of unconcentrated drinks.
The tobacco industry manufactures almost all the cigarettes and other tobacco
goods sold in Britain. The main centres of production are in and around Bris¬
tol, Liverpool, London, Manchester, Newcastle, Nottingham, Glasgow and
Belfast. The two biggest manufacturing groups account for over 90 per cent
of total output and the industry has 40,900 employees. In 1974 the industry’s
total sales were valued at £1,852 million. Exports worth £68-9 million (of
which cigarettes accounted for nearly 90 per cent) were shipped to a large
number of overseas markets; Saudi Arabia (£6-7 million), the Netherlands
(£5 million) and Belgium (£4-4 million) being the most important. The
tobacco industry used 362-3 million lb. of imported tobacco in 1974, the main
sources being the United States, Canada and India. The industry’s output in¬
cluded 277 million lb. of cigarettes; 5-5 million lb. of cigars; and 35-8 million
lb. of pipe and other tobacco.
This group comprises the manufacture of bricks, fireclay, refractory goods,
pottery, glass, cement, abrasives, asbestos and other building materials. The
industries have a combined labour force of 300,800 which includes 47,500 in
the bricks, fireclay and refractory goods trades, 72,700 in the glass industry
and 59,800 in the pottery industry.
Firms in the industry manufacture such items as bricks, roofing tiles, chimney
pots, fireclay ware and heat-resisting products including furnace and kiln
linings. Brickmaking is one of Britain’s oldest industries, but most manufac¬
ture is now based on highly mechanised systems. In 1974 about 5,580 million
building bricks were produced in Great Britain, made mainly in the Bedford
and Peterborough areas. Sales of bricks and other non-refractory goods had a
total value of £153-2 million in 1974. Refractory goods include firebricks,
silica bricks, magnesite bricks, chrome-magnesite bricks and alumina bricks,
which in 1974 totalled 965,400 tonnes valued at £50-3 million; output of other
refractory goods amounted to £65-5 million. Exports of bricks, tiles and
refractory goods were valued at £36-4 million in 1974-
The cement industry, with 15,200 employees, is chiefly concerned with the
manufacture of Portland cement for the home market. Invented by Joseph
Aspdin and patented in 1824, this material and the methods of its production
have been the subject of continuous technical improvement and intensive
research. The capacity of the industry has been expanded substantially in
recent years. Output totalled 18 million tonnes in 1974 and the industry’s total
sales were valued at £199-6 million.
The pottery industry, centred largely in Staffordshire, supplies almost all home
needs for domestic and industrial pottery. It is a long-established industry, in
which there has been considerable re-equipment; kilns fired by gas or elec¬
tricity have replaced almost all the coal-fired kilns, and new decorating tech¬
niques and automatic and semi-automatic machinery have been introduced.
Domestic pottery, including china, earthenware, stoneware, jet and Rocking¬
ham, accounts for about half of the industry’s output; the other main divisions

are glazed tiles, sanitary ware and electrical ware, and such specialised indus¬
trial products as acid-proof stoneware, porous ceramics and laboratory porcelain
are also manufactured. Production of tableware is concentrated in four major
groups. Britain is the world’s principal manufacturer of fine bone china;
famous makes include Wedgwood, Spode, Royal Worcester, Royal Doulton,
Minton, Coalport and Royal Crown Derby. Total sales of pottery were £203
million in 1974 including export sales of ^71‘2 million; the United States and
Canada are among the leading markets.
Britain’s glass industry is one of the largest in the world. The section of the
industry devoted to the manufacture of plate and sheet glass in their various
forms is organised for quantity production, much of it in the form of ‘float’
glass a process developed in Britain and licensed to glassmakers throughout
the world. The use of glass for internal decoration and as a finish for internal
and external walls has greatly increased in recent years. Large quantities of
safety glass are produced for the motor and other industries. Other products
include tubular glass (produced on a large scale), mirrors, lamp and bulb glass,
scientific and medical glassware, glass fibres, and all types of glass containers
(mostly made automatically). A traditional product is hand-made lead crystal
glassware of very high quality. Collective research is undertaken by the British
Glass Industry Research Association, and much research work is also carried
out by the Department of Glass Technology of Sheffield University.
Total sales of glass and glass products were valued at £393 million in 1974.
Direct exports of glass and glassware totalled £83 million in 1974. Those of
glass were worth ^50-4 million, the most important markets being European
Community countries.
The paper, printing and publishing industries have 588,700 employees,
including 96,400 in the manufacture of paper and board, 91,000 in the pro¬
duction of packaging materials, 148,900 in the printing and publishing of
newspapers and periodicals, and 210,500 in other types of printing and
publishing.
The British paper and board industry is one of the largest in Europe. Four
major companies dominate the industry but there are many medium-sized and
small firms. The large groups hold considerable interests abroad, including
pulp and paper producing mills in the United States, Canada, other parts of
the Commonwealth and Europe. In recent years the trend in production has
been towards high-quality and specialised paper.
The main raw materials are woodpulp and waste paper. Woodpulp pro¬
duced in Britain is used, although it still represents only a small percentage
of total supplies. The use of salvaged waste paper is increasing and new
recycling techniques are being developed.
Total sales in 1974 of all types of paper and board amounted to £907
million. Of this, newsprint accounted for £52-6 million and other printing
and writing papers for £340-3 million; £172-7 million was board and the
remainder was made up chiefly of wrapping papers, industrial and special
purpose papers and tissues. Sales of household paper products, including facial
tissues, and other paper and board products totalled £255 million. Sales of
packaging products, such as cardboard boxes, cartons and fibreboard packing
cases, totalled £603 million, while sales of manufactured stationery were
valued at £303 million. Sales of wall coverings (where a major innovation
has been the introduction of plastics coated coverings) totalled £947 million.

Publishing
BRITAIN 1976: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Exports of paper and board were valued at £137-1 million in 1974, and exports
of manufactured paper items at £62-2 million. The Irish Republic (£20-5
million), and France (£14 million) are among the leading purchasers.
The printing and publishing industry produces a wide range of goods, from
national newspapers and periodicals to books, business stationery and
greetings cards. Mergers in recent years have led to the formation of large
groups in the newspaper, magazine and book publishing sections. Three large
firms each employ more than 15,000 people. General printing, publishing,
engraving and bookbinding remains essentially an industry of small firms. j
Production processes include the latest developments in high-speed printing
equipment, including electronic engraving and advanced processes of photo¬
graphic reproduction, and several newspapers are set by computer techniques.
Total sales and receipts of newspapers and periodicals were valued at £1,106
million in 1974, including £678-9 million for newspapers (sales £282-5
million, advertising revenue £396-4 million) and £278-6 million for periodicals
(sales £148-8 million, advertising revenue £129-8 million). Sales in the general
printing and publishing industry totalled £977-2 million, of which sales of
books totalled £272-6 million. Exports of printed matter were valued at £161-5
million in 1974, including books and pamphlets (£84-5 million), and news¬
papers and periodicals (£24-2 million), but these figures do not include parcel
post shipments, which are possibly as large again as the recorded totals. The
United States (£27-2 million) and Australia (£23-4 million) are among the
most important overseas markets. The Book Development Council of the
Publishers Association promotes the supply and use of British books overseas.
OTHER Other manufacturing industries include the timber and furniture group, with
MANUFACTURING 283,100 employees, rubber manufacture, with 125,100 employees, and a group
INDUSTRIES misceilane0us manufactures employing some 233,100 including 128,000 in
plastics moulding and fabricating.
Rubber Tyres and tubes represent more than half the output of the industry but firms
also make a variety of goods, the most important being rubber footwear,
conveyor belting, cables, hose, latex foam products and other vehicle com¬
ponents and accessories. One recent major development has been the intro¬
duction of tyre systems which enable the vehicle to continue safely after
puncturing. The largest tyre group in Europe came into being in 1971, follow¬
ing the merger of Britain’s leading rubber and tyre company and its Italian
equivalent. Tyre manufacturers include several subsidiaries of United States
and other overseas companies.
In 1974 the industry’s consumption of rubber totalled 454,800 tonnes,
comprising 165,000 tonnes of natural rubber, 271,200 tonnes of synthetic
rubber and 18,000 tonnes of recycled rubber. In i974> 222,000 tonnes of
rubber were used in the production of tyres and tyre products. Direct exports
of rubber and rubber manufactures in 1974 were worth £171-8 million, with
Sweden, the United States and Australia as the main markets. This figure
included tyres and tubes valued at £86-4 million, but excluded large indirect
exports on vehicles. In addition, the industry exported about £8 million
worth of rubber or plastic footwear and £5-5 million of rubber gloves and
other clothing.
Furniture, Numerous enterprises manufacture furniture in Britain (including domestic,
Brushes and upholstered, office, school and other furniture) with a few large firms pre-
Timber dominating. The labour force is of the order of 125,300. New designs and

materials are incorporated into modern furniture; traditional designs are
reproduced by skilled craftsmen. Sales of wooden furniture and upholstery
totalled ,£539-5 million in i974> while sales of metal furniture were valued at
,£126-9 million. Exports of all furniture were worth ,£69-5 million in 1974. The
bedding industry employs 21,500 people; sales of bedding and soft furnishings
in 1974 were valued at ,£121 million. Scientific research and technical and
other information services are provided by the Furniture Development
Council and the Furniture Industry Research Association. A Development
Council for the furniture industry has existed since 1949.
The brush industry is located throughout Britain, and includes highly
mechanised establishments as well as small craft units. The value of sales in
I974 was j£46‘4 million, of which ,£5-9 million was for export.
The timber industry employs 99,000 people. Britain is mainly dependent
on imported supplies of timber although domestic production has been
steadily increasing. Sales of timber, plywood and chipboard and builders’
woodwork totalled ,£653 million in 1974.
The number of people engaged in manufacturing toys and sports equipment
and children s carriages in Britain is 45,700. Sales of toys, games and children’s
carriages in 1974 were worth ,£180-1 million and exports had a value of £72-5
million. The Federal Republic of Germany and the United States are the main
overseas markets. The value of sales of sports equipment was ,£54-9 million:
exports totalled £26-8 million.
There is in Britain a comprehensive system of legislation and machinery to
protect the consumer’s economic and other interests. The importance attached
to this is indicated by the establishment under the Fair Trading Act 1973 of
the office of the Director General of Fair Trading, and in 1974 of a Depart¬
ment of Prices and Consumer Protection (see p. 54). The Director General of
Fair Trading keeps consumer affairs continuously under review. He can
initiate action on unfair trading practices in general and against individual
unfair traders. He encourages trade associations to adopt and publish volun¬
tary codes of practice and himself publishes material to inform and educate
consumers. The Director General of Fair Trading is also concerned with
competition policy (see p. 209). The Consumer Credit Act 1974 is being
introduced in stages, and will replace previous legislation on credit, including
hire purchase and hire. It will give the consumer greater protection and will
provide for a licensing system for businesses involved in credit and hire trans¬
actions. The Supply of Goods (Implied Terms) Act 1973 guarantees the
consumer’s basic rights in transactions for the purchase of goods—that is,
that the goods correspond to their description and are of merchantable
quality and fit for their purpose. Other important legislation (which differs
in some respects for Northern Ireland) includes the Weights and Measures
Act 1963 which establishes a uniform system of weights and measures and
provides protection against short weight and short measure in commodities;
the Food and Drugs Act 1955 and the Food and Drugs Act (Scotland) 1956
which control the purity, hygiene and description of food; the Consumer
Protection Acts 1961 and 1971 which empower the Government to make
regulations to ensure the safety of any class of goods; and the Trade Descrip¬
tions Acts 1968 and 1972 which make it an offence to describe goods inaccurately
or make certain kinds of false statements about services. The Prices Act 1974
makes it possible to require prices or unit prices to be marked on goods offered
for sale. In the main, this type of legislation is enforced by the Trading
246
BRITAIN 1976: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Standards Departments and other branches of local government. Independent
consumer councils for each of the nationalised industries investigate consumer
complaints, while some trade associations in industry and commerce have
established codes of practice designed to protect the consumer and look into
complaints about member firms. A National Consumer Council, established
in 1975, ensures that the consumers’ view is made known to those in Govern- ;
ment and industry whose decisions affect consumers.
Where necessary, consumers can gain legal redress through the simplified
procedure introduced in 1973 in the county courts (see p. 89). Information
and advice are made available to consumers throughout the country by the
Citizens’ Advice Bureaux (see p. 124) or by consumer advice centres run by
local authorities.
In addition a number of private organisations work to further consumer
interests. The largest is the Consumers’ Association with a membership of
over 700,000. The association conducts an extensive programme of comparative
testing of goods bought on the open market; its views and test reports are j
published in a series of bulletins issued to members, the main monthly bulletin
being entitled Which?. The association also provides an advice service on
subscription. Work of this kind is also carried out by local groups, whose
representative body is the National Federation of Consumer Groups. Other
private consumer organisations include the Housewife s Trust and the
Research Institute for Consumer Affairs.
Structure
CONSTRUCTION
The construction industry, which accounts for about 7 per cent of the total
domestic income, includes firms engaged on the construction, alteration, repair
and maintenance of buildings, highways, airfields, drainage and sewerage
systems, docks, harbours and canals, sea defence works, offshore structures,
electrical wiring, heating and other installation work, open-cast coal prospect¬
ing and mining, and structural work connected with thermal and hydroelectric
power stations and telecommunications. About i-8 million people are engage
on construction, including the self-employed, and they represent some 8 per
cent of the total labour force. About 20 per cent are employed by public
authorities. Some 30 per cent of output consists of maintenance work, and
about 45 per cent of all new work is commissioned by public authorities.
Construction work is carried out both by private contractors and by public
authorities which employ their own labour. About 90 per cent of the work is
done by private firms. Although there are over 66,000 firms employing two or
more people over 92 per cent of them employ fewer than 25 people.
Public authorities as a whole employ about 242,000 operatives but a very
large proportion of these are engaged on repair and maintenance work or
local authorities. ,
Nearly 38 per cent of operatives are occupied on building maintenance,
valued at about £3,000 million annually. The total labour force includes about
710 000 skilled craftsmen, most of whom have been trained under the indus¬
try’s apprenticeship schemes. A further 88,000 are employed as apprentices.
The apprenticeship period is now four years.
Some firms are vertically integrated, owning quarries and workshops,
mechanised plant and standard builders’ equipment; some undertake respon¬
sibility for projects from initial design to finished building. All but the
smallest projects are generally carried out under professional direction, eit er

by architects or, in the case of the more complicated civil engineering projects,
by consulting engineers. The functions of the latter, acting on behalf of a
client, embrace advice on the feasibility of projects, the drawing up of plans
and the supervision of the construction work by the contractor.
The Property Services Agency, which is an integral part of the Department
of the Environment (see p. 50) is responsible for the construction programmes
undertaken directly by the Government, including work for the armed services,
both at home and overseas. The Department of the Environment is responsible
for co-ordinating research and development throughout the government
service and seeks to influence methods and techniques in the building industry
as a whole.
The value of work done in 1974 amounted to £10,181 million, of which £925
million represented work carried out by the labour employed directly by
public authorities. Private contractors carried out the remaining £9,255 million
(£7,012 million on new work and £2,243 million on repair work).
Some 252,000 houses and flats were started in 1974 and 268,000 were com¬
pleted, of which 140,000 were for private owners. Of the £2,536 million of
new housing carried out by private contractors, £1,467 million, or over half,
was for private owners and the remainder for public authorities. Industrialised
building methods employing prefabricated components are used in some of
the work.
The National Building Agency is an independent advisory body, managed
by a board of directors appointed by the Secretaries of State for the Environ¬
ment and for Scotland and Wales. Its main function is to encourage the adop¬
tion of advanced methods of house building, and to provide technical advice
and services to government departments, local authorities and other clients.
Britain was the first country to develop civil engineering as a large-scale
modern industry and the first to provide techniques, finance and equipment
to carry out major civil engineering projects throughout the world. Prominent
figures in the early development of civil engineering included John McAdam,
pioneer in road construction; Thomas Telford, builder of roads, bridges,
canals, docks and railways; George and Robert Stephenson and Isambard
Kingdom Brunei, pioneers of railway building.
Among important construction projects in hand in Britain in 1975 were
several major conventional and nuclear power stations (see p. 272), offshore
production platforms for North Sea oil—the two largest steel production
platforms in the world, both designed by British firms, were installed in 1974
and 11 more were on order by July 1975—hospitals, large-scale housing
developments, a scheme to extend the London underground railway system to
London Airport (Heathrow) and the first stage of the new Fleet underground
line in London. Projects for road construction, bridges and tunnels included
about 185 miles (298 kilometres) of motorways under construction at the end
of March 1975 in England alone, and a bridge across the river Humber (see
P- 323)-
Among important new construction projects being undertaken by British
contractors in overseas countries were: a £91 million dry dock and ship¬
repairing scheme and a £20 million cement works contract in Dubai; con¬
tracts worth over £54 million for construction of seven airfields in Zaire; a
contract worth £8 million for a marine terminal in Peru; a £2-8 million land
reclamation scheme in Iraq; and a £23 million tower block project in Australia.

British building and civil engineering firms are active in over 100 countries.
In 1973/74 the value of new overseas contracts totalled about £500 million.
A substantial and growing amount of overseas business is also being done
by British architects and surveyors, as well as by other types of consultant.
At the beginning of 1975 British members of the Association of Consulting
Engineers were engaged on projects worth nearly £6,000 million which
brought some £90 million net in invisible earnings.
The Director-General of Research in the Department of the Environment
works closely with the building industry on many aspects of construction
research. The Building Research Establishment is concerned with all aspects of
building and provides a technical advisory service for construction firms. An
Agrement Board, tests and certifies building products and methods.
The construction industry is served by several of the industrial research
associations. The Construction Industry Research and Information Associa¬
tion is concerned with structural design, civil engineering construction, build¬
ing design and construction, earthworks and foundations, hydraulic and public
health engineering, and underwater engineering. The Heating and Ventilating
Research Association deals with heating and air-conditioning in dwellings and
commercial buildings. T. he application of materials is the main concern of the
Timber Research and Development Association and the Cement and Concrete
Association. Other research associations deal with bricks, paint, plastics in
building, welding and civil engineering hydraulics. The major construction
firms have research departments working on plant, materials and methods.
Other bodies concerned with research include the universities and colleges of
technology. Most of the producers of primary building materials have trade
associations which maintain research institutions chiefly devoted to seeking
new and more efficient use for their materials.
DISTRIBUTIVE AND SERVICE TRADES
Internal trade can be divided into two broad categories: trade in raw materials,
capital goods and intermediate products (for example, vehicle components)
and trade in consumer goods, involving the network of distributive trades by
which home-produced or imported goods reach the consumer. (For the pattern
of consumers’ expenditure, see p. 203.)
While some of the trade in consumer goods passes through wholesalers to
retailers, sales are also made directly to consumers through producers’ own
selling organisations (including their own retail outlets and mail order
businesses), and other sales are made directly by producers to retailers.
Closely connected with the distributive trades are those which offer a service
directly to the public, notably catering and hotel trades, laundries and dry
cleaners, garage and motor repair trades, hairdressers and shoe repairers.
There have been a number of major official statistical inquiries into the
distributive trades. The latest censuses taken in Great Britain refer to the
wholesale trades in 19651 and the retail and certain service trades in 1971.
Sample monthly and annual inquiries are also undertaken.
The 1965 inquiry into wholesale trades showed that a total of 23,643 business
units were engaged in wholesale distribution in Great Britain; 3>435 in
clothing, footwear and textiles, 2,007 in grocery and provisions, 2,630 in
1 Another census on wholesale trades for 1974 being undertaken.

vegetables and fruit, and 3>4^9 other food and in drink. In addition, there
were 8,282 dealers (wholesale or retail) in coal, builders’ materials, grain or
agricultural supplies, and Q*11? dealers in other industrial materials and
machinery. The book value of stocks held by wholesalers and dealers at the
end of 1974 was £3’2°3 rnillion; fixed capital expenditure by wholesale distri¬
butors amounted to £174 million in 1974 (valued at 1970 prices).
Methods of wholesale distribution vary according to the type of merchandise
handled. Fish, for example, is auctioned at the ports to port wholesalers (who
sell to inland wholesalers at the main distribution centres) or, increasingly, is
sold by contract to fryers and processors, or direct to retailers. Fruit and
vegetables may be sold by growers to commission agents (who dispose of the
produce either to wholesalers or direct to retailers) or the grower may deal
only with wholesale firms. T he sale of some agricultural products is regulated
by statutory marketing boards (see p. 296).
London’s wholesale markets play a leading part in the distribution of food¬
stuffs, particularly imported supplies. Every year Covent Garden (see p. 297)
handles over 1 million tons of fruit and vegetables, and about 200,000 tons of
carcase meat and 53,000 tons of poultry pass through Smithfield market;
Billingsgate is the principal distributing centre for fish.
The co-operative movement in Britain has established its own wholesale
organisation to serve the needs of retail societies. The sales of the Co-operative
Wholesale Society (CWS), whose membership is restricted to incorporated
organisations, amounted to £903 million in 1974.
Since the early 1950s, many wholesalers have joined, either singly or in
groups, with numbers of retailers to form voluntary groups to help to preserve
the existence of retail outlets for the wholesaler and to give to smaller retailers
the advantages of the lower costs of large-scale trading without significant loss
of independence. The 1966 Census of Distribution showed that about 41 per
cent of the turnover of independent grocers was attributable to wholesaler-
sponsored voluntary groups and chains. About 25,000 shops, nearly a quarter
of all independent grocers, are members of voluntary groups.
The number of Cash and Carry wholesale warehouses has increased in recent
years. By bulk purchasing and limiting their expenditure on premises and
credit and delivery facilities they can offer large price discounts to their
customers. There are about 600 stores of this type with total sales of over
^1,000 million a year. Cash and Carry wholesalers account for about half of
all grocery warehousing by turnover.
Retail businesses in Britain may be classified under four main headings: (1)
multiple traders with ten or more branches; (2) retail co-operative societies;
(3) independent retail businesses, including for this purpose the small multiple
stores (that is, chains of stores with nine or fewer branches); and (4) department
stores. Other retail outlets include gas and electricity showrooms and mail
order houses (see p. 252).
The 1971 Census of Distribution covering retail and certain service trades
in Great Britain, recorded some 473,000 retail establishments (Table 17).
Out of this total, grocery and other food retailing groups numbered nearly
198,000 and the clothing and footwear group over 81,000.
Though the total value of retail trade in Great Britain (inclusive of elec¬
tricity and gas showrooms and mail order business) rose by nearly 37 per cent
between 1966 and 1971, rates of growth (measured in turnover) varied appre¬
ciably between different types of trade. The slowest growth was in confec¬
tionery, tobacconist, newsagent, clothing and ‘other food’ sectors. The fastest
250
BRITAIN 1976: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
growth was in department stores, mail order business, gas and electricity
showroom sales, household goods, groceries and provisions, and ‘other non-
foods’. However, the actual trends are blurred by the introduction into special¬
ised shops of other specialities, for example, clothing multiples opening food
sections, and vice versa. Final results of the 1971 Census of Distribution
indicate a continuation of the trend for a larger volume of trade to be handled
by rather fewer shops, particularly in the food sector, along with the continu¬
ing expansion of large multiple firms relative to other types of shop. Indepen¬
dent shops account for about half of the value of Britain s retail trade, although
they make up more than four-fifths of the number of shops.
A very wide range is covered in the size of retailing establishments. Seven
shops had a turnover in 1971 exceeding £10 million. At the other extreme
there were some 6,500 shops with a turnover of less than £1,000 a year. In
addition there were market and street traders, whose volume of business may
be very small.
The expansion in the value of all retail sales in Great Britain between 1971
and 1974, when they were valued at about £23,300 million, was about 47 per
cent. Taking into account the general increase in prices over this period, the
real expansion of sales by all kinds of retail businesses between 1971 an<i *974
was 10 per cent. Fixed capital expenditure by retail distributors in 1974
amounted to £371 million (at 1970 prices). About 2-5 million people are
employed in retail shops.
The Northern Ireland 1965 Census of Retail Distribution and Other Ser¬
vices shows total sales of £385 million through 22,000 establishments. The
value increased by 76 per cent between 1965 and 1974 reach an estimated
figure of £678 million.
Multiples and
Large Establish¬
ments
Retail
Co-operative
Societies
According to the 1971 Census of Distribution there were over 66,300 shops
owned by multiples (including multiple department stores) in 1971 with a total
turnover of over £6,000 million. In 1966 there had been nearly 74,000 shops
with sales of just under £4,000 million. The fall in numbers, combined with
the increase in sales, reflects the trend for individual shops to become larger
and handle a greater volume of sales. In 1971 t^ie multip^es share of total
turnover was about 38-6 per cent, compared with 34-5 per cent in 1966.
The share in total retail turnover of co-operative stores dropped from 11 to 9
per cent between 1961 and 1966 and fell again between 1966 and 1971 when it
was 7 per cent. Their share of sales from food shops was 12 per cent compared
with 18 per cent in 1961 and 15 per cent in 1966. Total sales of the retail co¬
operative societies in 1971 amounted to over £1,100 million.
The retail co-operative societies are voluntary organisations controlled by
their members. Membership is open to anyone paying a small deposit on a
minimum share, which entitles the member to an equal voice with other
members in the society. Share investment by individual members is limited
to £1,000 (less in some societies) and only a low rate of interest is normally
paid on the shares. One large society has introduced a scheme of bonus shares
carrying a higher rate of interest than the ordinary shares.
Traditionally the trading surplus was paid out to members in the form of a
dividend in proportion to their purchases. A large number of societies,
accounting for over four-fifths of total co-operative sales, have introduced
dividend stamps redeemable for cash, other goods, or credit to a share account,
at different redemption rates.
In March 1975 there were about 230 retail co-operative societies.

Independent shops have been giving ground gradually in the face of increased
competition from the larger undertakings. The number of independent shops
fell by about 9 per cent between 1961 and 1966, but the decline has been partly
reduced by the existence of voluntary buying groups (see p. 249) and between
1966 and 1971 the number fell by only 3 per cent. Although the independent
shops’ share of trade continued to fall—to 54-3 per cent—they still play an
important role, often in terms of convenience, service, and range of goods
stocked. The proprietors of some smaller shops have other means of livelihood.
Department stores were defined for the purposes of the census as having 25 or
more persons engaged in selling a wide range of commodities, notably clothing
and household goods.
There were 818 department stores in Britain in 1971 with a turnover of
£950 million: 242 were owned by multiples; 343 by independents; and 233,
with a turnover of nearly £160 million, by co-operative societies. Between
1966 and 1971 sales by department stores rose by some 45-5 per cent.
The development of self-service trading has been a feature of the last two
decades. In 1971 there were over 28,000 stores operating wholly or partly
on self-service lines, compared with about 9,500 towards the end of 1961 and
fewer than 500 in 1950. This development has been accompanied by a trend to
larger shops in terms of both floor space and staff, though the number of staff
per square foot of floor space has tended to decrease.
Supermarkets are defined as self-service shops with a minimum selling area
of 2,000 square feet. There were about 870 supermarkets in 1961, according

to the Census of Distribution; by 1971 it was estimated that there were some
4,800, handling nearly one-third of all retail food.
The number of very large stores, generally known as ‘hypermarkets’ or ‘super¬
stores’, is increasing. With over 50,000 square feet of selling space they
operate on supermarket lines but with a much wider range of goods. They
are generally associated with exclusive car-parking facilities and situated away
from established central shopping areas.
Mail order trading, which was one of the most rapidly growing forms of selling
in Britain between 1961 and 1966, slowed its growth rate between 1966 and
1971, although the increase in sales over that period was still strong (48 per
cent). Turnover was £633 million in ip?1* when it accounted for nearly 4 per
cent of total retail sales.
Some 31,790 mobile shops and market stalls were reported in the Census of
Distribution for 1971, with sales amounting to £147 million. Scotland (where
the density of population is lower than in England) accounted for nearly
25 per cent of this turnover, compared with 10 per cent of all retail sales. Co¬
operative societies accounted for 39 per cent of sales through mobile food
shops, against 12 per cent in ordinary food shops. Mobile shops were mainly
concerned with food sales; about two-fifths were travelling grocers, and
greengrocers and butchers each accounted for over one-fifth. Only a small
proportion were non-food shops, and these specialised mainly in paraffin sup¬
plies and hardware.
New forms of vending machines have come to the fore since 1955. Organisa¬
tions operating automatic vending machines (not otherwise engaged in retail
trade) numbered 65 in 1971, and sales from machines totalled nearly £12
million. In 1966 the turnover consisted of £6 million on sales of cigarettes and
tobacco, £2 million on confectionery, £2-5 million on hot and cold beverages
and £0-5 million on prepared foodstuffs and other commodities.
Forms of consumer sales promotion include reduced price offers, competi¬
tions, gift schemes, and stamp trading. Trading stamps are normally exchanged
for goods but, by law, have to be marked with a cash value and, where their
aggregate value is £0-25 or more, redeemed for cash on request.
The credit card is widely used in Britain. The cards enable users to have
their signatures accepted on bills in participating shops, hotels and restaurants.
The issuers, which include banks, then meet the bills and recover the money
from the card-holder through a single account presented periodically.
Sales by the 28 manufacturing and importing companies which are members
of the Direct Sales and Service Association Limited and which sell all their
products directly to consumers amounted to about £350 million in 1974.
About 2-1 million people were employed in trades offering a service directly
to the public in 1974.
There were over 170,700 establishments concerned with catering (defined to
include public houses, canteens and fish and chip shops, as well as licensed
hotels and restaurants) in 1973. There were 200 catering organisations and
over 20,000 industrial and office canteens. In addition, about 100,000 offices
and factories have installed coin-operated beverage and snack machines.

The value of total turnover of all caterers in 1974 was £4,306 million, an
increase of 70 per cent over the 1969 figure. Turnover of hotels and holiday
camps increased by 87 per cent to £763 million and that of public houses by
73 per cent to £2,334 million.
In 1971 there were over 8,400 laundry, launderette, dry cleaning and towel,
linen and overalls hiring organisations. Turnover in 1971 amounted to some
£212 million.
There were nearly 43,000 businesses in the motor trades in Britain in 1967
with 51,000 establishments and a total turnover of £4,234 million. Between
1967 and 1974 the motor trades’ total turnover increased rapidly by about 107
per cent but in 1974 was only 8 per cent more than in 1973. Of the total
turnover of about £8,800 million in 1974, sales of new vehicles accounted for
some 36 per cent, sales of second-hand vehicles for 14 per cent and other sales
for the remainder.
The 1971 census recorded some 47,200 hairdressing establishments with a
total turnover of £166 million. About two-thirds of the number are ladies’
hairdressers.
In 1971 there were some 5,500 boot and shoe repair establishments, the
number having fallen by over a quarter since 1966; takings in 1971 were £22-4
million, slightly below the 1966 level.
In Britain the expansion of self-service shops, the spread of branded and
standardised products, and developments in partly prepared foods, for
example, ready-washed vegetables and ready-made cake mixes, have all been
major factors in the sweeping changes which have taken place in packaging
methods. Packaging products of paper and board remain the most extensively
used (turnover of some £1,094 million a year), the fastest growing sector being
paper sacks (£79 million in 1974). Other important materials are tinplate,
plastics and glass. New uses are being found for tinplate, especially in sales of
soft drinks and beer. The use of plastics continues to develop; annual sales of
polyethylene film and film products amount to 115,000 tons and 141,000 tons
respectively, while the annual sales of low-density polyethylene bottles has
risen to about 742 million, providing further competition for the traditional
glass bottle.
The rapid growth of sales of household and durable consumer goods, such
as cars, furniture, washing machines, television sets, refrigerators and cookers,
has been greatly helped by instalment purchase (hire-purchase). Total new
credit extended in 1974 amounted to £2,517 million, 12 per cent less than
in 1973 when sales of these goods were very high; about three-fifths was
advanced by retailers and the rest by finance companies.
Hire-purchase in Northern Ireland directly financed by the major finance
houses operating from offices in Northern Ireland amounted in 1974 to £32-8
million.
About £900 million is estimated to have been spent on all forms of advertising
in 1974; as a proportion of the gross national product (1-3 per cent) and of con¬
sumer expenditure (i-8 per cent), it is about the same as it was 15 years ago.
About £579 million was spent on display advertising and £321 million on

classified, financial and industrial advertising. Most of the advertising is carried
out by agencies, which, in some cases, also provide marketing, consumer re¬
search and other services; their representative organisation is the Institute of
Practitioners in Advertising. The trade association for the whole industry,
including agencies, advertisers and media owners, is the Advertising Associa¬
tion. It was responsible for the setting up of the Advertising Standards
Authority, an independent body whose objective is the promotion and en¬
forcement of the highest standards of advertising, in particular through the
British Code of Advertising Practice.
Industry and commerce pay great attention to improving public understand¬
ing of their work and objectives. Many have their own public relations advisers
and staff, while consultancy firms provide general services and assistance for
special public relations activities. Their professional body, founded in 1948,
is the Institute of Public Relations which has some 3,500 members in com¬
merce, industry, the professions, national associations, and central and local
government.
13 Energy and
Natural Resources
Ownership of
Mineral Rights
About half of Britain’s energy requirement is supplied from domestic fuel
minerals (defined, for the purposes of this handbook, as coal, oil and natural
gas), and minerals in general make an important contribution to the economy.
The approximate value of minerals produced in 1974 was £1,719 million, of
which coal contributed 64 per cent and natural gas 9 per cent. The discovery
of commercial oil fields on the British Continental Shelf is likely to increase
the importance of domestically produced fuel minerals to the economy very
considerably. Over the past ten years the production of non-fuel minerals has
been increasing in terms of both value and quantity.
Water resources are sufficient for domestic and industrial requirements;
supplies are obtained partly from surface sources such as mountain lakes and
partly from underground sources by such means as wells and boreholes.
Apart from gold, silver, petroleum, natural gas (which are owned by the
Crown) and coal, all minerals in Great Britain are privately owned. On
Britain’s Continental Shelf the right to exploit all minerals except coal is vested
in the Crown. The exclusive right to extract coal, or license others to do so, both
on land and under the sea, is vested in the National Coal Board. Normally,
ownership of minerals runs with the ownership of the land surface but in some
areas, particularly where mining has taken place, these rights have become
separated. Mining and quarrying, apart from coal, are usually carried out by
privately owned limited liability companies.
ENERGY
Four main primary sources of energy—petroleum, coal, natural gas and
nuclear power—are used in Britain, together with some water power; second¬
ary sources produced from these are electricity, town gas and coke. About
half of all primary energy consumed comes from indigenous sources. Inland
consumption of energy amounted to 331 million tons of coal equivalent
in 1974, 4-4 per cent lower than in 1973. Petroleum accounted for 45 per cent
of consumption, coal 35 per cent, natural gas 15-8 per cent, nuclear power
3-6 per cent and hydro-electric power 0 6 per cent. In 1974 inputs of natural
gas and nuclear electricity increased by 20 per cent and hydro-electric power
4 per cent; petroleum fell by 7 per cent and coal 12 per cent. Trends in
primary energy consumption are shown in Table 18 and in the diagram on
p. 256. The share of oil—almost all of it imported—in total energy consump¬
tion expanded rapidly from under 10 per cent in 1950 to a peak of 48 per
cent in 1972, but has since fallen slightly. It is expected that offshore oil will
supply or even exceed Britain’s oil requirements by the early 1980s when
almost all the energy consumed in Britain could be derived from indigenous
sources. Although coal has accounted for a declining proportion of energy
consumption, a major capital investment programme is planned to end the
contraction of the industry. The share of natural gas in total consumption has
BRITAIN 1976: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
increased substantially, supplies from the North Sea discoveries having
expanded rapidly since the first quantities were piped ashore in 1967. In 1974
natural gas accounted for about 95 per cent of the gas consumed in Britain.
A programme for the establishment of nuclear power stations has been in
progress since 1955 and nuclear power now provides a significant share of
electricity supplies.
Energy consumption by final users in 1974 amounted to some 58,490 million
therms1 on a ‘heat supplied’ basis. Industrial users consumed about 41 per
1 1 therm = 100,000 British thermal units = 25,200 kilocalories.

cent of the total, domestic users 26 per cent, transport 21 per cent, public
services about 6 per cent and agriculture nearly 1-5 per cent. Energy consump¬
tion figures for the main industrial groups are given in Table 19.

The fuel and power industries, with the exception of most of the petroleum
industry and part of that concerned with the extraction of natural gas, are
under public ownership. In 1974 the Department of Energy (see p. 49)
was set up to assume general responsibility for the effective and co-ordinated
development of fuel and power resources in Great Britain; in Scotland the
Secretary of State for Scotland is responsible for electricity. The Govern¬
ment’s energy policy has been to ensure the best use of indigenous resources
and so reduce the dependence on imported oil. The importance of this
approach was illustrated by the shortfall in oil supplies in late 1973 and re¬
inforced by the effect of increased oil prices in 1973-74 on the balance of
trade and the cost of living.

BRITAIN 1976: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
The publicly owned fuel and power industries in Britain employ in total some
600,000 people, or 2-4 per cent of the working population, and their annual
turnover is about £5,800 million. The investment of the various statutory
boards is financed through internal resources and borrowing from the Govern¬
ment (long term), the clearing banks (short term), and from overseas sources
(long term). Research is undertaken by the fuel and fuel-using industries. The
Secretary of State for Energy also has an Advisory Council on Research and
Development. An Energy Technology Support Unit was set up in 1974 to
help the Secretary of State to assess the need for further research into non¬
nuclear forms of energy. A Nuclear Safety Advisory Committee advises on
nuclear safety issues. In each of the publicly owned fuel industries there are
statutory bodies set up to protect the interests of consumers.
Following Britain’s entry into the European Community in 1973 its fuel
industries are co-operating to an increasing extent with those of the other
member countries. The coal industry now conforms to the rules of the
European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC, see p. 78); under the arrange¬
ments for British accession to the ECSC, trade restrictions between the coal
markets of Britain and the other members were removed on 1st January 1973.
A Community energy policy is in the early stages of development; it has the
basic aim of guaranteeing certain and lasting energy supplies under satis¬
factory economic conditions.
Coal has been worked in Britain for over 700 years and an organised coal¬
mining industry has been in existence for over 300 years, some 200 years
longer than in any other country. British coal exports dominated the world
market until about 1910. In 1913—the peak production year—the industry
produced 287 million tons of coal, exported 94 million tons and employed over
a million workers.
In 1947 the coal mines passed into public ownership by means of the Coal
Industry Nationalisation Act 1946, which set up the National Coal Board as
a statutory corporation to manage the industry.
The National Coal Board (NCB) consists of a chairman and between eight
and fourteen members appointed by the Secretary of State for Energy. The
NCB has, with minor exceptions, exclusive rights over the extraction of coal
in Great Britain, but is empowered to license private operators to work small
mines and open-cast sites. It has no monopoly in distribution, and retail sales
remain largely in private hands, although it makes bulk sales to large industrial
consumers.
Two holding companies, wholly owned by the NCB, came into operation in
1973 to run the NCB’s non-mining activities. NCB (Ancillaries) Limited is
responsible for certain retail fuel distribution operations, computer services,
and engineering services. NCB (Coal Products) Limited is responsible for
solid smokeless fuel manufacture, and chemical and by-products plants. It is
also responsible for the NCB’s North Sea exploration although this will be¬
come the responsibility of the British National Oil Corporation (see p. 267).
The Secretary of State has power to issue general directions to the board on
matters affecting the national interest, and to authorise borrowings to finance
capital investment.
At the end of March 1975 there were 246 NCB collieries in operation, each
on average producing some 466,100 tons of coal, compared with 192,000 tons
in 1947. Of these, 243 were grouped into 12 areas, each controlled by a director

responsible to the NCB. The remaining three collieries (in Kent) are controlled
by a general manager who is also responsible to the NCB.
Total consumption of coal (including exports) was 127-2 million tons in the
year ended March 1975, an increase of 4-7 per cent over the previous year.
Between 1947 and 1956 coal consumption in Britain increased by an average
annual rate of nearly 4 million tons; sales fell sharply, however, between
1956 and 1959 and the decline in demand continued throughout the 1960s
and early 1970s. Growing competition from oil, increasing efficiency in the
use of coal and reduced requirements of the gas, steel, railway transport and
other industries contributed to the fall in demand. However, the competitive¬
ness of coal in the domestic energy market was improved by the greatly
increased price of oil.
Consumption by the electricity industry has increased by about 3 per cent
since 1964-65 to 71-5 million tons in 1974-75 when the industry accounted for
about 57 per cent of total coal consumption. Consumption in coke ovens
has remained fairly steady but the requirements of most other classes of
consumer have declined. Coke ovens consume 16-2 per cent but only a further
20-5 per cent is consumed by industrial and domestic users combined. Con¬
sumption by the gas industry has fallen rapidly to less than o-i per cent of the
total. The fall in consumption of coal by domestic users has been slightly
offset by increased purchases of solid smokeless fuels.
Exports of coal and coal briquettes in 1974-75 were 2-1 million tons,
almost all of which went to Western European countries. In 1974 imports
amounted to 3-6 million tons.
Total deep-mined and open-cast output in 1974-75 was 125-2 million tons,
an increase of 16-9 per cent compared with 1973-74. The fall in demand
during the 1950s and 1960s was accompanied by increases in productivity in
the industry and resulted in a rundown of the labour force at NCB mines from
some 700,000 in 1947 to 248,800 in March 1975. Productivity as a whole has
risen by over three-quarters since 1961 to 2-3 tons per manshift in 1974-75; at
the coal face it has more than doubled over the last 20 years to 7-8 tons per man¬
shift in 1974-75. The increases have been obtained largely by concentration

on the more productive mines and faces, by the extension of mechanisation
to nearly all coal faces and by the use of multi-shift working.
Other important measures which have contributed to increased produc¬
tivity include new techniques for obtaining information about the reserves
before they are worked, intensive training of management and men to obtain
the maximum utilisation of equipment on highly mechanised faces, the in¬
creasing use of underground communications systems, the use of higher horse¬
power machines and improvements in the mechanised handling of coal below
ground and on the surface.
Table 20 shows the main trends in the industry since 1965.
The NCB raises capital, including working capital, by borrowing from the
Secretary of State for Energy or with his consent and the approval of the
Treasury from overseas sources. Within certain limits the board may also,
with the permission of the Secretary of State for Energy, borrow temporarily
(by way of overdraft or otherwise).
Under the Coal Industry Act 1973 some £450 million, being the NCB’s
accumulated deficit at the end of March 1973 together with the amount by
which the board’s capital assets were overvalued, was written off; the statu¬
tory limit on the NCB’s borrowing was initially set at £550 million (it was
later raised to £700 million) and a limit of £50 million was imposed on the
NCB’s accumulated deficit to be increased to £100 million if necessary. The
Act also provided for government assistance to the industry in the form of
improved redundancy terms and various operational grants. In 1974-75
grants of £68-2 million were paid under the Coal Industry Acts and comprised
social grants j£i3'8 million, contribution to increased pensions £8-3 million,
coking coal subsidies million, stocking aid million and regional
grants ^37-8 million. In the year ended March 1975 the NCB made an
operating profit of about £34 million.
In 1974 the Government, the NCB and the coalmining trade unions carried
out a tripartite study of the policy towards the coal industry. As a result the
Government accepted the board’s Plan for Coal as a general strategy for
the following ten years, involving maintenance of deep-mined capacity at the
annual level of around 120 million tons and an increase in open-cast produc¬
tion to 15 million tons a year. Plan for Coal involves new capital investment of
some £600 million over the period to 1985 in order to provide 42 million
tons of new capacity to replace that lost by depletion. This investment is
over and above the requirements of some £70 million to £80 million a year
for ordinary continuing capital expenditure. The Government has given an
assurance that short-term fluctuations in the price and availability of com¬
peting fuels should not be allowed to interfere with the implementation of
the programme.
Although many good seams of coal have now been worked out due to the
early development of the industry, there are still some 100,000 million tons
of known coal deposits, of which about 4,000 million tons are estimated to be
economically viable. A new mine is planned to exploit the Selby coalfield in
North Yorkshire where total reserves are estimated at 1,000 million tons.
Exploration in the Selby area is part of a national programme to prove new
reserves either for the establishment of new mines or to extend existing
collieries as part of the NCB’s plan to maintain total output. Major schemes
in progress include a £13 million plan to expand coking coal pits in east
Durham, a £6 million plan to build a new mine at Betws (Dyfed) and a

Northumberland, the world’s biggest undersea mining complex. Many
collieries on the north-east coast of England are being equipped to extend their
operations offshore under the sea bed. The main coal-bearing areas are shown
on the map on p. 259.
The NCB has two research organisations: a Coal Research Establishment,
at Stoke Orchard, Gloucestershire, concerned with the processing and
utilisation of coal; and a Mining Research and Development Establishment,
near Bretby, Derbyshire, for research on mining methods and equipment,
the underground environment and coal preparation. There are also scientific
control staff in the coalfields and a large operational research organisation.
The NCB, with the British Steel Corporation and others, supports research
on carbonisation at the British Carbonisation Research Association. Much of
the work of other bodies, such as the Safety in Mines Research Establishment
(SMRE) (see p. 357), is closely related to the board’s problems; the SMRE
carries out research on explosions and fires, pneumoconiosis, engineering and
metallurgy. In 1974-75 the NCB spent £8-3 million on research.
Seismic prospecting in the British sector of the Continental Shelf for natural
gas and oil has been going on since the early 1960s and full-scale exploration
activities since 1964, following the enactment of the Continental Shelf Act
1964 and the subsequent award of a first round of licences. Further licences
were issued in 1965, 1970-71 and 1971-72. The total area now under licence
is 41,133 square miles (106,55° square kilometres) out of a total area, over
which Britain has exercised its rights to explore and exploit the seabed and
subsoil, of over 223,400 square miles (579,000 square kilometres).
Work on the development and production of natural gas and oil discovered
in the British sector of the Continental Shelf is proceeding rapidly. By the end j
of 1974, 424 exploration or appraisal wells and 217 production wells had been
drilled; of these 96 and 24 respectively were drilled in 1974. The total number
of drilling rigs used rose from 25 in 1973 to 39 in 1974 and the maximum
number of rigs in use at any one time rose from 18 to 29.
Public supply of gas in Britain dates from 1807, when Pall Mall, London, was
first lighted with gas. In 1812 the London and Westminster Gas Light and
Coke Company received a Royal Charter to supply gaslight in London. In
the early years of the industry gas was used almost exclusively for lighting.
However, between the two world wars it was displaced from this function by
electricity and it is now mainly used for cooking and heating purposes,
supplying i3-6 million customers.
The Gas Act of 1948 brought the industry in Great Britain, in which about
100,000 people are at present employed, under public ownership and control
in 1949. The industry’s structure was adapted under the Gas Act 1972 to take
account of the change from manufactured to natural gas necessitating more
centralised control of production and transmission. The British Gas Corpora¬
tion came into operation in 1973 taking the place of the Gas Council, the
former central co-ordinating body in the industry, and assuming the responsi¬
bilities of the 12 area gas boards formerly carrying out the local manufacture
and the distribution of gas to consumers. Members of the corporation are
appointed by the Secretary of State for Energy. In connection with its main
duty of developing and maintaining an efficient, co-ordinated and economical

system of gas supply and of satisfying reasonable demands for gas, it has
powers: to search for and extract natural gas and any petroleum discovered in
the course of searching for gas; to manufacture or acquire, transmit and dis¬
tribute gas; to manufacture, supply, or sell by-products; and to manufacture,
install, maintain or remove gas plant and fittings.
In Northern Ireland the gas supply industry remains in the hands of a
number of municipal undertakings and statutory and non-statutory com¬
panies.
The main single source of gas in Britain is now natural gas, supplied either
directly (over 90 per cent) or as feedstock for town gas manufacture, and
accounting for about 95 per cent of total gas supplies. Between 1969 and 1974
the quantity of gas available increased by over 140 per cent to 13,430 million
therms.
The first commercial gas discovery in the British sector of the North Sea
was made in 1965. Five major gasfields are now in production: Leman Bank,
West Sole, Hewett, Indefatigable and Viking. Two other fields, Rough and
Frigg, the large field which straddles the boundary between the British and
Norwegian sectors, are expected to come into production in 1975 and 1977
respectively. Gas produced in association with oil in the Brent field is expected
to be available in 1979-80. Gas has also been found in a number of smaller
structures and in association with oil in a number of other fields; exploration
is continuing. Total proven gas reserves from discoveries made in the British
sector of the Continental Shelf up to the end of 1974 amounted to 26-9
million million cubic feet (762,000 million cubic metres) and total possible
reserves amounted to 44’4 million million cubic feet (i-2 million million
cubic metres). The consequent reduction in manufactured gas supplies has
led to the closure of many gasworks; there were 50 in March 1975, compared
with 246 in March 1965. Some town gas manufacturing plant has been
adapted for producing substitute natural gas (SNG). The British Gas Corpora¬
tion is undertaking various coal gasification projects at its Westfield (Fife)
Development Centre in collaboration with groups of sponsors. During 1974-
75 SNG was successfully produced from coal and some was supplied to
customers in parts of south-east Scotland.
The pipeline system commissioned in 1964 for the delivery of liquefied
natural gas from Algeria has been expanded to form a national high-pressure
pipeline system for transmission of natural gas derived mainly from British
fields in the North Sea. The first pipeline to deliver natural gas to the shore,
at Easington in Humberside, was put on flow in Since then further
pipelines have been laid to bring natural gas to the terminals at Bacton,
Norfolk, and Theddlethorpe, Lincolnshire. By March 1975 some 2,240 miles
(3,605 kilometres) of pipeline were in operation. The central transmission
system is supplied by eight feeder mams from the three North Sea shore
terminals, and from the Canvey Island terminal for liquefied Algerian gas.
Investigations are being made into projects involving various methods of
storage of natural gas to meet peak load conditions. Liquefaction and storage
facilities for natural gas have been constructed near Coatbridge, Strathclyde,
and other facilities are under construction or planned.
The British Gas Corporation is constructing a terminal at St. Fergus,
Grampian, for the reception of gas from the Frigg field and some 550 miles

(885 kilometres) of new transmission pipelines will be laid to bring the gas
into the national network. A phased programme of converting all gas appli¬
ances is nearly complete. About 90 per cent of consumers had had their
appliances converted at the end of March 1975- ^ expected that the switch
over to natural gas will be completed by late 1977.
Over half of all gas sold by the British Gas Corporation is for industrial and
commercial purposes and the remainder for household use. Total consump¬
tion increased steadily during the 1960s and has risen rapidly during the
1970s. Sales reached 12,634 rnillion therms in i974> JSS per cent more than
in 1969.
Gas has traditionally been used extensively in industries which require the
control of temperatures to a fine degree of accuracy, for example, in the
pottery industry and in certain processes in the manufacture of iron and steel
products. Natural gas not required by the fixed tariff domestic, commercial
and small industrial markets is being used in bulk fuel markets and as a
chemical feedstock. In 1974 sales of gas to industry totalled 6,011 million
therms, 24 per cent more than in 1973 > sales to commercial users increased
by 17 per cent to 1,263 million therms.
The domestic load includes gas for cookers, space heaters, water heaters and
refrigerators, but an increasingly large part of domestic demand is for gas for
central heating. In 1974, 5,360 million therms were sold to domestic users,
11 per cent more than in 1973.
The borrowing limit for the British Gas Corporation has been fixed by the
Gas Act 1972 at £2>500 million, to be raised by order if necessary up to
£2’700 million. Within this limit the corporation may borrow (long term)
from various sources.
Capital investment expanded sharply in the mid-1960s to meet the de¬
velopment of natural gas from the North Sea, reaching a peak of £282 million
(excluding investment in subsidiary companies) in 1967-68. Subsequently
capital nee'ds have been at a lower level and the corresponding level of invest¬
ment in 1974-75 totalled £216 million.
The British Gas Corporation has a research committee which advises on
research policy at four research stations which are each responsible for a
different area of work. Research is also done on behalf of the corporation at a
number of universities and colleges. The corporation’s total expenditure on
research, development and testing amounted to nearly £12 million in 1974-75.
The petroleum industry in Britain dates back to 1850, when Dr. James Young,
a Glasgow chemist, succeeded in obtaining lamp oil and lubricants from
natural mineral oil occurring in the Derbyshire coal measures. The Scottish
shale deposits, yielding similar products, were first worked in 1858 and ceased
production in 1962. With the rapid growth of oil consumption during this
century, however, Britain has become almost totally dependent on imported
supplies. With the recent discoveries of oil in the British sector of the North
Sea Britain has the opportunity to reduce or even eliminate this dependence.
The first important find of oil in the British sector, the Forties field, was made
in 1970. Oil from the field, believed to be one of the largest in the world, is to

be brought ashore by a 105-mile (169-kilometre) submarine pipeline. A
further 12 commercial fields have been discovered and several other signi¬
ficant finds may prove to be commercial after further appraisal. The first oil
from the British sector was brought ashore by tanker from the Argyll field
in June 1975- The Forties, Beryl and Auk fields are also expected to start
production in 1975.
Latest government estimates indicate a production rate in 1980 of between
100 million and 130 million tons a year from existing fields and allowing for
further discoveries. Proven reserves of the commercial fields amount to 995
million tons but possible reserves from present and future finds under existing
licences total 3>I0o million tons. The total reserves of the designated areas of
the British Continental Shelf could amount to 4,500 million tons.

The Government is negotiating for a majority stake in existing commercial oil¬
fields. A British National Oil Corporation (BNOC) will be established to hold
the Government’s participation interest in production licences and to take
over the North Sea oil interests of the National Coal Board. It will have
powers to extend its activities to the refining and distribution of oil. The
Government is also taking powers to control the level of production and to
provide for a tighter control of exploration and development. The Govern¬
ment’s revenue from petroleum operations on the British Continental Shelf
will be derived from a new petroleum revenue tax (see p. 367), corporation
tax, royalties and revenues accruing to the BNOC from participation.
The Department of Energy’s Offshore Supplies Office seeks to ensure that
British industry can compete effectively for orders for offshore equipment
by helping firms to identify the needs of offshore operators, assisting operators
to identify British suppliers of offshore equipment and services, and pro¬
moting new ventures to increase British involvement in the industry.
Annual production of crude oil from land-based oilfields in Britain now
totals some 86,000 tons. Prospecting for crude petroleum has so far led to
the establishment of several small oilfields, notably in Nottinghamshire
(Egmanton and Bothamsall), in Leicestershire (Plungar), in Lincolnshire
(Gainsborough) and in Dorset (Kimmeridge and Wareham).
British and British-Dutch oil companies have been responsible for developing
the oil resources of many countries to mutual advantage, especially in the
Middle East, Far East, Africa and Caribbean areas.
Today production by these companies amounts to about 11 per cent of total
world production and they operate a tanker fleet (partly owned by them and
partly on charter) amounting to over one-tenth of the world’s tanker tonnage.
(British registered tanker tonnage is 12 per cent of the world’s total.)
In 1974 Britain’s net imports of crude oil were no-8 million tons valued
at £,3^20 million, the largest single item among imported products. Saudi
Arabia supplied approximately 32 per cent, Kuwait 15 per cent, Iran 13 per
cent in Libya 8 per cent. Other major suppliers were Nigeria, Qatar and Abu
Dhabi.
Deliveries of petroleum products for inland consumption (excluding refinery
consumption) in 1974 totalled 91'4 million tons, 7 per cent lower than in 1973.
Deliveries included 367 million tons of fuel oil, 18-8 million tons of gas and
diesel oil (including derv fuel used in road vehicles), 16-2 million tons of
motor spirit, 6-4 million tons of kerosene and 2-2 million tons of bitumen.

The most important uses of gas and diesel oils in 1974 were f°r road
vehicles and non-industrial central heating. Electricity generation accounted
for 38 per cent of fuel od consumption, followed by the iron and steel industry
with 9 per cent, and non-industrial central heating with a further 6 per cent.
Of the remainder, the largest users were the chemical, paper-making, glass,
engineering and textile industries.
Before 1939 three-quarters of Britain’s supply of petroleum products was
refined overseas, as it was considered more economic to refine at the source of
production. Following the second world war refineries were mostly sited in the
consuming areas, but there have recently been proposals for the construction
of large refineries in some producer countries.
In 1975 gross refinery capacity in Britain amounted to about 150 million
tons a year. Of the 22 refineries in operation, five have a capacity of under
1 million tons. The 15 largest are situated at Fawley, near Southampton
(18-5 million tons); Stanlow, in Cheshire (18 million tons); Isle of Grain
(10-7 million tons), Shell Haven (10 million tons), and Coryton (8 5 million
tons), all three on the Thames Estuary; Teesport (6-3 million tons) and North
Tees (4-9 million tons), both in Cleveland; Grangemouth, Central Scotland
(87 million tons); three at Milford Haven (15-2 million tons, 5-1 million tons
and 5 million tons) and one at Pembroke (9-3 million tons) in Dyfed;
Llandarcy near Swansea (8-2 million tons); and two at Killingholme near
Grimsby (9-6 million tons and 4-2 million tons). The other two refineries
are at Belfast (1-5 million tons) and Ellesmere, Merseyside (1-4 million tons).
Proposals for further refineries are under consideration at Cliffe (Kent),
Canvey Island (Essex) and in Scotland.
Output of refined products (excluding refineries’ own consumption) fell by
3 per cent in 1974 to 101-4 million tons. There is a substantial external
trade in refined products which tends to follow trading and seasonal require¬
ments and the commercial arrangements of the major oil companies. Exports
from Britain, mainly in the form of heavier products to other European
countries, were valued at £664 million in 1974. Imports of refined products
amounted to £681 million.
Four main crude oil pipelines are in operation in Britain between harbours
capable of berthing very large tankers and refineries: in central Scotland, from
Finnart to Grangemouth; in south Wales, from Angle Bay, Milford Haven, to
Llandarcy; in north-west England, from Tranmere to Stanlow and Heysham;
and in the Humber area from a single buoy mooring in the Humber estuary
to Killingholme. A fifth, from an offshore mooring, off Amlwch, Gwynedd, to
Stanlow is under construction (see p. 314). A 131-mile (211-kilometre) pipe¬
line has been built from Cruden Bay, Grampian, to Grangemouth, for od from
the Forties field in the North Sea. Pipelines also carry refined products to
major marketing areas; for example, from the Humber to the Manchester
area from Fawley to Staines, Surrey, and Heathrow Airport, London, and
from the Isle of Grain to Walton-on-Thames and Heathrow Airport. A
245-mile (394-kilometre) pipeline feeds refined products to north London
and the Midlands from refineries and installations on the Thames and
Mersey; a similar line 300 miles (480 kilometres) long from Milford Haven to
the Midlands and Manchester is in operation. The pipeline from Fawley to
Severnmouth originally used for ethylene has been extended to Avonmouth
and is now used for refined products. Pipelines carrying petrochemical feed¬
stocks run from Stanlow to Carrington, near Manchester, and from Teesside

to Fleetwood, Lancashire, and Runcorn, Cheshire. The Pipelines Act 1962 is
designed to secure the orderly development of privately owned industrial
pipelines.
Research into problems of petroleum technology is carried out mainly by the
leading oil companies, which have also endowed research at the universities
on a substantial scale. Research centres are situated at Sunbury-on-Thames
(the British Petroleum Company), Chester, and Woodstock in Kent (Shell),
and Abingdon, in Oxfordshire (Esso). The first of these covers the full range
of petroleum research and development, from geology and production to
product utilisation and petroleum chemicals. In general, the remainder are
concerned with the evolution of new and improved fuels and lubricants
and the development of new uses for petroleum products and of new
products based on petroleum, especially chemicals, but also including new
sources of protein.
A public supply of electricity was first provided in Britain in 1881, at Godai¬
ming, Surrey. From its earliest days a measure of public control has been a
feature of the industry. In 1919 the Electricity Commissioners were created as
a supervisory body and to promote reorganisation on a national scale through
voluntary agreement. In 1926 the Central Electricity Board was set up to
construct and operate a national grid inter-connecting individual power
stations, thus co-ordinating generation and transmission. In 1943 the North of
Scotland Hydro-Electric Board (NSHEB) was established as a public corpora¬
tion to develop the water-power resources of the Highlands. In 1948 all
municipal and private undertakings (other than those in Northern Ireland)
were acquired under the Electricity Act 1947 and vested in the British Elec¬
tricity Authority and 14 regional boards, except in the north of Scotland where
they became the responsibility of the NSHEB. Two subsequent Acts (1954
and 1957) effected a measure of decentralisation and gave the industry its
present structure. Electricity supply employs about 195,000 people, including
6,600 in Northern Ireland.
In England and Wales, electricity is generated and transmitted by the Central
Electricity Generating Board (CEGB) and distributed by 12 separate area
electricity boards; co-ordination is effected by the Electricity Council. In
Scotland, two boards—the NSHEB and the South of Scotland Electricity
Board (SSEB)—generate, distribute and sell electricity. In Northern Ireland
these functions are carried out by the Northern Ireland Electricity Service.
The Electricity Council is the central body of the supply industry with a
general responsibility for promoting electricity supply and for advising the
Secretary of State for Energy; it is also responsible for a number of common
services, principally capital financing, research and industrial relations. The
council consists of a chairman and two deputy chairmen, the chairman and
two designated members of the CEGB, the chairmen of the 12 area electricity
boards and not more than three other members. The CEGB controls the
operation and maintenance of power stations and the main transmission
system (the national grid) and supplies electricity in bulk to the 12 area boards.
The CEGB consists of a chairman, a deputy chairman and between six and
eight members. Each of the 12 area electricity boards acquires bulk supplies
of electricity from the CEGB and is responsible for distribution networks
and sales of electricity to its area consumers. The Secretary of State for

Energy appoints the chairmen, deputy chairmen and members of the Elec¬
tricity Council, the CEGB, and the area boards; approves each board’s
capital development programme and the industry’s research programme;
and approves, in consultation with the Treasury, the industry’s borrowing
requirements. A committee of inquiry is examining the structure of the
electricity supply industry in England and Wales.
The boundary separating the areas covered by the two Scottish boards runs
roughly from Dumbarton on the Firth of Clyde to Newburgh on the Firth of
Tay. Members of both boards are appointed by the Secretary of State for
Scotland; each board comprises a chairman and between four and eight
members, one of whom is the chairman of the other board. The Secretary of
State s responsibilities in relation to the boards are similar to those of the
Secretary of State for Energy in England and Wales.
In Northern Ireland electricity is generated at power stations in Belfast and
at Ballylumford and Coolkeeragh. The Northern Ireland Electricity Service
came into operation in 1973 as the result of the amalgamation of four former
electricity undertakings.
Most of the CEGB’s output capacity (about 68 per cent) is accounted for by
coal-fired steam generating stations. Oil-fired stations account for 17 per
cent and nuclear power stations for about another 6 per cent. The remainder
is made up of natural gas, gas turbine, diesel and hydro-electric plant. Nuclear
energy has become increasingly important since 1965. Water power resources
are relatively small and in remote areas.
Generation for the public supply in Britain reached 250,500 gigawatt
hours1 (GWh) in 1974; conventional steam power stations provided 86 per
cent of the total and nuclear and hydro-electric stations about 12 per cent and
2 per cent respectively. A high rate of expansion of output was a feature of the
industry in its earliest years, but the rate has slackened recently and the total
of electricity generated in 1974 was 3 per cent lower than in 1973.
The output capacity of the generating stations of the electricity boards in
Britain at the end of 1974 totalled 69,011 megawatts (MW), an increase of
2 per cent on the previous year. Between 1965 and 1974 over 30,000 MW of
output capacity was commissioned in England and Wales, including 1,735 MW
in 1974, bringing total output capacity to 59,451 MW. The SSEB’s total
installed capacity in 1974 was over 6,100 MW and the NSHEB’s total installed
capacity is about 2,150 MW. In Northern Ireland total generating capacity
was 1,909 MW in 1974, of which some 1,425 MW was installed in oil-fired
stations and the remainder in coal-fired stations.
Generation of electricity outside the public supply system is relatively small
—22,772 GWh in 1974. The major sources outside the fuel industries them¬
selves are the chemical, engineering, paper, and iron and steel industries
and the nuclear power plants of the Atomic Energy Authority and British
Nuclear Fuels Ltd.
An analysis of electricity generation in Great Britain is given in Table 21.
The electricity authorities account for 57 per cent of the British consumption
of coal and about 19 per cent of the consumption of oil.
Oil-fired stations of 2,000 MW have been commissioned at Fawley, on
1 One gigawatt hour = one million kilowatt hours = 1,000 megawatt hours.

at Pembroke, Dyfed. Other oil-fired stations are under construction at
Grain, Kent (3,300 MW), Inverkip, Strathclyde (1,980 MW), Littlebrook,
Kent (1,980 MW), Kilroot, near Carrickfergus (1,200 MW), and Ince,
Cheshire (1,000 MW).
A dual-fired station to burn either coal or oil has been commissioned at
Kingsnorth, Kent, two stations involving some 1,550 MW of plant have
been converted to dual natural gas/coal-firing and the station at Peterhead,
Grampian (1,320 MW), due to be commissioned in 1978, will burn natural
gas as well as oil. Average thermal efficiency (that is, the ratio of the electrical
energy output to the heat energy input of the fuel consumed) of conventional
steam stations in England and Wales rose from 2075 per cent in 1947 to
30 56 per cent in 1974-75 as new plant was brought into use. The 20 most
efficient stations, containing much of the newest plant, had an average thermal
efficiency of 33-87 per cent in 1974-75.
Striking advances have been made in the design of steam-generating plant.
The installation of 49 single-shaft units of 500 MW in 14 stations has been
substantially completed. Station capacities are also increasing. Ten stations,
each with capacities of 2,000 MW, with four 500 MW single-shaft generating
units, are now in service. Two 660 MW single-shaft generating units have been
commissioned and a third has been synchronised at Drax, North Yorkshire.
Some 23 660 MW units are on order for installation: five for Grain, three
each for Littlebrook and Inverkip, two for Peterhead, and two each for five
nuclear power stations under construction (for locations see map, p. 270).
A 2,400 MW station at Longannet, Fife, with four 600 MW cross-compound
units, was commissioned in 1970.
Large gas turbine units of 55 MW and 70 MW, based on aero jet engines,
have been introduced since 1965 for peak load operation. The CEGB and
SSEB have installed 1,035 MW of such units including two 58 MW units at
Leicester powered by industrial gas turbines and the CEGB plans to install a
further 3,600 MW. Many others of 17 to 35 MW capacity are being used in
new stations to safeguard the auxiliary supplies to the large new steam units,
and also to provide capacity for peak operation.
In 1974 nuclear power stations provided some 29,400 GWh of electricity or
12 per cent of Britain’s electricity generation by the public supply system.
ENERGY AND NATURAL RESOURCES

Britain has so far produced about 30 per cent of total world generation from
nuclear sources. Nuclear capacity forms about 6 per cent of total output
capacity of the public supply system.
The stations that generate nuclear electricity are owned by various authori¬
ties. The original prototypes built by the Atomic Energy Authority (AEA) at
Calder Hall, Cumbria (198 MW)—the first in the world to generate electricity
on a commercial scale—and at Chapelcross, Dumfries and Galloway (198
MW), are owned and operated by British Nuclear Fuels Ltd. (see p. 412). This
company (along with The Radiochemical Centre Ltd.) was set up in 1971 and
took over from the AEA the manufacture and processing of nuclear fuels for
Britain and other countries. A new single company, the National Nuclear
Corporation, has been set up with government encouragement to design and
construct steam supply systems for nuclear power stations and has acquired
the two previous design and construction consortia. The corporation has
established an operating subsidiary known as the Nuclear Power Company.
The AEA has four experimental or prototype stations which feed electricity
into the national grid: the Advanced Gas-Cooled Reactor (AGR) at Wind-
scale, Cumbria (32 MW); the Steam Generating Heavy Water Reactor
(SGHWR) at Winfrith, Dorset (100 MW); and the experimental fast breeder
reactor (15 MW) and the Prototype Fast Reactor (PER) (250 MW) at Dounreay,
Highland.
Most of Britain’s nuclear-generated electricity is, however, supplied by
stations owned and operated by the electricity authorities. These, like Calder
Hall and Chapelcross, are all magnox stations—graphite-moderated, carbon-
dioxide cooled, using natural uranium metal fuel elements canned in mag¬
nesium alloy. Under the first commercial programme, originally announced
in 1955 but since twice modified, nine magnox stations with a total design
capacity of 4,500 MW were in operation by 1972: Berkeley, in Gloucester¬
shire (276 MW design capacity), and Bradwell, in Essex (300 MW), were
both commissioned in 1962; Hunterston ‘A’, in Strathclyde (300 MW), in
1964; and in the following year Hinkley Point ‘A’, in Somerset, Trawsfynydd,
in Gwynedd (both 500 MW), and Dungeness ‘A’, in Kent (550 MW); Sizewell
‘A’, in Suffolk (580 MW), was commissioned in 1966; and Oldbury, in Avon
(600 MW), in 1968. A ninth station, Wylfa, in Gwynedd (1,180 MW), was
commissioned in 1971.
Under a second programme announced in 1964 and extended in 1965, a
further five stations were planned which, when commissioned over the next
three to four years, will provide over 6,000 MW of further capacity. The
reactor design chosen for the programme is based on the AGR at Windscale,
a logical development of the magnox system, which uses slightly enriched
uranium dioxide fuel canned in stainless steel. AGR stations under construc¬
tion are Dungeness ‘B’ (1,200 MW); and Hinkley Point ‘B’, Hunterston ‘B’,
Hartlepool, Cleveland, and Heysham, Lancashire (each of 1,320 MW capacity).
A third programme using the SGHWR was announced in July 1974. In the
initial phase a further 4,000 MW of nuclear capacity, based on reactor units
of 600-660 MW, is planned. This will comprise two SGHWR stations—
Sizewell ‘B’ with four reactor units and Torness (Lothian) with two. It is
intended to build up orders for further nuclear plant steadily from the late
1970s, subject to the success of the initial programme. Commissioning of the
AEA’s large PER (see above) took place during 1975 at Dounreay (where in
1962 the experimental fast reactor became the first of such type to produce
electricity for public use and to operate at a high power level). The fast breeder
reactor is capable of releasing up to 100 times as much energy from uranium

as present nuclear power stations and is of great importance to the long-term
supply of energy.
Hydro-electric generation is confined almost entirely to Scotland and Wales.
Most of the water-power so utilised is drawn from high-level reservoirs with
their own natural catchment areas. The setting up of the NSHEB in 1943
marked the beginning of an era of intensive water-power development in the
Highlands.
In 1974-75, 2,899 GWh were sent out by the NSHEB from water-power,
compared with 322 GWh in 1949. At the end of March 1975 there were 56
main hydro-electric conventional stations in operation in the north of Scotland
with a total installed capacity of 1,052 MW and the largest—the Loch Sloy
station—has a capacity of 130 MW. The Cruachan pumped storage section of
the Awe scheme, with an installed capacity of 400 MW from four reversible-
pump-turbines, came into full operation at the end of 1967- (In pumped-
storage schemes electricity generated in off-peak periods is used to pump
water to higher levels from which it descends at peak periods to operate turbo¬
generators.) A 300 MW pumped-storage project, with two 150 MW reversible-
pump-turbines, at Foyers, Loch Ness, has been commissioned. In addition,
there are stations generating electricity by water power in the south of Scot¬
land (123 MW) and in Wales (470 MW). The latter includes the 360 MW
pumped-storage station at Ffestiniog, Gwynedd. Work has started on a
1,500 MW pumped-storage station at Dinorwic, Gwynedd.
Main electricity transmission lines—the national grid—supply most of the
country. By 31st March 1975 those of the CEGB totalled over 8,015 circuit
miles (12,899 kilometres), of which 6,539 miles (10,523 kilometres) were at
400,000 volts, and 1,476 miles (2,376 kilometres) at 275,000 volts. Primary dis¬
tribution in England and Wales is at 132,000 volts, secondary distribution at
33,000 volts, tertiary at 11,000 volts and general low voltage distribution at
240 volts. In Scotland there were nearly 5,200 circuit miles (8,400 kilometres)
of main transmission lines at the end of March 1975, of which 90 circuit miles
(145 kilometres) operated at 400,000 volts, over 1,900 circuit miles (3,100
kilometres) at 275,000 volts and the remainder at 132,000 volts. Primary
distribution in Scotland is at 33,000 volts. Energy movements on the grid in
England and Wales are controlled through the seven operational areas, set up
for that purpose and distinct from the regions in which the generating side of
the industry is organised; each area has a separate control, and the operations
are co-ordinated by a National Control in London, ff he grid in Scotland is
operated from the control centres at Pitlochry (NSHEB) and at Kirkintilloch
(SSEB).
The development of the grid system has made the British system the largest
fully interconnected power network under unified control in the world. Twin
cross-Channel cables laid between Dungeness and Boulogne, capable of
transmitting up to 160 MW at 200,000 volts (direct current), have been in
operation since 1961; by this means advantage is taken of the differences
between France and Britain in the timing of peak loads.
In England and Wales the area electricity boards distribute to consumers
electricity acquired mainly from the CEGB, supplemented from other sources,
such as industrial plants, and the nuclear power stations of the AEA.
Consumption Total sales of electricity in 1974 amounted to 218,300 GW h, a fall of 3-1 per
cent over the previous year. Domestic users took 42 per cent of the total,

industry 38 per cent and commercial and other users about 20 per cent. About
one-third of domestic sales is for space heating, one-quarter for water heating
and one-tenth for cooking. Up to three-fifths of industrial consumption's for
operating motors, about one-third for heating, metal melting and electro¬
chemistry, and under one-tenth for lighting.
The electricity industry supplies about 21-5 million consumers of whom
about 19 million are in England and Wales; of the remainder 1-5 million are
supplied by the SSEB, 486,000 by the NSHEB and 492,000 by the Northern
Ireland Electricity Service.
Capital expenditure of the electricity supply industry expanded rapidly from
£249 million in 1956 to £720 million in 1966 but has since fallen to ^600
million in 1974-75. About one-half of the industry’s capital requirements has
been financed from internal resources. The statutory limit to borrowings by
the industry in England and Wales is £6,500 million and in Scotland £1,200
million. The Gas and Electricity Act 1968 empowered the industry to borrow
(long term) from overseas sources.
The Electricity Council, in consultation with the Secretary of State for
Energy, is responsible for drawing up a general programme of research,
comprising direct research carried out by the electricity boards themselves,
supported by co-operative research with selected industrial research associa¬
tions and by research contracts placed with universities and other organisations.
The council itself is empowered to conduct research. It is advised by the
Electricity Supply Research Council. Collaboration on research between the
supply industry and the plant manufacturers is co-ordinated by the Power
Engineering Research Steering Committee set up in 1966.
The main research establishments of the industry are run by the CEGB and
comprise the Central Electricity Research Laboratories at Leatherhead,
Surrey, the Berkeley Laboratories in Gloucestershire, concerned with nuclear
problems, and the Engineering Laboratories at Marchwood, on Southampton
Water. Research on distribution technology and electricity utilisation is under¬
taken at the Electricity Council Research Centre at Capenhurst, Cheshire, and
by the area boards.
Both Scottish electricity boards carry out research and experimental work
on their own and in co-operation with other electricity authorities. They
undertake a wide range of research and development work, both independently
and in conjunction with the universities and manufacturers and are associated
with the activities of the Electricity Council and CEGB.
The Government has introduced a large number of measures designed to
conserve energy. It is estimated that voluntary conservation measures could
have saved up to about 2 per cent of Britain’s normal energy consumption in
1974. The Secretary of State for Energy is assisted by proposals on the pro¬
motion of energy efficiency from the Advisory Council on Energy Conserva¬
tion. In addition, efficiency in the use of fuel, among both industrial and
domestic users, is being promoted by various bodies representing producers
and consumers and by the technical advisory services of the fuel and power
industries.
Energy-saving investment in industry is being encouraged by the provision
of financial assistance in the form of government loans. Energy prices have
been increased as a step towards prices reflecting true costs, and value added
tax on petrol has been increased to 25 per cent in order to discourage its

excessive use. Some speed limits have been reduced (see p. 325). The stand¬
ards of thermal insulation required in new dwellings have been doubled.
Improved control equipment, draught-proofing and additional insulation are
being installed in government buildings. Compulsory limits on heating levels
in commercial and industrial buildings and restrictions on the use of electricity
for external display and advertising during daylight hours were introduced
in January 1975.
The Government is discussing with local authorities and other public
bodies the scope for, and methods of achieving, energy saving. The Depart¬
ment of Energy is conducting a major publicity campaign to encourage the
efficient use of energy.
NON-FUEL MINERALS
Although Britain’s requirements of raw materials are met mostly by imports,
non-fuel minerals produced in Britain make a useful contribution to the
economy. Output of non-fuel minerals increased by 5 per cent in terms of
quantity and 58 per cent in terms of value between 1970 and 1974. Capital
expenditure in the non-fuel mining and quarrying industry in 1972 amounted
to £37 million, most of which was on plant and machinery and the remainder
on land and buildings. The total number of employees in the industry was
42,600 in 1974. The geographical locations of some of the more important
minerals produced in Britain are shown on the maps on p. 277.
Under the Mineral Exploration and Investment Grants Act 1972 the Secretary
of State for Industry can encourage exploration for mineral resources by pro¬
viding financial assistance of up to 35 per cent of the cost of searching for
mineral deposits in Great Britain and on Britain’s Continental Shelf, and
evaluating them for commercial purposes. Minerals included in the scheme
are the ores of non-ferrous metals, fluorspar, barium minerals and potash. By
the end of March 1975, 30 companies had sought assistance totalling ^1-5
million in respect of 126 exploration projects, mainly for non-ferrous metals.
Work on 74 projects has been completed. The assistance is to be repaid
with interest if a project leads to the extraction of minerals in commercial
quantities.
An exploration programme aimed at providing preliminary information on
areas with potentially economic mineral deposits in Great Britain is being
undertaken by the Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) on behalf
of the Department of Industry. Under a three-year programme costing
£1-3 million the Institute of Geological Sciences, a component body of NERC,
is carrying out work aimed at providing basic geological information on five
identified areas which may yield economic deposits of minerals.
The approximate value of non-fuel minerals produced in Britain in 1974
reached £451 million, an increase of 12 per cent compared with 1973.
Sand and gravel are second only to coal in terms of tonnage of minerals pro¬
duced in Britain. They are primarily used as an aggregate or bulking material,
in the main for concrete (accounting for about 75 Per cent of total production)
and road construction. In 1974,120 million tonnes of common sand and gravel
worth over £100 million were produced; 15-3 million tonnes or 13 per cent of
the total were marine-dredged. Britain is the world s largest producer of
marine-dredged aggregates. Total past production is about 2,600 million

tonnes, of which over half has been raised in the last 15 years. It is estimated
that about 4,000 acres (1,600 hectares) are worked each year.
More specialised sands used in glass-making and metal-founding are
also produced. In 1974 production of these special silica sands amounted
to 4-6 million tonnes. Virtually all glass produced in Britain is made from
domestically produced silica sands.
Limestone, igneous rock, sandstone and chalk are all quarried for use in the
construction industry. Limestone is also used by the steel industry. Produc¬
tion in 1974 included: 101 million tonnes of limestone valued at ^119 million;
42 million tonnes of igneous rock valued at £66 million; 14 million tonnes of
sandstone (including silica stone and ganister) valued at about £24 million;
and 20 million tonnes of chalk (including chert and flint) valued at about £12
million. The production of slate has declined steadily in recent years to a level
of 64,000 tonnes in 1974.
In 1974 Britain produced 37 million tonnes of clays, valued at £54 million.
Britain is a leading world producer of china clay, which is used mainly as a
filler and coater for fine quality paper, for making high quality pottery and
also in the paint, rubber, plastics, insecticide, and fertiliser industries. Most of
the output is for export. Other main types of clay produced included ball clay,
used in the pottery and ceramics industries, and fireclays, used for bricks
and refractory products.
Production of iron ore in 1974 was 3-6 million tonnes. Although indigenous
iron ore was important to Britain’s industrial development, the remaining
low-grade domestic ores are not competitive with high-grade ores and con¬
centrates from overseas and production has fallen substantially in recent years.
The most important non-ferrous metal produced in Britain is tin, which was
first worked in Cornwall over 2,000 years ago. Production was at its highest
in the early 1870s, amounting to about 15,000 tonnes a year of dressed ore,
but by the early 1950s production had fallen to about 1,400 tonnes a year.
Increasing demand for base metals since then has brought about a recovery in
production, which has more than trebled since 1970 to reach 9,900 tonnes of
dressed ore in 1974, with a tin content of 3,000 tonnes. Cornish mines supplied
Britain with nearly 25 per cent of its tin ore requirements in 1974. There are
now four mines and a fifth one is being developed. Some copper, zinc and
silver are produced in association with the tin. Production of lead ore has
remained fairly constant over the past few years in the range of 6,000-7,000
tonnes of dressed ore a year.
Among other domestically produced minerals Britain is a major world pro¬
ducer of salt, fluorspar, gypsum, anhydrite, and celestite. Britain is virtually
self-sufficient in salt, the value of production being nearly ^24 million in 1974.
The value of fluorspar produced in 1974 was £7 million while that of gypsum
and anhydrite combined was £9 million. Potash production started in Bou y,
Cleveland, towards the end of 1973; output in 1975 is expected to be over 1
million tonnes, exceeding domestic consumption, about 95 per cent of which
is accounted for by fertiliser manufacturers.
Britain also produces small amounts of talc, mica clay, diatomite and
mineral pigments.
ENERGY AND NATURAL RESOURCES
WATER SUPPLY
279
Evolution
Present
Organisation
England and
Wales
Britain’s water resources are, with progressive development, sufficient for
domestic and industrial requirements, despite the expected continuing growth
in demand. The sources of water are, however, often distant from the areas
where supplies are needed. Supplies are obtained partly from surface sources
such as mountain lakes, streams impounded in upland gathering grounds and
river intakes, and partly from underground sources by means of wells, adits
and boreholes.
The householder receives his domestic water supply at a comparatively
small charge, varying in different areas, which he usually pays by way of a
water rate levied, like other rates, on the net annual value of his house. Indus¬
trial users are charged in most cases according to actual metered consumption.
The provision of water supplies became a general public service in Britain in
the nineteenth century, largely due to the efforts of Edwin Chadwick (a well-
known social reformer) and his colleagues who demonstrated the dangers to
health arising from inadequate water supply and sanitation. Under the Public
Health Act of 1848, which laid the basis for a long series of statutes dealing
with public health, a number of statutory water undertakings were established
to provide water to the expanding urban population and the water supply
system developed rapidly although in piecemeal fashion with some over¬
lapping and waste. Where no commercial undertaking was willing and able to
do so, the Public Health Act 1875 empowered local authorities to provide
water supplies.
The Water Act 1945 laid a structural basis for the water supply industry,
and while embodying the principle of mixed public and private ownership of
water undertakings, gave more central direction to the industry’s development
and fostered amalgamations. The Water Resources Act of 1963 created river
authorities to administer, and a Water Resources Board to review, national
water resources and requirements in England and Wales. There were similar
arrangements in Scotland under the Water (Scotland) Act 1967 (see p. 281).
Water supply continued to be provided mainly by statutory water under¬
takings.
To meet the continuing increase in demand more effectively, a further radical
reorganisation of the administrative structure of the water industry in England
and Wales was brought about by the Water Act 1973 the main provisions of
which were implemented in April 1974 alongside the new arrangements for
local government (see p. 66). (For the position in Scotland and in Northern
Ireland see p. 281).
The main aim of the Water Act 1973 was to bring under the management of
a single body all aspects of water services within any river basin or catchment
area, thereby recognising the increasing interdependence of all parts of the
hydrological cycle and securing the more effective use of available resources
(a river can be used as a source of drinking water only if discharges of effluent
to that river are strictly controlled).
Responsibility for promoting a national policy for water in England and
Wales rests with the Secretaries of State for the Environment and for Wales
and the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food who, under the 1973 Act,
are charged with responsibility for securing the conservation, augmentation,

distribution and proper use of water resources and the provision of water
supplies; the provision of sewerage and sewage disposal services; the restora¬
tion and maintenance of the wholesomeness of rivers and other inland waters;
the use of inland waters for navigation and recreation; the provision of land
drainage; and the protection and development of fisheries.
The Water Resources Board has been abolished and its function taken over
by a Central Water Planning Unit and the Water Research Centre (see p. 282).
Nine regional water authorities in England and the Welsh National Water
Development Authority in Wales were set up under the Water Act 1973 and
the duties formerly scattered amongst a variety of bodies were transferred to
them. The board of each water authority consists of a chairman and several
members appointed by the Secretary of State for the Environment, a few
members appointed by the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food and
a small majority, usually of only one, of members appointed by the county
and district councils within the area of the authority. District councils usually
also act as agents of water authorities for the design, construction, operation
and maintenance of public sewers in their areas.
The Act provides for the continued supply of water by some 30 statutory
water companies for the water authorities both within and outside their limits
of supply. It makes special arrangements governing the relationship of statu¬
tory water companies to the water authorities and for control of the latter over
them.
Among bodies set up under the Act is the National Water Council to advise
and assist ministers and water authorities. The council consists of a chairman
appointed by the Secretaries of State, the chairmen of the water authorities,
and ten other members with special relevant knowledge, of whom eight have
been appointed by the Secretaries of State and two by the Minister of Agri¬
culture, Fisheries and Food.
A Water Space Amenity Commission has also been established to advise the
Secretary of State for the Environment, the National Water Council and the
water authorities on the discharge of their functions relating to recreational
and amenity use of water space in England. The commission consists of a
chairman appointed by the Secretary of State, the chairmen of the water
authorities and not more than ten other members appointed by the Secretary
of State—one in consultation with the Countryside Commission.
Public water supplies in England and Wales—reaching over 99 per cent of
the total population—now total some 3,300 million gallons (15 million cubic
metres) a day, out of a total estimated abstraction of nearly 5,500 million
gallons (25 million cubic metres) a day (excluding water used for cooling
in connection with electricity generation). Capital expenditure in 1974-75 on
water supply, sewerage and sewage disposal is estimated at £452 million (at
November 1974 prices). .
The provision of piped supplies for rural districts has been assisted by
grants under the Rural Water Supplies and Sewerage Acts 1944 to 1971. By
March 1975 schemes costing over £125 million had been completed or were
in progress with the aid of grants under these Acts, totalling £36 million.
The final report of the Water Resources Board on water resources in England
and Wales was published in 1974 (see Bibliography, p. 478). It anticipates

that no more than five new strategic reservoirs need be built in England
and Wales this century and recommends the development of the Dee Estuary
for water storage and the enlargement of a number of existing reservoirs.
Since recent increases in demand for water have not been as great as at one
time expected, no firm government decisions on the report’s recommenda¬
tions need to be taken for some time.
The administrative arrangements for water supply and distribution in Scot¬
land were reorganised by the Water (Scotland) Act 1967 under which the
functions of 200 local water authorities were transferred to 13 regional water
boards in 1968. The Act also established the Central Scotland Water Develop¬
ment Board to supply water in bulk to its seven constituent regional water
boards; it does not supply direct to individual consumers. All the members of
these boards were members of town or county councils.
The regional water boards were dissolved in May 1975 and their functions
transferred to the new regional councils and island councils established then
to carry out local government functions (see p. 68) except in the island areas;
separate river purification authorities continue to be responsible for the regula¬
tion of the discharges of effluent to rivers and certain tidal waters. The Central
Scotland Water Development Board has been reconstituted to carry out
co-ordinating functions and administer water schemes supplying more than
one regional council in central Scotland.
The water problem in Scotland is broadly similar to that in England and
Wales except that there is not the same need to allocate water between com¬
peting interests and requirements are met almost entirely from surface
sources. The Secretary of State for Scotland is responsible for general over¬
sight and co-ordination and has a general duty to promote the conservation of
water resources in Scotland; and to require regional and island councils to
provide supplies of wholesome water everywhere in their regions, where this
can be done at reasonable cost; at present, they supply over 98 per cent of the
total population. A survey of currently available supplies and likely demands
to the end of the present century and of potential services to be developed was
carried out by the Scottish Development Department in consultation with the
water boards (see Bibliography, p. 478). The Scottish Water Advisory Com¬
mittee advises the Secretary of State on general questions relating to resources
and supplies and the organisation of the water service. The Rural Water
Supplies and Sewerage Act 1944, as amended, makes available to Scottish
regional water boards and to local authorities grant assistance towards the cost
of water supplies and sewerage schemes.
Northern Ireland has abundant potential supplies of water for both domestic
and industrial consumption. Over 90 per cent of the population has a piped
supply. Between 1945 and end-September 1973 over £100 million was expen¬
ded on water and sewerage services—over £100 million byway of government
grants. The Government, responsible for water conservation and pollution
control under the Water Act (NI) 1972, took over from local authorities, on 1st
October 1973, responsibility for water supply and sewerage services. The
Water and Sewerage (NI) Order 1973 requires the Department of the Environ¬
ment (NI) to provide these services. Capital expenditure on these services
amounted to around £13-5 million between October 1973 and December
I974-

this water resource system a comprehensive water management programme
has been prepared.
Information on the yield, behaviour and quantity of the nation’s water re¬
sources is provided in the Surface Water Year Book of Great Britain, and in
the Ground Water Year Book for England and Wales published annually by
Her Majesty’s Stationery Office. Detailed studies of the resources and use of
water in specified areas have been published in the series of hydrological
surveys which cover approximately half of England and Wales. General
information on rainfall, published annually in British Rainfall, is the
responsibility of the Meteorological Office.
Barrage projects involve dams across or within tidal estuaries to form a lake
of fresh water, and studies have been carried out for several estuaries in
Britain. A report on a study for Morecambe Bay, Lancashire, published early
in 1972, put forward several suggested schemes, including a barrage and
storage reservoirs. Reports have also been prepared for plans for the Wash and
the estuary of the Dee. A feasibility study for the River Parrett, Somerset,
barrage scheme, completed in January i975> adds land drainage, flood pre¬
vention, recreational amenity and road linkage to the water storage objective.
Central government functions concerning control of water pollution are the
responsibility in England of the Department of the Environment, in Wales of
the Welsh Office, in Scotland of the Scottish Development Department and
in Northern Ireland of the Department of the Environment (NI). The regional
water authorities in England and the Welsh National Water Development
Authority in Wales are responsible for the control of pollution in rivers and
certain tidal water in their areas and their approval must be sought before
polluting effluents are discharged. Similarly in Northern Ireland the consent
of the Department of the Environment (NI) is required for discharges into
waterways or underground strata. In Scotland river pollution is controlled by
river purification boards over the whole mainland, island councils being the
river purification authorities for their areas. Under the Control of Pollution
Act 1974, existing measures for protecting water against pollution have been
strengthened.
The Government’s aim is to improve the quality of water in all the main
rivers by the early 1980s. The River Pollution Survey records in detail progress
already made in reducing river pollution.
A Water Research Centre co-ordinates water research in the whole of Britain
(see p. 402). The Water Research Centre’s station at Medmenham and the
Hydraulics Research Station of the Department of the Environment at
Wallingford carry out research into problems of the design and calibration of
gauging weirs and flumes for the measurement of surface water, and into other
hydraulic problems.
The Water Pollution Research Laboratory at Stevenage, also part of the
Water Research Centre, investigates problems connected with the treatment
of polluted water, the treatment and disposal of sewage and industrial waste
water, and the effects and prevention of pollution of surface water and
underground water.

AGRICULTURE
Although Britain is a densely populated, industrialised country relying on
imports for nearly half its food supply, agriculture remains one of its largest
and most important industries. It occupies 678,000 people or 2-8 per cent of
the total in civil employment, provides about 2-6 per cent of the gross domestic
product, and uses 47 million of the 60 million acres (19 million of the 24
million hectares) of land.
rrs^ISE^0 AND The S°ilS °f the country are varied (see P- 4)- Land used for farming is con¬
ventionally divided into land suitable for cultivation (crops and grass) and
rough grazing. In hill country the area of cultivated land is often small, but is
usually supplemented by grazing on a comparatively large area of hill land.
In Britain there are 30 million acres (i2-i million hectares) under crops and
grass. Cultivated land, rough grazing, woodland (ancillary to farming) and
other land on agricultural holdings together represent 79 per cent of the land
area. The rest is mountain and forest, or put to urban and kindred uses. The
area available for farming is gradually decreasing to meet the needs of housing
and industry; so far, the loss has been offset by the increase in output from
what remains. The ratio of rough grazing—used for stock, mainly sheep—to
better quality agricultural land varies considerably throughout Britain. In the
southern half of England, for example, it constitutes only about one-sixth of
the total acreage, increasing to one-fifth in Northern Ireland, about a third in
the hill regions of England and Wales and nearly three-quarters in Scotland.
Size of Farms There are about 278,000 statistically significant farming units in Britain. Some
41 per cent are very small units, mostly farmed part-time, and accounting for
less than a tenth of the industry’s total output. Of the 176,000 full-time farm
businesses some 41,100 are classified (by standard man-days) as large farm
businesses (capable of employing four or more men full-time): these, account¬
ing for some 14-8 per cent of the number of holdings, produce more than half
the industry’s total output. There are 55,000 medium-sized (two-three men)
and 66,500 small farm businesses.
Amalgamation of small farms into larger, more viable units has been
encouraged by successive governments. The average size of full-time holdings
in Britain is 239 acres (97 hectares) of crops and grass (including rough
grazings).
Some 35,000 of the total of significant farming units are in Northern
Ireland: over half of these provide a full-time occupation for the owner and
produce over four-fifths of the total output. The average farm size is 50 acres

(21 hectares). Other holdings, of which there are about 16,000, are either
extremely small or let in conacre (seasonal lettings for crops or grazing).
The increasing use of intensive methods of production both in crops and in
animal husbandry has led to greater specialisation. Three-fifths of the full¬
time farms in Britain are devoted mainly to dairying or beef cattle and sheep.
One in six is a cropping farm and the remainder specialise in pigs, poultry or
horticulture or are mixed farms. In England the farms devoted primarily to
arable crops are in the eastern part of the country—in East Anglia, Kent,
Lincolnshire and Humberside. In Scotland the rich lowlands of the east coast
are also primarily arable. Potato and vegetable growing on a substantial scale
marks the farming of the Fens (south Lincolnshire and Cambridgeshire), the
alluvial areas around the rivers Thames and Humber and the peaty lands in
south Lancashire. Early potatoes are an important crop in Dyfed and the south¬
west. Elsewhere, horticultural crops are widely dispersed amongst agricultural
crops.
Dairying occurs widely, but there are concentrations in south-west Scot¬
land, the western parts of England and south-west Wales, where the wetter
climate encourages the growth of good grass. Sheep and cattle are reared in the
hill and moorland areas of Scotland, Wales and northern and south-western
England. Beef fattening takes place partly on better grassland areas and partly
in yards on arable farms.
In Northern Ireland dairying is the main occupation on 40 per cent of the
full-time farms, while a further 35 per cent concentrate on beef and sheep
production. The remainder are either specialised cropping and horticultural
holdings, intensive pig and poultry units or mixed farms with no predominant
single enterprise. Oats and barley are widely grown, mainly for livestock
feeding, and the only important cash crop is potatoes.
The increase in production which has occurred over the past decades is a
result of the effort of individual farmers, of farmers’ organisations, of research
workers and advisers and of government action. The role of the Government
is described on pp. 292-96.
The steady expansion in production and in yield per acre of arable land which
has taken place since 1936 is summarised in Table 22. Apart from a slight
decline between 1961 and 1964, and another in 1968, total cattle stocks have
risen each year since i957> t° reach a record figure of i5‘2 million in 1974-
Over the past decade the beef herd has grown considerably, but expansion in
the milk-producing herd has been less marked. Numbers of sheep and lambs
reached their highest level in 1966; although they later declined, steady
expansion is now evident again. Numbers of pigs have increased by over one-
quarter during the past decade, as have those of poultry. Arable production
has shown a greater diversification since the second world war. Total cereals
production has increased considerably since i960, reaching about 17 million
tons in 1974-75. Potato production is susceptible to weather conditions but,
on average, adequate supplies are maintained from a steadily declining area.
Between 1963 and i973~74 output of pigmeat increased by one-quarter and
eggs by one-tenth; these increases, together with those in beef and milk,
resulted in higher consumption of feedingstuffs, mostly from home resources.
Between 4 million and 5 million tons of concentrated feeds are imported each
year, depending on the size of the home crop of cereals.

BRITAIN 1976: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
The index of agricultural net product (all holdings) at constant prices has
risen steadily. By 1953-54 it was some 56 per cent above the immediate pre¬
war average; it rose a further 36 per cent between 1954-57 and 1964-67.
With the average of 1968-72 as a base, the index for all commercially signi¬
ficant holdings reached 117 in 1973-74; 117 is forecast for 1974-75.
The British climate suits grassland farming. Grassland forms an important
section of the economy of most farms, whether as permanent grass, mostly
occupying land less suitable for cultivation, or as sown grassland (leys), often
part of the arable rotation. A wide range of herbage species and varieties are
used, over half the total supply of herbage seed being produced in Britain.
Grassland production has been enhanced over recent years by the develop¬
ment and application of new techniques, notably the increased use of fertilisers
(especially nitrogenous), methods of grazing control, improved herbage con¬
servation for winter feed and irrigation. Rough grazings remain as semi¬
natural grassland used for extensively grazed flocks and herds, producing
young animals for fattening elsewhere.
Wheat is grown mainly in the eastern half of England. About 5"9 million tons
were harvested in 1974, with average yields estimated at 1-95 tons per acre
(4-89 tonnes per hectare). Between one-third and one-half of the wheat crop
is used for flour milling, the remainder going mainly for animal feed.
Since 1961 the area under barley has increased by nearly 50 per cent and in
general production has risen faster because yields have also increased. The
malting and distilling market currently absorbs about one-fifth of the crop;
most of the remainder is retained by farms or sold for animal feed.
The widespread use of combine harvesters has necessitated the installation
of drying and storage facilities on many farms. Such equipment is also often
used on a co-operative basis.
In Great Britain the total area of fodder crops has fallen because in many
cases farmers can provide winter feed more economically by increased grass
production and improved methods of conservation. The principal fodder crops
are beans and kale in England and turnips and swedes in Scotland.
Beet is grown mainly in East Anglia and Lincolnshire under contract to the
British Sugar Corporation (see p. 294), which also provides technical advice
and assistance.
Potatoes are grown in most parts of Britain. First supplies of early potatoes
normally come at the end of May, and the lifting of main crop varieties usually
starts in September. Seed potato production for Britain and for export is
chiefly centred in Scotland and Northern Ireland.
Britain is normally self-sufficient in main-crop potatoes. As yields are
increasing, requirements, including the increased demand for processed
potatoes, can be met from a declining acreage. The area planted in 1974 was
532,000 acres (215,000 hectares) and the average yield per acre was i2-6 tons.
This resulted in an overall balance of supply and demand. Although potato
production is becoming increasingly mechanised, much hand labour is still
needed.
In Great Britain more milk goes for liquid consumption than for manufacture,
but in Northern Ireland the greater part of the milk is used for manufactured
AGRICULTURE, FISHERIES AND FORESTRY 287
products. Average consumption of liquid milk per head is 4 74 pints (2'6g
litres) a week.
Average yields per dairy cow have increased during the last decade by about
11 per cent and now average some 864 gallons (3,927 litres) a year. Freedom
from tuberculosis has reduced herd wastage, and a campaign to eradicate
brucellosis is under way. The Friesian breed is dominant in the dairy herds of
England, Wales and Northern Ireland, and the Ayrshire breed in Scotland.
Average herd size is 39 cows. Milk production has been stimulated by advances
in grassland management, intensive grazing techniques and new methods of
making high quality hay and silage. Most dairy farmers practise some degree
of intensive grass management, but hay or silage of the traditional type supple¬
mented with purchased concentrates remain the basic winter feeds.
Livestock A great number of specialised breeds of livestock have been developed over
the centuries in Britain. Substantial sales of animals and semen are made to
overseas buyers seeking to replenish and improve their herds and flocks.
British breeds have recently been joined by a number of continental breeds.
Artificial insemination plays an important part in cattle breeding, about
two-thirds of the dairy herd in Great Britain being bred in this way, through
centres operated by the Milk Marketing Boards and other organisations.
Beef Cattle In the hill regions hardy herds of beef cattle are kept, especially of the Gallo¬
way and Welsh Black breeds and their crosses; in marginal land and lower
areas the sires used are predominantly of the Aberdeen Angus and Hereford
breeds. About two-thirds of home-fed beef production derives from the dairy
herds, some females being mated to beef sires. There is a large and complex
trade in store cattle (increased by animals imported from the Irish Republic),
a typical movement being from the upland west to grazing areas in the Mid¬
lands. The demand for lean tender beef at an economic price has stimulated
the development of intensive and semi-intensive systems of production.
Sheep Britain has a long tradition of sheep production. More than 30 breeds and
innumerable crosses are to be found in Britain, each breed having originated
within a particular area. Research has provided vaccine and sera protection
against nearly all the epidemic diseases.
In the hills, and especially in the Highlands, winter conditions are usually
severe. Draft ewes and lambs are brought from the hill areas every autumn
to swell the lowland flocks, usually in two stages; first, to farms at inter¬
mediate altitudes, where they are mated with rams of a larger and more rapidly
maturing breed; then, the cross-bred progeny pass on to the more genial low¬
land conditions, where they become crossed again with Down rams for fat
lamb production. The hill breeds bring in hardiness and the lowland sires
fecundity and early maturity. Fat lamb production provides the main source
of income for sheep farmers but wool is also of considerable importance,
especially to farmers in hill areas.
Pig production is carried on in most parts of Britain but is particularly
important in the eastern and southern counties of England and in Northern
Ireland. There is an increasing concentration into specialist units and larger
herds. The most frequently used breeds are the Large White and the Landrace
though a large number of cross-bred sows are also used in commercial pig-
meat production. Pig improvements are fostered through research by the
Meat and Livestock Commission and by leading commercial firms. Artificial
insemination is available nationally.

About 25 per cent of the pigmeat is used for bacon and 75 per cent for
pork and manufacturing into sausages and other processed forms.
The British poultry industry has expanded rapidly in recent years, aided by
the application of improved husbandry and management techniques in
intensive production units and to genetic improvements in stock. Only a small
proportion of total production is in the hands of the smallest producers—75
per cent of the laying birds on farms are in flocks of 5,000 or more and 73 per
cent of the broilers are in flocks of 50,000 or more. The average yield of eggs
per bird is about 230 a year and nearly all eggs consumed in Britain are home-
produced. About 310 million broilers and other special table chickens were
slaughtered in 1974.
The horticultural industry produces a wide variety of fruit, vegetables and
flower crops which are together worth nearly 12 per cent of the total value of
agricultural output—an estimated £512 million in 1974-75 out of a total of
£4.344 million.
At the June 1974 census the land on which these crops were grown amounted
to nearly 704,000 acres (285,000 hectares) about 15 per cent of the land used
for crops and grass. Of crops in the open, fruit accounted for 178,000 acres
(72,000 hectares), vegetables, excluding potatoes, for 480,000 acres (194,000
hectares), and flowers, bulbs and nursery stock for 38,000 acres (16,000
hectares). Crops under glass, plastic and in sheds, including mushrooms, occu¬
pied 6,000 acres (2,400 hectares).
Horticultural crops are largely grown on specialised holdings where soil,
climate, skilled labour and irrigation can produce maximum yields of high
quality crops and where access to markets or good roads enable them to be
sold at economic prices. Most horticultural enterprises are increasing output
per unit area with the help of improved planting material, new techniques of
cultivation and environmental control and the widespread use of machinery.
Some horticultural crops form parts of general farm rotations but the returns
from increased specialisation favour separate horticultural enterprises.
Of the land used for fruit growing in 1974, 44,000 acres (18,000 hectares) were
devoted to small fruit and the remainder was under orchards. The acreage of
apple orchards (excluding cider apples), some 75,000 acres (31,000 hectares),
continues to decline, but yields have increased to some 5 tons per acre on
average. Dessert apples are the most important fruit crop, grown mainly in
Kent and neighbouring counties, in East Anglia and to the north and south of
Bristol. Recent plantings are largely of Cox’s Orange Pippin which is marketed
throughout autumn and winter; many of the new orchards consist of closely
planted dwarf trees which can be efficiently pruned, sprayed and picked.
England and Northern Ireland are among the few countries which grow
varieties of apples especially suitable for cooking, the best-known of which is
Bramley’s Seedling. There are 12,700 acres (5,150 hectares) under varieties of
cider apples.
Although pears thrive best in the warmer continental climate, in the east
and south-east of England where somewhat similar conditions prevail the
Conference pear and a few other high quality varieties are produced. Cherries
and plums are grown in Kent, and plums also in the Vale of Evesham and
parts of East Anglia. Around Perth in Scotland is the largest concentration of
raspberry plantations in the world. This forms the basis of an important
processing industry.

Strawberries are the most widely grown soft fruit, accounting for some
17,700 acres (7,200 hectares), the main-crop areas being in Kent and East
Anglia. Blackcurrants are also widely grown in Britain, mainly for the prepara¬
tion of juice for the manufacture of soft drinks and flavours for confectionery.
Other fruits include gooseberries, red and white currants, loganberries and
blackberries. Almost all the nuts consumed in Britain are imported but a few
cob nuts and filberts are still grown in parts of Kent.
Much of the glasshouse sector of the horticultural industry has been re¬
equipped since the mid-1960s with the aid of grants. There are now, in many
parts of the country, units with automatic control of heat, ventilation, and
semi-automatic control of watering coupled with carbon-dioxide enrichment
of the atmosphere. Tomatoes form the most important glasshouse crop, either
as a single crop or in rotation with others, and together with lettuce and cu¬
cumbers represent some 95 per cent of the total value of glasshouse vegetable
output. There is also increasing production of sweet peppers, aubergines, and
celery. Cucumbers are extensively grown in the traditional glasshouse area in
the Lee Valley to the north of London and more recently in Yorkshire. Mush¬
rooms, whose farmgate value is forecast at over £26 million for 1974-75, are
grown in specially constructed sheds in numerous parts of the country. Pro¬
duction in Northern Ireland, in particular, is steadily increasing each year.
Bulbs and hardy nursery stock each occupied some 18,000 acres (7,300
hectares) in June 1974; flowers in the open took 3,000 acres (12,150 hectares).
Many nurseries concentrate on the production of plants in containers for sale
through the garden centres which have been established on the outskirts of
many towns.
Cut flowers are grown and bulbs cultivated in many areas but particularly
in the Holland area of Lincolnshire, Norfolk, the east of Scotland, Cornwall
and in the Isles of Scilly where more than 50 per cent of the cultivable land is
devoted to bulbs which flower there from November to May.
Vegetables and outdoor salad crops are grown in the traditional areas of the
Thames Valley, north Kent, Vale of Evesham, south Lancashire and Hum¬
berside, but newer areas, especially suited through soil type or climate to
production of a particular crop, have come into prominence. West Cornwall,
south Devon, Dyfed and Kent send winter cauliflowers and spring cabbage
to most urban markets while almost half the summer and autumn cauliflowers
come from the intensive horticultural holdings in Lincolnshire. The light soils
of Norfolk and Cambridgeshire are especially suitable for carrots and onions,
and the Holland area of Lincolnshire accounts for just over a quarter of the
onion acreage. Brussels sprouts are grown extensively in Bedfordshire, the
Vale of Evesham, and well up the east coast of England wherever freezing
factories are sited for the processing of fish as well as vegetables. Peas and
dwarf beans are increasingly sold frozen, canned or dried and so are grown
close to factories in the east of England and in Scotland. Celery is mainly
grown on the deep soils of south-east Lancashire, Norfolk and the fens of
Cambridgeshire. Nearly three-quarters of the early rhubarb is produced in
Humberside where plants grown in the open are then forced in unlit
sheds.
Hops for the brewing industry are grown in Kent, East Sussex, Hampshire,
and Hereford and Worcester. They occupy only about 16,000 acres (6,500
hectares) but have a very high yield per acre and value by weight.

FOOD SUPPLIES Britain now produces just over half of its total food requirements or nearly
70 per cent of those supplies that can be produced in temperate climates.
Home Production Home production of the principal foods is shown as a percentage by weight
and of total supplies in Table 23. Table 24 shows how the level of the main food
Consumption supplies passing into consumption has changed since the end of war-time
rationing. Rising living standards have led to increased consumption of high
protein foods. More recently the pattern of food consumption has tended to
stabilise but with a more pronounced trend towards partly prepared and
‘convenience’ foods.

in 1974-75. The figures given in Table 25 show that Britain’s farming is pre¬
dominantly based on livestock enterprises. Nearly seven-tenths of total farm
output is in the form of livestock or livestock products.
Of all farm expenses, purchased feedingstuffs amount to nearly two-fifths,
wages to nearly one-fifth and machinery (including depreciation) and equip¬
ment to nearly one-fifth. Since i960 male agricultural earnings have more than
trebled, offsetting the manpower economies made possible by mechanisation
and larger farms, while labour productivity has risen by about 6 per cent a
year since 1964-65.
The capital required for land and buildings may be provided by the farmer,
if he is an owner-occupier, or by the landlord, if the farm is let to a tenant.
In 1974 provisional ‘fixed capital’ totalling £266 million was added to the
value of buildings and works and £309 million was invested in new plant,
machinery and vehicles. The bulk of the capital required to stock and run the
farms is provided by the occupiers. Bank advances are an important source of
outside capital, both fixed and working; about two-thirds of the total bank
advances to agriculture are believed to be for short-term purposes. Agricultural
merchants are also an important source of short-term credit. Mortgage loans
form the chief source of long-term credit and are provided by specialised
financial institutions (see p. 295) and private sources.

BRITAIN 1976: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Accounts of some 3,000 farms in Britain, collected by agricultural economists
in 1974, show average valuations of occupiers’ capital ranging from about £10
per acre (£247 per hectare) on hill farms with extensive rough grazings to over
£100 per acre (^247 per hectare) on some lowland farms. On all types of farm
investment in machinery is a heavy item: on dairy and arable farms it averages
about £15 per acre (£37 per hectare); on stock-rearing farms it may amount to
£4 per acre (£10 per hectare).
Britain has one of the heaviest tractor densities in the world, with 515,000
tractors in 1974 or one to every 34 acres (14 hectares) of arable land. Power-
take-off implements now characterise arable farming; and some 61,000
combine harvesters were in use in 1974. A wide variety of machines for
harvesting and preservation of grass are employed. Milking machines are
installed on all except the smallest farms.
Over 90 per cent of the farms in Great Britain have an electricity supply and
accompanying equipment. There are about 1,700 farmers’-machinery syndi¬
cates. through which farmers have the use of expensive equipment without
tying up their own capital.
Research, development and testing of farm machinery are carried out by
the National Institute of Agricultural Engineering.
The range of net incomes between individual farms is very wide, varying with
the type and size of farm, quality of land, and managerial ability of the occupier.
The average net income for farms in England and Wales of different types is
generally within the range of £20 to £45 per acre (^49 to 11 per hectare) with
the exception of pig and poultry farms and horticultural holdings, which are
more intensive in their use of land. Net income per acre on dairy and arable
farms has nearly always been higher than on stock-rearing farms, which are
generally larger than the other types and are situated on poorer land.
The functions of government in relation to agriculture are mostly exercised
by the agricultural ministers; for England and Wales the Minister of Agricul¬
ture, Fisheries and Food and the Secretary of State for Wales, for Scotland
the Secretary of State for Scotland, and for Northern Ireland the Secretary of
State for Northern Ireland. The Advisory Council for Agriculture and Horti¬
culture in England and Wales exists to provide the Minister and his depart¬
ment with independent advice on any agricultural or horticultural subjects
remitted to it.
The Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food operates through func¬
tional divisions. Its relations with individual farmers are conducted mainly
through its local offices, grouped in England in regions, with regional man¬
agers. Local offices in Wales are grouped under a Welsh Secretary with similar
functions and with special responsibility for Welsh affairs.
In 1966 an Economic Development Committee for agriculture was estab¬
lished, comprising representatives of farmers, workers and landowners, as well
as official and independent members.
In Scotland most of the agricultural functions of the Secretary of State are
discharged through the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries. The
Secretary of State for Scotland also appoints the members of the Crofters
Commission (see p. 295) and the Red Deer Commission, which deals with the
conservation and control of red deer.
The Northern Ireland Department of Agriculture is responsible for imple¬
menting agricultural policy. It is organised on similar lines to the Ministry
AGRICULTURE, FISHERIES AND FORESTRY 293
of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, for which it acts as agent in the administra¬
tion in Northern Ireland of United Kingdom agricultural schemes.
Britain began to take part in the European Community system of agricultural
support under the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) on 1st February 1973.
The Intervention Board for Agricultural Produce was set up in 1972 to
administer the system; although administratively separate from the agricul¬
tural departments, the board maintains close working links with them and is
responsible to the agricultural ministers, who remain responsible for policy.
Annual Review Each year, the agricultural ministers review the economic condition and
prospects of the industry in consultation with representatives of agricultural
producers (in practice, the three farmers’ unions in Britain). They consider
such factors as production trends and market requirements, world market
prospects, the cost of subsidies, income trends in the industry as a whole, the
increasing efficiency of the industry and changes in production costs. The
conclusions drawn from the review form the background for the determina¬
tion of guaranteed prices in Britain and contribute together with views
expressed on behalf of agricultural workers, landowners and the food industry
to the formulation of government agricultural policy generally.
The cost of government support to the industry in 1974-75 is estimated at
£296 million. Expenditure under the CAP arrangements is estimated at about
£193 million, of which some £147 million is likely to be reimbursed from the
European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund (FEOGA).
Common
Agricultural
Policy
Price
Guarantees
The objectives of the CAP are to increase agricultural productivity and earn-
ings, to stabilise markets and to provide adequate supplies at reasonable prices
to the consumer. For most commodities there is free trade within the Com¬
munity with a common system of variable levies on imports from third coun¬
tries, and common support prices within the Community designed to give
producers an adequate return from the market. For some of the more impor¬
tant products support buying is undertaken when necessary. There is also
provision for certain payments to producers, including variable premiums
payable on cattle and beef. For most commodities Britain is gradually adopting
full Community support price levels over the five-year transitional period.
During this period there is free trade between Britain and the other Commun¬
ity members in the main agricultural products subject to arrangements to
compensate for the differences in price levels and currency values. For fresh
fruits and vegetables the market organisation is similar, although third country
trade is subject to a common customs tariff and not to variable import levies.
Items of particular importance to Community producers are covered by a
market intervention system and a form of minimum import prices.
The principal tasks of the Intervention Board in administering this system
are the issue and control of export/import licences and the payment of
export and import refunds; market support for certain commodities, in¬
cluding support buying, aids to private storage and the payment of denaturing
premiums. The board also pays the minor Community production and pro¬
ducer subsidies not administered by the agricultural departments.
In the light of the Annual Review the agricultural ministers determine guaran¬
teed prices for the coming year for cereals, potatoes, fat sheep, milk and wool.
By the end of the transitional period (31st December 1977) the guarantees
for all commodities for which the Community has a common market organisa¬
tion will have been ended. There is no common market organisation for sheep,

wool and potatoes. The guarantee for fat cattle ended in March 1973, that for
rye in July 1973, that for eggs in March 1974, and that for sugar beet in June
1974. The guarantee for fat pigs ended on 31st July 1975. Deficiency payments
are made, designed to make up the deficit between the market price of a com¬
modity and the price guaranteed by the Government. The level of the guaran¬
teed prices for commodities for which there is a Community common market
organisation are subject to rules under the Treaty of Accession.
For cereals payment is made by the agricultural departments on the
acreage harvested. Deficiency payments for fatstock are made weekly to
producers on certified sales on a liveweight or deadweight basis.
For milk and wool in the United Kingdom, and potatoes in Great Britain
the Government operates the guarantee through the appropriate marketing
boards which take account of any payments from or to the Government in
deciding what to pay producers for their produce. In the case of milk there are
five boards; the Government pays the guaranteed price on a ‘standard quantity’
which for 1975-76 will be broadly the same as total production. Any milk
produced in excess of this would be sold for manufacturing and the returns
from these two sources averaged by the boards to give the ‘pool price’ paid to
producers. Recent government decisions to subsidise the retail price have
resulted in a deficit which is being met by the Exchequer. For potatoes,
ministers fix each year a target acreage designed to achieve self-sufficiency. In
Great Britain the Potato Marketing Board ensures, as far as possible, that this
acreage is planted and may with government agreement undertake support
buying of any surplus, re-selling as much as possible for stockfeed. In Northern
Ireland the Department of Agriculture undertakes any support measures.
Most of the cost is met by the Government.
For wool a fixed price is guaranteed to the British Wool Marketing Board
for every pound of fleece wool it buys from producers. This enables it to fix in
advance a schedule of producers’ prices, based on types and quality, after
making allowance for the board’s marketing costs.
The British Sugar Corporation Ltd. contracts annually for the acreage from
which it will buy sugar beet. The contracted acreage has risen over the past
few years and for the 1975 crop was 490,000 acres (198,000 hectares). For
production within Britain’s maximum quota under the CAP (over 1-5 million
tonnes of refined sugar in 1975-76) the corporation must pay not less than CAP
minimum prices. Any additional sugar must, except in case of shortage, be
exported outside the European Community and the price paid will reflect
prices on the world market. The Commonwealth Sugar Agreement under
which the Government was committed to take certain quantities of sugar
annually from Commonwealth exporters, expired at the end of 1974. It was
replaced early in 1975 by provisions in the Convention of Lome (see p. 387).
Under these provisions the European Community is committed to taking
certain quantities of sugar annually from developing sugar-exporting coun¬
tries, most of whom are Commonwealth members, at a price related to that
applicable within the Community. In practice most of the sugar is expected
to continue to come to Britain for refining.
The relative importance of the price guarantees has declined in recent
years. The Government does, however, offer to farmers a wide range of other
inducements to increase productivity. The cost amounted to £290 million in
1974-75, and is estimated at £220 million in 1975-76. These government
payments include grants to maintain breeding herds of cattle and sheep,

particularly in upland areas, and to encourage the retention of calves suitable
for beef production. In addition grant aid is available towards the cost of
certain capital expenditure and towards the cost of farm amalgamations and
other measures to improve farm structure.
In England and Wales finance for the purchase or improvement of agricultural
land and buildings is available from the Agricultural Mortgage Corporation
Ltd. whose funds are derived mainly from public issues of stock, with some
government support. Loans for agricultural purposes secured on agricultural
land in Scotland are granted by the Scottish Agricultural Securities Corpora¬
tion Ltd. which works on a similar financial basis to the Agricultural Mortgage
Corporation Ltd.
Loans for carrying out improvements to agricultural land and buildings are
also available to landowners from the Lands Improvement Company.
In Northern Ireland loans are available to farmers from the Agricultural
Loans Fund, administered by the Department of Agriculture and financed out
of public funds. Short-term finance for agricultural machinery is arranged on a
hire purchase basis, whilst medium- or long-term loans are arranged for such
purposes as the purchase of livestock, the erection and improvement of farm
buildings and farm dwellings, and the purchase of land for amalgamation and
subsequent restructuring.
The Government can make loans in Great Britain to help finance the pur¬
chase of land acquired for approved amalgamations of small farms and appro¬
ved remodelling expenditure. These loans may be granted up to 90 per cent
(100 per cent for certain small amalgamations) of the valuation of the com¬
bined unit determined by the Agricultural Mortgage Corporation Ltd. in
England and Wales and the Scottish Agricultural Securities Corporation Ltd.
in Scotland, which act as the Government’s agents.
In England and Wales, about 10,300 smallholdings are provided by local
authorities and about 870 lettable holdings by the Ministry of Agriculture,
Fisheries and Food. For financial assistance in improving smallholdings,
authorities can obtain the amalgamation and capital grants available to farmers
generally. The minister and local authorities may make loans of up to 75 per
cent of required working capital to their smallholding tenants.
Land settlement in Scotland has always been carried out by the central
Government, which now owns and maintains about 415,000 acres (167,900
hectares) of land settlement estates, comprising some 3,010 crofts and holdings.
Within the crofting counties of Scotland (comprising the former counties of
Argyll, Caithness, Inverness, Orkney, Ross and Cromarty, Sutherland and
Shetland) much of the land is held by crofters or tenants whose holdings are
generally either rented at a cost of not more than £50 a year or have an area
not exceeding 75 acres (30 hectares).
The Crofters Commission, with headquarters in Inverness, is responsible
for the administration and regulation of crofting. Its functions are to re¬
organise, develop and regulate crofting in the crofting counties, to promote the
interests of crofters and to keep under review matters relating to crofting. The
commission’s statutory powers include supervising the letting of crofts and
collaborating with other organisations whose activities affect crofting interests.
It also acts as the Secretary of State’s agent in administering grants to crofters
for cropping and land improvement.

BRITAIN 1976: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
On 1st April 1974, responsibility for land drainage (including flood preven¬
tion) in England and Wales was transferred from the former river authorities
and catchment boards to ten new regional water authorities. There are no com¬
parable authorities in Scotland, where arterial drainage of agricultural land is
the owners’ responsibility.
The work of the water authorities includes, in both urban and agricultural
areas, the improvement of land drainage, the prevention of inland flooding,
and the construction and maintenance of defences to protect low-lying coastal
areas from tidal flooding. Most of the funds needed for this work are obtained
from local authorities, but the Government pays grants toward the cost of im¬
provement schemes varying from 10 per cent to 80 per cent according to the
financial position of the authority, with an additional premium for sea defence
works.
Within the water authority areas, in low-lying areas where there are special
local problems of land drainage, there are 314 internal drainage districts
administered by internal drainage boards who carry out work for the special
benefit and protection of their districts. These boards finance their work from
drainage rates levied on owners and occupiers. They also receive government
grant at a flat rate of 50 per cent for improvement schemes.
Local authorities in England and Wales also have general land drainage
powers and may receive government grants of between 20 per cent and 50 per
cent of the cost of improvement work. In Scotland 60 per cent grants (70 per
cent if for the benefit of hill land) are available to owners or occupiers of
agricultural land.
In Northern Ireland the Department of Agriculture is the drainage authority
for watercourses designated by the Drainage Council as main or minor water¬
courses and also has responsibility for urban drainage.
In Great Britain more than half, and in Northern Ireland almost all, farms are
owner-occupied. In order to protect the respective interests of landlords and
tenants and to eliminate uncertainty as to their rights and liabilities, a code of
landlord and tenant relationships has been written into legislation.
Legislation provides for any tenancy of agricultural land, with the exception
of certain short-term lettings, to continue in force from year to year until
terminated by a valid notice to quit. With certain exceptions the tenant can
contest it by serving a counter-notice; the notice to quit then becomes in¬
operative unless the landlord can satisfy an independent body (in England and
Wales the Agricultural Land Tribunal and in Scotland the Scottish Land Court)
that his claim for possession is in the interests of sound estate management or
good husbandry or that the land is required for certain specified purposes.
There is a code of compensation to which the tenant is entitled on termina¬
tion of the tenancy. Rent is a matter for negotiation between landlord and
tenant and may be varied by agreement at any time or, failing agreement, by
arbitration.
Agricultural products are marketed mainly through private trade channels,
through producers’ co-operatives or through marketing boards operating under
the Agricultural Marketing Act 1958 or Northern Ireland legislation. The
practice of selling under contract is growing. The marketing boards are
producers’ organisations with statutory powers to regulate the marketing o
particular products. The schemes under which they are constituted and
operate must be approved by Parliament and, except in Northern Ireland,
confirmed by a poll of the producers. Most board members are elected by the

producers but a minority are appointed by the agriculture minister or minis¬
ters concerned. Further safeguards serve to protect consumers and other
interests affected by schemes and the public interest generally.
Marketing boards fall into two broad categories: first, those which are sole
buyers of the regulated product from all producers not specially exempted or
those which exercise a comparable influence by controlling all contracts
between producers and first buyers; and, secondly, boards which maintain
only a broad control over marketing conditions, leaving producers free other¬
wise to deal individually with buyers. The boards for hops, milk and wool and
the Northern Ireland pigs and seed potato boards fall into the first category
and the Potato Board into the second.
For certain other commodities there are broadly based organisations
representing producer, distributor and independent interests.
The Home-Grown Cereals Authority was set up to improve the marketing
of home-grown cereals. It provides market intelligence, operates a wheat
classification scheme, and promotes research and development of value to the
cereals market. It also acts as agent for the Intervention Board for Agricultural
Produce in respect of the support buying, storage and disposal of cereals and
oilseed rape.
The Meat and Livestock Commission is charged with improving the pro¬
duction, marketing and distribution of livestock and meat in Great Britain. It
has a range of executive functions extending from breeding to retail distribu¬
tion, including acting as agent for the Intervention Board. It is not empowered
to trade in either livestock or meat.
The Eggs Authority, which represents the industry and consumers, was set
up with the general duty of improving the marketing of eggs. It provides market
intelligence, carries out promotional work and undertakes research and
development projects.
Grants of up to one-third are available for the modernisation of major
wholesale horticultural markets; Covent Garden has been moved to a new
site in south London.
Under the CAP a wide range of fresh horticultural produce and also cut
flowers and flowering bulbs are subject to common quality standards which,
with certain minor exceptions, apply at all stages of distribution. The Com¬
munity standards apply to all produce entering Britain and, since 1st February
I975> British produce sold on the domestic market.
Community regulations prescribe grades consisting of a range of up to four
classes and specify requirements concerning colour, sizing, etc., and relating to
packing, presentation and labelling. All fruit and vegetables subject to the
standards which are exported from or imported into the Community must meet
the requirements of at least Class II.
The Central Council for Agricultural and Horticultural Co-operation was
established to promote and develop co-operation in agriculture and horticul¬
ture and to administer a scheme of grants. The Agricultural and Horticultural
Co-operation Scheme 1971 provides grants for co-operative production and
marketing of agricultural and horticultural produce, including capital grants
on similar terms as are available under the schemes for individual producers
(see p. 295). The Federation of Agricultural Co-operatives represents British
co-operatives both in Britain and in the Community.
The day-to-day work of treating animal disease is the responsibility of the
practising veterinary surgeon. Control of animal disease nationally in accord¬
ance with the Government’s policy is the responsibility of the State Veterinary
298
Animals

Service, which is part of the Agricultural Development and Advisory Service.
The Veterinary Service is also responsible for the administration of legislation
providing for the welfare of farm livestock.
For many years Great Britain has been free from many serious animal
diseases including rinderpest, contagious bovine pleuro pneumonia, sheep pox,
glanders and rabies, except for two isolated cases of rabies in imported dogs
in 1969-70. Measures against rabies were strengthened by the Rabies Act 1974
and orders made under it. Sheep scab, eradicated in 1952, reappeared in 1973:
control measures reduced the disease to a low level by the end of the year. The
campaign to eradicate swine fever was successfully completed in 1966 and
although three cases of the disease occurred in 1971 the infection was quickly
eliminated. An epidemic of a previously unknown swine vesicular disease
began in December 1972; it is being combated by a stringent slaughter policy.
A major epidemic of foot-and-mouth disease was experienced in 1967-68 but
was successfully eradicated. In i960 the whole of Britain became a bovine
tuberculosis attested area. The incidence of the disease is now very low; cattle
(except for certain categories) are tested at regular intervals and reactors to the
test are slaughtered, compensation being paid to the owners. Voluntary
schemes for the eradication of brucellosis have been in operation since 1967 >
compulsory eradication on an area basis began in 1^2. By the end of 1974
nearly 60 per cent of all herds in Great Britain were subject to eradication
measures. Newcastle Disease (fowl pest) which had declined considerably
since 1963, reappeared in serious epidemic proportions in a series of outbreaks
in 1970 and early 1971 in England and Wales and then declined again to a low
level.
The work of the service is backed by the extensive facilities of the Central
Veterinary Laboratory at Weybndge, Surrey, and those of its subsidiary
laboratory at Lasswade, near Edinburgh. In addition, there are 24 investiga¬
tion centres with well-equipped laboratories in England and Wales. These
centres perform work requiring specialist knowledge and give advice on disease
problems to private practitioners. In Scotland a similar service is provided by
the investigation centres of the three Scottish agricultural colleges.
In Northern Ireland the veterinary services are organised similarly to those
in Great Britain but are administered separately by the Department of
Agriculture for Northern Ireland. Animal health control policies and the
geographical situation have kept the country free from nearly all the major
epizootic diseases, including swine vesicular disease. A Brucellosis Eradica¬
tion Scheme has been successfully carried out and in December 1971 Northern
Ireland was declared a brucellosis-free country. The full-time veterinary
service is supplemented by the central veterinary laboratory at Stormont,
Belfast.
The plant health services, operated by the agricultural departments, are
responsible for statutory controls designed to limit the spread of plant pests
and diseases present in Britain and prevent the introduction of new ones from
abroad. They also issue the health certificates required by other countries to
accompany plant material imported from Britain. \ oluntary certification
schemes are operated to encourage the development of healthy, vigorous and
true-to-type planting stocks. The Plant Pathology Laboratory at Harpenden,
Hertfordshire, and the Agricultural Scientific Services Station, East Craigs,
Edinburgh, provide scientific and technical advice on which statutory controls
and certification schemes are based.
AGRICULTURE, FISHERIES AND FORESTRY 299
Pests and Storage 1 he Ministry of Agriculture’s Pest Infestation Control Laboratory provides
scientific and technical advice on harmful mammals and birds and on insects,
mites and moulds associated with grain and other stored food products. The
laboratory s headquarters is at Slough, Berkshire, where storage problems are
studied; vertebrate pests are studied at Tolworth, Surrey, and Worplesdon,
Surrey. The laboratory works closely with Regional Pest Officers who advise
farmers, local authorities and others on control techniques.
Agricultural Safeguards against the dangers which could arise from uncontrolled use of
Chemicals pesticides have been devised and are operating successfully. Regulations pro¬
vide protection for operators using the more toxic chemicals. The non-
statutory Pesticides Safety Precautions Scheme ensures that new pesticides
intended for use in agriculture and the home garden, forestry and food storage,
or new methods of using existing pesticides, are not introduced until enough
experimental work has been done on their possible hazards (including those of
users, consumers of treated produce, livestock or domestic animals and wild
life) to allow the Government to make recommendations for their safe use.
Products cleared for safety under the Pesticides Safety Precautions Scheme
may then be submitted through the Agricultural Chemicals Approval Scheme
for efficiency approval. The purpose of this scheme is to enable users and
advisers to choose efficient proprietary brands of agricultural chemicals.
A key role in the administration of the safety scheme is played by the
Government’s Advisory Committee on Pesticides and Other Toxic Chemicals
which keeps under review all risks that may arise from the use of pesticides.
Veterinary
Medicinal
Products
The Medicines Act 1968 provides through a system of licensing for the control
of the manufacture, sale and supply of both human and veterinary medicinal
products (including those used in animal feedingstuffs). These controls are
being brought into operation in stages. The licensing authority (the British
health and agriculture ministers) is advised by the Medicines Commission,
the Veterinary Products Committee, on the safety, quality and efficacy of
veterinary medicinal products, and by other expert licensing committees.
Until the Medicines Act is fully in operation, existing controls restricting the
use of certain antibiotics in animal husbandry and veterinary medicine will be
kept in force.
Safety at Work The Safety Inspectors of the agricultural departments advise farmers and
workers about health and safety with particular reference to the Health and
Safety at Work Act 1974. They are also responsible for enforcing the relevant
statutory provisions including regulations which cover such matters as the
guarding of field and stationary machinery, the safeguarding of work-places,
and the fitting of safety cabs to tractors.
ADVISORY In England and Wales scientific, technological and management advice and
SERVICE services are available through the Agricultural Development and Advisory
Service (ADAS) which operates mainly from the ministry’s regional and
divisional offices. The service also helps to identify problems requiring inves¬
tigation and research; to suggest priorities for such work and where appropriate
to contribute to possible solutions. ADAS provides free and impartial advice
to landowners, farmers and growers but charges are made for certain labora¬
tory and other services.
3°o
BRITAIN 1976: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
In Scotland the agricultural advisory service is provided by the three
regional independent colleges which are financed almost entirely by public
funds. The nature of service is similar to that provided by the ADAS and
covers all branches of advice.
Advisory work in Northern Ireland is under the direction of the Chief
Inspector of the Department of Agriculture and Advisory Centres are located
in the main provincial towns. The resources of the agricultural colleges, the
research centres and the specialist divisions of the department are available to
the advisory service.

Agricultural research and development in Britain, including that carried out
by the Agricultural Research Council (ARC) and the universities, is men¬
tioned on p. 410. The Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food carries out
research and development at its own laboratories and on the 22 experimental
farms and horticulture stations operated by ADAS, and has funds which are
used to commission work from the ARC, the Natural Environment Research
Council and outside research organisations. In England and W ales, research
in agricultural economics is undertaken by 12 university departments of
agricultural economics. Nine of these and one college of agriculture conduct
work on farm incomes and the economics of particular products for the minis¬
try (see p. 292). In Scotland, agricultural economists are on the staff of the
three agricultural colleges and the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries
for Scotland.
The Northern Ireland Department of Agriculture has an Economics and
Statistics Division and eight other research divisions.
Agricultural
Education and
Training
Thirteen universities in England and Wales, three in Scotland and one in
Northern Ireland provide degree and postgraduate courses in agriculture or
agricultural sciences. The National College of Agricultural Engineering at
Silsoe, Bedfordshire, offers degree and postgraduate courses. Sandwich courses
leading to a Higher National Diploma are available at eight agricultural
colleges in England and Wales and there are nearly 50 local authority and
other agricultural colleges providing full-time courses on different aspects of
agriculture, horticulture, forestry and farm management. A centre for Euro¬
pean agricultural studies is based at London University s Wye College at
Ashford. In Scotland the three agricultural colleges which provide the advisory
services are also teaching establishments, associated with the agricultural
departments of the neighbouring universities. They mainly provide sandwich
courses leading to Higher and Ordinary National Diplomas, post-diploma
courses and certain short courses. In Northern Ireland degree courses in
agriculture and food science are provided at Queen’s University, Belfast.
Courses below this level are provided at three residential colleges run by the
Department of Agriculture.
Local education authorities throughout Britain provide full-time, block-
release, day-release and other part-time courses for farmers, farm workers and
horticulturists, as well as an advisory service for domestic producers.
The Agricultural Training Board, established under the Industrial Training
Act, provides a training advisory service and organises training courses in
agricultural and horticultural subjects. The board pays grants towards the
cost of career training for new entrants, for attendance at approved short
courses, training groups and schemes of training at places of work for those
already engaged in the industry.

FISHERIES
301
Fishing Ports
Methods of
Sea Fishing
The Fishing
Fleet
The industry falls into three main divisions, concerned respectively with white
fish, pelagic fish and shellfish. The major element of the catch (about 89 per
cent by weight) is white fish: the catches of pelagic fish comprise about 2 per
cent and shellfish 9 per cent of the total catch. The principal white fish (in
terms of value) are demersal species which live near the sea bed, such as cod,
haddock, plaice, coalfish (saithe), whiting, soles and skate. The pelagic species
live mainly in midwater or near the surface: they include herring, sprats and
mackerel, of which herring is the most important. Shell-fish include Crustacea
(such as lobsters, nephrops and crabs) and molluscs (such as escallops,
mussels, cockles, queens and oysters).
Britain’s exclusive fishing limits were extended to 12 miles in 1964, although
a number of states enjoy historic rights allowing them to fish in designated
parts of 6-12-mile belt for designated species for which they have traditionally
fished. Under the terms of the Common Fisheries Policy of the European
Community, vessels registered in member states may also fish within British
waters although, by virtue of arrangements embodied in the Treaty of
Accession, which are due for revision by 1982, they are currently excluded
from all areas within 6 miles and certain areas between 6 and 12 miles.
The principal fishing ports in England and Wales are Hull, Grimsby, Fleet-
wood, North Shields, Lowestoft, Brixham, Newlyn and Milford Haven. In
Scotland the chief ports for white fish are Aberdeen, Peterhead, Fraserburgh,
Lossiemouth, Buckie and Lerwick. Herring landings are made mainly at the
east coast port of Fraserburgh, the west coast ports of Stornoway, Ullapool,
Mallaig, Oban and Ayr and in the Shetland Islands. In Northern Ireland the
main fishing ports are Kilkeel, Portavogie and Ardglass.
The chief methods of catching fish are by trawling, seining, purse-seining,
lining and ring netting. Trawling is carried out in the distant and near waters
for all species of demersal fish. Seining is also used for catching demersal fish
all the year round, mainly in the North Sea, the Minches, the Firth of Clyde
and the Irish Sea.
The pelagic fisheries are seasonal. There is summer fishing for herring based
on the Shetlands, the east coast ports of Scotland and the north-east coast ports
of England. Other seasonal fisheries take place off the west coast of Scotland, in
the Isle of Man area and off southern Ireland and off East Anglia. A mackerel
fishery takes place, mainly during the winter, off south-west England.
The inshore fisheries comprise a great diversity of types of vessels and
methods of capture; there are extensive fisheries for crabs, lobsters, shrimps,
mussels, escallops, cockles and oysters, and, off Scotland, north-east England
and in the Irish Sea there are valuable catches of nephrops (Norway lobsters
or Dublin Bay prawns).
Distant water trawlers, which operate mainly from Hull, Grimsby and Fleet-
wood, number about 160. They are 140 feet (42-5 metres) and over in length
and most of them make voyages lasting up to 80 days to fishing grounds off
Iceland, in the Barents Sea, around Bear Island and off the coasts of Norway
and Greenland. Freezer trawlers and factory ships, which spend from one to
six months at sea and freeze much or all of their catch, in some cases as
fillets, have become an important part of the distant water fleet in recent years
and number about 38. There are about 430 Scottish seiners, and about 210

operating from English ports. Excluding seiners, there are about 200 near and
middle water vessels of between 80 and 139 feet (24-5 and 42 5 metres) long
and most of them work nearer home, making voyages lasting from a few days
up to more than two weeks, although some of the larger vessels fish regularly
off the Faroes and seasonally as far afield as Iceland. Included in the near
water group are vessels engaged in fishing for herring which normally make
daily landings. The inshore group consists of some 2,000 vessels of over 40
feet (12-3 metres) and over 4,000 smaller vessels, many of which do not fish
regularly. The majority are seldom at sea for longer than two or three days
and more usually make daily landings, often fishing within sight of land,
although some seiners operate for up to three weeks in the North Sea.
In the British fishing industry in 1974 there were about 18,000 fishermen
in regular employment and some 4,500 occasionally employed; about two-
fifths of the former and one-third of the latter were from Scottish ports. In
Northern Ireland there are about 600 regular fishermen and 200 part-time.
In 1974 landings of all types of fish (excluding salmon and trout) by British
fishing vessels totalled 470,000 tons (369,000 tons of demersal fish, 60,000
tons of pelagic and 41,000 tons of shellfish), valued at £88 million. Cod
accounted for 43 per cent of the total value of demersal and pelagic fish landed
by British vessels; haddock (19 per cent) and plaice (6 per cent) were the other
most important sources of earnings to the industry.
Imports of all fresh, frozen and cured fish and shellfish totalled 125,000 tons
valued at nearly £58 million. Imports of canned and preserved fish and shell¬
fish amounted to 64,000 tons valued at nearly £62 million. Imports of fish meal
amounted to 195,000 tons, worth £36 million, and those of fish oils to 179,000
tons, worth over £39 million. Exports and re-exports of fish and fish products
amounted to 170,000 tons and were worth over £53 million.
Weekly disposals of fresh, frozen and cured fish (excluding shellfish and
imported canned fish) in Britain averaged about 14,000 tons landed weight in
1974. Total fish consumption, which has declined from its peak of 28-7 lb.
(13 kg.) per head in 1948 on an edible weight basis, was running at a level of
approximately i5'3 lb (6-9 kg.) a head in I974- Home production provided
about 85 percent of supplies.
Processing and packaging of fish are the subject of continuing research and
development. The growth of quick-frozen fish production has radically altered
the structure of the industry. With the increase in quick-freezing (which now
processes just over a quarter of all white fish landings), new export outlets have
opened up for white fish, which account for almost half the total exports of
fish and fish preparations. Experiments are being carried out in the catching
and processing, for human consumption and fish meal, of previously under¬
exploited species of fish of which large stocks are known to exist in the sea
adjacent to the British Isles.
A valuable by-product of the industry is the manufacture of fish meal for
animal food and, to a much lesser extent, for fertilisers. Home production of
white fish meal and herring meal in 1974 was 68,000 tons.
The most valuable freshwater fish are salmon and sea-trout. Sea fishing for
salmon is prohibited in a wide area around the British Isles outside exclusive
fishery limits. Within the limits drift netting and certain other methods are
prohibited off the coast of Scotland but are permitted under licence off Eng¬
land, Wales and Northern Ireland. In Scotland, where salmon fishing is a

private right, the main commercial methods are fixed nets on the coast out¬
side estuaries and sweep netting within estuaries and in rivers. Water authority
licences are required for the limited amount of estuary and river netting carried
out in England and Wales. In England and Wales the landed value of the
salmon catch is approximately £600,000 a year, in Scotland it amounts to
about £3 million, and in Northern Ireland to some £243,300. In Northern
Ireland, eels worth £360,000 were captured in 1974 by long lines and by eel
nets placed in river weirs.
The principal method of distribution is through wholesalers, located at the
ports, who buy at the auctions and sell to inland wholesalers as well as directly
to retail outlets; the port wholesalers prepare the fish for onward shipment.
Fish lorries, including insulated and refrigerated vehicles, transport the catch
daily from the ports to inland centres, although rail transport is still used from
some ports. The principal inland wholesale distributing centre for fish is
Billingsgate Market in London, which handles about 180 tons a day, but other
large cities also have central fish markets. Retail sales are handled by fish¬
mongers and fish friers; the latter use about a third of the landings of white
fish.
Trawler-owning companies have entered into the marketing and distribu¬
tive system. This process has been encouraged by the growing popularity of
quick-frozen consumer packs, which are sold mainly by other retail outlets.
The government departments mainly responsible for the administration of
legislation concerning the fishing industry are the Ministry of Agriculture,
Fisheries and Food, the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries for Scotland
and the Department of Agriculture for Northern Ireland. The safety and
welfare of crews of fishing vessels and other matters common to shipping
generally are provided for under the Merchant Shipping Acts administered by
the Department of Trade. Research is carried out by the fisheries departments.
From 1st February 1973 the provisions of the Common Fisheries Policy of
the European Community, based on the establishment of a common organisa¬
tion of the market and a common structural policy, have applied in Britain. The
common organisation of the market aims at assisting in the adaptation of
supplies to marketing requirements while ensuring, as far as possible, a
reasonable return to producers, by means of the establishment of a common
grading and price system, and common rules on competition. The responsi¬
bility for market organisation is placed largely in the hands of the industry
itself through producers’ organisations established on the initiative of the
industry. Tariff adjustments for intra-Community trade in fish and trade with
third countries are following the general agricultural timetable (see p. 293).
The common structural policy covers measures aimed at promoting the
harmonious and balanced development of the fishing industry and the rational
exploitation of resources. It covers access to waters under the jurisdiction of
member states, conservation in coastal waters and common measures for the
financing of the improvement of the structure of the fishing industry and the
provision of an equitable standard of living for those engaged in it.
The Herring Industry Board was set up to reorganise, develop and regulate
the herring industry and consists of a chairman and two other members, all
part-time and independent of the industry, who are appointed jointly by the
Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, and the Secretaries of State for
3°4
The White Fish

Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. The board, whose activities are
financed partly by levies and licence fees and partly by government grants
and loans, is advised by the Herring Industry Advisory Council, which repre¬
sents all sections of the industry and consumers.
The functions of the board include the promotion of sales of herring, both
at home and abroad, and the application of the benefits of technical progress
to the industry, including the adoption of new methods of catching, processing
and distributing herring. The board administers the government grant and
loan schemes which provide for assistance towards the purchase of new fishing
vessels, and the improvement of existing vessels. Fishermen may also obtain
loans from the board towards the purchase of second-hand vessels under 80
feet in length and towards the cost of new nets and gear. Up to 31st March
1975 about £57 million in loans and £6-9 million in grants had been approved.
The function of the White Fish Authority is to reorganise, develop and regulate
the white fish industry, and that of its Committee for Scotland and Northern
Ireland is to advise the authority about the exercise and performance of its
functions in Scotland and Northern Ireland. The authority is composed of a
chairman and six members, and the Scottish and Northern Ireland Committee
of five members and a chairman who is a member of the authority; member¬
ship is by appropriate ministerial appointment. The White Fish Industry
Advisory Council, which represents the various interests of the fishing
industry, advises the authority about the exercise and performance of its
functions.
The White Fish Authority administers government grant and loan schemes
for the purchase of new fishing vessels and engines and the improvement of
existing vessels. It administers loans for the purchase of nets and gear and
loans are made available to processors, co-operatives, etc., to acquire, recondi¬
tion or improve facilities. Up to 31st March 1975 about £43 million in loans
and £52 million in grants had been approved. Its other activities are financed
by levies on first-hand sales of most white fish, and a government grant to¬
wards research and development. In 1973 the Herring Industry Board and
White Fish Authority formed a unified administration for the expected
development of fisheries administration under the common fisheries policy.
FORESTRY
The estimated total area of woodland in Great Britain is 4-8 million acres
(1-94 million hectares), or about 8| per cent of the total land area; nearly half
of the area is in England, two-fifths in Scotland, the remainder in Wales.
The area of productive forest managed by the Forestry Commission, at
1-98 million acres (o-8o million hectares) represents 41 per cent of the total.
The annual rate of productive forest expansion is currently about 45,000 acres
(18,000 hectares) by the commission mainly in Scotland, and a similar area by
private woodland owners. The commission’s programme includes consider¬
able planting in upland areas, and consists mainly of conifers because of the
difficult site conditions encountered and because over 90 per cent of industrial
demand which the commission is primarily charged with supplying is for
softwoods. The major species used are Sitka spruce, Lodgepole pine, Scots
pine, Corsican pine and larches. In the older woodlands and taking the country
as a whole, the most common coniferous trees are Scots pine, Sitka spruce,
Norway spruce and the larches; among the broadleaved, beech and oak occur
widely.

Total employment in state and private forests was 22,000 in 1974 and a
further 11,000 were engaged in the transport and milling of home-grown
timber.
Except for the period of the two world wars, when much over-felling took
place, home woodlands have until recent years made only a limited contribu¬
tion to the nation’s consumption of wood and wood products, as only some 30
per cent of the commission’s woodlands are yet in production. Britain imports
92 per cent of its needs by volume and a higher proportion still by value, the
total import cost of wood and wood products including pulp and paper being
nearly £1,684 million in 1974 of which £588 million was for timber imports.
The Forestry Commission is the national forestry authority charged with
promoting the interests of forestry, the development of afforestation and the
production and supply of timber in Great Britain. The commission consists of
a part-time chairman, a full-time director general, three full-time executive
commissioners and five part-time commissioners. The commissioners comply
with directions given by the forestry ministers, who are the Minister of Agri¬
culture, Fisheries and Food and the Secretaries of State for Scotland and Wales.
Northern Ireland has its own separate organisation (see p. 307). New policies,
resulting from an earlier forestry review, were announced in 1974. Since 1974
the main objective of forestry in Great Britain, timber production, has taken
account of amenity, environmental and employment criteria.
The commission’s total estate covers some 3 million acres (1-2 million
hectares) and includes 2-2 million acres (0-89 million hectares) of forest land,
of which over 1-9 million (o-8o million hectares) are under trees in 250
forests distributed throughout England, Scotland and Wales. All these forests
are covered by management plans which provide for such work as planting,
road construction, thinning, fire protection and timber production, facilities
for public recreation, wildlife conservation and the landscaping of plantations.
Much of the Forestry Commission’s new planting in Scotland is in the
Highland counties, where poorer types of land, such as sour, peaty soil which
is unsuitable for agricultural purposes, are used, having become suitable for
forestry as a result of deep ploughing and fertilisation.
As more of its coniferous woods reach the production stage the commission,
as managers of the National Forestry Enterprise, has assumed an increasingly
important role as a timber seller and has encouraged the setting up of some 20
major new timber-using industries since the mid-1960s.
Production of felled and thinned timber from commission woodlands
amounted to i-6 million cubic metres in 1974-75. Some of this produce is
meeting traditional requirements of the coal mines but much is taken by the
paper pulp industry, by sawmills and by factories established to make chip¬
board, fibreboard and wood wool.
The Forestry Fund was constituted under the 1919 Forestry Act; from it is
paid all the expenditure of the Forestry Commissioners and into it are paid
amounts voted annually by Parliament, together with the commission’s
receipts from sales of produce, rentals and other sources. In the period ended
31st March 1974 drawings from funds voted by Parliament amounted to
£i3'5 million, and receipts were £16-9 million.
Privately owned woods comprise nearly 60 per cent of the total forest area in
Great Britain and contain most of the mature and semi-mature timber. The
size of woodlands in individual ownership ranges from a few acres to several

thousand acres, and some 40 per cent of the private woodland area is in small
ownerships—that is, owners of up to about 200 acres (80 hectares).
The effective management of private woodlands is encouraged by the pro¬
vision of grants. In 1974 a single woodlands dedication scheme replaced the
three earlier schemes. Under the new arrangements once-for-all planting
grants, based on acreage, are made available, in return for which owners accept
a continuing obligation to manage their woodlands in accordance with sound
forestry practice. There are premium rates of grant for planting hardwoods.
The Forestry Commission consults with the agricultural departments and
local planning authorities before administering grant aid for private forestry.
Woodland owners are represented, in their relations with the Forestry Com¬
mission, by the Forestry Committee of Great Britain, which co-ordinates the
work of two associations of woodland owners: the Timber Growers’ Organisa¬
tion (for owners in England and Wales) and the Scottish Woodland Owners’
Association.
Under the Forestry Act 1967, the Forestry Commissioners have set up for
Great Britain the Home Grown Timber Advisory Committee (HGTAC) to
advise on certain statutory functions, including promoting the interests of
forestry and the production and supply of timber. The HGTAC includes
representatives of associations of woodland owners, timber merchants, pro¬
cessors, and other major timber users and the trade unions, under an inde¬
pendent chairman. The HGTAC maintains a technical sub-committee to
advise it on subjects such as harvesting, transport and utilisation of home¬
grown timber.
The Forestry Commissioners also maintain National Committees for
England, Scotland and Wales, which act in an advisory capacity, particularly
on the social, recreational and amenity aspects of the commissioners’ activities
and relationships with other land users. The commissioners also maintain a
regional advisory committee for each conservancy, whose members represent
local amenity and planning interests as well as the forestry industry, and,
because of its special nature, a consultative panel for the New Forest.
Forestry education is the responsibility of the education departments. Degree
courses in forestry and associated studies are provided at four universities
(Aberdeen, Bangor, Edinburgh and Oxford) and supervisory level courses
are run at Newton Rigg, near Penrith in Cumbria.
The Forestry Training Council, whose membership is representative of
forestry employers (both commission and private) and the trade unions, the
education services, the forestry societies and the relevant industrial training
boards, makes recommendations to the industry for meeting requirements for
training and associated further education, and encourages co-operation at all
levels between the agencies and authorities concerned. The Furniture and
Timber Industry Training Board is concerned with training for private sector
employees in the home timber trade.
Research at the commission’s Southern Forest Research Station at Alice
Holt Lodge in Surrey is largely concerned with lowland forests, landscaping
and amenity problems, and with the study of hardwood trees. Work at the
Northern Research Station at Roslin near Edinburgh is linked to the needs of
forest management and upland forestry. Expenditure on research work in
Great Britain amounted to £ 1-51 million in 1973-74. This sum included grants
for special forestry research work to various institutions and to university
departments including the Commonwealth Forestry Institute at Oxford,

which is also financed by the university, the Ministry of Overseas Develop¬
ment and overseas governments. Research into the qualities and uses of home¬
grown timber is carried out by Princes Risborough Laboratory, and also by
grant-aided research associations.
The Department of Agriculture is the forest authority for Northern Ireland. It
can acquire and manage land, and give financial and technical assistance to
private planting. It has introduced measures for the protection of all woodlands
against destruction by over-cutting, fire or depredation by animals.
The state forest area has grown steadily since the end of the second world
war. Over 157,000 acres (63,500 hectares) have been acquired, of which over
113,000 acres (45,700 hectares) have been planted.
Financial provision is made by sums voted annually by Parliament and from
receipts from forest produce and other sources. About 1,600 people are em¬
ployed in the state forests. There are also about 36,000 acres (15,000 hectares)
of privately owned forests, and private planting is assisted by schemes for the
supply of young trees from the department’s nurseries at a low cost, by grants
towards the cost of the establishment and maintenance of plantations and by
free technical advice.
15 Transport and
Communications
Transport and communications employed some 1-5 million people in Great
Britain in June 1974 and accounted for 6 per cent of the employed labour
force. Of these, 449,000 employees were engaged in road passenger transport
and road haulage contracting, 220,000 in railways, 434,000 in postal services
and telecommunications, 76,000 in port and inland water transport, 86,000
in sea transport, 78,000 in air transport and 140,000 in other transport
services and storage. Transport and communications contribute over 9 per
cent of the gross national product and are responsible for a rather higher
proportion of the nation’s gross domestic fixed capital formation.
SEA TRANSPORT
SHIPPING Of the world’s active sea-going tonnage of 100 gross tons1 and over, some 10
per cent is registered in Britain, making the British merchant fleet, at 31 6
million gross tons, the third largest in active employment after those of Liberia
and Japan. The oil tanker fleet, at 15-2 million gross tons, is the world’s third
largest, and the ore and bulk carrier fleet, at 7-6 million gross tons, the fourth
largest. The British fleet has grown steadily, particularly over the last few
years; since 1969 it has increased by 32 per cent, much of the new tonnage
consisting of purpose-built container, tanker and bulk carrier vessels.
Role of The Department of Trade is the government department responsible for most
the Government matters connected with merchant shipping. Under the Merchant Shipping
Acts, it administers many regulations for marine safety and welfare, for
instance: certifying the load-line (or Plimsoll line) that shows that a ship is
not overloaded; ensuring that standards of safety are observed in ship con¬
struction; ensuring the provision of adequate life-saving, fire-fighting and
radio equipment; and dealing with the discipline, professional standards,
health and accommodation of seamen. Most of the work which these respon¬
sibilities entail is carried out by the staff of the Marine Survey and Mercantile
Marine Offices at the ports. There is also a Registrar General of Shipping and
Seamen, in whose office at Cardiff a complete record of all British ships is kept.
THE MERCHANT In July 1974, 29-4 million gross tons of trading vessels of 100 gross tons and
FLEET over were both owned and registered in Britain.2 These ships are usually
employed as follows: 5-3 million gross tons as foreign-going passenger and
cargo liners, 8-i million gross tons as foreign-going tramps; 15-2 million gross
1 One gross ton (g.t.) = 100 cubic feet (2'83 cubic metres). One deadweight ton (d.w.t.)
= 1 long ton (2,240 lb. or 1,016 kilogrammes). Gross tonnage indicates the total capacity
of the enclosed space on a ship. Deadweight tonnage denotes the maximum load which
a vessel can carry before submerging the load-line.
2 The remaining tonnage included fishing vessels, tugs, river and estuary craft, Ministry
of Defence vessels (mostly tankers) not usually engaged in the commercial carriage of
cargo, and shipping registered in Britain but owned in other Commonwealth countries.

tons as foreign-going tankers; and 755,000 gross tons in coasting and trade with
ports between the Elbe and Brest (home trades). Rapid technological change in
the merchant fleet is reflected in the current composition. Vessels are becoming
obsolete over a shorter period and as they do so are being replaced by larger
ships, with generally lower building costs per ton. Labour-saving devices and
faster turn-round facilities are helping to combat rising costs, while ship¬
owners are paying greater attention to operating vessels at speeds of optimum
fuel efficiency following increased fuel costs.
The tendency to greater average size has been most marked in tankers, bulk
carriers and container vessels. Tanker size has increased from a maximum of
about 20,000 deadweight tons in the early 1950s to nearly 500,000 deadweight
tons for the largest ocean-going tankers, but the recent depression in the world
tanker market is resulting in a trend towards tankers in the medium tonnage
range. Several combined carriers of over 200,000 deadweight tons are now in
operation. The largest modern container ships of up to 60,000 gross tons have
a capacity of 2,800 containers of 20-foot (6-metre) equivalent units. The grow¬
ing use of container and roll-on/roll-off vessels has resulted in the safer and
quicker carriage of a wide range of goods.
Nearly the whole of the British merchant fleet is privately owned, apart from
some ships which are owned and/or operated by nationalised industries as
part of their normal commercial operations, one example being British Rail
(see p. 316). About two-thirds of the tanker fleet belongs to the oil companies,
although there are a few independent tanker operators. British liner tonnage
is dominated by a relatively small number of large groups. Some shipowners
have delegated the management of their fleets to specialist ship management
companies. Several companies are participating in consortia, particularly
where heavy investment in ships and facilities is required, as with container
and bulk cargo vessels.
Almost all Britain’s overseas trade by weight, nearly four-fifths by value, is
carried by sea. Ships registered in Britain carry 33 per cent by weight, 45 per
cent by value, of foreign seaborne trade. Tanker cargoes, mostly imports of
crude oil, account for over half seaborne foreign trade by weight but less than
one-tenth by value, and foodstuffs and manufactured goods account for over
four-fifths by value.
The proportion of passengers travelling to or from Britain by sea is less than
one-third, compared with about one-half in the early 1960s. Sea traffic
between Britain and the continent of Europe has doubled since the early
1960s, reflecting the growing popularity of motoring holidays, while the
number travelling on routes between Britain and countries outside Europe
and the Mediterranean has fallen by three-quarters, with the growing competi¬
tion of air travel.
There were some 89,000 seamen employed by the merchant fleet in 1971,
according to a census of seamen, of whom some 55,000 were domiciled in
Britain.
The Department of Trade holds examinations for, and issues certificates of
competency to, ship s officers as master, first mate and second mate of foreign-
gomg ships, or master and mate of home trade ships and as first-class engineer
and second-class engineer. Officers may not normally serve on board ships in
these grades unless they hold the appropriate, or a higher, certificate.

Radio officers are required to hold certificates of competency in radio¬
telegraphy issued by the Home Office on the results of an open examination.
A seaman may not be rated an efficient deck hand unless he holds a certifi¬
cate issued by the Department of Trade. To qualify for this certificate he must
be not less than 18 years old, have not less than one year’s sea service and pass
a Department of Trade examination. To become rated as able seaman a
seaman must have served at least three years at sea on deck. Seamen qualify
by seniority and efficiency for promotion to the rating of petty officer. Service
as a deck rating qualifies for the purpose of admission to the examination for
a second mate’s foreign-going, or home trade mate’s certificate.
There are some 50 establishments providing full-time vocational training
for seafarers. Most deck and catering junior ratings are trained at the National
Sea Training School at Gravesend, Kent, claimed to be the world s largest
and most modern ratings’ establishment. It trains some 2,000 ratings a year.
The Merchant Navy Training Board promotes the instruction and studies
of apprentices, cadets and ratings who are preparing for their examinations for
the various certificates of competency.
Wages and conditions of employment of the majority of seafarers are nego¬
tiated by the National Maritime Board, composed of equal numbers of
representatives of the General Council of British Shipping and seafarers
trade unions. Most officers and ratings are registered with the Merchant Navy
Establishment Administration. Minimum wages and holidays with pay are
guaranteed for both officers and ratings. The Merchant Navy Established
Service Scheme, introduced in 1947, removed a great deal of the uncertainty
formerly associated with a seafaring life. Under the latest scheme seafarers
are employed either as ‘registered seafarers’ or they may enter into a company
service contract, for a minimum of one year, for employment on the ships of
a particular company. Registered seafarers receive special benefits between
voyages in addition to the normal state benefits. The benefits paid to company
service contract seafarers must be at least equivalent to those paid to registered
seafarers.
The main organisations concerned with the activities, interests and common
problems of the industry are as follows:
Lloyd’s Register is an organisation (distinct from the Society of Lloyd’s, see
p. 378) which surveys and classifies ships with particular regard to their safety
and operational efficiency. It accepts responsibility for surveying and giving
technical advice on vessels of all flags from the initial stages of building, at
regular intervals during their service, and after casualties.
The representative body speaking for shipowners generally (excluding, for
the most part, owners of fishing vessels) is the General Council of British
Shipping which became fully operative on 1st March 1975 as a result of the
merger of the Chamber of Shipping of the United Kingdom and the British
Shipping Federation. Other organisations represent companies specialising in
a particular trade or type of cargo.
The British Shippers’ Council, formed in 1955, represents the shipping
interests of exporters and importers in matters of both national and inter¬
national concern.
British shipping companies operating liners have associated with each other
and with the companies of other countries operating on the same routes in a

series of ‘conferences’ designed to secure standardisation and stability of rates,
and to maintain frequency and regularity of services. The essential principle
of a conference is the establishment of a common tariff of freight rates or
passenger fares from each port of departure. Each conference meets from
time to time to review and revise existing rates and practices. There are about
100 conferences dealing with trade to and from Britain.
The Baltic Mercantile and Shipping Exchange, which originated in one of
London’s seventeenth-century coffee houses, is the world’s largest market
for the chartering of ships of all nationalities. Shipbrokers and merchants’
representatives meet there to arrange the chartering of dry-cargo tramp ships
for the carriage of goods to and from all parts of the world. In addition sale
and purchase of ships, chartering of aircraft and trade in certain commodities
are carried on there.
The Department of Trade’s responsibilities for safety include administration
of the Coastguard Service, and certain administrative functions concerning
lighthouses and pilotage. The department makes regulations to ensure safety
of navigation and conducts inquiries into shipping casualties and accidents.
The Coastguard Service co-ordinates search and rescue measures for vessels in
distress off the coasts of Britain, and gives direct assistance where appropriate.
There are some 600 regular coastguards and about 8,000 part-time auxiliary
coastguards. Constant watch is maintained all the year round at certain main
stations and where necessary at a number of others. During 1974 life-saving
action was taken on 5,572 occasions.
The Coastguard Service calls upon shipping, the lifeboats of the Royal
National Life-boat Institution, and Service aircraft to assist as necessary. It
may call upon the services of long-range civilian helicopters based at Aberdeen
and Sumburgh (Shetland). The Royal National Life-boat Institution is sup¬
ported entirely by voluntary contributions, and depends for its operation on
voluntary workers. From its foundation in 1824 to the end of 1974 it saved
99,819 lives. Lifeboats were launched 2,890 times in 1974 and rescued 1,351
people.
The general lighthouse authority for England and Wales, the Channel Islands
and Gibraltar is the Corporation of Trinity House, which received its first
Royal Charter in the sixteenth century and is administered by a board of Elder
Brethren elected from the Royal Navy and the Merchant Navy. Lighthouses
in Scotland and Ireland are the responsibility respectively of the Northern
Lighthouse Board and the Commissioners of Irish Lights. These authorities
control about 180 lighthouses, many minor lights and buoys, and a number of
lightships, some of which are being replaced by unattended sea marks or by
light towers.
Trinity House is the chief pilotage authority, licensing some 725 pilots in
41 districts in England and Wales, including London, Southampton and
Milford Haven. In some cases the harbour authority or local council is the
pilotage authority. In Britain there are 45 pilotage authorities for the 90
pilotage districts and over 1,600 licensed pilots.
The first traffic separation scheme adopted by the Inter-Governmental Mari¬
time Consultative Organisation (IMCO—a United Nations agency with

headquarters in London) was introduced in the Dover Strait, one of the world’s
most congested seaways, on a voluntary basis in 1967. It was revised, extended
and made mandatory in 1972, and now stretches from the Greenwich meridian
in the Channel as far as other separation schemes operating in the southern
North Sea. It consists of inshore traffic zones on each side of the Channel for
coastal shipping, and main traffic lanes in the centre. Britain and France operate
radar surveillance services which keep watch on ships not conforming to the
traffic separation scheme and broadcast navigational information to ships in
the Dover Strait. The two countries have joint plans to develop these services
with the establishment of further radar stations in the Dover Strait area.
The discharge of oil into British territorial waters was first restricted in 1922.
Britain is a party to the International Convention for the Prevention of the
Pollution of the Sea by Oil 1954. Amendments to the convention agreed upon
in 1969 prohibit the discharge of persistent oil or mixtures containing any oil
anywhere at sea except at a rate which has been shown not to cause harmful
pollution; no oil whatever may be discharged from cargo spaces of tankers
within 50 miles (80 kilometres) of land. Britain enforces these restrictions on
British registered ships through the Prevention of Oil Pollution Act ip?1)
administered by the Department of Trade. The International Convention for
the Prevention of Pollution from Ships 1973, concluded in London, will
eventually supersede the 1954 convention.
Dumping at sea is controlled by the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and
Food and the appropriate departments in Scotland and Northern Ireland,
through the Dumping at Sea Act 1974 which gave statutory backing to
voluntary arrangements which had been operated for several years. Under the
Act dumping is prohibited unless a licence has been obtained from the
appropriate department.
There are some 250 port authorities or public wharf operators in Britain, and
about 800 other undertakings engaged in various harbour operations, such as
stevedoring, towage, warehousing and lighterage. Port authorities are of four
main types: nationalised bodies, public trusts, local authorities and statutory
companies. The Government intends that all commercial ports and cargo¬
handling facilities should eventually be brought under public ownership and
control; this would involve the establishment of a new National Ports Authori¬
ty to exercise essential central controlling functions.
Ports run by nationalised undertakings represent over a quarter of total
capacity, the majority including Southampton, Hull, Immingham, Newport,
Cardiff and Swansea, being owned by the British Transport Docks Board. In
1974 shipping arrivals and departures at the board s docks totalled 136 3
million net registered tons (including fishing vessels) and total cargo handled
was 84 8 million tonnes. The British Railways Board controls certain ports,
which are largely used for the cross-Channel services of the railways (for
example, Folkestone, Holyhead, Heysham, Stranraer and Parkeston Quay at
Harwich) while the British Waterways Board owns Sharpness (Gloucester)
and Weston Point (Manchester).
The constitutions of public trust port authorities vary considerably. Tra¬
ditionally they consist of representatives of shippers, importers, exporters,
shipping companies, local authorities and trade unions. Examples of such
public trusts are the Port of London Authority, the Tees and Hartlepool Port
Authority, and the Belfast Harbour Commissioners. The reconstitution of a
number of port trusts is in progress. The main features are fewer members, a

greater proportion of executive members and the appointment of non-executive
members by the Government. Local authorities own about one-third of
Britain’s ports, including Bristol, Preston and Sunderland. Port undertakings
owned by statutory companies include Manchester, Liverpool and Felixstowe.
Many private ports deal with the traffic of individual industrial firms in com¬
modities such as petroleum, china clay and paper pulp.
Port authorities, in the main, operate with statutory powers and responsibili¬
ties set out in private Acts of Parliament. Most are members of the British
Ports Association which aims to further the common interests of port authori¬
ties in their relations with the Government, shipowners and traders.
The National Ports Council, set up as a statutory body under the Harbours
Act 1964, is financed by a levy on port authorities. It advises the Government
on major port developments and has various responsibilities in relation to
research, training, statistics and charges. It has encouraged the amalgamation
of harbour authorities in certain estuaries into single port authorities, as on
the Forth, Clyde and Tees.
Over 360 million tonnes of cargo a year pass through the ports of Great
Britain. Of this total, coastal traffic accounts for over 100 million tonnes
consisting mainly of petroleum and coal. Of nearly 211 million tonnes of
imports from overseas some 127 million tonnes consist of petroleum and
petroleum products. Manufactured goods form over one-third of exports.
A large proportion of the general cargo traffic through British ports is
handled by unitised transport methods in containers and roll-on goods
vehicles, which carried 30 million tonnes of goods in 1974. London, South¬
ampton, Felixstowe, Dover and Hull all handled large amounts.
London is Britain’s largest port for non-fuel traffic. In 1974, 46 million tonnes
of goods were handled, including 24-6 million tonnes of petroleum. South¬
ampton is Britain s second seaport by value of trade, the chief port for ocean
passenger traffic and the mam trading port on the south coast. In 1974 it
handled 27'5 million tonnes of goods. It has the advantages of deep water and
double tides. Medway is an important port for petroleum and petroleum
products. Some of the ports in the South East and East Anglia, particularly
Dover, Felixstowe and Harwich, are growing rapidly with modern facilities
especially for roll-on/roll-off and container traffic. Dover is Britain’s leading
port for passengers and roll-on/roll-off traffic.
Liverpool is a very important export outlet, especially to countries outside
Europe and the Mediterranean. The inland port of Manchester, reached from
the Mersey via the 36-mile (58-kilometre) Manchester Ship Canal, exports
manufactured goods and chemicals.
The port of Fees and Hartlepool handles petroleum products, chemicals,
iron and steel, and iron ore. The port of Tyne and some other north-east coast
ports, such as Blyth and Sunderland, have an important outward trade in
coal. Grimsby and Hull are Britain’s two main fishing ports; with Immingham
they also serve the industrial areas of northern England and the Midlands,
especially in trade with Scandinavian and Baltic ports. Immingham handles
imports of iron ore and crude oil and exports of coal and petroleum products.
Milford Haven, handling 59 million tonnes a year, is Britain’s major oil port
and now Britain’s leading seaport in terms of tonnage handled. Much of the
traffic through the other south Wales ports is connected with the local steel
industry imports of iron ore and exports of iron and steel, and tinplate.

BRITAIN 1976: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
In Scotland the principal port facilities serving the central industrial area
are Greenock (handling particularly containers and raw sugar) and Glasgow
(iron ore and grain) on the Clyde, and Grangemouth (containers and timber)
and Leith (grain and whisky) on the Forth. The Clyde also has a major crude
oil terminal at Finnart. Aberdeen is Britain’s third largest fishing port.
Belfast is the principal port of Northern Ireland and with Larne handles
the main traffic across the Irish Sea.
Most of the oil tankers coming to Britain to discharge crude oil are berthed at
special tanker terminals owned and operated by the oil companies to serve
their own refineries.
British ports offer the deepest water access in Northern Europe for fully
laden tankers to pipe crude oil direct to refineries. Milford Haven can accom¬
modate fully laden vessels of up to 275,000 deadweight tons on all tides at five
private oil company terminals. Finnart on the Clyde will accept vessels of
325,000 deadweight tons; it is frequently used in lightening operations to
allow part-laden vessels to proceed with shallower draft to other ports in
Northern Europe. At Tetney Haven off the mouth of the Humber, fully laden
tankers discharge at Britain’s first offshore mooring monobuoy, a large buoy
anchored in deep water with a connecting pipeline to the shore. A single-buoy
deep-water mooring is under construction at Amlwch, Gwynedd, to accom¬
modate the largest tankers afloat or projected. With the development of
oilfields in the North Sea, major new terminals for handling crude oil for
export are being provided on the Tees, at Hound Point on the Forth, Scapa
Flow in Orkney and Sullom Voe in Shetland.
Large-scale modernisation of the port transport industry has been taking place
in recent years, as a result both of the increase in Britain s trade, especially
with other European countries, and of technological changes affecting sea¬
going traffic. The growing size of tankers and bulk carriers has necessitated
more deep-water berths, while development of mechanical handling methods,
packaging of general cargo, containers and ‘roll-on/roll off services has created
a demand for new types of port facilities.
A major development at Tilbury, Port of London, costing £30 million over
a number of years, has provided 12 deep-water berths, four of them for
container traffic, and a riverside grain terminal. Another major scheme has
been the construction of the £50 million Royal Seaforth dock complex at
Liverpool which provides ten deep-water berths including four container
berths, a grain terminal and refrigerated meat berth, and two timber berths.
A new dock under construction at Bristol at a cost of some £28 million will
provide six berths and have the largest entrance lock in Britain; it is due to
open in 1976. Container facilities have been expanded at a cost of some
^14 million for the Far East traffic at Southampton and new facilities are
being built to accommodate the container service to South Africa, due to start
in 1977. Deep-sea container facilities have also been constructed at Felixstowe,
the Clyde, and Manchester. At Hull a major extension of roll-on/roll-off
facilities was completed in 1974- In Northern Ireland an expansion scheme at
Warrenpoint, providing new container and roll-on/roll-off facilities, was
completed in 1975. Modern ore terminals have been built at Port Talbot,
Redcar and Immingham and another is planned at Hunterston on the Clyde.
Port developments in connection with the exploration for, and production
of, offshore oil and gas are mainly in Scotland. Supply bases for offshore
vessels have been or are being built at Leith, Dundee, Montrose, Aberdeen,

Peterhead, Lyness (Orkney), and Lerwick and Sandwick in Shetland. Facili¬
ties have been developed at Leith, Invergorden and Immingham for handling
steel pipe and coating materials for submarine pipelines. Three new harbour
authorities have been established, partly to provide for the development of
facilities for offshore activities, for the Cromarty Firth, Orkney and Shetland.
About 70,000 people are employed in Britain’s port transport industry; of
these, 34,600 dockers, responsible for the physical and mechanical handling
of cargo, were registered with the National Dock Labour Board at the end of
I974-
The system of casual labour common among dock workers in the past has
gradually been superseded. In 1947 the National Dock Labour Board was
established to administer the Dock Workers Employment Scheme under which
registered dock workers received a minimum wage for attendance even when
no work was available. In 1967 each registered dock worker was placed in
employment on a permanent basis with an employer licensed by the port
authority, under the provisions of the Docks and Harbours Act 1966. Port
authorities are becoming more involved in cargo-handling and by the end of
I974 employed over half the registered dock workers. The Government is
proposing to extend the Dock Workers Employment Scheme so that it will
cover all significant cargo-handling activities at ports and wharves.
The hovercraft, a vehicle which rides on a cushion of air over both land and
water surfaces, was invented in Britain and has been in regular public passen¬
ger service around the coasts of Britain since 1965. Services are run by several
privately owned firms including Hoverlloyd Ltd., which has a purpose-built
hoverport at Pegwell Bay in connection with its car and passenger ferries
between Ramsgate and Calais, and Hovertravel Ltd., which operates across
the Solent to the Isle of W ight and has a subsidiary which does training and
charter work. Two publicly owned bodies, the British Railways Board and the
Scottish Transport Group, have hovercraft interests. British Rail’s subsidiary,
British Rail Hovercraft Ltd. (‘Seaspeed’), was set up in 1966, and is the world’s
largest commercial hovercraft operator. It runs regular services across the
Channel between Dover and Boulogne, and Dover and Calais, carrying
passengers and accompanied cars. It also operates two services across the
Solent, and takes on charter work.
INLAND TRANSPORT
The passenger and freight traffic of Great Britain is carried mainly by road.
However, rail, coastal shipping and, to a lesser extent, pipelines and inland
waterways are important in carrying certain types of freight, particularly bulk
goods. In 1974 about 65 per cent of freight, in terms of ton-mileage,1 travelled
by road, 17 per cent by rail, 15 per cent by coastal shipping, and 3 per cent by
pipeline and inland waterway.
Part of the inland transport system of Great Britain is publicly owned:
the railways, a large proportion of road passenger and some road haulage
services, most of the inland waterways and some of the vessels on them. Road
haulage is largely, and coastal shipping almost entirely, in the hands of private
enterprise.
1 Ton-mileage is calculated by multiplying the tonnage carried by the actual distance
it is transported.

BRITAIN 1976: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
In the third quarter of 1974 there were 17-2 million vehicles licensed for use
on the roads. Of these 13-6 million were motor cars, one million motor cycles,
scooters and mopeds and i 8 million road goods vehicles; about two-thirds of
the 79,000 public road passenger vehicles (excluding taxis) were publicly
owned. Private ownership of cars has been growing rapidly for many years and
the car is now the most popular form of travel within Great Britain.
The railways first came under government direction during the first world
war, and afterwards some 130 private companies were amalgamated into four
large regional groups under the Railways Act 1921. Thereafter they suffered
from the prolonged industrial depression and growing competition from road
transport, and following the second world war the Transport Act 1947 brought
the railways in Great Britain under public ownership as a single enterprise,
British Railways. Under the Transport Act 1962 the British Railways Board
was set up and came into existence in 1963 with sole responsibility for managing
railway affairs.
The Transport Act 1968 reduced the board’s capital debt and introduced
a system of grants to support individual unremunerative passenger services
which the Government considered necessary for social or economic reasons.
Following a comprehensive review of railway policy by the board and the
Government, completed in 1973, the Government decided to retain and
improve the railway network at roughly its present size. Under the Railways
Act 1974 the system of specific grants was replaced by a new general scheme
of government compensation to the British Railways Board for operating the
railway passenger network from 1st January 1975 ’’ Act also reduced the
board’s capital debt and increased its borrowing powers.
In 1974 the railway network operated by British Rail amounted to 11,289
route-miles (18,168 kilometres) of which 2,266 miles (3,647 kilometres) were
electrified. A total of 733 million passenger journeys was made and 175 million
tons of freight traffic carried by rail. Total railway receipts amounted to
£622 million (excluding grants). The board made a loss of £157-8 million
following interest payments of £7I-9 niillion. Capital expenditure amounted
to about £129 million. At the end of 1974 it employed 255,900 people and
operated 3,619 diesel and 352 electric locomotives, 3,427 diesel and 7,156
electric passenger multiple-unit vehicles, 7,154 passenger carriages and a fleet
of 241,400 freight vehicles. Several companies also own or lease rolling stock.
In 1974 British Transport Hotels Ltd. owned 30 hotels of which it managed
29. It controls Travellers-Fare, responsible for catering facilities on trains and
at stations. British Rail’s Shipping and International Services division, which
carries more sea-going passengers than any other fleet in the world, operated a
fleet of 63 vessels in 1974, providing passenger and freight services on most of
the important routes between Britain and the Irish Republic and on the short-
sea routes to the continent of Europe, as well as on some domestic routes.
British Rail Hovercraft Ltd. runs hovercraft services (see p. 315). In 1974
British Rail Engineering Ltd. had 14 main workshops, employing about
33,700 people, mostly on the repair and construction of British locomotives,
rolling stock and containers, although some manufacturing work is done for
export. ,
The Railway Technical Centre at Derby employs about 2,000 people and
controls a comprehensive research and development programme costing over
£5 million a year, part of which is met by direct government grants.

BRITAIN 1976: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
In recent years the most important developments have been the replacement
of steam by diesel and electric traction completed in 1968; the improvement
of inter-city passenger services with the emphasis on speed, reliability, com¬
fort and better train connections; and an increase in freight trainload traffic,
allowing higher speeds, and greater mechanisation in the carrying of coal,
other bulk commodities and containers. Further improvements to commuter
and inter-city passenger services and freight services are being made and the
standards of track and signalling raised to allow faster running speeds and
improved operating efficiency.
Although passenger route-mileage and rolling stock have been reduced since
1963, the number of passenger journeys has declined less and rolling stock is
used more intensively. This has been achieved during a period of substantial
growth in car ownership. Passenger services have been concentrated increas¬
ingly on the high-speed inter-city network, linking the main centres of Great
Britain, and on commuter routes in and around the large conurbations,
especially London and the South East. The board s plans for inter-city
services include a programme to replace old passenger coaches by new air-
conditioned stock. Some 59 ^8^ speed trains are on order; the prototype
entered regular passenger service on the route from London to Bristol and
Weston-super-Mare in May 1975 and the remainder will begin carrying
passengers in the Western Region in 197^ ^nd the Eastern Region at a later
date. They will operate at a sustained speed of 125 mph (201 km/h). Work is
in progress on track improvements and signalling, which already permit
speeds of up to 100 mph (161 km/h) in certain sections. Development work
is proceeding on an experimental advanced passenger train capable of speeds
up to 155 mph (250 km/h). Train speeds of up to 100 mph (161 km/h) are
also possible on parts of the London-Edinburgh line and the electrified west
coast route from London to Glasgow. This electrification scheme was the
largest capital investment project ever undertaken by the British Railways Board
and included station reconstruction, bridgeworks, new colour-light signalling
and new rolling stock. The first stage between London, Birmingham, Man¬
chester and Liverpool was completed in 1967 and led to an approximate
increase of 150 per cent in numbers of passengers. The second stage, an
extension of 235 route-miles (378 kilometres) to Glasgow, was completed in
1974.
Motorail services (carrying both passengers and their cars) have an annual
capacity of 135,000 cars on 40 services.
The board’s proposals for commuter services include the development of new
multiple-unit trains to replace old stock. T he first of these, the Prototype
Electro-Pneumatic Train, is being tested in the London area. Several urban
railway projects are in progress (see p. 321).
The most important freight commodities handled in 1974 were coal and coke
(87 million tons) and iron and steel (31 million tons). A decline in the
carriage of these products, particularly coal and coke, has been accompanied by
a small increase in other traffic, especially petroleum products, cars and motor
components, refuse, roadstone and construction materials, and containers.
The efficiency of freight operations is being improved as new types of
wagon are introduced with larger capacities and capable of higher speeds; a
network of regular high-speed freight services using these new wagons is
being established. The board has begun a programme to concentrate freight

traffic at fewer and better equipped and sited marshalling yards and terminals.
A computer-based total operations processing system, allowing constant con¬
trol of all consignments and freight train and wagon movements, introduced
in south-west England in 1973 has been extended to the whole of Great Britain.
The board is concentrating on traffic particularly suitable for carriage by rail,
especially long-distance and bulk trainload traffic, often between specialised
company terminals. Long-term contracts are in operation for the carriage of
cars, oil, china clay, milk, newspapers, grain, chemicals, coal, steel, refuse,
and sand and gravel aggregates. The ‘merry-go-round’ system, whereby trains
are loaded and discharged automatically while in motion, is being used in¬
creasingly where there are heavy flows of mineral traffic, such as the carriage
of coal to power stations and iron ore to steelworks. Express container services
are growing in importance. The freightliner services are operated by Freight-
liners Ltd., a company jointly owned by the National Freight Corporation
(see p. 321) and the British Railways Board (with 51 per cent and 49 per cent
of the shares respectively) and serve a network of terminals throughout Great
Britain, with connections to the continent of Europe.
Discussions initiated by the Government are in progress between many of
Britain s largest firms and the British Railways Board on the potential for
transferring freight to the railways.
The Northern Ireland Railways Company Ltd., a subsidiary of the Northern
Ireland Transport Holding Company, operates the railway service on 200
miles (322 kilometres) of track. Improvements to the rail system under a
modernisation scheme involve the re-opening of a stretch of line and the
introduction of new rolling stock. The Belfast Central Railway is being
rebuilt for passenger traffic and should be open by late 1975.
Public road passenger transport in Britain is provided mainly by publicly
owned operators but partly by private firms. In the public sector in Great
Britain 25,000 vehicles are operated by the National Bus Company and the
Scottish Transport Group, 11,000 by the seven Passenger Transport Execu¬
tives, 6,700 by the London Transport Executive and 6,000 by other local
authority undertakings. I here are more than 5,000 privately owned fleets (of
which the majority have fewer than five vehicles) comprising some 25,000
vehicles; only a small proportion of these operators are concerned with
scheduled bus services.
There are 11 traffic areas in Great Britain each under the jurisdiction of an
independent body of three traffic commissioners. The commissioners are
responsible for ensuring the fitness of vehicles used to carry passengers for
hire or reward, and for licensing public road passenger services in order to
secure proper co-ordination and to avoid unnecessary competition; to this
end they may settle routes, timetables and fares.
A new system of grants for local transport came into operation on 1st April
1975 in England and Wales, replacing a number of grants previously paid on
specific services at varying rates. A block grant is paid to each county council
on expenditure on local transport services above a certain level. Below this
level transport expenditure qualifies for the normal rate support grant. The
Department of the Environment and the Welsh Office distribute the grants
following the annual submission by county councils and the Greater London
Council of their five-year transport plans. In Scotland the new grant system,

which came into operation on 16th May 1975, is based on an extension of the
rate support grant.
In addition, grants at the rate of 50 per cent are available towards the cost of
new buses complying with specifications approved by the Department of the
Environment. The Government also makes grants to offset the duty charged
on fuel used on local bus services.
The National Bus Company operates in England and Wales through locally
based subsidiaries such as the Western National Omnibus Company, Kibble
Motor Services Ltd. and Crosville Motor Services Ltd. At the end of 1974 it
owned some 20,500 vehicles and employed 69,600 people. In 1974 passenger
journeys on the company’s buses amounted to 2,200 million.
The Scottish Transport Group operates bus services in Scotland and
shipping services on the Clyde and to the Western Isles. It has 4>500 vehicles.
In Northern Ireland almost all road passenger services are provided by
subsidiaries of the Northern Ireland Transport Holding Company. Citybus
Ltd. operates services in the city of Belfast and Ulsterbus Ltd. operates most
of the services in the rest of Northern Ireland. These companies have 305 and
977 vehicles respectively.
The Transport Act 1968 enables Passenger Transport Authorities (PTAs) to
be set up to control and co-ordinate the different forms of transport in any
particular area. PTAs have been set up in England and Wales in the conurba¬
tions of Greater Manchester, Merseyside, West Midlands, Tyne and Wear,
South Yorkshire and West Yorkshire, and in Scotland in Greater Glasgow. In
each case in England the PTA is the metropolitan county council, which is also
responsible for land use policy and transport matters in general; in Scotland
the Strathclyde Regional Council is the PTA although the passenger transport
area does not cover all of the region. The PTAs are responsible for policy as
a whole, and appoint professional Passenger Transport Executives (PTEs) to
be responsible for day-to-day management and operations. The PTEs operate
the former municipal passenger transport undertakings in their areas and are
responsible for reaching agreements with the British Railways Board concerning
the provision of such services as are considered necessary by the PTAs.
Several similar agreements have been reached with other bodies, including
National Bus Company subsidiaries.
The Greater London Council (GLC) is the transport planning authority for
London as a whole and is responsible for the central bus and Underground
rail services, managed and operated by the London Transport Executive
which is appointed by the GLC. The buses serving areas around London and
the long-distance Green Line coach services are run by London Country Bus
Services Ltd., a subsidiary of the National Bus Company. Some 10,400 taxi¬
cabs that ply for hire in the streets are privately operated by companies or
owner-drivers and are licensed annually by the Metropolitan Police. There
are about 15,200 licensed cab drivers. In addition, numerous car-hire firms
are in operation.
London Transport’s railway network stretches 22 miles (35 kilometres) from
north to south and 35 miles (56 kilometres) from east to west. In January 1975
the total length of the railway over which London Transport trains operated
was 252 miles (406 kilometres), of which 99 miles (159 kilometres) were
underground. London Transport trains serve 279 stations and its buses travel

over 1,732 miles (2,787 kilometres) of roads. To carry traffic over all this area
London Transport owns 4,318 railway cars and 6,735 buses. The total staff
employed is over 56,500.
London Transport is engaged on a 20-year modernisation programme for
the Underground. Improvements planned include an extension of automatic
ticket issue and control and the introduction of new signalling and train
control techniques. Work is in progress on the construction of the first stage
of the new Fleet line, which is projected to link north-west and central
London, and on a scheme to extend the Piccadilly line to Heathrow airport—
the section to Hatton Cross was opened in July 1975 and the extension should
be completed in 1977.
One-man operation of buses is being steadily extended over a period of
years although certain heavily used routes in central London will continue to
be operated by two-man crews. The first one-man-operated double decker
buses were introduced in 1969; some 1,363 of these buses are in service.
London Transport operates an international advisory service for city trans¬
port.
Improvements to public transport services and passenger facilities are being
undertaken in many areas of Britain. Express and/or limited-stop bus services,
which have been a feature of some areas for many years, have been introduced
in several towns and cities. ‘Park and ride’ bus services are providing services
between large suburban car parks and the centres of several towns including
Leicester, Mansfield, Norwich and Oxford. ‘Dial-a-bus’ services, which pick
up passengers as a result of a telephone call to a central control point, are being
evaluated in a number of areas including Harlow (where the largest and most
advanced experiment of its kind in Europe is being carried out).
In Greater Glasgow two major rail projects are being undertaken by the
PTE. A £12 million scheme for the modernisation of Glasgow’s underground
system includes provision for new rolling stock, track and signalling equip¬
ment; station improvements; and interchange facilities. Work is in progress
and should be completed by 1977-78. A £15 million scheme for the reopening
and electrification of Glasgow’s central low-level line, the major part of the
‘Clyderail’ scheme, is designed to improve access to the centre of Glasgow and
integrate rail services on the north and south banks of the Clyde. On Mersey-
side a £14 million scheme, due for completion in 1976, will provide an exten¬
sion of the Mersey underground railway in central Liverpool and an £11
million scheme to provide an underground link between Liverpool’s main
railway stations will be completed in 1977. A light rapid transit system under
construction on Tyneside involves the electrification of two suburban railway
lines, linked by new tunnels under Newcastle upon Tyne and Gateshead, and
a new bridge over the Tyne. The system, which should be operating in 1980,
will be 34 miles (55 kilometres) long with 46 stations. The project is the largest
provincial urban transport scheme to have been prepared in Britain in the
twentieth century.
There are some 140,000 operators in the road haulage industry. Many are
small firms, the average size of a vehicle fleet being only about four. Most of
the industry is privately owned, but the biggest operator in Great Britain is
the National Freight Corporation (NFC), a public corporation established
under the Transport Act 1968 to operate road and intermodal freight services.
Its turnover amounted to >6264 million in 1974 and at the end of 1974 it had
49,400 employees and owned or leased 23,700 vehicles, 19,800 trailers and
322

12,000 containers and demountable bodies. The Government’s policy is to
extend public ownership in the road haulage industry. Public haulage (private
road hauliers and the NFC carrying other firms’ goods) accounts for 64 per
cent of freight carried in Great Britain in terms of ton-mileage. In Northern
Ireland the biggest operator is Northern Ireland Carriers Ltd., owned jointly
by the Northern Ireland Transport Holding Company and the NFC.
Under the Transport Act 1968 those operating vehicles of over 3! tons gross
weight (with certain special exemptions) require an operator’s licence,
obtained on showing good repute and ability to maintain vehicles properly and
control loading and hours worked by drivers. It may also be necessary to
demonstrate adequate financial resources for compliance with these conditions.
Over 1 million goods vehicles not exceeding 3! tons gross laden weight are
exempt from operators’ licensing.
Regulations control the emission of smoke and noise by lorries and the
carriage of dangerous goods by road. There are limits on the hours worked by
drivers of goods vehicles. European Community rules, limiting driving in
general to eight hours a day and 48 hours in any seven consecutive days, apply
to drivers of goods vehicles over 3^ tonnes gross weight on international
journeys. Journeys entirely within Britain are due to become subject to these
rules on 1st January 1976. European Community legislation also requires
commercial vehicles to be fitted with a tachograph, an instrument which
automatically records driving hours and a vehicle’s speed and distance
covered. In Britain a tachograph is due to become a required fitting on most
goods vehicles over 3! tonnes gross weight, from 1st January 1976 for new
vehicles and those carrying dangerous goods, and from 1st January 1978 for
other vehicles.
There are three main categories of road in Great Britain: trunk roads
(including motorways), classified roads and unclassified roads. Trunk roads
form a national strategic network linking industrial areas, centres of population
and ports. Motorways are roads specially designed for high-speed traffic only.
The Government’s road programme is intended to complete a network of
routes of high quality linking the major centres of population with the most
important ports and airports, by the construction of new roads and improve¬
ment of existing roads. About 1,800 miles (2,897 kilometres) of these routes
are in use in England and Wales and a further 1,300 miles (2,092 kilometres)
should be completed by the early 1980s. The Government is generally opposed
to the building of new urban motorways because of their environmental im¬
pact and high cost, although in exceptional circumstances their construction
may be required. In Scotland the highest priority in the road programme is
being given to oil-related road developments.
In mid-1975 Great Britain had about 214,600 miles (345,400 kilometres)
of public highway. There were 9,600 miles (15,450 kilometres) of trunk roads,
of which 1,190 miles (1,915 kilometres) were motorways; 20,500 miles (33,000
kilometres) of principal roads, of which some 58 miles (93 kilometres) were
motorways; and 184,500 miles (297,000 kilometres) of other roads, including
unsurfaced roads.
In Northern Ireland in mid-1975 there were 14,406 miles (23,184 kilo¬
metres) of public roads comprising 390 miles (628 kilometres) of trunk roads,
1,033 miles (1,662 kilometres) of Class I roads, 1,759 miles kilometres)
of Class II roads, 2,940 miles (4,731 kilometres) of Class III roads and 8,284
miles (13,332 kilometres) of unclassified roads.

At the end of March 1975 in England 1,066 miles (1,716 kilometres) of trunk
motorways had been opened for traffic and construction had started on a
further 174 miles (280 kilometres). There were some 55 miles (89 kilometres)
of local authority motorway in use and a further 11 miles (18 kilometres) under
construction. In Wales 27 miles (43 kilometres) of trunk motorway were in
use and 13 miles (21 kilometres) under construction. In Scotland about 109
miles (175 kilometres) of trunk and local authority motorway had been opened
and construction had started on a further 15 miles (24 kilometres). About 61
miles (98 kilometres) of motorway were in use in Northern Ireland. (See map
on p. 324.)
A large programme of bridge and tunnel building has been undertaken in
recent years. Modern bridges include the suspension bridge across the Firth of
Forth and the Severn Bridge, both incorporating major advances in suspension
bridge design, and a £10 million continuous steel box-girder bridge across the
river Clyde at Erskine. A bridge across the river Humber, with a span of
4,626 feet (1,410 metres)—longer than any existing bridge span in the world—
is to be completed in 1977.
Among major recent tunnel schemes has been the second Mersey crossing
of which the first twin tunnel was opened in 1971 and the second in 1974. A
second crossing of the Thames at Hartford, Kent, is under construction and
should be completed in 1977.
The Secretary of State for the Environment is the highway authority for
trunk roads in England and on these roads he administers expenditure, which
is provided wholly from central Government sources, although for many pur¬
poses he employs local authorities as his agents. The Secretary of State for
Scotland has corresponding responsibilities for roads in Scotland and the
Secretary of State for Wales for roads in Wales. Work on major trunk road
schemes in England, including motorways, is controlled by regional road con¬
struction units, manned jointly by Department of the Environment and county
council staff. The highway authority for non-trunk roads in England and Wales
is, in general, the county council in whose area the roads lie. Part of the block
grant to the highway authorities towards transport expenditure (see p. 319) is
attributable to their expenditure on the construction, improvement and main¬
tenance of non-trunk roads. In Scotland the highway authority for non-trunk
roads is the regional or islands council and the cost of maintenance and con¬
struction of these roads is eligible for grant under an extension of the rate
support grant system.
In Northern Ireland the Northern Ireland Department of the Environment
is responsible for all public roads and bears the total cost of maintenance and
construction.
Research on roads is carried out at the Department of the Environment’s
Transport and Road Research Laboratory (TRRL). The laboratory provides
technical and scientific advice and information to help in formulating, develop¬
ing and implementing government policies relating to roads and transport,
including their interaction with urban and regional planning. Work is con¬
cerned with planning, design, construction and maintenance of roads and
structures such as bridges and tunnels; safe, efficient and convenient move¬
ment of people and goods, including road layout and transport networks,
control of traffic flow, study of road accidents and methods of reducing their
frequency and severity; assessment of existing and projected passenger or
 i.

freight transport systems and investigation of technical developments and their
environmental effects. The TRRL employs over 1,000 people of whom about
half are scientists and engineers.
Britain has one of the highest densities of road traffic in the world but a rela¬
tively good accident record, the fatal accident rate per vehicle being lower
than that in most other European countries. In 1974, 6,900 people were killed
on the roads, about 82,100 seriously injured and 235,900 slightly injured. Road
accident statistics are compiled and published by the Government Statistical
Service from reports made by the police.
Modern roads, designed for present-day traffic and segregating pedestrians
from vehicles, are safer than the roads they replace and surveys have shown
they result in a marked fall in casualties. There are speed limits of 30 mph
(48 km/h) in most built-up areas, 40, 50 and 60 mph (64, 80 and 97 km/h) on
selected roads and up to 70 mph (113 km/h) on motorways. In December
I974 speed limits of 50 mph (80 km/h) on single-carriageway and 60 mph
(97 km/h) on dual-carriageway roads were introduced, except on those which
already had a lower limit, as a contribution to fuel saving and road safety; the
70 mph (113 km/h) limit on motorways was retained. Other measures direc¬
ted primarily towards road safety include the provision of pedestrian crossings
and the system of road markings and traffic signs. A centrally controlled
computerised signalling system is being installed on certain motorways to
warn motorists of advisory speed limits in certain conditions and of lane
closures.
The design of vehicles, their use on the roads, and the maintenance of their
mechanical condition are controlled by regulations. The regulations are kept
under constant review, and amended whenever necessary in the interests of
safety or for control of pollution and noise. The fitting of seat belts to the front
seats is compulsory for cars first registered in or after 1965 and for light goods
vehicles first registered in or after 1967. In Great Britain private cars and light
vans which are three or more years old must be tested annually at private
garages authorised as test stations. In Northern Ireland a scheme to test
private cars, initially ten or more years old, at vehicle driving test centres was
introduced in July 1975. Heavy goods vehicles are tested annually at govern¬
ment test stations. Public service vehicles must be specially approved before
being licensed to carry passengers, and are tested at regular intervals. Any
vehicle may be stopped on the road at any time by the police and examined
All drivers of motor vehicles, unless they have either held a full British
licence or passed the driving test in the last ten years, are required to pass the
test before being granted a full licence to drive. Until they pass the test they
must obtain a ‘provisional’ licence and display ‘L’ (Learner) plates on their
vehicle. In Northern Ireland a driver having passed the test is required to
display an ‘R’ (Restricted) plate for a one-year period during which he must
not exceed 45 mph (72 km/h). With the exception of solo motor-cycles and
motor-cycle combinations, where vehicles are constructed to carry passengers,
learner drivers must be accompanied by a qualified driver. (Newly arrived
residents of Britain may drive under their overseas driving licences for three
months before becoming subject to these rules.) Professional driving instruc¬
tors must be approved by the Department of the Environment. There is a
scheme for special licensing and testing of drivers of heavy goods vehicles. The
Driver and Vehicle Licensing Centre at Swansea, which began operating in
!973> wiU eventually deal with all licensing and registration of vehicles and
drivers in Great Britain.

The Road Traffic Acts, which embody the law relating to road users, are
enforced by the police and the courts. A person convicted of any of the 26
most serious offences is liable to be disqualified from driving for a period. The
standard of conduct for all road users and a summary of the requirements of
the law are set out in easily understandable form in the Highway Code. A failure
to observe the code does not of itself render a person liable to criminal pro¬
ceedings but may be taken into account in any such proceedings. The Road
Safety Act 1967 made it an offence to drive with more than a prescribed level
of alcohol in the blood, at present 80 milligrammes of alcohol per 100 milli¬
litres of blood.
National campaigns to persuade people to take greater care on the roads are
conducted by the Department of the Environment and the Royal Society for
the Prevention of Accidents with assistance from the local authorities, which
also help by arranging courses of instruction, especially courses for children.
In recent years major publicity campaigns have been undertaken to increase
the wearing of seat belts and reduce pedestrian casualties.
With the exception of trunk roads, which are the concern of the central
Government, traffic is the responsibility of local authorities. Urban transport
planning has involved the development of medium-term transport studies,
which have been carried out or are in progress in many cities and towns in
Great Britain. Following a study the local authority adopts a preferred strategy
which provides the framework for more detailed short-term traffic management
and public transport operational measures.
Several cities have abandoned extensive urban motorway schemes in favour
of limiting the amount of traffic permitted to enter central areas and providing
better public transport. Limited urban road improvements are continuing, but
local authorities are relying on measures to improve traffic flow and road
safety, and, in some cases, to assist the flow of certain types of vehicle, usually
buses. Comprehensive traffic management schemes may include ‘one-way’
systems, improved traffic signal control and area traffic control systems, park¬
ing controls, pedestrian precincts and bus lanes. Following experiments on
methods to control by computer a large number of traffic signals in an urban
area, several local authorities are installing these systems. The first purpose- 1
built automatic traffic control system for a whole city was opened in Leicester J
in 1974. In most town centres street parking is permitted for limited periods
only; in London and many other towns schemes for payment at parking meters
or residents’ parking spaces are under the supervision of traffic wardens. In (
many big cities new shopping precincts are specially designed for pedestrians j
and motor traffic is excluded. Streets in many town centres have been con¬
verted wholly or partly to pedestrian use.
The Government’s road programme (see p. 322) is designed so that even¬
tually heavy goods vehicles will be able to avoid town centres and residential
suburbs wherever possible. The Government is devising, in co-operation with
local authorities, a system of lorry routes.
Since 1963 control of the majority of inland waterways has been vested in the
British Waterways Board. Under the Transport Act 1968 a grant-in-aid is
being paid primarily to enable the board to maintain an extensive network of
amenity waterways; in 1974 £5'3 million was paid and a further £1-4 million
for improving bridges.
The board’s turnover in 1974 amounted to £7-4 million, including receipts
of £o-$ million from its own freight-carrying activities, £17 million from

warehousing and terminal services, and £i ‘4 million from the docks. The
sale of water for industrial and agricultural purposes brought in £1-2 million.
Receipts from pleasure boating were £368,400. The number of pleasure craft
licensed or registered in 1974 was nearly 25,200.
There are about 2,500 miles (4,023 kilometres) of navigable inland waterways
in Great Britain, some 2,000 miles (3,219 kilometres) of which belong to the
British Waterways Board; the remainder are mainly in the hands of water
authorities or private companies. Many of the board’s canals are narrow water¬
ways which can generally be used only by boats not exceeding 7 ft (2-13 metres)
in width; others are broad waterways, ship canals and canalised rivers, some of
which can be used by craft of up to about 1,000 tons capacity. Of the inland
waterways under the control of the British Waterways Board some 340 miles
(547 kilometres) are commercial waterways, which are mainly canalised river
navigations. A substantial additional mileage (1,100 miles—1,770 kilometres—
known as cruising waterways) is being maintained for recreational purposes;
a statutory Inland Waterways Amenity Advisory Council advises the Secretary
of State for the Environment and the British Waterways Board.
Engineering, commercial and estate work is directed from the board’s head¬
quarters in London. There are also principal offices at Leeds and Gloucester.
In Scotland the Caledonian Canal and the other Scottish canals are, for
engineering and estate purposes, under the control of the board’s office in
Glasgow, with direction as a whole from London.
In 1974 traffic on the board’s waterways amounted to 3-9 million tonnes,
of which 1-3 million tonnes were coal, 11 million tonnes liquids in bulk and
1-5 million tonnes general cargo. Some 97 per cent of the traffic is carried on
the commercial waterways.
Although the British Waterways Board is one of the largest single carrying
operators, most of the traffic is handled by independent carriers or by traders
in their own craft. The board also operates 3 docks and 19 warehousing depots.
In Northern Ireland the only inland waterway which is still used for com¬
mercial transport purposes is the Lower Bann Navigation.
The British W aterways Board is developing its cruising waterways for purposes
of recreation and amenity. Among the most popular are the Llangollen branch
of the Shropshire Union Canal, the Oxford Canal, and the Leeds and Liver¬
pool Canal. Many disused waterways are being restored in co-operation with
local authorities and voluntary societies. The principal commercial waterways
are the river navigations and broad canals in the Yorkshire-Humberside area,
the Trent Navigation, and the Gloucester and Sharpness Canal. New facilities
and waterway improvements are being undertaken to increase freight traffic.
The board has devised and is already operating on some of its commercial
waterways a specially designed interlocking modular barge system. A new
barge-carrying ship entered service in 1974 between the Humber estuary and
Rotterdam.
CIVIL AVIATION
Airline services are operated by British Airways and by a number of inde¬
pendent airlines. In 1924 four small British companies merged to form
Imperial Airways Limited and this company pioneered the commercial
development of intercontinental air routes. The two public corporations, the
British Overseas Airways Corporation (which took over the undertakings of

Imperial Airways Limited and British Airways Limited in 1940) and British
European Airways (established under the Civil Aviation Act 1946), became
divisions of British Airways under the Civil Aviation Act 1971 which created
the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) and the British Airways Board (BAB).
The new bodies became fully operative in 1972.
The Secretary of State for Trade is responsible for international matters
(including negotiation of air service agreements with other countries, the
licensing and control of public transport operations into Britain by overseas
operators and British participation in the activities of the International Civil
Aviation Organisation and other international aviation bodies), airport policy,
amenity matters such as aircraft noise, aviation security policy and investiga¬
tion of accidents. The Secretary of State appoints the chairman and other
members of the CAA, and is empowered to give written guidance on the
general policies to be followed. The guidance must be approved by both
Houses of Parliament.
The Secretary of State may also give directions, after consultation, to the
CAA, concerning Britain’s relations with other countries, membership of
international organisations or adherence to international agreements, or to
deal with problems of noise, vibration, pollution or other disturbances arising
from the activities of civil aviation. He may also give directions, after consulta¬
tion, to the BAB concerning matters affecting the public interest. He has
powers to make funds available to the CAA and the BAB, with the approval
of the Treasury and within limits laid down by Parliament.
The Civil Aviation Authority is an independent statutory body, responsible
for the economic, technical and operational regulation of the industry, the
provision by the National Air Traffic Services of air navigation services and
the aerodrome navigation services at certain British airports and the operation
of eight airfields in Scotland. It issues licences and certificates to airlines,
aircraft, aerodromes and personnel, including pilots, air traffic controllers and
maintenance engineers.
The CAA has been given the objective of recovering as far as possible, by
X 977-78, the whole of its costs and a reasonable return on capital from the
users of its services. Meanwhile the Government is paying the CAA a grant
to meet its deficit on revenue account, assessed annually in advance; it
amounted to ^34'5 million in 1974-75.
The Civil Aviation Authority operates an air transport licensing system, within
which British operators, both state-owned and independent, apply on an equal
footing for licences for scheduled and charter services, or for revocation or
variation of existing licences. It determines categories of licence, content of
applications, and conditions and tariff provisions of licences. It also has power
to exempt particular flights or categories of flights from licence requirements.
In issuing licences the CAA must consider the applicant’s financial resources,
staffing and organisation, the need for the proposed services, their adequacy
and possible effect on existing services, and any representations made by
interested parties. Appeals may be made to the Secretary of State for Trade.
A CAA scheme for licensing air travel organisers came into operation in 1973.
The Airline Users Committee was established by the CAA in 1973 to assist in
protecting the interests of passengers and other airline users, and to investigate
individual complaints against airlines.

The CAA is responsible for the regulation of the safety of civil aircraft
registered in Britain. Its Operations Division deals with the preparation and
application of safety requirements concerning airline operations, flight crew
licensing and training, aerodromes and fire or rescue services. A mandatory
system of reporting of incidents and structural or mechanical defects is being
developed for introduction in 1976- d he Airworthiness Division is responsible
for British Civil Airworthiness Requirements, a code with which all aircraft
built in Britain or flown by British airlines must comply. Continued airworthi¬
ness is ensured by regular inspection and by requiring aircraft to be maintained
in accordance with a schedule approved by the CAA. The authority is advised
by an Airworthiness Requirements Board representing various interests
including manufacturers, operators, pilots and insurers.
Every operator of aircraft above a certain weight used for public transport
must possess an Air Operator’s Certificate which is granted by the CAA when
it is satisfied that the operator is competent to secure the safe operation of its
aircraft. The CAA’s flight operations inspectors (who are experienced airline
pilots) check that satisfactory operating standards are maintained by these
operators.
Each member of the flight crew of a British registered aircraft must hold the
appropriate official licence issued by the CAA. Applicants for professional
pilots’ licences are required to attend approved courses of training before
attempting qualifying examinations and flight tests. The CAA has approved
such courses at training schools at Carlisle, Oxford and Perth, as well as the
College of Air Training at Hamble, Hampshire. The latter was set up in i960
to increase the supply of well-trained pilots for civil airlines and is sponsored
by British Airways.
Responsibility for policy planning and execution of both civil and military
air traffic control over Britain and the surrounding seas rests with the National
Air Traffic Services, under the joint control of the Civil Aviation Authority
and the Secretary of State for Defence.
A system of airways, introduced in 1950 and covering the main traffic routes
with control zones around the major airports, has been gradually extended.
The primary navigation aids have been the very high frequency omni¬
directional ranges (VORs) and distance measuring equipment. Re-equipment
with the more accurate Doppler VOR system began in 1974 and should be
completed before 1980. During the last few years virtually the whole of the
airspace over Britain above 5,000 feet (1,500 metres) has been brought under
surveillance by modern primary and secondary radar equipment to provide
data for use in two air traffic control centres, located at West Drayton (near
London) and Prestwick. The first stage was introduced at West Drayton in
1971. Early in 1975 a subsidiary centre was opened at Manchester to deal with
traffic in the Manchester terminal control area. A new Scottish centre under
construction at Prestwick is due to enter service early in 1977. Extensive use
is being made in these centres of automatic data processing and other advanced
electronic techniques.
The development of all-weather landing systems, on the basis of an im¬
proved version of the standard instrument landing system, was pioneered by
the Royal Aircraft Establishment at Bedford, airlines and private industry. All
Britain’s major airports are now fitted for use with this improved version.

BRITAIN 1976: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Britain is a member of Eurocontrol, a European international agency concerned
with the traffic control problems arising from the increasing use of high-flying,
high-speed jet aircraft. Set up in 1963 it provides control at the higher flight
levels for civil aircraft and for military aircraft operating according to civil
procedures.
Since 1971 all new types of subsonic jet aircraft using British airports have
been required to hold a ‘certificate of quietness’. From 1st January 1976 the
older types of subsonic jet aircraft will also have to hold a certificate and
extension of the regulation to cover propeller aircraft is in preparation. The
noise standards follow the recommendations of the special meeting held by the
International Civil Aviation Organisation in Montreal in 1969, subsequently
embodied in an annex to the Chicago Convention on International Civil
Aviation.
Noise abatement measures in force at various airports include limitations
on noise levels at take-off, route restrictions, limits on the number of jet move¬
ments during summer nights and other procedures designed to lessen noise
on the ground.
The board of British Airways controls the activities of the seven divisions of
British Airways—British Airways European Division, British Airways Over¬
seas Division, British Airways Regional Division, British Airways Associated
Companies Ltd., British Airways Engine Overhaul Ltd., British Airways
Helicopters Ltd. and International Aeradio Ltd. The chairman and members
of the board are appointed by the Secretary of State for Trade. British Air¬
ways’ total borrowing limit is fixed at million, but may be increased up
t° £700 million by statutory order. During the year 1974-75 the board s turn¬
over was £748 million, of which 55 per cent was earned overseas, and it made
a net loss of £9 4 million. Revenue earned by the airline divisions amounted
to £665 million. Some 13-3 million passengers were carried on scheduled
services. At March 1975 British Airways employed about 59,000 staff. Its
assets of £555 million included ^408 million of aircraft and spares and £89
million of land and buildings.
British Airways has the largest route network in the world, almost 500,000
miles (800,000 kilometres), covering nearly 200 destinations in 88 countries.
The Overseas Division is engaged on long-haul operations. Its scheduled ser¬
vices link Britain with continental Europe, the Middle East, the Far East,
Australasia, Africa and North and South America, and also provide complete
round-the-world services.
The European Division operates on short-haul and medium-haul services in
Britain and the rest of Europe and to North Africa and the Middle East. In
January 1975 it introduced Europe’s first air shuttle service (a regular
scheduled no-reservation service with back-up aircraft to carry extra pas¬
sengers) between London (Heathrow) and Glasgow.
The Regional Division is responsible for secondary domestic services and for
a network of services to Europe. Its services in Britain include a number which
meet a vital social need, mainly the services to and from the Highlands and
Islands of Scotland.
British Airways Associated Companies Ltd. is responsible for the group’s
investments connected with some 42 hotel companies and 6 air companies in

different parts of the world. The helicopter division—British Airways Heli¬
copters Ltd.—operates a scheduled service between Penzance, Cornwall, and
the Isles of Scilly, undertakes charter work, provides links between oil rigs in
the North Sea and the mainland and operates the air-sea rescue service from
Aberdeen and Sumburgh. Engine overhaul work for British Airways and other
airlines is carried out by British Airways Engine Overhaul Ltd. International
Aeradio Ltd. plans, installs, operates and maintains airport technical services
and general communications and manufactures specialised equipment for use
in these services. Other operations controlled by British Airways include
British Airtours which operates charter flights, British Airways Travel Divi¬
sion which handles sales of passenger tickets in Britain and British Airways
Cargo UK which handles British Airways’ cargo sales in Britain and controls
cargo-handling facilities at 18 airports in Britain.
The British Airways fleet of some 196 aircraft in May 1975 is the world’s
largest passenger fleet operating international services. Aircraft in the Overseas
Division consist of Super VCios (15), VC 10 (1) Boeing 707-436$ (6), Boeing
7°7~33^s (11), and 17 Boeing 747s. The European Division contains BAG
One-Elevens (1%), Trident Threes (26), Trident Twos (15), Trident Ones (9) and
6 Lockheed TriStars. British Airways has converted the Vanguard aircraft into
the Merchantman used solely for freight and six are now in service. The
Regional Division s fleet consists of BAC One-Elevens (7), Viscounts (35) and
4 Trident Ones. British Airtours has 8 Boeing 707-436$. Helicopters in the
helicopter division include Sikorsky 6iNs (10), Bell Jet Ranger (1) and Bell
212 (1). British Airways plans to introduce Concorde supersonic aircraft early
in 1976; five Concordes have been ordered. Other major orders include nine
Lockheed TriStars for the European Division.
The independent companies compete with British Airways over several
domestic and international routes. In 1973 they carried some 5-9 million
passengers on scheduled services. British Caledonian Airways, the leading
independent airline, has a fleet of some 31 aircraft, used on chartered and
scheduled passenger and freight services, and carries about 13 million
scheduled service passengers a year. In addition to the public transport
operators many companies are engaged in miscellaneous aviation activities
such as charter operations, supplying North Sea oil rigs, crop-spraying, aerial
survey and photography, and flying instruction. There are over 40 companies
engaged in air-taxi operations; they carried a total of over 400,000 passengers
in 1974.
In 2'5 million passengers entered or left Britain by air, compared with
57 million who arrived or departed by sea; in 1962 there were for the first
time more air than sea passengers, and the latest annual figures are 31 million
by air (international terminal passengers) and 13-8 million by sea. British Air¬
ways accounts for some 92 per cent of scheduled services flown by British
airlines. The charter market is dominated by independent companies; British
Caledonian has 26 per cent of the market, other independent airlines 53 per
cent and British Airways’ charter subsidiaries 21 per cent. Total capacity
offered on all services by British airlines amounted to 9,003 million capacity-
tonne-kilometres in 1973.
Freight traffic in 1973 amounted to some 699,500 tonnes, 8 per cent higher
than in 1972. The value of overseas trade by air rose by 28 per cent to £5,731

million in 1974, but the proportion of Britain’s overseas trade carried by air
(13 per cent of the value of imports and 17 per cent of exports) did not increase
for the first time in ten years, partly reflecting the large increase in the value
of oil imports. Among the main commodities exported by air are machinery,
medicinal and pharmaceutical products, and diamonds.
The estimated number of aircraft on the British register used for business and
private purposes is 4,000 while approximately 950 are owned by clubs, groups
and training schools. About 19,300 private pilots hold licences. About 100 com¬
panies use corporate aircraft and 65 companies are members of the Business
Aircraft Users’ Association. There are some 9,000 glider pilots.
In 1974 Britain’s civil airports handled 41-2 million passengers, slightly below
the level of 1973 following several years of rapid growth. The leading airports
were Heathrow—14 miles (23 kilometres) west of central London—20-4 million
passengers, Gatwick 5-2 million, Manchester 2-4 million, Luton 2 million,
Glasgow 2 million, Belfast 1-2 million, Birmingham 11 million, Edinburgh
810,000 and Prestwick 564,000. Air transport movements have grown at a
slower rate than passenger movements; in 1974 there were 710,000 movements
of aircraft engaged on commercial transport operations.
There are approximately 150 civil airports in Britain; in addition, 50 Service
aerodromes are available for civil use.
The British Airports Authority (BAA), an independent statutory body
operating on a commercial basis, was created in 1966 to own and manage
London’s airports (Heathrow, Gatwick and Stansted), together with Prestwick
in Scotland. The BAA acquired responsibility for Edinburgh airport in 1971,
Aberdeen at the beginning of 1975 and Glasgow on 1st April 1975 and has
established a new division to administer its Scottish airports. Eight small
airfields in the Highlands and Islands of Scotland are controlled by the Civil
Aviation Authority and Belfast’s airport (Aldergrove) is managed by the
Northern Ireland Airports Ltd., a subsidiary of the Northern Ireland Trans¬
port Holding Company. Most of the other public airports are controlled by
local authorities. Municipally or privately owned airports or airfields which
are used for the public transport of passengers and/or flying instruction are
subject to licensing, inspection and regulation by the CAA, which is also
responsible for navigation facilities at the BAA’s airports and a number of the
main municipal airports.
For international scheduled services Heathrow and Gatwick are the main
airports and Heathrow is the busiest centre of international travel in the world
An £8 million programme is under way at Heathrow for the improvement of
terminal facilities to accommodate wide-bodied aircraft.
The airport at Gatwick, 28 miles (45 kilometres) south of London, was
opened in 1958 as the second airport for the London area and was the first in
the world to contain road, rail and air transport in one unit. A £65 million
redevelopment programme at Gatwick is in progress; a new international
arrivals terminal was opened in 1974 and further major improvements to
passenger facilities are planned. . . ,
Work is in progress to develop facilities at many of Britain s other airports.
A Sn million extension to Manchester airport, controlled by the Manchester
District Council and the Greater Manchester County Council, was opened in
1974. The extension doubled the airport’s passenger handling capacity and

enabled it to accommodate Boeing j/ff (jumbo jet) aircraft. Prestwick airport
has been developed to accommodate the world’s largest aircraft. A £13 million
redevelopment scheme for Edinburgh airport involves the construction of an
8,400-foot (2,560-metre) runway and a new terminal building which will be
opened in late 1975 and early 1977 respectively. The BAA has plans to expand
the terminal facilities at Aberdeen airport and there is a ^10 million expansion
programme for Glasgow airport. A scheme has recently been completed by the
CAA to strengthen and lengthen the main runway at Inverness airport. At
Sumburgh (Shetland), an important staging post for communications between
the Scottish mainland and many North Sea oil rigs, a ^7 million scheme is
being undertaken to improve the runway.
THE POST OFFICE
The Post Office, founded in 1657, provides postal, public telecommunications,
data processing and Giro services. It was set up as a public authority under the
Post Office Act 1969, having previously been a government department. The
chairman and members of the board are appointed by the Secretary of State
for Industry. It has some 430,000 employees and 23,660 post offices. Income
excluding internal transactions totalled £2,123 million in 1974-75. The Post
Office is investing some £3,700 million in the period 1975-79 5 capital expendi¬
ture on fixed assets amounted to £826 million in 1974-75.
Some 201 million parcels and 10,878 million items of other correspondence
(including 10,234 million inland letters) were handled by the Post Office in
1974^75■ An increasing amount of correspondence is sent by air, reaching
492 million items in 1974-75 i 2'8 million parcels were sent by air in that year.
New highly mechanised sorting office buildings are being opened in Britain.
Letter segregating and facing machines have been installed at some 39 centres.
Postal address coding (postcode) is in operation over the whole country.
‘Datapost’, a door-to-door overnight collection and delivery service for
computer data and important packages, provides over 20,000 services each
week. International datapost services are also available to eight overseas
countries.
The British Postal Consultancy Service offers professional advice on all
aspects of postal business to overseas administrations and work was done in
I974_75 f°r 11 overseas postal administrations.
At the post office counter, besides making use of its postal and telegraph
facilities, a person may draw a pension or a family allowance, buy a licence for
his dog, a licence for his television receiving set, renew his motor vehicle
licence, obtain a British visitor’s passport, buy national insurance stamps, and
use the savings and investments facilities of the National Savings Bank (see
p. 374) and the money transmission services of the National Giro (see p. 372).
In much of its counter service the Post Office acts as agent for government
departments and local authorities.
Britain has one of the world’s most up-to-date telegraph systems which is
directly connected through a computer-controlled telegram retransmission
centre, the biggest of its kind in the world, to most of the principal overseas
telegraph offices. With the exception of those offered by the small number of
foreign telegraph companies licensed to operate in Britain, all international
public telegram services are operated through the provincial and London

offices of the Post Office International Telegraph Service. Direct connection
is available to the main towns in the rest of Europe and to 60 other countries
throughout the world.
The telex service combines the speed of the telephone with the accuracy of the
printed word. The British telex service is fully automatic. Calls may be made
direct between the rapidly increasing number of telex users in Britain (esti¬
mated at 56,000 by mid-1975) and also to well over 759,000 subscribers
throughout the world. Britain is linked to over 177 countries by telex and
about 98 per cent of international calls are directly dialled. These include calls
to virtually the whole of Europe. Calls to countries not available through the
automatic service are connected through the International Telex Exchange in
London. The Post Office is planning for a system of about 100,000 British
subscribers by 1980.
The demand for data communications is increasing and the trend is towards
higher speeds. The Post Office offers a range of datel-services providing for
transmission at rates of up to no bits per second (bit/s) over telegraph circuits
or up to 2,400 bit/s (to be increased to 4,800 bit/s) over speech circuits. Higher
speeds up to 50,000 bit/s are available over special wideband circuits. Inter¬
national services allow data transmission to the rest of Europe, the United
States and a number of other countries. In 1975 there were 34,900 Post Office
datel terminals in Britain, more than three times the number in any other
European country. An experimental packet switched service is being imple¬
mented, with packet exchanges at London, Manchester and Glasgow. Plans
for digital services to cater for future data communications requirements are
under consideration.
The Post Office operates the largest telephone system in Europe and the third
largest in the world. At the end of March 1975 there were 6,254 local telephone
exchanges and 20-4 million telephones. During i974-75> 1'4 million new lines
were installed. Trunk dialling by subscribers (STD) began in Bristol in 1958;
virtually all local and trunk calls can be dialled direct. In 1974-75 some 15,909
million telephone calls were made comprising 13,523 million local calls, 2,313
million trunk calls and 73 million international calls. .
Hull District Council is the only municipality to exercise its option of
operating its own service under licence from the Post Office; this service is
connected to the Post Office trunk network.
The first operational electronic exchange in Europe was opened at Amber-
gate, Derbyshire, in 1966. There are now over 600 such exchanges in Britain.
Large electronic exchanges with capacities of up to 40,000 lines are due to
come into service in major cities from 1976. Mobile electronic exchanges were
introduced in 1973. Pulse code modulation systems are being used to increase
the circuit capacity of lines on routes between exchanges. Nearly 3,300 were
in service by the end of 1974.
International subscriber dialling operates from London and other major
cities to 24 countries including most of western Europe, the United States,
Canada and New Zealand. The Post Office is engaged in a five-year programme
costing £250 million to expand Britain’s international telephone exchange
^Operator-connected calls are handled at London, Glasgow and provincial
international exchanges, which have direct telephone circuits to European
countries. Direct links via transatlantic and Commonwealth cable networks,

communications satellites and high frequency radio provide service to coun¬
tries outside Europe. Almost every country can be reached from the inter¬
national exchanges, via intermediate points where necessary.
A radio tower, 620 feet (189 metres) high, in London provides microwave
radio links for carrying long-distance telephone and television circuits. There
are over 200 Post Office communications masts and towers in use.
Several specialised services are available by telephone, including the ‘999’
emergency dialling service enabling subscribers to be connected as quickly
as possible, and free of charge, to the police, ambulance or fire brigade services.
A public radiotelephone service operating in Greater London, south Lanca¬
shire, the Midlands and the east Pennines enables users of vehicles fitted with
suitable equipment to make or receive calls to or from any telephone in the
British network; the service is being extended to three other areas in Britain.
Recorded information services include: the speaking clock, weather forecasts,
motoring information, recipes, cricket scores, Financial Times Share Index
and Business News Summary, and 'Dial a Disc’. In London a recorded service
provides details in five languages of events taking place, and a similar service,
in English only, is provided in Edinburgh during the summer.
There are over 266,000 private circuits not connected with the public exchange
networks. These are associated with circuits rented for private use for tele¬
phone conversations, teleprinter connections, photo-telegraphy, television,
music, or for the transmission of signals which represent data for computers
or operate other devices.
There are some 39 submarine cable systems between Britain and Europe and
five between Britain and North America, covering a total of about 18,000
miles (28,970 kilometres). Cable systems using transistors in place of ther¬
mionic valves have been developed by British manufacturers in consultation
with the Post Office Research Station and are used in many new systems. A
comprehensive Commonwealth telephone cable plan, completed by 1967,
covered the construction of three long-distance telephone cable systems:
CANT AT 1 (2,100 nautical miles), from Scotland to Canada; COMPAC
(8,130 nautical miles), connecting Canada, Hawaii, Fiji, New Zealand and
Australia; and SEACOM (7,070 nautical miles), connecting Australia, New
Guinea, Guam, Hong Kong, Malaysia and Singapore. The submarine cables
are linked overland across Canada and Australia by radio microwave systems.
CANT AT 2, which entered service in 1974, has doubled telephone links
across the Atlantic, with its 1,840 circuits. It covers 2,800 nautical miles
between Cornwall and Nova Scotia.
The Goonhilly satellite communication earth station in Cornwall was brought
into operation in 1962, and took part in the first experimental satellite com¬
munications using the Telstar and Relay satellites. A second aerial was
introduced in 1968 and a third was brought into use in 1972. The three aerials
provide commercial telephone and television circuits via high-capacity geo¬
stationary satellites positioned over the Atlantic and Indian Oceans. In May
1975 Britain operated some 1,150 satellite telephone circuits to 40 countries.
The satellites used in the global communications systems are provided by the
International Telecommunications Satellite Organisation (see p. 414) of which
Britain is the second largest shareholder.

In addition to the radio stations for overseas telecommunications, the Post
Office has 11 coast radio stations in Britain which provide radiotelegraph and
radiotelephone communications with ships at sea at ranges of up to some 500
miles (805 kilometres) and 250 miles (402 kilometres) respectively, and with
oil rigs and pipe-laying barges in the North Sea. There is also the long-distance
radiotelegraph and radiotelephone station, Portishead Radio, which communi¬
cates with ships in all parts of the world.
These coast stations are an important part of the search and rescue services
concerned with safety of life at sea (see p. 311)- They keep continuous watch
on the international radiotelegraph and radiotelephone frequencies for distress
calls from ships or aircraft and take immediate action to obtain assistance for
any vessel in distress. During 1974-75 the stations handled 792 urgency and
distress calls.
In addition to the services for safety of life at sea, the stations exchange
radiotelegrams with ships and connect radiotelephone calls between telephone
subscribers ashore and suitably equipped ships. Radio teleprinter facilities are
being introduced at selected coast stations to enable ships to be connected to
telex subscribers ashore. The stations also broadcast navigational warnings
and weather bulletins.
An £8 million microwave radio system is being developed to link oil and
gas production platforms in the North Sea with the mainland. Two new radio
stations under construction at Peterhead (Grampian) and Scousburgh in the
Shetland Islands are expected to enter service in October 1975.
The Post Office is one of the largest users of automatic data processing equip¬
ment and techniques in Britain. Its computer organisation is divided into two
parts: the Post Office Data Processing Service for its own internal services,
and the National Data Processing Service for services to business firms and
other external users.
The world’s first purpose-built system of conferences by television, ‘Confra¬
vision’, was introduced by the Post Office in 1971. Using Post Office video
circuits the service allows private communication between studios in London,
Birmingham, Bristol, Glasgow, and Manchester. An international Confra¬
vision link to Sweden was opened in 1974 and a further extension to the
Netherlands began operating in April 1975.
The Post Office is spending some £29 million a year on research and develop¬
ment, in collaboration with industry and the universities. A £12 million
research centre, the largest complex of its kind in Europe, at Martlesham
Heath, Suffolk, is nearing completion.

Manpower
Employment policy in general, industrial relations and pay policy are the
responsibility of the Department of Employment (see p. 49), while the
Manpower Services Commission (see p. 339) is responsible for the public
employment and training services and for advising the Government on man¬
power questions generally. In Northern Ireland employment matters are the
responsibility of the Department of Manpower Services.
MANPOWER
The total working population of Britain at the middle of June 1974 was
257 million, about 46 per cent of the total population. If the unemployed,
the self-employed, and the Armed Forces are omitted from the working
population, there remained 22-8 million employees (137 million men and 9-1
million women) in employment. The percentage of women (particularly those
working part time) in the labour force continues to rise. The great majority of
the working population work for a wage or salary, but about 1-9 million are
employers or self-employed.
Northern Ireland, which has 2-8 per cent of the total population of the
United Kingdom, has 2-3 per cent of its working population (see p. 338).
Farmers and smallholders working their own holdings account for about
6 per cent of the working population.
The working population increased slowly until 1966, and declined between
1966 and 1971, since when it has been rising again (see Table 26). One reason
for the fall after 1966 was the increased number in full-time education. During
the late 1970s the number of males in the labour force is expected to remain
approximately constant, while the number of females is expected to continue
to increase.
Though successful development policies in the less-prosperous regions may
raise the working population above the levels forecast, any increasing demand
for labour must in general be met by better deployment of manpower, im¬
proved productivity and more training. In general, non-employed married
women form the only substantial reserve.
The industrial distribution of employees is shown in Table 27.
Most industries employ women as well as men though not always for the
same types of work; for example, few women are managers and few personal
secretaries are men. Although it is illegal to employ women in certain jobs,
such as underground work in coal mines, the Government has introduced
legislation which would, in general, forbid discrimination against women in
opportunities for employment (see p. 345). Women are chiefly employed in
the food, drink and tobacco industries; the manufacture of electrical goods,
textiles and clothing; the distributive trades; the financial, professional,
scientific and miscellaneous services; and public administration.
It is estimated that in October 1974 in manufacturing industries in Great
Britain (comparable figures for Northern Ireland are not available) 27 per
cent were administrative, technical and clerical employees (the ratio ranged
338

according to industry from 147 per cent in clothing and footwear to 38-8 per
cent in chemicals and allied industries).
As an aid to government manpower policies the Manpower Services Com¬
mission, both independently and through its Employment Service Agency
(see p. 340), maintains a continuing study of manpower resources and require¬
ments for the whole economy and for certain industries and occupations in
particular.
The commission, through its Training Services Agency (see p. 343), also
co-operates with industrial training boards on technical problems connected
with industrial and manpower planning, recruitment, training and careers
advice.
The general unemployment rate in Britain as a whole was among the lowest in
the world during the 20 years prior to 1967—usually between 1 and 2 per cent
and, although it has risen since then, it was still lower and rising more slowly
in 1975 than in other developed countries.

It has been relatively low in the south-east of England, and consistently
higher in those parts of the country which have the greatest dependence on
shipbuilding, coalmining, and certain branches of the heavy engineering and
metal manufacturing industries, notably parts of Scotland and Wales, and
north-east England and Merseyside. These areas have been the subject of a
series of measures of selective assistance to stimulate industrial expansion;
and counter-measures have been taken to limit expansion in areas of man¬
power shortage (see p. 212). The general unemployment rate in Great
Britain in July 1975 was 41 per cent: the areas with the highest rates were
Wales and Scotland and the North and North-West regions.
The total working population of Northern Ireland—including employers and
self-employed but excluding certain unpaid helpers—was 582,000 in June
1974 (374»000 males anci 208,000 females). The number of employees in
employment was 494,000. The largest non-service industries are agriculture,

The unemployment rate in Northern Ireland has remained higher than in
other parts of the United Kingdom. In July 1975 it was 7 4 per cent of all
employees. The Northern Ireland Department of Commerce has wide
powers (similar to those of the Department of Industry in Great Britain) to
assist the development and diversification of industry. It is using these powers
vigorously in an attempt to improve the situation (see p. 59).
EMPLOYMENT AND TRAINING SERVICES
In Great Britain the Manpower Services Commission (MSC), set up under
the Employment and Training Act 1973, runs the public employment and
training services previously provided by the Department of Employment. Its
responsibilities are exercised through two agencies, the Employment Service
Agency (ESA, see p. 340) and the Training Services Agency (TSA, see
P- 343). both of which are statutory organisations headed by a chief executive
appointed by the MSC with the approval of the Secretary of State for Em¬
ployment. The MSC has a chairman and nine other members representing
employers and employees, and local government and educational interests;
responsibility for the management and development of the commission’s
services thus belongs directly to representatives of those who use them.

EMPLOYMENT
SERVICES
Jobcentres
BRITAIN 1976: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
The MSC carries out its functions within a general policy framework
agreed with the Secretary of State, and is responsible for expenditure in excess
of £100 million a year. Most of its activities are financed from public funds,
and it receives an annual grant-in-aid from the Department of Employment.
The MSC is advised by a network of local consultative committees on which
employers, employees and other local interests are represented, so that it may
secure the full benefit of local knowledge and the co-operation of employers
and employees.
The main duty of the MSC is to make such arrangements as it considers
appropriate for assisting people to select, train for, obtain and retain em¬
ployment, and for assisting employers to obtain suitable employees. Its
responsibilities include running the offices of the employment service,
Professional and Executive Recruitment (PER), the Occupational Guidance
Units and other employment services, operating the Training Opportunities
Scheme (TOPS) and co-ordinating the activities of the industrial training
boards (see p. 343). The services in Northern Ireland are run on similar lines
by the Department of Manpower Services but there are some variations related
to the much smaller area of administration. Reference is made to these
variations where they exist.
While many of the employment and training functions of the Secretary of
State have been transferred to the MSC, he retains responsibility for general
manpower policy, manpower aspects of regional policy and regional economic
planning, and for the department’s unit for manpower studies, the race rela¬
tions employment advisory service, certain executive duties under the Race
Relations Act 1968 (see p. 147), certain functions in relation to redundancy
payments, the issue of work permits to immigrants and international aspects
of employment and training matters, and the wages inspectorate. Manage¬
ment of unemployment benefit has been separated from that of the employ¬
ment services and is administered under a regional benefit manager at each of
the department’s regional offices.
The main government employment services are provided in Great Britain
through a country-wide network of jobcentres (see below) and employment
offices which are run by the Employment Service Agency (ESA) of the Man¬
power Services Commission.
Employment offices provide a comprehensive service for employers needing
staff and for people, whether or not already in employment, seeking jobs.
Information and advice on any employment problem is available to all. Use
of the service is voluntary. Employers and individuals alike remain free to use
general or specialised fee-charging private employment agencies and direct
recruitment by advertisement or personal introduction. There are some 1,000
local offices, which placed people in more than 1-5 million jobs in i974> sorne
15 to 20 per cent of total adult placings in Britain.
The employment offices handle the full range of occupations and deal with
full-time, part-time and temporary vacancies. Details of unfilled vacancies (or
of people seeking jobs) can be circulated quickly in the ‘travel to work’ area,
or more widely if necessary.
Employment offices are being replaced by jobcentres which provide self-
service facilities in addition to other services. The first jobcentre was opened
in Reading in May 1973 and a network of 800 is to be in operation by the end
of the 1970s.

A commercial employment service for office and shop work is available at all
employment offices and also at a number of specialised commercial employ¬
ment offices. In the hotel and catering industry a specialist service is based on
the Hotel and Catering Trades Exchange in London and more than 20 hotel
and catering trades sections of employment offices elsewhere.
The Regular Forces Resettlement Service, in which the Department of
Employment collaborates with the Ministry of Defence and the voluntary
organisations concerned with former regular servicemen, helps members of
the Forces to achieve a satisfactory transition to civilian life.
In areas where there are large groups of hospitals, there are specially trained
officers in the employment service to deal with the employment problems of
nurses, midwives and those in related occupations or who wish to enter those
professions. Elsewhere nursing employment work is done as part of the general
employment service.
In large-scale redundancy situations, teams of officers from local employ¬
ment offices visit firms to assist in the redeployment of redundant workers to
new jobs or training.
Professional and Executive Recruitment (PER) provides a specialised service
for men and women looking for professional, managerial, technical and
scientific appointments. Each of the 38 offices is staffed by experienced con¬
sultants who can quickly identify job opportunities in any part of the country
by use of a computer-assisted matching and selection system. The service is
free to candidates, while employers are charged a fee on all successful placings,
based on the starting salary. A broadly similar service, free to both employers
and candidates, is operated in Northern Ireland.
Occupational guidance units are situated in 44 centres of population. They
are available free to anybody who wishes to take expert advice before choosing
or changing his occupation.
Since the implementation of the Employment and Training Act 1973 young
people have had a choice of employment services. All local education authori¬
ties have a duty to provide a vocational guidance service for people attending
educational institutions and an employment service for those leaving them.
In addition these authorities have powers, which they must exercise as
required by the Secretary of State for Employment, to extend these services
to people in their early years in employment. At the same time the ESA (see
p. 340) offers its services to young people who have left school and who are
faced with the need to choose their career.
In Northern Ireland the Youth Employment Service has recently been
absorbed into the Department of Manpower Services, which provides a
single comprehensive guidance and placement service for people of all ages.
The Disablement Resettlement Service is designed to help disabled people
to get and keep suitable work. It is available to anyone over school-leaving
age who is substantially handicapped. All aspects of the service, which is
administered by the ESA (see p. 340), are under review.
Vocational guidance and help in finding jobs is given at employment offices
by specialised disablement resettlement officers (DROs) who, where necessary,
arrange for a course of industrial rehabilitation or training or both. A Register
of Disabled Persons is maintained and all employers of 20 or more persons are

required to employ a quota (3 per cent for all industries, except shipping in
respect of the manning of ships) of registered disabled persons.
Employment rehabilitation is provided at 26 centres (including one linked
with a medical rehabilitation unit). Attendance at a centre is voluntary and
maintenance allowances are paid. Financial assistance is also given to
various voluntary and other organisations operating approved employment
rehabilitation.
There are vocational training facilities for the disabled at skillcentres (see
p. 344), educational institutions and employers’ establishments. For the more
seriously disabled there are special residential training colleges run by
voluntary organisations with the help of the Training Services Agency. Grants
are available to disabled people qualified to undertake study or training for
professional or comparable employment.
Remploy Ltd., a non-profit-making company, partly supported by public
funds, provides sheltered employment in 87 factories in Great Britain for
about 8,300 registered severely disabled people who are unlikely to obtain
work except under special conditions. (A similar organisation, Ulster Sheltered
Employment Ltd., exists in Northern Ireland.) In March 1974 the ESA was
helping local authorities and voluntary organisations with the cost of providing
facilities for sheltered employment for 2,062 blind workers and 113 partially
sighted workers, and 46 trainees.
As part of the policy of assisting geographical mobility of labour within
Britain to balance resources and demands, the ESA also makes grants and
allowances to help with costs of fares, temporary lodging and acquisition of
and removal to a new home, in specified instances. The grants are available to
unemployed workers moving away from home to take up employment, to key
workers transferred by a firm to a new plant in an assisted area (see p. 210),
and to local unemployed workers recruited to new plants in areas of high
unemployment and sent to the parent works for preliminary training.
The Government offers incentives both to encourage industrial expansion and
reduce unemployment in the assisted areas. The incentives include grants
towards the cost of new buildings and equipment; tax allowances; help with
training; and a regional employment subsidy.
In general, people coming to Britain for employment (including Common¬
wealth citizens who do not have the right of abode, see p. 11, but excluding
nationals of European Community countries) need a work permit issued by
the Department of Employment. This must be applied for by the prospective ;
employer and is issued for a specific job and for a fixed initial period not
exceeding 12 months in the first instance. People admitted as holders of work
permits may only change their jobs with the approval of the department.
Normally their stay is extended if they remain in approved employment. After
four years’ approved employment the time limit on their stay may be removed
and a worker may change employment without restriction. Nationals of the
European Community countries do not require permits (see below) but for
other overseas workers permits are in general issued only for work requiring
a professional qualification, skill or experience, where the Department of :
Employment is satisfied that the worker is necessary, and where the wages
and conditions are not less favourable than those generally available in the
area for similar work.
Subject to an annual quota for both men and women (other than the more

highly skilled), permits may, however, be issued for work in the hotel and
catering industry, hospitals, and resident domestic work.
Commonwealth citizens and foreign nationals (other than nationals of
European Community countries) are generally eligible for permits on the
same terms. In addition Commonwealth citizens may be admitted for fixed
periods of training ‘on the job’ arranged in advance if they hold student
trainee permits issued by the Department of Employment. Foreign nationals
may also enter Britain as holders of student employee permits for short-term
employment, thus enabling them to improve their English and widen their
experience.
In Northern Ireland employment permits are issued by the Department of
Manpower Services and are required for non-Northern Ireland workers.
Legislation defines Northern Ireland workers and makes certain occupations
exempt.
The European Community regulations, now enforced in Great Britain,
establish the rights of workers to move freely between member states for the
purposes of employment. In Northern Ireland there is a transitional period
extending up to 31st December 1977 before this applies. Workers entering
another member state are entitled to be treated in the same way as nationals of
that state as regards facilities of the national employment services, pay and
working conditions, trade union rights, vocational training and retraining
facilities, access to housing and property, and insurance and industrial injury
benefits. Workers who wish to remain in the United Kingdom for longer than
an initial period of six months are expected to apply for a residence permit.
If they are in permanent employment the residence permit is valid for five
years. If the employment is temporary (that is, expected to be of less than
12 months duration) the permit is valid for the expected duration of the
employment.
Britain, as a member of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and
Development, participates with 13 European countries in the arrangements for
assisting nationals of the countries concerned to obtain employment in other
member countries.
Race relations employment advisers, based in the Department of Employ¬
ment s regional offices, provide advice and information to employers, trade
unions, and other organisations with the aim of improving employment
opportunities for immigrant workers.
The task of managing and developing the country’s training programme,
expenditure on which is planned to double between 1974-75 and 1978-79,
is the responsibility of the Training Services Agency (TSA) of the Manpower
Services Commission.
Most industrial and commercial training has always been carried out by
individual employers, but in recent years the Government has taken a number
of measures based on the need to provide trained manpower to sustain the
growth of the economy, and to provide opportunities for people to make the
best use of their skills in the right jobs and to acquire new skills when old ones
are no longer in demand.
The framework of training in industry and commerce is mainly based on the
Industrial Training Act 1964, as revised by the Employment and Training
Act 1973. There are 23 industrial training boards and the Foundry Industry
Training Committee appointed to be responsible for the quantity and quality
344
Training

BRITAIN 1976: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
of industrial training in the industry concerned; 12 million employees or about
60 per cent of those in industry and commerce are covered.
Under the Employment and Training Act 1973 most °f the Secretary of
State for Employment’s previous responsibilities for exercising control over
the activities of industrial training boards were transferred to the Manpower
Services Commission. Exchequer funds are available to cover the boards’
operating expenses, including advisory services, and for grants for certain key
training activities; the boards also have powers to raise levies to finance other
training activities, the levy rate normally being limited to 1 per cent of
employers’ payrolls. The boards’ plans and budgets are agreed with the TSA
for a running 5-year period.
A body sponsored by the MSC is the Industrial Training Service (ITS)
which is independent and non-profit-making and helps companies, employers
associations and industrial training boards in any industry in the identification
of training needs, the formulation of training policy, job analysis for any j
occupational categories, training programme design and the assessment of
training effectiveness.
The Training Opportunities Scheme (TOPS) is intended to supplement the
training given by industry by providing individuals over the age of 19 with
the opportunitv to acquire a skdl or to retrain. Training is carried out at over
50 skillcentres (SCs) which are within easy reach of the main industrial areas i
of the country. Courses are available in over 60 different trades. Most courses
last for six months but a few are longer. Training under the scheme is also
provided in colleges and employers’ establishments. For severely disabled
people training is provided at four residential training colleges run by volun¬
tary organisations with government financial assistance. Trainees are paid
allowances which vary according to the number of their dependants and their
former earnings. Allowances are substantially higher than unemployment 1
benefit.
The Government is expanding the scheme substantially. Some 40,000
people were trained under TOPS in i973> anc^ ^ hoped to increase the
numbers to between 70,000 and 75,000 by 1976.
The Government also offers industry a wide range of training facilities outside
the scope of the TOPS. The Training Within Industry Scheme (TWI) is in¬
tended to develop the skills of supervisors in instructing and communicating,
in improving methods and in preventing accidents. Special courses are avail¬
able for supervisors employed in offices, retail distribution and hospitals, and
for staff engaged in export procedures, and there is also an in-plant training
development service to aid selection and further the training of operatives and
clerks as instructors. Courses in industrial instruction techniques are available
to firms and SC staff at the Training Services Agency’s two Instructor Train¬
ing Colleges (one in England and one in Scotland) and at six Instructor
Training Units attached to SCs.
Training services at SCs, TWI courses, and courses at Instructor Training
Colleges are available to trainees from overseas under approved schemes (for
instance, those of the International Labour Organisation or technical assist¬
ance provided jointly by the Department of Employment and the Ministry of
Overseas Development).
Certain training services, previously available free to firms expanding in
assisted areas, are now available to all firms; these services comprise the train¬
ing of firms’ own instructors, training of experienced workers in instructional

techniques, provision of mobile instructors to train people in employers’ own
premises, and training of supervisors.
TERMS OF EMPLOYMENT AND WORKING CONDITIONS
Though Britain has been a pioneer in the introduction of protective legislation
for the safety, health and welfare of employees and in providing certain legal
immunities for trade unions, until recently there were relatively few legal
restrictions on the right of an employer to hire an employee on any terms which
he would accept and to dismiss him at will. The employee in general looked
to his trade union to protect him. The determination by statute of minimum
wages, holidays and holiday pay was in principle confined to those trades
and* industries where the organisation of employers or workers, or both, was
inadequate to negotiate collective agreements and to ensure their observance
(see p. 348). However, recent legislation provides considerable safeguards for
the employee in his terms of employment as well as working conditions. The
Terms and Conditions of Employment Act 1959, as amended under recent
legislation, provides machinery, under certain conditions, for enforcing the
observance of terms or conditions established by collective agreement. The
Contracts of Employment Act 1972 requires an employer to give an employee
written information on his terms and conditions of employment, and the
procedure available to him where he has a grievance about his employment;
it also lays down the right of both employers and employees to minimum
periods of notice when employment is to be terminated. Under the Redun¬
dancy Payments Acts 1965 and 1969 employees with a minimum period of
service of 104 weeks are entitled to lump-sum redundancy payments if their
jobs cease to exist (for example, because of technological improvements or
because of a fall in demand) and their employers cannot offer suitable alterna¬
tive work, the cost being partly met from a fund subscribed to by industry
as a whole. The Trade Union and Labour Relations Act 1974 gives
protection against unfair dismissal by providing machinery under which an
employee may bring an action against an employer for unfair dismissal, and
obtain either reinstatement, re-engagement or compensation; give legal sup¬
port to the right to trade union organisation by making it illegal to dismiss, or
to discriminate against, a person because he is or proposes to become a member
of an independent trade union; and lays down that written collective agree¬
ments between trade unions and employers are presumed to be intended to
be legally binding only if they contain a provision to that effect. The Employ¬
ment Protection Bill (introduced in March 1975) would provide for the exten¬
sion of the rights of employees regarding unfair dismissal and to discrimi¬
nation short of dismissal because of trade union membership, and to payment
when work is not available for reasons other than as a result of a trade dispute.
The Race Relations Act 1968 (see p. 147) makes it illegal for an employer
to discriminate on the grounds of race, colour or ethnic or national origin in
the engagement, dismissal or employment of workers.
In March 1975 the Government introduced a Sex Discrimination Bill
which would make it unlawful, with some limited exceptions (for example,
for employment in a private house or in a firm of five employees or less), for
an employer to discriminate against women in recruitment or treatment of
existing employees regarding promotion, training, transfer, dismissal and
benefits.
Other legislation prescribes minimum standards of safety, health and wel¬
fare in most places of employment (see p. 355). However, it is recognised
346

Fees
BRITAIN 1976: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
that the causes of many accidents are not amenable to statutory control.
Therefore, voluntary action taken by employer organisations, often in associa¬
tion with trade unions, is encouraged.
Minimum rates of pay for many manual workers are determined by national
collective agreements or statutory wages regulation orders. For men these
range from about ^0-50 to ^1-50 per hour. Separate rates for men and women
are less frequently specified as the date for full implementation of the Equal
Pay Act 1970 approaches (see below). Many employers pay above the national
minima. Higher rates are also usually paid for shift-work and overtime, and
weekly earnings may be further increased by piecework rates and other incen¬
tive schemes. Piecework rates are of declining importance in a number of
industries, where methods of production tend to dictate the output of a worker.
On the basis of the latest survey in a series conducted every year by the
Department of Employment into earnings and hours of work in manufacturing
industries and some non-manufacturing industries throughout Britain, the
average earnings of full-time male adult manual workers in October 1974 were
£1-08 an hour and £48-63 a week. Full-time women manual workers at the
same date earned an everage of £0-72 an hour and £27-01 a week.
Minimum rates for women manual workers tend to be lower than the
corresponding rates for men though the gap is gradually closing. Women s
earnings are markedly lower than those of men, partly because on average
they work shorter hours, with less overtime paid at premium rates, but also
because a smaller proportion of women do skilled work. The Equal Pay Act
1970 provides that from 29th December 1975 a woman doing the same or
broadly similar work to a man will qualify for equal pay and conditions of
employment.
Between October 1964 and October 1974 average weekly wage rates in¬
creased by 158 per cent and the average weekly earnings of manual workers, |
before tax and national insurance deductions, by 168 per cent. Part of the in¬
crease has been offset by a rise in retail prices of about 100 per cent and by
larger national insurance contributions and income tax. The trends of earn¬
ings, wage rates, retail prices, wages and salaries per unit of output since 1970
are shown in the diagram opposite.
Remuneration in commercial, technical and professional careers is normally
by annual salary, often on a scale carrying annual increments, and such careers
generally afford opportunities for promotion to posts with higher remunera¬
tion. Starting salaries may be in the range of £2,000 to £2,400 (lower for
trainees in their teens and higher for some graduates entering industry). The
average weekly earnings of full-time non-manual adult workers in April 19/4
were about £54 for men and £29 for women. On average, salaries more than
doubled between 1964 and 1974.
Most of the senior posts in business, the professions and the Civil Service
are in the range of £7,000 to £15,000 a year gross before tax. The posts with
salaries in the range of £15,000 to £25,000 a year include those of Cabinet
Ministers, top-ranking judicial appointments, the highest positions in govern¬
ment departments and the largest municipal authorities, editors of dai y
newspapers, some persons outstanding in their professions and in the higher
managerial posts in industry, commerce and banking. The earnings of a few
persons in business, star entertainers and certain other very successful people
exceed £50,000 a year gross. Net earnings of highly paid people are consider¬
ably lower because of the incidence of taxation (see p. 365).
Hours of Work
EMPLOYMENT
A Royal Commission on the Distribution of Income and Wealth was set up
in July 1974 to inquire into, and to report on, such matters concerning the
distribution of personal incomes, both earned and unearned, and wealth as
may be referred to it by the Government. The work of the commission forms
an integral part of government policy on industrial relations and collective
bargaining and helps secure a fairer distribution of income and wealth. It
works in close co-operation with other bodies involved.
Women have the same right of entry as men to nearly all public offices,
administrative posts and professions. As civil servants, Ministers of the Crown!
Members of Parliament, salaried magistrates and solicitors, and in most pro¬
fessions they are paid the same salary as men for doing the same kind of work.
Women in independent professions are not expected to charge lower fees
than men. Equal pay as between men and women will be enforced in all
occupations from the end of 1975 (see p. 346).
The normal working week in Britain is in the range 39-40 hours for manual
work and 37-38 for non-manual work; a five-day week is usually worked.
Actual hours worked by men in manual occupations are usually somewhat
longer than their standard hours; in October 1974 they were 45-1 compared
with 37-4 for women. Men and women in non-manual occupations generally

work little or no overtime, although senior salaried staff may from time to
time be required to work substantial (unpaid) overtime.
National legislation limits and defines permissible hours of work for women
and young people in a number of industries or trades the maximum, with
limited exceptions, being 48 hours a week and 10 hours a day (9 hours a day
for 6-day-week workers) in premises covered by the Factories Act (see p. 355)
for adult women over 18 and young people between 16 and 18. The employ¬
ment of women and young people at night is prohibited in industrial under¬
takings, except for young men over 16 working in some continuous-process
industries (subject to certain conditions). The Department of Employment
can make exemptions from these restrictions on grounds of public interest. In
general the hours of work of adult men are not restricted by statute.
With few exceptions, manual workers (including shop assistants) in indus¬
tries covered by agreements or statutory orders are entitled to paid holidays
of at least three weeks and over one-half have basic entitlements of more than
three weeks, in addition to public holidays. Non-manual workers generally
have higher entitlements than manual workers. Some agreements, particularly
in the non-manual sector, provide for extended holidays related to length of
service, or status, or both. .
Payment is made for public holidays, which are as follows: in addition to
Good Friday and Christmas Day there are public holidays in England and
Wales on New Year’s Day, Easter Monday, the last Monday in May, the last
Monday in August, and the first weekday after Christmas (Boxing Day);
while in Scotland, though there are many local variations, there are bank
holidays on New Year’s Day, 2nd January (in the civil service, banks and
most major industries but on another additional day elsewhere) and 3rd
January if either the 1st or 2nd January happens to be a Sunday, the first
Monday in May, and the first Monday in August. Northern Ireland observes
all the English holidays and, in addition, has a holiday on St. Patrick s Day
(17th March) and on 12th July; the Tuesday after Easter is also a customary
holiday for industry and trade.
A variety of additional benefits exist in varying degree. It has been estimated
that at the end of 1971 in million employees were covered by occupational
pension schemes. Many employees are also covered by occupational sick pay
schemes (additional or complementary to the State schemes, see p. 127). A
smaller number are covered by schemes for redundancy payments above the
statutory minimum (see p. 345)- Such benefits are more usual among clerical
and professional employees receiving a standard salary than among manual
workers, who have a chance to increase their pay—for example, by working
overtime. Senior members of firms may use a company car and some firms
provide profit-sharing and share-saving schemes.
The Office of Manpower Economics, established in 1971 as an independent
non-statutory body, acts as secretariat for the three review bodies set up to
advise on the remuneration of certain groups in the public sector for which
negotiating machinery is not appropriate, such as Members of Parliament, the
judiciary, the armed forces, and doctors and dentists; it also services inquiries
on particular pay structures and related problems.
The structure of labour relations in Britain has been established mainly on a
voluntary basis. The system chiefly rests on the organisation of employers and
EMPLOYMENT
Wages Councils

workers into employers’ associations and trade unions. These organisations
discuss and negotiate terms and conditions of employment and other matters
affecting people at their work. In the past the emphasis has been on industry¬
wide agreements supplemented as necessary by local agreements in firms or
factories, but a gradual change of attitudes and structure has led to more
emphasis being placed on agreements at firm and factory level. In some
industries, firms and factories, negotiations are conducted simply by meetings
of employers and employees’ representatives, which are held when necessary;
in others, voluntary joint councils or committees have been established on a
permanent basis. The scope of the various joint bodies—from the national joint
industrial councils for whole industries to the works councils and committees
in individual workplaces—varies widely. Although some of them only negotiate
and others discuss a wide range of topics, the scope of the bodies is tending to
widen and the distinction between discussion (or consultation) and negotia¬
tion to become blurred. Normally these arrangements for collective bargaining
suffice to settle all questions which are raised, but provision is sometimes made
for matters not so settled to be referred for settlement to independent concilia¬
tion or arbitration.
Under the Industry Bill introduced in 1975 (see p. 208) trade unions may
obtain information concerning the future plans of an enterprise whose contribu¬
tion to a particular sector of industry is important to the economy, unless it
is considered that this would be contrary to the national interest or in breach
of a statute or trust of confidence. The Employment Protection Bill (see p. 345)
also makes provision for information needed for collective bargaining pur¬
poses to be disclosed by employers to trade unions, subject to certain safe¬
guards.
Standing arrangements exist for consultation at national level between the
Government, the Confederation of British Industry (CBI) (see p. 351), the
Trades Union Congress (TUC) (see p. 352) and the nationalised industries
through the National Economic Development Council (see p. 194) on matters
in which employers and workers have a common interest. The operation of
collective bargaining has from time to time been restricted in an attempt to
control inflation (see p. 196).
Both official and voluntary organisations are concerned with promoting
better human relationships in industry. The Government has sought to extend
by research the available knowledge of the factors influencing human relations
in industry and human efficiency. Such research is sponsored or conducted by
the Social Science Research Council (see p. 415) and the Medical Research
Council (see p. 410). In addition, the Department of Employment has set up
a Work Research Unit to provide information on how particular jobs can be
redesigned to create greater satisfaction, and to help industry and others in
initiating and evaluating changes in the content of work. Voluntary organisa¬
tions include bodies which deal with management problems and provide a
service to subscribing firms; professional associations, linking individuals with
a common interest in particular functions of management; and bodies provid¬
ing specialist services, usually on a fee-paying basis.
In a number of industries and trades where the organisation of employers or
employees or both is not strong enough to provide a basis for successful
voluntary arrangements, there are statutory wage-regulating bodies, known
as wages councils. These are composed of equal numbers of representatives of
employers and employees in the respective sectors of industry, with three
independent members. Wages councils may submit proposals for fixing
35°

minimum remuneration and holidays with pay to the Secretary of State who
must then make orders giving statutory force to such proposals, subject only
to his right to return them as a whole for further consideration by the councils.
The Department of Employment’s Wages Inspectorate helps employers and
workers to interpret the provisions of wage regulation orders and sees that
they are complied with. About 3-25 million workers are covered by such
arrangements.
Agricultural wages boards (there are separate boards for England and Wales
and for Scotland) perform similar functions in relation to employment in
agriculture.
The Employment Protection Bill (see p. 345) would make a number of
important changes in the role, operation and procedure of wages councils,
designed to encourage the transition from statutory regulation to voluntary
collective bargaining and give the councils a greater measure of independence
from the Government by enabling them to make their own wage regulation
orders instead of submitting proposals to the Secretary of State for Employ¬
ment. The changes proposed in the Bill would also widen the scope of the
councils by enabling them to regulate any terms and conditions of employ¬
ment in addition to remuneration and holidays, and give the Government
power to convert a wages council into a statutory joint industrial council where
facilities for collective bargaining are thought to have become adequate.
The Trade Union and Labour Relations Act 1974 (see p. 345) defines the
status of trade unions and employers’ associations and sets out certain legal
requirements which they must observe. The Act confers immunities on them
in respect of actions taken in the course of a trade dispute; confirms the right
to picket peacefully and also provides that collective agreements shall not be
legally enforceable unless they specifically provide for this.
Many employers in Britain are members of employers’ organisations wholly
or partly concerned with labour questions. The primary aims of such organisa¬
tions are to help to establish suitable terms and conditions of employment,
including a sound wage structure and proper standards of safety, health and
welfare; to promote good relations with employees and the efficient use of
manpower; and to provide means of settling any disputes which may arise.
Employers’ organisations are usually organised on an industry basis rather
than a product basis. A few are purely local in character or deal with a section
of an industry; others are national in scope and are concerned with the whole
of a particular industry. In some of the chief industries there are local or
regional organisations combined into national federations, while in others,
within which different firms are engaged in making different principal pro¬
ducts, there is a complex structure with national and regional federations for
these different sections of the industry as well as for the industry as a whole.
Although there are some 1,100 employers’ organisations dealing with labour
matters, most of these are local branches of national organisations. There are
about 50 of these, most of which belong to the CBI, and they negotiate the
national collective agreements for their industry with the trade unions
concerned.
The final authority of a local or small national organisation may be a meeting
where all member firms are directly represented; but in larger organisa¬
tions some form of indirect representation is necessary, either through local
organisations or through regions or sections into which these are grouped.
The representatives thus chosen, together with a number of office holders,
EMPLOYMENT
351
The Confederation
of British
Industry
Trade Unions
form a general council or central committee, which meets perhaps once a
quarter, mainly to make major policy decisions, to elect committees and to
ratify their work. A paid staff under a director or secretary carries out the
organisation s day-to-day work. There is usually a small working group,
consisting of senior officials and committee chairmen, which meets to deal
with urgent questions and co-ordinate the work of committees.
The principal organisation representing employers is the CBI, which deals
with all matters (not only labour relations) affecting the interests of employers
and represents them nationally to the Government and the public and also
internationally, for instance, in the International Labour Organisation and in
the various institutions of the European Community. It is also the British
member of UNICE (the organisation of industrial federations of the European
Community). The majority of national employers’ organisations and national¬
ised industries and a large number of individual companies, both large and
small, belong to the CBI. Its representatives sit on the National Economic
Development Council, on various government advisory committees, and on
other statutory bodies, such as the Manpower Services Commission and the
Health and Safety Commission (see p. 355)- It is also consulted regarding
appointments to the council of the Advisory, Conciliation and Arbitration
Service (see p. 353).
In nearly all industries and occupations some workers—and in some industries
nearly all workers—are organised into trade unions. These have grown up
gradually and independently over many years and, consequently, their form
and organisation vary considerably as do their traditions and attitudes. Trade
unions started more than two hundred years ago among the skilled craftsmen
and spread later to the general labouring and unskilled classes. More recently
trade unionism has increased among clerical, supervisory, technical and
administrative workers. The qualification for membership of some unions
is occupational (for instance, they may recruit clerks or fitters wherever
employed), while in most others the qualification is industrial (that is, they
seek to recruit all employees in an industry, whatever their occupation). In
many unions recruitment is based on a combination of these principles.
At the end of 1973 the total membership of British trade unions was about
11'5 million. There were 495 unions, but nearly 77 per cent of all trade union¬
ists were in the 24 largest unions, each with a membership of 100,000 or over,
while under 1 per cent were in the 253 smallest unions with under 1,000
members each.
The number of trade unionists has increased during the last decade but the
number of unions has fallen owing to amalgamations.
The Registrar of Friendly Societies (RES) is required to maintain a list of
trade unions. To be eligible for entry on the list their principal purposes must
include the regulation of relations between workers and employers, or between
workers’ and employers’ associations or their constituent or affiliated organisa¬
tions. Under the Employment Protection Bill (see p. 345) the functions of the
RES in this respect would be transferred to a certification officer.
The central organisation of most large unions consists of a national executive
council, usually elected by and responsible to the annual conference of dele¬
gates from local branches. Between conferences, councils are the highest
authority of unions, and carry out policy decisions made by conference dele¬
gates. Most unions also have regional and district organisations. At the level of
the individual member there are local branches, covering one or more factories.
352
Trades Union
Congress
BRITAIN 1976: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Members may attend branch meetings, make suggestions about terms and
conditions of employment, discuss the work of the union, and take part in the
election of the union’s officers. The branch takes action on certain matters
considered to be entirely, or mainly, of local interest and forwards its views on
wider issues for action by the union’s national or regional bodies. The
organising of members in individual places of work, and the negotiation of
local pay agreements with managements at the factory or plant, may be done
by full-time district officials of the union, or, increasingly, by ‘shop stewards’,
who are chosen by their fellow members in the place of work to represent
them. Trade unions vary in the degree to which shop stewards are integrated
into their organisation. Where two or more unions have members in the same
workplace, shop stewards’ committees may be formed to discuss matters of
common concern.
Unions often provide dispute benefit (‘strike pay’) for members involved
in official industrial action. They also provide legal advice for members who
suffer injury or contract diseases at work, and may pay members’ legal costs
where a case for compensation goes to court. Some unions pay benefits in case
of illness, accident, death and retirement (additional to those payable under
the national insurance scheme) financed out of membership contributions.
Many trade unions are affiliated to the Labour Party.
In Britain the national centre of the trade union movement is the TUC, which
celebrated its centenary in 1968. The TUC’s objects are to promote the
interests of its affiliated organisations and to improve the economic and social
conditions of working people. Its membership comprises 112 organisations,
some of which are themselves federations of smaller organisations. Together
they represent about 10 million workpeople. The TUC deals with all general
questions which concern trade unions both nationally and internationally and
gives assistance on questions relating to particular trades or industries.
The annual Congress convenes in September to discuss matters of concern
to trade unionists and to employees generally. It elects a General Council
which represents it between successive Congresses and is responsible for
carrying out Congress decisions, watching economic and social developments,
providing educational and advisory services to unions, and presenting to the
Government the trade union viewpoint on economic, social and industrial
issues. The council is also empowered to mediate in inter-union disputes
in certain circumstances and its activities for this purpose were enlarged
following a special Congress in 1969 and subsequent agreement with the
Government. The General Council undertook to use its authority to deal with
unauthorised and unconstitutional stoppages of work, as well as the inter¬
union and official disputes with which it had dealt previously.
The TUC as well as many individual unions conduct extensive educational
services for members, mainly concerned with industrial subjects, trade union¬
ism and principles and practice of industrial relations.
The TUC plays an active part in international trade union activity, through
its affiliations to the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions
and the European Trade Union Confederation. It also nominates the British
workers’ delegation to the annual International Labour Conference.
There are eight TUC regional councils in England, based on the Govern¬
ment’s eight planning regions (see p. 195), with a further similar body for
Wales known as the Wales Trades Union Council. These bodies, whose func¬
tion is to make representations to the Government’s various regional bodies,
came into operation in May 1974 and replaced the previous twelve TUC
EMPLOYMENT
353
regional advisory committees. They also co-ordinate the activities of trade
unions in the regions, and keep them in touch with the policy of the TUC at
national level.
Scotland and Scottish trade unionists have also their own national central body, the Scottish
Northern Ireland Trades Union Congress (STUC) which is similar in constitution and functions
to the TUC. Trade unions whose membership includes Scottish workers may
affiliate to the STUC and a number of trade unions are in fact affiliated to both
bodies. Trade unions in Northern Ireland are represented by the Northern
Ireland Committee of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions (ICTU), though
the majority of trade unionists in Northern Ireland belong to unions based in
Great Britain. Almost go per cent of Northern Ireland trade unionists are
members of organisations affiliated to the ICTU, while the majority belong to
unions which are also affiliated to the TUC.
TUC—Labour Party The TUC-Labour Party Liaison Committee was set up in January 1972
Liaison Committee after the general council of the TUC, the national executive committee of the
Labour Party and the parliamentary committee of the Labour Party had agreed
to establish a liaison committee to discuss policies on industrial relations and
management of the economy. In February 1973 the committee reached an
agreement on the ‘social contract’ (see p. 196).
Advisory,
Conciliation
and Arbitration
Service
In September 1974 the Secretary of State for Employment set up an in¬
dependent Advisory, Conciliation and Arbitration Service (ACAS), which is
controlled by a council consisting of a chairman and nine other members
experienced in industrial relations. The Employment Protection Bill (see p.345)
provides for the ACAS to be placed on a statutory basis. The service has
taken over the former conciliation and advisory services provided by the
Department of Employment.
The service may offer conciliation in industrial disputes in both the public
and private sectors where this is considered likely to be of assistance, and has
discretion in meeting requests for conciliation subject only to the need to
encourage the use of appropriate agreed procedural arrangements. Where
there are such procedures, the service does not normally intervene unless
efforts to obtain a settlement within these procedures have failed.
The service also, subject to the consent of the parties in dispute, appoints
single arbitrators or boards of arbitration to determine differences on the
basis of agreed terms of reference. It is estimated that the service has helped
a settlement to be reached in about 70 per cent of cases referred to it.
Although the primary responsibility for intervention in disputes rests
with the ACAS, the Secretary of State retains powers to appoint a court of
inquiry or committee of investigation into a dispute, whether existing or
foreseen.
The service gives advice on all aspects of industrial relations and personnel
management. It conducts surveys to diagnose the causes of industrial relations
problems and suggests remedial action to management and trade unions or
employee representatives. It also carries particular responsibility for dealing
with complaints of unfair dismissal.
The service is concerned with the long-term improvement of collective
bargaining and, with the consent of the parties involved, conducts detailed
inquiries in particular firms or industries. It also examines questions relating
to claims for trade union recognition.
354
BRITAIN 1976: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Labour While industrial relations in government service and in the nationalised indus-
Relations of tries are, in general, organised on the same principles as in private industry,
Public Authorities there are some special features.
Central and Local Non-industrial employees in central Government service, where salaries and
Government conditions of service are dealt with by the Civil Service Department (see
p. 46), are permitted and encouraged to join the appropriate Civil Service
associations and there is a highly developed system of negotiation and joint
consultation by means of the National and Departmental Whitley Councils
(see p. 64). If there is failure to reach agreement by negotiation a department or
association may, subject to certain limitations, report the dispute to the
Secretary of State for reference to the Civil Service Arbitration Tribunal, an
independent body appointed by the Secretary of State by powers under the
Industrial Courts Act 1919. Government industrial employees are similarly
encouraged to belong to trade unions and machinery exists for joint consulta¬
tion. There are four Trades Joint Councils on which representatives of the
Government and the trade unions sit to consider pay and conditions of employ¬
ment affecting individual grades and certain other limited matters. A Joint
Co-ordinating Committee, on which the Government and Trades Joint
Councils are represented, deals with national pay negotiations, conditions of
service and other matters of general application. In the main employing depart¬
ments there are departmental joint councils for the discussion of domestic
matters. Disputes on wages or conditions of employment that cannot be resolved
by the existing machinery can be referred to the Industrial Arbitration Board.
In local government service there are separate National Joint Councils
for the main grades of employees (such as manual, clerical and technical
employees) which deal with wages and conditions of service as well as other
matters. There are corresponding regional and district councils.
Nationalised The major nationalised industries have a statutory duty to establish satisfac-
Industries tory arrangements for collective bargaining and for joint consultation with
their employees; in carrying out these duties they are free to choose suitable
arrangements. Unlike firms in the private sector, the corporations are not
usually members of employers’ associations (although the majority are public
sector members’ of the CBI). In some industries they are sole or main
employers, but even where part of the industry is in private hands, as for
example in road transport, the corporations are separately and directly
represented on wage-negotiating bodies.
Wages and conditions of service in the nationalised industries are genera y
settled by negotiation between representatives of management and trade
unions at the national level; in most cases there are also regional and local
bodies, similarly representative, to deal with local implications but not
normally to negotiate separate local agreements. Most of the industries use the
facilities for arbitration offered to industry generally by the AC AS (see p. 353),
but coalmining and rail transport have their own special arrangements.
Consultation at all levels, including the workplace, has been arranged in all
the nationalised industries.
Industrial
Disputes
As in many other countries, time lost through industrial disputes has risen in
Britain in recent years, though it is still very much less than time lost through
sickness, accidents and absenteeism.
The number of working days lost reached a peak of nearly 24 million in
1972, when major disputes occurred in coalmining, docks, engineering and

building, involving some i'7 million employees; but this figure has since
dropped sharply, being y-i million days in 1973 and 147 million in 1974,
though the number of workers involved has tended to remain fairly constant.
Northern Ireland has its own, though broadly similar, system of industrial
relations under which certain powers and responsibilities devolve upon the
Department of Manpower Services.
Employers have a duty at common law to take reasonable care of their em¬
ployees and provide a safe system of working, while employees have a duty of
care towards each other. In addition, minimum required standards of safety in
certain kinds of workplaces or work are laid down under a number of statutes;
some of these also deal with health and welfare. The Health and Safety at
Work etc. Act 1974 reorganised the system under which safety and health at
work was safeguarded and extended it to cover everyone at work and to further
the protection of the general public from industrial hazards.
A Health and Safety Commission, with members representing employers,
trade unions and local authorities, together with an Executive as its opera¬
tional arm, has taken over responsibility for the existing government inspector¬
ates covering factories, mines and quarries, explosives, nuclear installations
and alkali works; the commission and its executive also develop and carry
out policy on health and safety matters.
The basic obligations laid down in the Act are supported by ministerial
powers to make regulations dealing with a wide range of health and safety
matters. Regulations will be supplemented where appropriate by codes of
practice approved by the commission. In particular the Act gives inspectors
the power to issue improvement and prohibition notices, which enable them
to require practical improvements to be made within a specified time or to
require preventive measures immediately without first having to obtain a
court order. There are provisions for appeals to industrial tribunals against
such notices.
About 270,000 industrial premises (factories, warehouses, shipyards, docks
and construction sites) are regulated under the Factories Act 1961, which is
enforced by the Factory Inspectorate, part of the Health and Safety Executive.
Likewise about 750,000 premises are subject to the Offices, Shops and Railway
Premises Act 1963, whose enforcement is shared by the Factory Inspectorate,
the Mines and Quarries Inspectorate (also part of the new Executive), and
local authorities.
The Acts and regulations made under them are designed to secure the
health, safety and welfare of employees, and deal with such matters as the
fencing of machinery; precautions against fire and special risks; the safe-
condition of premises; and cleanliness, lighting, temperature and ventila¬
tion. Anyone intending to employ other people in industrial or commercial
premises to which either the Factories Act or the Offices, Shops and Railway
Premises Act applies has to notify the enforcing authority of his intention and
every accident which is either fatal or causes more than three days’ incapacity
must be reported. The Factories Act includes provisions for the compulsory
notification and investigation of certain types of dangerous occurrence. It also
contains provisions for precautions against dangerous substances and the
employment of women and young people.
Comparable provision with appropriate variations covers mines and quarries

under the Mines and Quarries Act 1954; two statutes are concerned with
agriculture—the Agriculture (Poisonous Substances) Act 1952 and the Agri¬
culture (Safety, Health, and Welfare Provisions) Act 1956; and specialised
statutes and delegated legislation are concerned with transport—the Railway
Employment (Prevention of Accidents) Act 1900, the Merchant Shipping
Acts, the Road Traffic Acts and the Air Navigation Order and Regulations.
As with the Factories Act these other provisions are, with some exceptions,
enforced through inspectorates—the Mines and Quarries Inspectorate, the
Agricultural Inspectorate of the agricultural departments, and the Railway
Employment Inspectorate of the Department of the Environment. (The
Health and Safety at Work etc. Act 1974 provides for separate administration
of the Agricultural and Railway Employment Inspectorates, and of the Build¬
ing Regulations.) The Department of Trade is responsible for administering
the Merchant Shipping Acts and for safety in air transport (most of the powers
in respect of airworthiness are delegated to the Civil Aviation Authority, see
p. 329), and the Department of the Environment is responsible for road and
rail transport safety matters. Safety requirements in all other places of work
including hotels, places of entertainment and educational establishments are
covered by the Health and Safety at Work etc. Act in addition to the Fire Pre¬
cautions Act 1971 or (in respect of their offices and shops) by the Offices, Shops,
and Railway Premises Act. The Health and Safety at Work etc. Act 1974
amends the Fire Precautions Act to allow for the transfer to the fire authorities
of responsibilities for general fire precautions and means of escape. The
Radiological Protection Act 1970 has been amended to provide for co-ordina¬
tion of the activities of the commission and the National Radiological Protec¬
tion Board (see p. 404).
The Department of Energy has responsibility for the safety of offshore oil
and gas operations and has prepared a comprehensive code of health and
safety regulations under the provisions of the Mineral Workings (Offshore
Installations) Act 1971.
Transport operators and ministries concerned with road and air travel give
high priority to safety measures affecting crews and passengers. Every effort is
made to counter the higher risks resulting from rising traffic densities by
improving the design of vehicles and transport equipment, by control of
standards of maintenance, by traffic regulations and by training crews in
safety awareness.
To safeguard the many interests which might be adversely affected by the
use of chemicals in agriculture and food storage, a voluntary scheme is operated
by the Government with the help of an advisory committee and with the full
co-operation of the chemical industry.
The National Coal Board has its own safety organisation—a Standing Com¬
mittee on Safety, a chief safety engineer, and safety engineers at divisions,
areas and the largest collieries.
The Health and Safety Commission encourages the development of volun¬
tary central organisation within each industry at national level for the consid¬
eration of safety matters and the formulation of policy and accident prevention.
Its Factory Inspectorate, besides inquiring into notified accidents and safety
aspects of machine design and specification, circulates expert advice and
encourages the appointment of safety officers and the formation of works
safety committees, and maintains an industrial health and safety centre in
London, at which various types of machinery demonstrating the effectiveness

of guards are displayed, as well as a wide range of protective clothing and
equipment.
Organisations in industry participate also in joint standing and advisory
committees appointed by the Secretary of State for Employment, but these
arrangements are being replaced. The Health and Safety Commission is to
appoint three major advisory committees in addition to the Committee on
Major Hazards set up in January 1975! these include one on toxic substances,
one on dangerous substances and one on medical matters. Proposals have also
been made for the appointment of 18 industry-based committees. The Royal
Society for the Prevention of Accidents (RoSPA) and the British Safety
Council are two major national bodies concerned with accident prevention.
A number of local accident prevention groups are affiliated to either RoSPA
or the British Safety Council. These groups serve as forums where questions
of industrial safety can be examined and information on accident prevention
exchanged.
Training is important in accident prevention and the Training Services Agency
provides a course in job safety for supervisors in its TWI scheme (see p. 344).
The industrial training boards usually include specific provisions for safety
training in their training recommendations.
RoSPA provides a variety of safety courses for special needs mainly at its
Industrial Safety Training Centre in Birmingham and also helps the accident
prevention movement by providing publicity and organising conferences; its
regional industrial safety officers work to promote safety activity among top-
level managers. The British Safety Council also offers safety training courses.
Other courses are organised by local accident prevention groups and organisa¬
tions such as the Federation of Civil Engineering Contractors.
A substantial amount of research is being done by industry, universities and
other academic bodies, and government research organisations into problems
of guarding machines, ergonomics, safe handling, electrical hazards, protective
personal equipment, construction methods, fires and explosions, psychologi¬
cal factors and causes of accidents, both generally and in particular sectors of
industry. A register of research into industrial health and safety matters has
been compiled by the Department of Employment to give an indication of the
scale and nature of research being undertaken. Industrial research associations
include among their more purely economic research projects the improvement
of working conditions and the reduction of hazards.
The National Coal Board conducts courses of safety training for workmen
and officials. Its research programme includes a number of projects with a
direct bearing on safety. In addition, the Health and Safety Executive has a
statutory responsibility for research concerning the safety and health of coal
miners. This responsibility is largely exercised through its Safety in Mines
Research Establishment.
The University of Aston has established a Chair in Safety and Hygiene to
help meet the need for academically trained safety officers and engineers whose
careers will be concerned with the technical aspects of insurance and forensic
work.
Local authorities have power, under the Public Health Acts, to regulate the
provision of suitable sanitary accommodation at places of work and to treat the
conditions of workplaces which are dirty or badly ventilated or overcrowded
as nuisances the abatement of which can be enforced. Factories, certain
other industrial premises, offices, shops and railway premises must comply

Shops and Railway Premises Act. These include the cleanliness of workrooms,
adequate ventilation and suitable temperature and lighting, the avoidance of
overcrowding, the provision of sanitary accommodation, the protection of
workers against inhaling harmful dust or fumes, the provision of washing
facilities, lockers or other accommodation for outdoor clothing, drinking water,
first aid and seats. Other places at work are covered by the Health and Safety
at Work etc. Act.
Legislation, besides forbidding employment of children under 13 years of
age, forbids the employment of children who have not reached the statutory
minimum school-leaving age (see p. 154) in any industrial undertaking; of
women and young people underground in mines and in certain other danger¬
ous occupations (for example, certain processes connected with lead manufac¬
ture); and of women in factories and workshops within four weeks after
childbirth. It also limits and defines the permissible hours of employment for
women and young people (see p. 348)- Local authorities, moreover, have wide
powers under the Children and Young Persons Acts 1933-63 as well as the
Education Acts 1944-48, to regulate hours and conditions of employment of
children within their areas.
There are special arrangements for the medical care of people at work. The
Employment Medical Advisory Service (EMAS), set up under the Employ¬
ment Medical Advisory Service Act 1972 and now part of the Health and
Safety Executive, provides a nation-wide service of advice on the medical
aspects of employment problems to employers, employees, trade unions,
doctors and others. It carries out medical examinations of workers in hazar¬
dous occupations and surveys of employment hazards, advises the staff of the
Manpower Services Commission on medical aspects of job placement,
rehabilitation and industrial training and co-operates with school medical |
officers and careers officers in helping to solve the employment problems of
handicapped school leavers. . , T>. r
The service, headed by the Health and Safety Executive s Director of
Medical Services, has over 100 employment medical advisers based in the
country’s main industrial centres. The TUC, the CBI and other interested
organisations are associated with the work of the service through advisory
committees.

The Occupational Health Laboratory of the Health and Safety Executive at
Cricklewood, north London, gives advice on occupational hygiene problems,
and its medical division assists the EMAS in the conduct of blood tests.
There are some six centres in Great Britain (including the TUC s Institute
of Occupational Health) which undertake studies of particular problems or
health risks and also carry out routine physical, chemical and biological tests
Research facilities are provided by government agencies such as the Medical I
Research Council; by university faculties of industrial health and social
medicine; and by the research departments of various industries and large
industrial’ concerns. Field investigations are carried out by the Factory
Inspectorate, which has specialised technical branches, and by the EMAb.
Many employers voluntarily maintain medical services for their employees
over and above the statutory requirements. It is estimated that there are some
400 factories with doctors providing full-time medical cover and some 4,000

factories with part-time medical cover. In addition several thousand nurses are
employed in industry. The big employers, including the State and the boards
of nationalised industries, have taken the lead but a number of smaller factories
also provide medical services and in a few cases have joined together in group
medical services.
An increasing number of firms pay part or all of the cost of recreational facili¬
ties. Some have their own rehabilitation centres or support convalescent
homes. The provision of low-priced meals at the place of employment has
become usual in large undertakings and quite common in smaller ones. Many
offices and shops which are unable to provide canteen facilities for their staff
have adopted luncheon voucher schemes.
Safety, Health

The safety, health and welfare of employees in Northern Ireland have been
the subject of legislation which is embodied in the Factories Act (Northern
Ireland) 1965 and the Office and Shop Premises Act (Northern Ireland) 1966.
A number of firms voluntarily employ safety officers, and industrial safety
groups, supported by representatives of industry, insurance companies and
public authorities, make a valuable contribution to industrial accident
prevention.
17 Finance
PUBLIC
EXPENDITURE
Public Expendi¬
ture Surveys
THE PUBLIC SECTOR
Public expenditure comprises the current and capital expenditures of central
Government and local authorities, together with the debt interest and capital
expenditure of the nationalised industries and other public corporations.
Public expenditure in 1974-75 amounted to about £44,700 million, of which
60 per cent was undertaken by the central Government and 30 per cent by
local authorities, and 10 per cent represented the capital expenditure of the
nationalised industries and other public corporations.
The wide range of functions and purposes of this expenditure and its
distribution is shown in Table 28.
Between 1964 and 1974 total public expenditure grew in real terms by
66 per cent.
The social services programmes now take 39 per cent of the total, whereas
in i960 they represented just over 35 per cent. On the other hand defence
expenditure has declined from 17 per cent to just over 9 per cent.
Out of the total public expenditure of £44,700 million in 1974-75, some
£26,000 million or 58 per cent was spent by the public sector directly on goods
and services (wages and salaries, other current expenditure on goods and
services, gross domestic fixed capital formation and stocks). Transfer pay¬
ments to individuals, companies and other institutions in the private sector
(for example, social security payments, capital grants, subsidies, and debt
interest) made up the balance. Unlike public authorities’ direct purchases of
goods and services, transfer payments do not represent a direct demand on
the nation’s resources. The gross sums transferred create a proportionately
lower indirect demand for goods and services because of taxes paid and savings
made by the recipients.
Each year a survey is made of the whole range of projected public expenditure,
including total expenditure of central government departments (most of
which is covered by Supply Estimates—see p. 361—and the national insurance
fund), the nationalised industries’ capital expenditure, and local authorities’
expenditure. The survey, which covers the period five years ahead, is carried
out by officials in the Treasury and other government departments, under the
direction of the Public Expenditure Survey Committee.
The primary purpose of the survey is to present to ministers an up-to-date
assessment of the cost of their existing policies as a basis for decisions about
the total and the composition of public expenditure over the whole area over
which the Government has control or influence. The five-year period gives
the Government the opportunity to plan ahead significant changes without
causing wasteful disruption in existing services, and to have regard to the
overall economic outlook when taking decisions.
The initial review normally takes place in the first half of the year, to be
followed by ministerial consideration of the survey report. Since 1969 the
public expenditure plans as settled by the Government have been published
(see Bibliography p. 482) around the end of the year, forming the basis of an
annual public expenditure debate in the House of Commons. The supply
estimates are classified functionally in the same way as the public expenditure

surveys (see Table 28) to assist comparison. The House has a standing select
committee on expenditure to consider public expenditure, and its reports
provide further information on which the debates can draw. The committee
has a number of sub-committees, one to consider general Government finan¬
cial control and the presentation of information about public expenditure,
and others considering public expenditure in particular areas: defence and
external affairs; education, the arts, and the Home Office; social services and
employment; trade and industry; and environment. These committees can
question departmental ministers as well as their officials, and can take evidence
also from witnesses outside Government.

Each department submits its estimates of cash requirements to the Treasury
in the December before the financial year beginning on the following 1st
April. After they have been approved by the Treasury, the Supply Estimates
are presented to Parliament shortly before the Budget (see p. 363) and are
approved by Parliament for one year ahead, by means of an annual Appro¬
priation Act, in July (expenditure to this date from 1st April is covered by a
Vote on Account approved by Parliament before the beginning of the financial
year). There are 29 allotted days (known as supply days) in each session on
which the choice of subject for debate rests with the Opposition and on which
estimates can be debated. Broad issues of policy are normally discussed

Certain expenditures are not approved annually, but are covered by Acts
of Parliament allowing payments to continue from one year to another and are
paid direct from the Consolidated Fund. These include the financial provision
for members of the royal family, and salaries and pensions of judges. The
Consolidated Fund, into which tax revenue and other receipts are paid,
finances most of the Government’s expenditure; its balance is held in the
Exchequer account at the Bank of England. The National Loans Fund covers
most of the Government’s domestic lending and borrowing, and is operated
as an official account at the Bank of England. The two funds deal only with
sterling receipts and payments; official dealings in foreign exchange are carried
out by the Exchange Equalisation Account (see p. 37°)-
The Treasury’s authority is required for any new item of expenditure, for any
increase in expenditure beyond that originally authorised, for any change in
policy which means an increase in expenditure, and for extra-statutory pay¬
ments. This requirement is, however, subject to any delegated authority
which may be given to departments to deal with particular types of expendi¬
ture. Treasury control does not imply final sanction by the Treasury in the
last resort the decision is taken by the Government as a whole, and carried
out subject to Parliamentary consent.
Control over issues of money to departments and the audit of accounts is
exercised by the Comptroller and Auditor General, a permanent officer of
the Crown. Since 1866 he has had two functions: as Comptroller he controls
receipts and issues of public money to and from the Consolidated Fund and
the National Loans Fund, and as Auditor General he audits departmental
accounts and submits his report on the Appropriation Accounts and other
accounts, as required by statute, to Parliament. His statutory function is to
ensure that all expenditure is properly incurred, for example, that no payments
are made which go beyond any relevant statutory authority, and that Treasury
sanction has been obtained wherever necessary. In addition, however, he has
been asked by successive Public Accounts Committees (see below) to examine
departmental expenditure for cost-effectiveness with a view to drawing their
attention to any cases of apparent waste or extravagance.
The accounts of each department and the reports on the accounts made y
the Comptroller and Auditor General are considered by a House of Commons
select committee called the Public Accounts Committee. This was first set up
in 1861 for the purpose of ensuring that expenditure was properly incurred in
accordance with the purpose for which it was voted and with any relevant cts
of Parliament. The terms of reference of the committee are simply to examine
the accounts and these terms have been widely interpreted by successive com¬
mittees which have investigated whether full value has been obtained tor the
sums spent by departments and have examined cases in which the administra¬
tion appears to have been faulty or negligent. The committee has therefore
become a powerful instrument for the exposure of waste and inefficiency, it
embodies the findings in reports which may be debated in the House of Com¬
mons. Its recommendations are considered by the Treasury in consultation
with departments and put into effect, so far as they are accepted according
to Treasury instructions. A reply to each report is submitted to Parliament by
Treasury Minute and both documents are debated at the beginning of t e
following session.
FINANCE
THE BUDGET
The Budget (an old word which meant a bag containing papers or accounts)
is a set ot proposals made usually once a year in either March or April, for
financing Government expenditure. Supplementary budgetary measures may
also be introduced at other times of the year and in November 1974 there
was a second full budget. The proposals are described by the Chancellor of
the Exchequer in the Budget speech, against the background of a statement of
the Government s past and prospective revenue and expenditure, and the
Chancellor s assessment of the position and prospects of the economy.
The Budget speech is followed by the moving of a set of Ways and Means
resolutions, in which the proposals are embodied. These resolutions, when
passed by the House, become the foundation of the Finance Act, which
expresses the proposals in statutory form.
A major function of the Budget is to act as an instrument of economic
management, and the Budget speech is normally the main occasion for a
review of general economic policy. The scale of public expenditure and taxa¬
tion has an important influence on the general level of output and distribution
of resources. The Budget judgment is therefore concerned with the balance
between the total of goods and services which are likely to be available to the
nation and the total claims which are likely to be made on them. Taxation
provides the Government with a means of exerting a considerable influence
on the pressure of demand. Taxation measures can also have a broader
influence on the pattern of demand and the long-term performance of the
economy.
The Budget deals with the means of financing expenditure and particularly
with changes in taxation and not primarily with expenditure itself. On occa¬
sions, changes affecting expenditure, such as increases in pensions and family
allowances, have been announced in the Budget speech as have financial and
monetary measures not related to the Finance Act, such as changes in exchange
control policies. Such measures, however, are not reflected in the resolutions
or the Finance Act but are applied by whatever procedure is appropriate to
implement them—separate legislation, statutory instruments or administra¬
tive action.
The scope of the Budget and that of the Finance Act which follows it are
different although they are closely interrelated. The Budget is essentially
concerned with the measures that give effect to the Chancellor’s decision to
increase or reduce to an appropriate extent the predicted level of demand on
economic resources by use of the instruments at the Chancellor’s disposal, and
especially by increasing or reducing the yield of central Government taxes.
The tax changes made necessary by the Budget judgment are enacted in the
Finance Act. But the Finance Act also provides the annual opportunity for
non-Budgetary changes in the tax system and for certain other financial
matters, such as provisions relating to Government borrowing.
The bulk of the taxation proposals in the Budget are concerned with changes
in the rates or coverage of existing taxes, the introduction of new taxes or the
abolition of existing ones, and changes in the administrative machinery relating
to taxation. In two cases however (income tax and corporation tax) annual
Ways and Means resolutions followed by a Finance Act clause are necessary
to maintain the taxes in existence at all, since they are annual taxes. It is this
which makes a Budget at or about the beginning of each financial year a
necessity.
New taxes and changes in certain existing taxes, like other changes in statute
laws, do not come into effect until the appropriate Act—in this case the
Finance Act—has received Royal Assent (in the case of the spring Budget,
364
Public Sector
Accounts
Budget Changes

normally at the end of July) or at some other date laid down in the Bill.
Some changes, however, come into effect earlier, usually from Budget Day or
from the start of the tax year, under the Provisional Collection of Taxes Act.
This enables the Government to collect certain taxes provisionally, income
tax for example, either at the rates previously in operation or at new rates
following the passing of the appropriate Ways and Means resolutions. Tax
proposals may be made at other times in the year to meet changes in economic
circumstances.
The economic background to the spring Budget and the transactions of the
central Government and the public sector as a whole are presented in the
Financial Statement and Budget Report (see Bibliography p. 482) which is laid
before the House of Commons by the Chancellor of the Exchequer when
he presents the Budget. The report is in three parts: the economic context
of the Budget; the accounts of the public sector for the past financial year
and the one immediately ahead; and the accounts of the central Government
for the same two years. The accounts are designed to assist in assessing the
impact of changes in revenue and public expenditure on the economy.
The accounts of the public sector show the transactions of the central
Government, local authorities, nationalised industries and other public cor¬
porations combined into a consolidated account covering the whole of the
public sector. The transactions within the public sector cancel out on consoli¬
dation and the net balance on the consolidated account represents therefore the
borrowing required by the public sector from the private and overseas sectors.
The accounts of the central Government show transactions both on the
conventional cash basis of Exchequer accounting and in accordance with the
framework of the national income accounts.
Central Government borrowing may be in the form of borrowing from
the public either through the National Savings Movement (see p. 373) or by
borrowing on the market by means of new issues of securities. New issues of
government securities are made from time to time for the purpose of refinanc¬
ing maturing issues (conversion loans) or to raise new money (issues for cash).
The capital requirements of the nationalised industries are met to some
extent by the central Government through the National Loans Fund, while
those of the local authorities are met partly by the central Government
through the Public Works Loan Board and partly by borrowing directly from
the public. Some nationalised industries and local authorities also borrow,
under special statutory power and with Treasury consent, in foreign curren¬
cies. The euro-currency market has become an increasingly important source
of public sector borrowing. After allowing for the changes introduced by the
Budget of April 1975 the central Government’s borrowing requirement for
J975-76 was expected to be £7,827 million, compared with £5,109 million in
1974-75 and that for the public sector as a whole £9,055 million compared
with £7,602 million in 1974-75.
Table 29 shows total revenue from taxation and other sources in 1974-75
and 1975^76 together with the effects of the Budget changes.
In the Budget presented in April 1975 the Chancellor of the Exchequer intro¬
duced measures designed to release resources for export (so that the economy
would be in a position to take advantage of the expected increase in world
trade in 1976) and so reduce the balance of payments deficit. Action was also
taken to strengthen Britain’s industrial base and reduce the public sector
borrowing requirement as a percentage of gross national product.
FINANCE
SOURCES OF
REVENUE
365
The three principal sources of tax revenue are first, taxes on income, which
include income tax and corporation tax; second, taxes on capital, which in¬
clude capital transfer tax and capital gains tax (for proposed new taxes, see
p. 367); and third, taxes on expenditure (including taxes on the ownership or
use of certain assets)—these include protective and revenue duties, value
added tax (VAT), local rates (see p. 72), stamp duties and licence duties (for
example, on motor vehicles). Taxes on individual (but not corporate) incomes
are progressive in that large incomes bear a proportionately higher rate of tax.
The Board of Inland Revenue assesses and collects the taxes on income and
capital and the stamp duties; the Board of Customs and Excise collects the
most important taxes on expenditure (the customs and excise duties and VAT)
while a variety of authorities is responsible for the collection of the remainder.
Taxes on Income Income tax is imposed for the year of assessment beginning on 6th April. The
Income Tax rates tax intrc,duced in the April 1975 Budget are as follows: the basic rate
°f 35 Per cent applies to the first £4,500 of taxable income (that is, total
income less deductions and personal allowances), a rate of 40 per cent is
charged on the £4>500~^5>000 band of taxable income, and the rate for
successive bands rises generally in steps of 5 per cent until a maximum rate of
83 per cent is reached at a level of over £20,000 of taxable income. These
rates are charged on both earned and investment incomes. Investment in¬
comes are also liable to a surcharge on the amount by which they exceed
£1,000 (£1,500 for the elderly); the surcharge is 10 per cent on the first
£1,000 (£500 for the elderly) of investment income above the relevant thresh¬
old and 15 per cent on the remainder. The tax imposed on an individual is
graduated by means of personal allowances and reliefs. In general, married
couples receive higher allowances than a single person. Husband and wife may
choose to have the wife’s earnings charged separately for tax on condition that
the former receives the single instead of the married personal allowance.
A single person earning £3,000 a year pays £81375 in income tax, while a
married man with the same earned income pays £71575; if he has two children
under the age of 11 and his earnings plus the family allowance total £3,000
his tax falls to £5^5'95' The amount of tax payable by a single person
varies from, for example, £11375 °n an earned income of £1,000 a year to
£11,11875 on an earned income of £20,000.
Most wage and salary earners pay their income tax under a PAYE (‘Pay as
You Earn’) system whereby tax is deducted (and accounted for to the Inland
Revenue) by the employer, thus enabling them to keep as up to date as possible
with their tax payments.
In general, income tax is charged on all income which originates in the
United Kingdom and on all income arising abroad of persons resident in the
United Kingdom. Interest on certain United Kingdom government securities
belonging to persons not ordinarily resident in the United Kingdom is exempt.
The United Kingdom has entered into agreements with many countries pro¬
viding for relief from double taxation; where such agreements are not in force
unilateral relief is allowed.
Companies pay corporation tax at a single rate on all their profits, whether
distributed or not. However, only a proportion of any capital gains is included
in total profits, with the result that chargeable gains as a whole are subject to
a lower effective rate of tax. Income tax is not deducted from dividends but
a company which distributes profits to its shareholders is required to make to
the Inland Revenue an advance payment of corporation tax. In general, this
Company
Taxation

BRITAIN 1976: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
advance payment is set against a company’s corporation tax bill and the reci¬
pient of the distribution in respect of which the advance payment was made is
entitled to a tax credit, which satisfies the liability to income tax at the basic
rate.
The rate of corporation tax is fixed retrospectively in the Budget for the past
financial year; for 1974-75 it is 52 per cent with a reduced rate of 42 per cent
for small companies (as defined in the Finance Acts 1972 an<^ I974)- The tax
is assessed on the profits of accounting periods, the rate of tax being the rate
for the financial year in which the accounting period falls. Where an account¬
ing period straddles 31st March the profits are apportioned on a time basis.
Relief for the effect of inflation on the value of stocks was given in the Novem¬
ber 1974 budget and further extended in the April 1975 budget.

Under the Oil Taxation Act 1975 a petroleum revenue tax of 45 per cent
(deducted in computing profits for corporation tax) is to be imposed on profits
from the winning, as opposed to refining or other form of processing, of
hydrocarbons under licence in Britain and on its continental shelf. Each
licensee of an oilfield is to be charged on the profits for that field, computed
for half-yearly periods.
A new comprehensive tax on all transfers of personal wealth, capital transfer
tax, was introduced in the Finance Act 1975. The tax applies to transfers in
three main areas: lifetime gifts; transfers on death; and transfers relating to
settled property (that is, any property held in trust). The tax is chargeable in
respect of a person’s lifetime transfers as they occur and on a cumulative
basis. The final stage of cumulation is the inclusion of the property ‘passing’
on an assumed transfer of the whole of the deceased’s estate immediately
before the death. The rates of tax applicable are progressively higher on suc¬
cessive slices of the cumulative total of chargeable transfers, with a lower scale
of tax for lifetime transfers than for transfers on death. Under both scales the
£i5>00° of transfers is exempt; the rates on the remainder rise from 5 per
cent on the slice between £15,000 and £20,000 to 75 per cent on the excess
over £2 million for lifetime transfers and from 10 per cent on the slice between
£i5,o°o and £20,000 to 75 per cent on the excess over £2 million for transfers
on death.
Capital gains accruing on the disposal of assets are liable to capital gains tax
or, in the case of companies, to corporation tax. The rate of tax is normally 30
per cent, but in the case of individuals may be less, depending on their
circumstances. Certain assets may be exempt from tax, including the principal
private residence, chattels worth less than £1,000 (and any chattels, except
those used for the purpose of a trade, with a predictable life of less than 50
years), private motor cars, and National Savings Certificates. An individual
is exempt from capital gains tax where the total proceeds of disposals do not
exceed £500 in any year. In addition gains on gilt-edged securities are exempt
from capital gains tax if the securities were held for more than 12 months.
Certain gains arising on the disposal of land in Britain with development
value or potential are taxed as income.
In March 1974 the Chancellor of the Exchequer announced the Govern¬
ment’s intention to introduce an annual tax on wealth, but only after a
thorough public discussion of its form, rates and relationship with other forms
of taxation had taken place. As a first step towards this a consultative docu¬
ment was published in August 1974. A Select Committee of the House of
Commons has now been set up to examine the Government’s proposals.
The Government intends to introduce a development land tax (DLT)
which will apply to interests in land situated in Britain. Realisations of
development value from land will be chargeable to DLT at a rate set initially
at 80 per cent.
The largest group of taxes on expenditure are those administered by the
Customs and Excise Department, namely VAT, car tax and the duties on
tobacco, hydrocarbon oil and alcoholic drinks, protective duties, betting and
other revenue duties of customs and excise. In Britain it has been the practice
that a commodity which is taxed to provide revenue bears a customs duty if it
is imported and an excise duty if it is home produced. These taxes are usually
referred to as indirect taxes since they are normally paid by the importer,

manufacturer, or wholesaler, who adjusts the prices charged to customers
accordingly. Under the Treaty of Accession to the European Community
Britain undertook gradually to convert revenue duties into internal taxes
chargeable alike on imported and home-produced goods. The Finance (No.
2) Act 1975 provides for the conversion of the customs revenue duties into
internal taxes on 1st January 1976 (except in the case of tobacco, the conver¬
sion date for which is scheduled for 1st January 1978). The conversion
provides that fiscal charges, to be known as excise duties, will be charged on
imported goods at the same rates as the duties on similar home-produced
goods, and that any protective charges will be levied as import duties under
the Import Duties Act 1958, as are all other protective duties. Protective
customs duties are being brought into line with the Community’s common
customs tariff (see p. 386). All the revenue duty goods (other than hydro¬
carbon oil) are subject to the standard rate of VAT.
The Chancellor of the Exchequer has power to vary between Budgets the
VAT rates by up to 25 per cent, and the rate of any of the other main groups
of customs and excise duties (that is, tobacco, alcoholic drinks, oil and the
minor revenue duties) by up to 10 per cent. This power, known as the
‘regulator’, requires annual renewal. The April 1975 Budget increased the duty
on tobacco, spirits, wine and beer.
Value added tax (VAT) is collected at each stage in the production and distri¬
bution process. The final tax is borne by the consumer. A taxable person
(generally, a trader carrying on a business with a turnover of more than
£5,000 a year) is charged by suppliers of goods and services with VAT
(‘input’ tax). The trader then charges the customer with VAT on goods and
services supplied (‘output’ tax). The trader pays to Customs and Excise the
difference between output and input tax. Although VAT falls on imported
goods, most exports are zero-rated and VAT entering directly into export
costs can be reclaimed.
VAT is a broadly-based tax falling on final consumers’ expenditure except
where there are strong social or economic reasons for giving relief. There are
two basic methods by which supplies of goods and services may get relief
from VAT: zero-rating, when a trader does not have to charge tax to a
customer but can reclaim any input tax paid to suppliers, and exemption,
when a trader does not have to charge a customer any output tax but is not
entitled to deduct or reclaim any input tax relating to the goods or services
which he sells The most important supplies to which zero-rating applies are
most types of food (except in the course of catering); books, newspapers and
periodicals; fuel (except for petrol and other fuels for road use); construction
of buildings; exports (goods and most services); public transport fares; young
children’s clothing and footwear; and drugs and medicines supplied on
prescription. Exemption applies to land (including rents); insurance; posta
services; betting, gaming and lotteries; finance; education; health; and burial
and cremation. r . ,
VAT is chargeable at a standard rate of 8 per cent except for certain goods
which are charged at a higher rate of 25 per cent. These include petrol, most
domestic electric appliances (excluding cookers, space heaters and fitted water
heaters), radios, televisions, hi-fi equipment, boats, aircraft, caravans, cameras,
binoculars, furs and jewellery.
New cars whether British made or imported, are chargeable with car tax at
10 per cent on the wholesale value. VAT falls on the price including car tax.

The principal betting duties are: the pool betting duty (which applies to
football pools and betting by coupon at fixed odds) charged at a rate of 40 per
cent of the stake money; and the general betting duty, which is charged at the
rate of 7’5 Per cent of stake money except for on-course betting which is
charged at 4 per cent. Gaming is taxed at different rates mainly by licence fees.
Taxes on motor vehicles are collected for the Department of the Environment
by local post offices; the proceeds are paid into the Consolidated Fund. The
licence duty on a private motor car is £40 a year; motor cycles and three-wheel
vehicles, etc., pay £4, £8 or £16 a year according to engine capacity. Goods
vehicles are taxed by unladen weight, and taxis and buses by seating capacity.
The National Debt increased rapidly during and immediately after the first
and second world wars. It rose from ^650 million in 1914 to £7,435 million at
the end of the first world war, and from £7,131 million in 1939 to £23,647
million in 1946- On 3Ist March 1975 total National Debt was estimated at
£45*883 million, of which £2,323 million was repayable in currencies other
than sterling, mainly to the United States and Canadian Governments. Of the
£43*56° million of internal debt, £8,499 million was short-term debt, mainly
in the form of 91-day Treasury bills, while the long-term loans included a
variety of stocks, bonds, loans and certificates carrying fixed rates of interest
(ranging from 2^ to i2j per cent) and with fixed or indeterminate dates of re¬
payment.
The general system of public finance in Northern Ireland is, in its main
features, similar to that operating in the United Kingdom as a whole. The
major sources of revenue are the main national taxes imposed by the United
Kingdom Parliament over the whole country. The Northern Ireland share of
the yield of United Kingdom taxes is paid out of the Consolidated Fund of
the United Kingdom into that of Northern Ireland. Revenue also accrues
from taxes levied locally such as the regional rate and from certain non-tax
revenue. This revenue is supplemented by an annual sum voted to the
Secretary of State for Northern Ireland. Loans from the United Kingdom
National Loans Fund are available (up to a limit of £450 million) to finance
capital expenditure programmes in Northern Ireland.
Various funds have been established in Northern Ireland, in addition to
statutory Reserve and Sinking Funds, for specific purposes. In general, these
funds follow the United Kingdom pattern, the principal funds being those
relating to national insurance and government loans. The latter constitutes a
pool of money available mainly for local and public authority borrowings; on
31st March 1975 a sum of approximately £448 million was outstanding
against such borrowers.
THE CENTRAL BANK
The British banking system comprises a central bank; deposit banks which
perform the usual main banking services; the United Kingdom offices of
banks whose main business is in other countries; merchant banks and other
specialised institutions.
The Bank of England was established in 1694 by Act of Parliament and
Royal Charter as a corporate body; the entire capital stock was acquired by
the Government under the Bank of England Act 1946. As the central bank,
the Bank acts as banker to the Government, to overseas central banks and to
370
BRITAIN 1976: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
deposit banks and is the lender of last resort to the banking system (see p. 372);
it is the note-issuing authority and the registrar for some 200 government,
nationalised industry, local authority, public board and Commonwealth
government stocks. As agent for the Government the Bank administers
exchange control. On behalf of the Treasury it manages the Exchange
Equalisation Account (EEA), which holds Britain’s official reserves of gold,
foreign exchange and Special Drawing Rights (SDRs) on the International
Monetary Fund. Using the resources of the EEA the Bank designs its inter¬
ventions in the foreign exchange market both to prevent undue fluctuations in
the exchange value of sterling and to conserve the means of making payments
abroad. . .
As banker to the Government the Bank examines and seeks to anticipate
banking and financial problems and undertakes the appropriate operations
in the money, capital and the foreign exchange markets; consequently the
Bank has a major responsibility for advising the Government on the formula¬
tion of monetary policy and for its subsequent execution.
In implementing monetary policy the Bank is ready to act daily in the money
market, by buying or selling Treasury and other bills, and similarly in the
market for government stocks. When necessary, the Bank may exert influence
on interest rates through market operations; an important indication of its
intentions is the minimum lending rate (known as ‘Bank rate until i972)>
which is the minimum rate at which the Bank will normally lend to the
members of the London Discount Market and closely reflects short-term
market rates, being normally | per cent above the average rate of discount for
Treasury bills. The Bank can also influence market and money supply
conditions through its power to call for special deposits.
The Bank is the recognised channel of communication between the deposit
banks and other financial institutions of the City of London on the one hand,
and the Government on the other.
The Bank of England has the sole right in England and Wales of issuing
bank notes. The note issue is fiduciary, that is to say, it is no longer backed by
gold but by government and other securities. The Scottish clearing and
Northern Ireland banks have limited rights to issue notes; these issues, apart
from an amount specified by legislation for each bank, must be fully covered
by Bank of England notes. The provision of coin for circulation is the respon¬
sibility of the Royal Mint, a government department.
Following discussions by the Bank of England with the banks, the hire pur¬
chase finance houses and the discount houses, new arrangements for the
control of credit came into effect in 1971. While it is still necessary for the
Government, as an indispensable part of economic management, to regulate
the development of credit and the money supply, the new system has replaced
rigid quantitative controls over lending in sterling with policies for influencing
bank and finance house lending which are designed to combine effective con¬
trol with greater flexibility and freedom for these institutions. The techniques
now in operation involve more reliance upon changes in interest rates, in
particular through calls by the Bank for special deposits from other banks
superimposed on a minimum reserve assets ratio of i2| per cent of eligible
liabilities.1 Calls for special deposits also restrict the growth of money supply
by reducing the banks’ lending base. The ceiling controls on lending by the
banks and finance houses have been removed and the London and Scottish
1 Basically sterling deposits of two years or less from outside the banking system together
with any foreign currency changed into sterling.

371
clearing banks have abandoned their collective agreements on interest rates.
Moreover they now set their base rates for lending independently of the
minimum lending rate. Greater potential for competition and innovation by
these institutions has thereby been introduced into the domestic economy.
In hebruary 1975 the Bank suspended a supplementary scheme designed
to improve its control over the money supply and bank lending. The scheme
had come into effect during 1974 and penalised any growth in the banks’
interest-bearing deposits above a specified rate by requiring the placement of
non-interest-bearing supplementary special deposits with the Bank.
THE BANKING
SYSTEM
The Deposit
Banks
OTHER BANKS AND INSTITUTIONS
The primary business of the deposit banks is the receipt, transfer and encash¬
ment of deposits. The principal deposit banks are the six London clearing
banks, three Scottish clearing banks and two Northern Ireland banks. Mergers
have resulted in the formation of six banking groups, four based in London
and two in Scotland. The two Northern Ireland banks are owned by London
clearing banks, but two groups of banks based in the Irish Republic also
operate in Northern Ireland.
In March 1975 current and deposit accounts with deposit banks operat¬
ing in Britain totalled some ^28,035 million, and accounted for nearly 33 per
cent of the total deposits (in sterling and foreign currencies) of the banking
sector, which also includes the National Giro, the accepting houses, overseas
banks, other banks and the discount market. The deposit banks provide full
banking services throughout Britain, and operate through over 14,000
branches. Several of them have interests in British overseas and Common¬
wealth banks, and in other banks which have been formed specially to com¬
pete in international markets. They have also acquired substantial interests in
hire-purchase finance houses, and some have set up their own unit trusts.
Together with the Bank of England the London clearing banks make up
the membership of the London Bankers’ Clearing House. In 1974 cheques,
drafts, bills and bankers’ effects passing through the interbank debit clearing
system averaged in value nearly ^136,760 million monthly, while the average
monthly value of the credit transfer clearing was over £1,545 million.
Current account balances with the deposit banks are repayable on demand
and no interest is paid on them, but on deposit account balances interest is
paid at a rate below individual banks’ base rates. The deposit banks’ more
liquid assets consist of cash, balances at the Bank of England, money at call
(mainly loans to discount houses), and their holdings of Treasury and com¬
mercial bills. The banks also hold a proportion of their assets as portfolio
(mainly British Government securities) or trade investments.
The banks’ profits are largely earned through their advances to customers
partly in the form of overdrafts and partly in the form of loans (with or with¬
out collateral security). The ratio of London clearing bank advances to total
deposits in April 1975 was 63-5 per cent.
The bank giro, a credit transfer scheme, and the direct debiting system, by
which a creditor with the prior approval of the debtor may claim money due
to him direct from the latter’s banking account, have helped to improve the
money transmission services. Another banking innovation has been the intro¬
duction by some banks of automatic cash dispensing machines. Credit cards
are in widespread use for the settlement of accounts in retail shops; and
cheque cards enable the card holder to cash a cheque up to £30 at any office
of the major British and Irish banks, and at offices of many banks overseas.

The Post Office National Giro, which was introduced in 1968 to provide a
low-cost current account banking and money transfer service, is operated
through most post offices in Britain. All accounts and transactions are main¬
tained by means of a computer complex at the National Giro Centre near
Liverpool. In March 1975, Giro had 493,000 accounts with deposits of nearly
£120 million. The number of weekly transactions had risen from 500,000 in
September 1969 to 3-33 million by March 1975 when the weekly turnover
was £483 million. In addition to its services to individuals Giro’s services to
commerce, industry and the public utilities include a facility whereby organisa¬
tions with dispersed branches, depots and representatives can rapidly channel
receipts into their central accounting system. Many local authorities use
Giro’s rent collection services. Giro’s international services also provide
money transfer facilities in Europe linking over 16 million account holders in
the European Community and other countries in Western Europe. Giro has
been authorised to offer personal loans and overdrafts, as well as overdrafts
for corporate customers. These new facilities are being introduced on a
phased basis.
The overseas banks, some of which have their headquarters in London, pro¬
vide a comprehensive banking service in many parts of the world and engage
in the financing of trade not only between Britain and other countries but also
between third countries. There are 57 United States banks, 24 banks from
the European Community, 17 Japanese banks, 29 consortium banks, and
76 others, including Commonwealth and other European banks.
The merchant banks have an influence on Britain’s financial affairs which is
much greater than their size in relation to other financial institutions might
suggest. Traditionally merchant banks have been primarily concerned with
acceptance credits1 and with the sponsoring of capital issues on behalf of their
customers. Today they have a widely diversified and complex range of activi¬
ties with an important role in international finance and the short-term capital
markets, the provision of expert advice and financial services to British
industrial companies especially where mergers, takeovers and other forms of
corporate reorganisation are involved, and the management of investment
holdings, including trusts, pensions and other funds.
The Money or Discount Market is an institution which is unique to the City of
London. Its function in the monetary system is to provide a financial mecha¬
nism designed to promote an orderly flow of short-term funds. The market
consists of 11 discount houses which borrow money ‘at call’ or short notice and
lend for somewhat longer periods. They have recourse to the Bank of Englan
as lender of last resort and the Bank lends to the houses generally overnight or
for seven days at minimum lending rate, although it may charge a higher rate.
Most of the market’s borrowed funds come from the banks, which are thus
provided with a flexible means of earning a yield on surplus funds which they
have at any given time. „ m ,
The assets of the discount houses mainly consist of Treasury and commer¬
cial bills, government and local authority securities and negotiable certificates
1 Acceptance credits are usually short-term (90 days) arrangements to finance exports
from andTmports to, Britain and other markets. The expression is derived from the
method of financing trade by which commercial bills are accepted or guaranteed by
a merchant bank against documents, after which they may be discounted for cash by
a discount house.

of deposit denominated in both sterling and US dollars. The market accepts as
an informal responsibility that it should cover the Government’s need to
borrow on Treasury bills which are offered on tender each week.
The National Savings Movement started in 1916 to help finance the war by
promoting savings. The present movement encourages the widespread invest¬
ment of savings in Trustee Savings Banks and the National Savings Bank
(see p. 374) and in National Savings securities. The movement is led by the
National Savings Committee for England and Wales and similar committees
for Scotland and Northern Ireland. The committees consist of representatives
of the voluntary savings movement in the regions and of various national
institutions connected with finance, industry and education. They have a
staff of civil servants. Voluntary local savings committees, often supported
by local authorities, co-ordinate the work of voluntary local savings groups.
The administration of the National Savings Bank and other forms of national
savings is carried out by the Department for National Savings. At the end of
June 1975 National Savings totalled £10,977 million.
Five forms of National Savings securities are on sale: National Savings Certifi¬
cates, British Savings Bonds, Premium Savings Bonds, National Savings
Stamps, and Gift Tokens. National Savings Certificates, in units of £1, are
encashable at par at any time; interest, which is free of income tax and capital
gains tax, is paid only on encashment; the limit on individual holdings is
1,000 units of the current ‘fourteenth issue’ introduced in 1974. British Savings
Bonds, 9-5 per cent, sold in units of £5, are repayable at par on one month’s
notice. If the bonds are held to maturity (five years from the date of purchase)
they are repaid with a bonus of 3 per cent tax free. Maximum holding is
£10,000. Premium Savings Bonds are in units of £1 (minimum purchase is
£2) and individual holdings are limited to £2,000. After a qualifying period of
three months the bonds give investors a chance to win tax-free prizes instead
of receiving interest. There is a weekly draw for a prize of £50,000 and 25
prizes of £1,000 and a monthly draw for prizes ranging from £25 to £75,000.
At the end of June 1975 ^I>°79 million was invested in this form of savings.
A selection of British Governments ecurities is held on the National Savings
Stock Register. Trustee Savings Banks also deal in stock on the National
Savings Stock Register.
In June 1975 the Government introduced index-linked National Savings
Certificates costing £10 each. The certificate is available only to men aged
65 and over and women aged 60 and over up to a maximum of £500 per
person. These certificates have a life of five years and if they are held to
maturity will attract a tax-free bonus of 4 per cent of the purchase price in
addition to any increase due to the upward movement of the retail price index.
If the certificate is encashed before maturity but after one year repayment will
include any increase due to movement in the retail price index but no bonus
will be payable.
Northern Ireland issues separately Ulster Savings Certificates and Ulster
Development Bonds on similar terms to the corresponding National Savings
Certificates and British Savings Bonds.
An index-linked contractual savings scheme was introduced in July 1975
under the terms of the Third Issue of the Save as You Earn (SAYE) scheme.
The new scheme enables savings to be made in regular monthly amounts with
a minimum of £4 and a maximum of £20 in deposits with the Department

for National Savings, by means of deductions from pay or by other regular
payments. Indexation only applies to completed savings contracts. At the end
of five years, the repayment value will be the total contributions plus any
increase due to index-linking of monthly contributions. Completed savings
which are not withdrawn will qualify for further index-linking and a bonus
equal to two monthly contributions at the end of seven years. Savers who
wish to stop payments will be able to withdraw the total sum saved (but there
cannot be partial withdrawals). Tax-free compound interest will be paid at
the rate of 6 per cent a year on amounts withdrawn after the first but before
the end of the fifth year or where the contributions cease but the savings are
left invested for the remainder of the five years.
The National Savings Bank provides a countrywide system for depositing and
withdrawing small savings and has over 22 million active accounts. Ordinary
Accounts bear interest at 4 per cent and the first £40 of annual interest is tax
free. Up to £20 can be withdrawn on demand at any savings bank post office,
but a few days’ notice is required for larger amounts. The money is lodged
with the National Debt Commissioners and is invested in government
securities. Deposits bearing a higher rate of interest (at present 9 per cent)
may be made in Investment Accounts. All deposits carry a government
guarantee. At the end of June 1975 the sum of the two accounts totalled
£2,122 million.
The Trustee Savings Banks, most of which were founded in the nineteenth
century, operate under their own trustees but are subject to government
supervision through the National Debt Office and the Trustee Savings Banks
Inspection Committee. In June 1975 there were 67 individual banks with over
1,570 offices and io-8 million depositors, but by early 1976 there are expected
to be fewer than 20 individual banks as a result of the planned programme of
amalgamations. Deposits can be made in the Ordinary Department, the
Special Investment Department or the Current Account Department.
Savings in the Ordinary Department earn interest at 4 per cent and the first
£40 of interest is tax free. Withdrawals can usually be made on demand
though notice is required for large sums. Deposits are invested with the
National Debt Commissioners and both capital and interest are guaranteed by
the Government. The Special Investment Department offers a higher rate of
return, which is taxable.
At the end of June 1975 total sums in Ordinary Departments of the Trustee
Savings Banks were £1,528 million and in the Special Investment Depart¬
ments £2,127 million. Most Trustee Savings Banks operate cheque services
on deposits in the Current Account Departments which were valued at £86
million. In 1974 the Government announced that the role of Trustee Savings
Banks was to be expanded and to include personal loans to depositors.
The Trustee Savings Banks operate their own unit trust and units may be
purchased by depositors and non-depositors alike.
Many special financial facilities, which are supplementary to the credit
facilities of the banks, are provided through institutions outside the banking
system. These include finance corporations, hire-purchase finance com¬
panies, the stock exchange, investment trust companies, unit trusts, building
societies and the insurance market. The firms engaged in such activities are in
the main highly specialised, for example, finance houses, stockbrokers,
insurers and insurance underwriters and brokers.

There are about 1,900 firms engaged in the financing of hire-purchase and
other instalment credit transactions, and of these 37 constitute the Finance
Houses Association and together cover 90 per cent of all finance house busi¬
ness. At the end of May 1975 the value of instalment credit debt outstanding
to finance houses amounted to ^1,466 million, compared with about ^845
million at the end of i970. About 60 per cent of the assets of finance houses
consists of hire-purchase agreements and other instalment credit. Of this
amount about 60 per cent relates to cars and commercial vehicles, the remain¬
der relating to industrial and building equipment and household and other
goods.
Since 1965 the leading finance houses have complied with the authorities’
policies on lending similar to those applied to banks, and all finance houses
have been required to observe term controls affecting the minimum deposit
and maximum repayment period for specific goods financed by certain forms
of lending. The system of credit control introduced in 1971 (see p. 370) has
been applied to those larger finance houses whose total eligible liabilities
exceed £5 million.
Finance for Industry Ltd. was formed in 1973 as a result of the merger of the
Finance Corporation for Industry and the Industrial and Commercial Finance
Corporation. It provides capital for the re-equipment and development of
industry when finance cannot readily be obtained elsewhere; and provides
capital, financial advice and computer and other services to small and medium¬
sized companies, especially those concerned in technical development. The
resources of the company are being expanded substantially to enable it to
provide up to £1,000 million of medium-term funds at commercial rates
of interest for investment in industry over a period of about two years.
The Commonwealth Development Finance Company (CDFC) is no longer
confined to the Commonwealth in its activities. It supports business enterprise
overseas by providing finance in the form of share capital and loans on
mutually acceptable terms. Its authorised share capital is £30 million, of which
about 14^ million ‘A’ ordinary shares of £1 (£o-io paid) are held by industrial,
shipping, mining and banking interests in Britain, and uf million ‘B’ ordinary
shares of £1 (£0-50 paid) are held by the Bank of England and certain central
banks in the Commonwealth. At 31st March 1975 the CDFC held investments
worth about £34 million spread over a wide range of industries placed in 39
countries.
The Agricultural Mortgage Corporation was established in 1928 for the
purpose of making loans to farmers. Its authorised share capital is £1-5 million
and at 31st March 1975 loans and investments amounted to £290 million.
The Commonwealth Development Corporation (CDC) was set up in 1948
and undertakes projects for the promotion and expansion of a wide range of
enterprises within and outside of the Commonwealth. At the end of 1974,
CDC had a total capital commitment of £257 million.
Investment trust companies and unit trusts enable investors to spread their
risks and obtain the benefit of skilled management.
The usual type of investment trust company is constituted as a public com¬
pany registered under the Companies Acts with limited liability; its business
is to invest its capital in a range of stocks and shares. Like other companies, it
may issue several types of stocks or shares and may retain part of its profits to
build up reserves. Investment trust companies grew to importance in the latter
half of the nineteenth century and have been prominent in directing capital

towards overseas investment. At. the end of 1974 such companies held assets
worth ^3,709 million, of which over one-third were in overseas securities.
Unit trusts are constituted by trust deed between a management company
and a trustee company which holds the assets. Normally, the managers sell
units to the public and must invest the proceeds in a fairly wide range of stock
exchange securities. The costs of running the trust are defrayed partly by an
initial charge which forms part of the price of a unit and partly by a half-
yearly service charge which is usually taken out of the income of the trust.
The level of both charges is controlled by the Department of Trade, whose
authorisation is required before units can be offered to the public; this
is only granted if the trust deed is drawn according to the Department’s
requirements.
The first British unit trust was formed in 1931 and by 1939 there were
98 trusts, with assets estimated at £80 million. This medium of saving has
grown considerably since 1957. At the end of June- 1975 there were 2-2
million unit holdings. The value of the funds invested in authorised trusts de¬
pends on the value of the underlying securities; from only £60 million at the
end of 1958 they had risen to £2,203 million at the end of June 1975 (having
reached £2,647 million at the end of 1972 and fallen to £1,310 million at the
end of 1974). There is now a wide variety of trusts, both as regards the range
of investments covered and the ways in which they cater for the differing
needs of investors.
The principal function of building societies is to supply long-term loans on
the security of private dwelling-houses purchased for owner-occupation,
though loans are occasionally made on the security of commercial and indus¬
trial premises and farms. The funds of building societies are derived mainly
from the general public who invest in shares or deposits. The amount of
share capital is not fixed; shares are not dealt in on the stock exchange but
may be withdrawn at par in cash if notice is given. The Building Societies Act
1062 which consolidated all earlier legislation, prescribes the general way in
which societies must conduct their business. The Chief Registrar of Friendly
Societies has discretionary powers to stop a society either advertising or
accepting money from investors if he considers that the way in which the
society’s business is conducted is jeopardising investors money. The rapid
expansion of building society activity in the twentieth century has been
accompanied by a concentration of most of the business in the hands of a few
large societies. At the end of i974, 4^ societies were registered, with total
assets of about £20,000 million; just over half of this amount is accounted for
by the five largest societies. The amount advanced on mortgage in 1974 was
nearly £2,912 million, 18 per cent less than in 1973*

7,607 securities of companies were quoted, including a number of leading
overseas companies. Company issues represented more than four-fifths of the
securities at market valuation, the remainder being United Kingdom, Irish
Republic and other overseas government and corporation stocks.
The Stock Exchange does not fix dealing prices; the terms on which bar¬
gains are made between members reflect the interaction of supply and demand
for the securities concerned. The Stock Exchange operates under strict rules
of conduct which it formulates itself.
There has been substantial growth in demand for ordinary (equity) shares,
partly in expectation that such shares will maintain or increase their real
value. This demand, however, is very sensitive to the state of the economy,
and economic uncertainty in i973~74 caused large falls in share values which
recovered substantially in the first half of 1975. There is a growing level of
institutional investment on the London market by insurance companies,
pension funds, and by investment and unit trusts.
The market consists of about 250 authorised banks and several firms of foreign
exchange brokers which act as intermediaries between the banks. It provides
those engaged in international trade with foreign currencies for their trans¬
actions. The foreign exchange banks are in close contact with financial
centres abroad and are able to quote buying and selling rates for both spot and
future delivery. An important function of the market is to engage in arbitrage
transactions which serve to eliminate differentials in exchange rates between
different centres. The forward market enables traders, who at a given date in
the future are due to receive or make a specific foreign currency payment, to
determine in advance the precise sterling equivalent of the foreign currency.
All authorised banks may deal in gold but, in practice, dealings are largely
concentrated in the hands of the five members of the London gold market.
The five members meet twice daily to fix a price for all transactions which
customers ask to have executed at the fixing. The London fixing price remains
the basis on which most of the world’s non-monetary gold is traded. Forward
prices may also be quoted on request.
Although a certain amount of insurance is provided by friendly societies and
trade unions, most insurance services in Britain are in the hands of mutual or
joint stock insurance companies or Lloyd’s underwriters.
There are about 614 insurance companies incorporated in the United King¬
dom. Most British insurers undertake several classes of business although
some specialise in one class, particularly in life assurance, where about 150
companies deal with only that type of business. A few specialise in re-insurance.
In addition about 184 overseas companies carry on business (and even more
companies are represented) in the United Kingdom, which illustrates the
international nature of the London market. Some of the large British com¬
panies, however, have their administrative headquarters in the provinces.
At the end of 1974 the total assets of the British insurance companies
amounted to about £24,357 million, the bulk of which was life assurance
companies’ investments. Some 282 companies belong to the British Insurance
Association which accounts for just over 95 per cent of total insurance
business in Britain.
The Government’s supervisory powers over insurance companies under the
Insurance Companies Acts 1958-74 are exercised by the Department of Trade.

BRITAIN 1976: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Lloyd’s is an incorporated society of private insurers in London. The name
‘Lloyd’s’ is derived from Edward Lloyd’s coffee house, established in the late
seventeenth century, where merchants with maritime and other interests
gathered to transact business. By the middle of the eighteenth century,
Lloyd’s coffee house had become the principal centre of underwriting business
and intelligence of shipping movements. Although in its earlier history the
activities of Lloyd’s were confined to the conduct of marine insurance business,
there has also been built up at Lloyd’s a very considerable world-wide market
for the transaction of other classes of insurance business in non-marine,
aviation and motor markets.
Lloyd’s is regulated by a series of special Acts of Parliament starting in 1871.
The affairs of the Society of Lloyd’s in its corporate capacity are administered
by the Committee of Lloyd’s. The society does not accept insurance itself.
Lloyd’s is not a company but a market for insurance, where business is
transacted by individual underwriters for their own account and risk and in
competition with each other. Insurance may only be placed through Lloyd s
brokers, who negotiate with Lloyd’s underwriters on behalf of the insured.
Only elected underwriting members of Lloyd’s, who must transact insurance
with unlimited liability and who have met the most stringent financial regula¬
tions laid down by the Committee of Lloyd s, are permitted to transact
business at Lloyd’s; these financial safeguards give security to the Lloyd’s
policy. Since 1969 non-Commonwealth underwriters have been admitted to
membership of Lloyd’s if they satisfy the requirements.
There are about 7,740 underwriting members of Lloyd’s grouped into
some 360 syndicates and represented at Lloyd’s by underwriting agents who
accept risks on behalf of the members of their syndicates.
In conjunction with its marine insurance business Lloyd’s has built up a
world-wide organisation for the collection and diffusion of shipping intelli¬
gence.
The insurance market is completed by the insurance brokers, acting on behalf
of the insured; brokers are an essential part of the Lloyd s market and a
valuable part of the company market. Many brokers specialise in re-insurance
business, acting as intermediaries in the exchange of contracts between j
companies, both British and overseas, and often acting as London representa-
tives of the latter.
About two-thirds of British insurers’ general (that is, non-life) business is
carried on overseas, partly by re-insurance on the London market and partly
through branches and agencies established in over 100 countries. The basic
principle of this international business is that resources capable of meeting
any potential loss are instantly available for use in any part of the world.
Behind this large and international volume of business stand the very j
substantial assets of the companies, in addition to substantial reserves of
uncalled capital, and the deposits, underwriting trust funds and other re¬
sources of Lloyd’s underwriters. .
In accordance with the Treaty of Rome, insurance and re-insurance in the
European Community are regulated by directives addressed to the govern¬
ments of member states. The purpose of the directives is to harmonise the
legislation of the various member countries, thus providing a ‘common
market’, which would avoid distortion of competition. Two directives have
been approved by the Council of Ministers. The first deals with the conditions I
of access to non-life insurance business and the second requires member j

countries not to discriminate in law or practice between their own subjects
and those of other member states. Draft directives on life insurance, insurance
contracts, and the taxation of insurance policies are also being considered.
Britain remains the principal international centre for transactions in a large
number of commodities, although most of the sales negotiated in these mar¬
kets relate to consignments which never pass through the ports of Britain. The
need for close links with sources of finance and with shipping and insurance
services often determined the location of these markets in the City of London.
Among the more important are the Baltic Exchange (shipping and aircraft
charter markets), the London Commodity Exchange (cocoa, coffee, copra,
rubber and sugar), and the London Metal Exchange. A new market for soya
bean meal was set up in 1975. In addition to these formal markets, almost any
product can be traded through an intermediary in Britain.
The Crown Agents for Oversea Governments and Administrations provide
financial, professional and commercial services for about 90 governments
mostly of independent countries, and some 200 overseas public authorities
and international bodies. The chairman of the Crown Agents is appointed by
the Minister for Overseas Development, but the office is not a government
department. It is a non-profit-making public service which is responsible
to its principals for business operation and dependent on them for fees to
cover administrative costs, a working balance, and a contingency reserve.
The Crown Agents have a staff of about 1,800, including 200 professional and
technical officers.
18 Trade and

PATTERN OF
TRADE
Value and
Volume
Although small in area and accounting for only about 1-4 per cent of the
world’s population, Britain is the fifth largest trading nation in the world and,
as a member of the European Community, part of the world s biggest trading
area which accounts for about 35 per cent of all trade.
Since the mid-nineteenth century, when the rapid growth of Britain s
industry, commerce and shipping was accompanied by its development as an
international trading centre, overseas trade has been of vital importance to
the country’s economy. Britain relies upon imports for almost half its total con¬
sumption of foodstuffs and most of the raw materials needed for its industries.
It is among the world’s largest importers of foodstuffs, metals and ores, textile
raw materials, petroleum and many other products. Its exports of goods
represent more than one-fifth of the gross domestic product. It is a major
supplier of machinery, vehicles, aircraft, metal manufactures, electrical
apparatus, chemicals and textiles.
The existence of a sound commercial banking system and a wide range of
financial institutions ensures that commercial needs are met for both short-
and long-term finance for international trade. The facilities provided by mer¬
chant banks and accepting houses, for example, have long been used to
finance shipments of goods not only to and from Britain, but also between
overseas countries.
This chapter describes the pattern of British overseas trade including its
commodity and area distribution, outlines British commercial policies and
government services to overseas trade, summarises Britain s balance of pay¬
ments and gives an account of government aid to developing countries.
OVERSEAS TRADE
Changes in the value, volume, composition and geographical distribution of
imports and exports are outlined in the following paragraphs.
In 1974 Britain’s exports of goods were valued at about £15,886 million f.o.b.
on a balance of payments basis. On the same basis, after excluding payment
for freight and insurance and making some other adjustments, imports in
1974 were about £21,120 million. Between 1973 and 1974 the value of
exports rose by 35 per cent while that of imports increased by 51 per cent
Over the same period the volume index of exports rose by 7 per cent, and ot
imports by only 1*2 per cent; but the unit value of exports rose by 29 per cent
while import unit values rose by 56 per cent, largely because of higher com¬
modity prices and a further depreciation of sterling (see p. 199).
Following the devaluation of sterling in 1967 exports rose rapidly until 1972
when they increased by only 4 per cent in value compared with 11 per cent in
1971 In 1973 there was a marked recovery with the value of exports growing
by 25 per cent, around half of which represented an increase in volume; this
TRADE AND PAYMENTS 381
sharp increase was generated in part by the upswing in world trade in manu¬
factures in 1973 and in part by the initial effects of the depreciation of sterling
since mid-1972 on the competitiveness of British goods overseas. Exports
continued to rise rapidly in 1974 but fell slightly towards the end of the year.
There was a large increase in the value of imports in 1973, mainly owing to the
effects of increased commodity prices, and a further sharp increase early in
:974 <^ue a fourfold increase in oil prices.1 However, the volume of imports
showed a continued decline during i974> following a reduction of the level of
activity and demand in the domestic economy.
From 1964 to 1967 there had been a steady improvement in Britain’s terms
of trade, that is, export prices rose faster than import prices. Following an
initial fall in the terms of trade index after the devaluation of the pound in
November 1967* it continued to increase until 1972, when it stood at ioi'7
(1970 = 100). With the sharp rise in commodity prices and the lower ex¬
change value of sterling in i973> index fell to 90'2 and then to 74’9 in
I974- At the end of the first half of 1975 it stood at 82-1.
The value and volume of exports and imports from 1969 to 1974 are shown
in Table 30.

about 11 per cent in 1974.

Imports of petroleum and petroleum products are by far the biggest single
item by value, amounting to about 20 per cent of the total value of imports
during 1974 when their value was ^4,142 million, having increased by 223
per cent between 1973 and 1974.
In recent years there has been a significant rise, in Britain as in other in¬
dustrial countries, in the proportion of imports of finished manufactures,
particularly capital goods and industrial components. Such imports rose
from about 6 per cent of the total imports in 1957 to 29 per cent in 1973,
falling, however, to 24 per cent in 1974, when they were valued at £5,555
million. Imports of semi-manufactures have also been increasing and since
1962 have formed a larger part of the total import bill than basic materials,
partly because the countries producing the basic materials increasingly carry
out the subsequent stages of manufacture themselves. Imports of semi¬
manufactured goods (including chemicals) totalled £6,373 million in 1974 and
accounted for 28 per cent of total imports.

About 83 per cent of Britain’s exports consist of manufactured goods both
finished and semi-manufactured. By far the most important group is machinery
and transport equipment exports of which have been increasing rapidly and
accounted for 37 per cent of total exports in 1974- The share of chemicals
has grown fairly steadily, exports of chemicals having grown by 69 per cent
in 1974. The share of metals was little changed in 1973 and 1974 following a
steady fall over a number of years to 10-4 per cent in 1972.

IMPORTS EXPORTS
Trade between Britain and Western Europe has been increasing in recent
years—particularly rapidly in 1973 and 1974—and conversely there has been
a decline in the proportion of Britain’s exports going to primary producing
countries. Exports to Western Europe formed just over half of the total in
1974, having risen by 34 per cent during the year; their share in 1958 was only
31 per cent. Exports to the enlarged European Economic Community (EEC)
rose by 37 per cent to account for over 33 per cent of Britain’s total.
Imports from Western Europe rose by 40 per cent in 1974 forming 48
per cent of the total, the same proportion as in 1973.
Imports from the EEC rose by 48 per cent in 1974 to form one-third of all
imports, again the same proportion as in 1973.
Exports to developing countries, having declined in recent years as a pro¬
portion of total exports, rose by 39 per cent in 1974 forming 22 per cent of
the total, while imports from the same countries rose sharply by 81 per cent
in 1974 (largely owing to increases in oil prices), forming 28 per cent of the
total. Exports to the oil-exporting countries1 rose by 51 per cent in 1974 and
imports by 156 per cent. Canada, Australia, South Africa and the Irish
Republic are still among Britain’s leading trading partners but since 1957 the
United States has been Britain’s largest single market and source of imports.
In 1974 North America accounted for about 14 per cent of Britain’s exports
and imports. The value of exports to Latin America increased by 38 per cent
in 1974 and the value of imports by 35 per cent. Exports to the centrally

As far back as estimates have been made, that is, for nearly two centuries,
Britain has usually earned a surplus from its invisible transactions: the receipts
and payments arising from services (as distinct from goods) supplied to and
received from overseas residents; the income arising from outward and in¬
ward investment; and transfers between Britain and other countries.
The invisible transactions involved are divided for statistical purposes into
six main groups: government services and transfers; transport (shipping an
civil aviation); travel; other services (which covers a variety of items including
the financial services of the City of London); interest, profits and dividends;
and private transfers (migrants’ funds, legacies and private gifts) fable 33
shows the breakdown of the figures from 1964 to 1974. The total invisi e
balance in 1974 was £1,566 million. Gross earnings of £9>975 ™lhon from

Tourist Trade
TRADE AND PAYMENTS 385
total invisible exports were about two-thirds of the total of £15,886 million
from visible exports.
As shown in Table 33 in recent years there has been a considerable and
rapidly rising net surplus on ‘other services’ and another large surplus on
interest, profits and dividends. There has also been a surplus on civil aviation
services throughout the past decade. Sea transport transactions have been in
deficit since 1969. Except in 1973, travel credits have exceeded debits since
1968, mainly because of the continuing increase in the number of travellers
(including tourists) visiting Britain and in the average expenditure per visitor.
About half the total debits in respect of government expenditure relate to
military expenditure overseas and this has remained steady or fallen in real
terms in recent years, though currency changes have caused the sterling value
to rise; other substantial items of expenditure are grants to developing coun¬
tries, expenditure on the diplomatic service, subscriptions to international or¬
ganisations, and Britain s contribution to the common budget for the financing
of European Community expenditure (see p. 81).

In addition, since its accession to the European Community in 1973 (see
p. 77) Britain has been paying £24 million in three annual instalments

and tourist receipts, excluding fares, are estimated at about £833 million.
United Kingdom residents on holiday, or travelling for business or other
purposes overseas, spent about £682 million (excluding fares) in the same
year. The almost continuing increase in both the average expenditure per visitor
and in the number of travellers visiting Britain has produced the surpluses on
the travel account mentioned above in 1968—72 and I974- The estimated total
number of visits to the Lnited Kingdom in 1974 including visitors from the
Irish Republic, was a record figure of 7-9 million—twice the level of 1966 and
an increase of 2 7 per cent over the 1973 level.
Britain’s national tourist organisation consists of four independent govern¬
ment-financed statutorv bodies—the British Tourist Authority, which is
responsible for the overseas promotion of tourism in Britain and for certain
general matters affecting the country as a whole, and the English, Scottish
and Wales Tourist Boards which are responsible for encouraging the develop¬
ment and improvement of facilities and amenities for tourists in their respec¬
tive countries, and for tourist promotional work and publicity within Britain
—and a separate statutorv Tourist Board for Northern Ireland. The English,
Scottish and Wales boards offer financial assistance to selected tourist projects
in development areas.
Britain has long been an advocate of the removal of artificial barriers to trade,
and to this end has taken a leading part in the activities of such organisations
as the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), the International
Monetary Fund (IMF), the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and
Development (OECD) and the Enited Nations Conference on Trade and
Development (UNCTAD). As a member of the European Community,
Britain is committed to working for the development of world trade by the
progressive reduction through reciprocal measures of both tariff and non-tariff
barriers. The Communitv’s Common Customs Tariff (CCT) is lower than
that of several other major industrial countries.
Britain’s protective tariffs have been considerably modified in recent years
as a result of negotiations held under the auspices of GATT which also seek to
increase the volume of world trade by reducing tariffs and other barriers to
trade, and by eliminating discrimination in international commerce.
As a result of the ‘Kennedy Round’ (May 1964-June 1967), a series of
GATT tariff negotiations, average reductions of over 30 per cent were made
by the major trading countries, including Britain, in their tariffs on industrial
goods. The reductions made between 1968 and 1972 British tariffs on
dutiable industrial goods imported from the EEC, the United States and
Japan amounted to about 37 per cent, 40 per cent and 34 per cent respectively.
This was closely in line with the reductions made by these countries which
affected well over 70 per cent of British exports of dutiable industrial goods
to them. Some reductions were also made in the tariff on agricultural goods.
A new series of negotiations was formally launched in Tokyo in September
1973 and substantive discussions began in Geneva in February 1975. The
negotiations cover a wide range of both tariff and non-tariff barriers to trade.
All tariffs on trade in industrial products between Britain and the other Euro¬
pean Community countries are being eliminated in five equal stages over the
transitional period ending 1st July 1977. By the same date Britain will be
applying the common customs tariff to all countries neither belonging to, nor
having any special arrangement with, the Community, subject to special

arrangements for some industrial materials. By the same date also virtually all
industrial tariff barriers between the European Community and the remaining
member countries of the European Free Trade Association (EFTA), to
which Britain belonged between i960 and 1972, will have been dismantled.
Reciprocal preferential tariff treatment for trade between Britain and other
independent Commonwealth countries dates from the Ottawa Conference
of 1932.
The special trading relations between Britain and 22 developing Common¬
wealth countries in Africa, the Caribbean and the Pacific (ACP)1 were re¬
placed by the Convention of Lome, signed in February 1975. This established
new trade, aid and co-operation links between the Community and a total of
46 developing ACP countries.2 The Convention safeguards the interests of
Commonwealth and other countries dependent on the export of particular
agricultural products, including sugar for which access to Community markets
has been guaranteed for an indefinite period at prices related to those in the
Community and in quantities which the producing countries have under¬
taken to supply.
All British dependent territories (with the exception of Gibraltar, Hong
Kong and Bermuda), together with the Overseas Countries and Territories
(OCT) of other Community members, are to be linked with the Community
as a whole during 1975 under arrangements similar to those embodied in the
Convention of Lome. The preference for imports from Commonwealth
countries which are neither signatories of the Lome agreement nor members
of the OCT will be phased out by 1st January 1977.
Other special arrangements have been agreed relating to continued access
into the Community for New Zealand dairy products.
The Community has stated its continuing objective of expanding and re¬
inforcing existing trade relations with the Commonwealth countries of Asia,
taking into account the scope of the generalised system of preferences (see
below) from which they derive considerable benefit. A commercial co¬
operation agreement between the Community and India came into effect in
April 1974, and negotiations are proceeding for similar agreements with
Bangladesh and Sri Lanka. The Community is also engaged in discussions
with Pakistan.
The establishment of a generalised system of preferences for manufactures and
semi-manufactures exported by developing countries was agreed in principle
at the second UNCTAD Conference in New Delhi in 1968. Britain’s scheme
started early in 1972, but, as a member of the European Community, Britain
adopted in 1974 the scheme of the enlarged Community. The EEC’s scheme
has been considerably improved since the Community’s enlargement by the
establishment of more liberal access into the Community for imports of manu¬
factured and processed agricultural products from developing countries. Con¬
tinued improvement of the scheme is to be made with the interests of the

poorest developing countries (particularly those of Asian members of the
Commonwealth) in mind.
The Government assists exporters by its efforts to create conditions favourable
to the export trade and by providing credit insurance facilities and informa¬
tion and advice about opportunities for trade in other countries. Export pro¬
motion is also assisted by the Scottish Council (Development and Industry),
the Development Corporation for Wales and in Northern Ireland by the
Department of Commerce.
The British Overseas Trade Board (BOTB) of the Department of Trade
directs Britain’s export promotion programme, including the provision of
export intelligence, help to exporters at trade fairs and other promotional
events overseas, and support for firms participating in missions overseas and
for inward commercial visits to Britain. It includes representatives of commerce
and industry, the Trades Union Congress, and the Department of Trade and
the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, and operates under the general
authority of the Secretary of State for Trade who is the President.
Exporters wanting assistance and advice can consult Department of Trade
offices throughout Britain and, through these offices, the commercial posts of
the British Diplomatic Service overseas.
Overseas officers regularly report on local economic and commercial con¬
ditions and (together with the Export Services and Promotions Division of the
BOTB) generally assist the exporter to overcome any difficulties he encounters
in trade with the country in question, particularly those arising out of govern¬
mental regulations. Assistance is also given to British exporters in appointing
agents and locating potential importers.
The Export Credits Guarantee Department (ECGD) provides credit insur¬
ance for more than a third of the country’s export trade and for much of the
external trade of British merchants.
The main risks covered include insolvency or protracted default of the
buyer, governmental action which stops the British exporter receiving pay¬
ment, new import restrictions, war, or civil disturbance in the buyer’s country.
Cover may commence from the date of contract or (at lower premiums) from
the date of shipment.
This insurance may be supplemented by unconditional guarantees of re¬
payment given direct to banks financing the exporter. Alternatively, for
contracts over ^250,000, the ECGD will guarantee loans direct to overseas
buyers enabling them to pay on cash terms, or ‘lines of credit’ similarly
covering an agreed buying programme of an overseas country, with the mini¬
mum value of the individual contracts often as low as £10,000. The banks
provide finance against these guarantees.
Since 20th February 1975 ECGD has offered a measure of cover against
high and unpredictable cost escalation to exporters with capital goods con¬
tracts worth over £2 million which involve a manufacturing period of over
two years. Since the same date it has also been prepared to support the issue
of performance bonds in the commercial market in respect of cash or near¬
cash contracts worth over £2 million.
Investment insurance ig also provided for new British investment against
expropriation, war damage and restrictions on remittances.

Britain stages many exhibitions and trade fairs and British products are shown
at most of the large international trade fairs throughout the world.
Participation in trade fairs, ‘British weeks’ and store promotions overseas is
a form of export promotion for which the Government provides information
and financial assistance to exporters. In September 1973 a British Export
Marketing Centre was opened in Tokyo to provide exhibitions and other
marketing facilities for individual British firms or organisations.
There are now very few restrictions imposed by Britain on the movement of
goods and services.
Under the Import, Export and Customs Powers (Defence) Act 1939 the
Department of Trade is empowered to prohibit or regulate the import or
export of goods. Several other departments have separate powers to control
imports and exports for specific purposes.
In accordance with its international obligations under the GATT and the
IMF, and its European Community membership, Britain has progressively
removed quantitative restrictions from almost all its imports from the market
economies. There has also been a continuing substantial relaxation of quanti¬
tative restrictions on imports from centrally planned economies. In 1975 the
importation of gold coins, gold medals and similar articles, minted or made
after 1837, was made subject to individual licensing; the remaining controls
include those recognised internationally on a few goods such as arms, ammuni¬
tion and radioactive materials. Controlled goods require a specific import
licence and quotas have been set up for many of them. Some further restric¬
tions or prohibitions are applied under separate legislation for the protection of
health or public safety, in the interest of conservation, and for other non¬
economic reasons (for example, on animals, drugs and explosives). There is
also a general import restriction on goods from Rhodesia as part of the Govern¬
ment’s sanctions policy against the illegal regime.
Except for the control necessary to ensure that exports to destinations outside
the scheduled territories1 are paid for in the proper manner most British
exports are not subject to any government control or direction. The few
controls that are in operation are imposed to supervise exports of military
and strategic importance; to conserve materials which may be in short supply;
on diamonds to assist exchange control operations (see below) in preventing
the export of capital in that form; to ensure the humane treatment of cattle,
sheep and pigs; and to prevent the export of antiques (including works of art
and documents), and documentary and photographic material over 70 years
old, on grounds of national importance. There is a general export restriction
on goods to Rhodesia.
Britain applies exchange control mainly in order to conserve its reserves of
gold and foreign exchange. The powers under the Exchange Control Act 1947
are conferred mainly on the Treasury which has delegated the administration
of most parts of the Act to the Bank of England. The Bank has in turn
authorised most commercial banks in Britain to execute a wide range of
transactions.
1 The scheduled territories comprise the United Kingdom, the Channel Islands the
Isle of Man, the Irish Republic and Gibraltar.
39°
BRITAIN 1976: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
The general effect of exchange control regulations is to control transactions
between residents of the scheduled territories and non-residents. Payments
in sterling may in general be made freely between residents, but the acquisition
of other currencies by them is subject to control.
The aim of exchange control policy is not to discourage investment abroad
but to regulate the manner in which investment outside the scheduled terri¬
tories is financed. Official exchange is usually available only for projects which
promise early and continuing benefits to the balance of payments. Where the
use of official exchange is not permitted investors can finance their approved
projects in other ways, for example, by borrowing foreign currency or pur¬
chasing investment currency (which, because it is drawn from a limited
pool of currency, normally changes hands at a premium). Payments for
goods exported to destinations outside the scheduled territories have in
general to be in foreign currency or in sterling from an external account,
and must be received within six months of export unless they are covered by
an approved export credit arrangement. Control is also exercised over im¬
ports to ensure that currency authorised for their payment is used for that
purpose.
There are certain restrictions on dealings in gold bullion and on the use of
gold for manufacturing and industrial purposes. Purchases of gold coins
minted after 1837 by residents other than authorised dealers in gold are
allowed only if the coins are in Britain and are being sold by a resident who is
not selling on behalf of a non-resident.
Residents are entitled to purchase up to £300 in foreign currency for their
travel expenditure on each journey outside the scheduled territories, other
than to Rhodesia, irrespective of the purpose of the journey. Further travel
funds may be obtained for business, professional or other reasons. Non¬
residents may hold an external account in a British bank and are entitled to
change their sterling on external account for other currencies and to make and
receive payments in any currency to and from non-residents in any other part
of the world. Special restrictions apply to transactions with residents of
Rhodesia.
People living outside the scheduled territories who visit Britain tem¬
porarily are regarded as non-resident and not subject to the exchange control
provisions. On the other hand, people coming to Britain from outside the
scheduled territories and intending to take up permanent residence in
Britain are normally regarded as resident, though they may be eligible for
certain exemptions from their obligations under the Exchange Control Act
I947-
Visitors to Britain may import notes in any currency, travellers’ cheques and
letters of credit without limit. On departure, visitors may take with them
sterling or scheduled territory notes up to a value of £25, foreign currency
notes up to a value of ^300 and any foreign currency notes which they brought
in with them.
BALANCE OF PAYMENTS
Britain’s balance of payments has usually been characterised by a deficit on
visible trade more than offset by a surplus on invisible earnings. Estimates of
the balance of payments and its main constituent items are given in summary
since 1967 in Table 34 and in greater detail since 1972 in Tables 35 and 36.
The balance of payments statistics contain two indicators of particular
importance. The first is the balance on current account, covering both visible
TRADE AND PAYMENTS
391
(exports and imports of goods) and invisible (trade in services, investment
income and transfers) transactions. This, together with capital transfers,
provides a measure of how far Britain is paying its way abroad and thus adding
to or using up overseas assets. The second indicator is the total currency flow.

This is the net result of all external flows, that is the current account, capital
transfers, investment and other capital flows (including official long-term
capital transactions, investment flows, trade credit, and changes in Britain’s
external banking and money market liabilities in sterling) and other flows
which are unidentified transactions reflected in the balancing item. The total
currency flow shows the impact of all external flows on the reserves and debt
position, that is, how much is available to add to the reserves and to repay any
official borrowing in the case of a net inflow, or how much must be financed
by drawing on the reserves or by borrowing if there is a net outflow. Table 35
gives details of the current account since 1972. Both exports and imports rose
strongly after the devaluation of sterling in 1967. In 1971 exports rose in value
faster than imports resulting in the highest-ever surplus on visible trade of
£282 million which, together with a substantial surplus on invisibles, pro¬
duced a record current account surplus of £1,048 million. This trend was
reversed in 1972 and 1973 with the development of a visible trade deficit
reflecting both the rise in world commodity prices and the depreciation of
sterling from June 1972. The rise in commodity import prices continued in
1974 but the increase in oil prices (see p. 381) was the main cause of a sub¬
stantial rise in the visible deficit in 1974 to £5,234 million, offset to some extent
by a surplus on invisibles of £1,566 million. The non-oil deficit in the second
half of 1974 was 14 per cent lower than in the same period of 1973. During
J975 there was a reduction in the deficit on oil and a general improvement in
the trade balance on other goods.
In the period 1963-68, there was a total currency outward flow of £3,778
million (including a gold subscription of £44 million to the IMF) financed
mainly by official borrowing totalling £3,134 million, but also by transfers to
the reserves of the dollar portfolio totalling £520 million; and a reduction of
£124 million in the reserves. In 1969 there was a reversal of the net currency
flow, and a rapidly increasing currency inflow which in 1971 reached £3,228

There was a net inflow in 1974 on identified investment and other capital
transactions of some ^2,716 million, reflecting in particular public sector over¬
seas currency borrowing of about £1,260 million, mainly under the exchange
cover scheme (see p. 204). Overseas investment in the private sector rose in
1974 to about £2,110 million reflecting, among other factors, investment by
foreign oil companies in North Sea operations. Private investment overseas, at
£1,128 million, was lower than in 1972 and 1973 mainly owing to reduction
by British investors of their holdings of foreign securities. Direct investment
overseas, which included a substantial element of reinvested profits in both
1973 and 1974 and also a number of large acquisitions of overseas companies
by British ones in 1973* declined somewhat in 1974 as number and level
of acquisitions fell.
Britain participates in the Special Drawing Rights (SDRs) scheme which
came into effect in 1970 in order to supplement world reserves. SDRs are
reserve assets created and distributed by decision of the members of the IMF.
Any member of the IMF may join the scheme, and its share is based on its
IMF quota. Participants in the scheme accept an obligation to provide con¬
vertible currency, when designated by the IMF to do so, to another participant
in exchange for SDRs up to a total amount equal to twice the net amount of
their own allocation of SDRs. Only those countries with a sufficiently strong
balance of payments are so designated by the IMF. SDRs may also be used in
certain direct payments between participants in the scheme and for payments
of various kinds to the IMF.
In 1972 Britain’s official financing requirement was reduced to £i,i4I
million by an IMF allocation of £124 million of SDRs which was taken into
the reserves. Britain participates in the IMF oil facility and the OECD
Financial Support Fund (see p. 200).
Britain has also taken part since 1961 in the international network of re¬
ciprocal credit (swap) facilities arranged between central banks. Under these
arrangements each central bank is able to exchange on request, for a limited
period, its own currency for the currency of another country up to an agreed
TRADE AND PAYMENTS
393
maximum. It agrees to reverse the transaction at a specified date at the same
rate of exchange. The currencies so obtained can be added to the reserves or
used in exchange operations.

EXTERNAL
ASSETS AND
LIABILITIES
BRITAIN 1976: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
The significance of any inventory of Britain’s aggregate external assets and
liabilities1 is limited because a variety of claims and obligations are included
that are very dissimilar in kind, in degree of liquidity and in method of valua¬
tion. The inventory for the end of 1974 shows that Britain had a net creditor
position estimated at some £1,700 million.
External Assets
External
Liabilities
Britain’s assets arising from private investment overseas are estimated to have
been £19,120 million at the end of 1974. This compares with a figure of
£8,070 million at the end of 1962. Direct investment, including oil, accounted
for’£14,720 million of the total figure for end-1974, the balance consisting of
£4,400 million of portfolio investment.
United Kingdom banking and commercial claims at the end of 1974 totalled
£5,568 million.2 Within this total banking claims were £2,983 million; sup¬
pliers’ export credit to unrelated firms was £2,137 million. With the increase
in recent years in British aid to developing countries, inter-governmental loans
of £1,148 million form the largest item among official external assets, which
at the end of 1974 were £3,067 million including refinanced export credit, j
The latter figure, together with official reserves of £2,345 million, £5,568 i;
million in banking and commercial claims and private investment overseas of
£19,120 million, resulted in aggregate identified external assets at the end of
1974 of some £30,100 million.
Identified external liabilities at the end of 1974 are estimated to have been
some £28,405 million. All official short- and medium-term liabilities to the
IMF and other monetary authorities were repaid in 1972 but foreign currency
borrowing by the Government late in 1974 totalled £638 million at the end of
the year. Inter-governmental loans to Britain and other official liabilities,
mainly a consequence of the second world war and its aftermath, totalled
£1,465 million at the end of 1974 of which £1,135 million was owed to the
United States and £285 million to Canada. Other public sector liabilities of
£5,176 million comprised overseas holdings of British government and public
corporations’ sterling securities, holdings of Treasury bills and notes, local
authorities’ securities and mortgages, and foreign currency borrowings by
British public corporations and local authorities. British banking and com¬
mercial liabilities, including liabilities in sterling and in foreign currencies,
totalled £9,920 million.2 Liabilities in the form of overseas investment in
Britain’s private sector totalled £11,205 million.
Liabilities in sterling comprise both public sector and banking and money-
market liabilities within the totals above. Sterling held in Britain by foreigners
in the form of British government securities (where these were held by central
monetary institutions and international organisations other than the 1Mb),
bank deposits, deposits with local authorities and hire purchase companies,
and Treasury bills totalled £7,579 million at the end of June 1975. Of mis,
£3 606 million was held by residents of oil exporting countries, £821 million
by residents of the European Community, and £3,152 million by other
holders. The total of these liabilities (excluding the counterpart of borrowing)

remained broadly constant between the end of 1945 and 1970 but rose sharply
during 1971 and i972> and again during 1974- They reflect the international
trading and reserve role of sterling and in part the financial services of the
City.
Overseas liabilities arising from investment in the private sector of the British
economy rose from £3,165 million in 1962 to £11,205 million at the end
of 1974.
Overseas investors in Britain are free to repatriate the proceeds of the sale
of their investments, including any capital gains that may have accrued.
Earnings and dividends are transferable irrespective of their size. In 1974
the inflow of direct, portfolio and other private investment, including oil,
amounted to £2,110 million.1
The value of overseas investment in the private sector at the end of 1974
comprised: the book value of direct investment in Britain by companies in¬
corporated abroad £5,355 million (excluding oil, banking, and insurance);
portfolio holdings of British securities—£1,530 million; the book value of the
net assets in Britain of overseas oil companies—£3,100 million; and the
balance of £1,220 million which included borrowing by British companies
overseas.
About two-thirds of the direct investment of £5,355 million originally
came from North America and about one-fifth from Western Europe. Of the
£682 million inflow of direct investment into Britain in 1973 £390 million
originated from North America and £106 million from EEC countries.
Foreign investment inflow brings a number of benefits to British industry,
including technological development which in turn will strengthen the
economy and its balance of payments position.
Approval is readily obtained for financing direct investment projects by
borrowing abroad on appropriate terms. There is also scope for the investment
of retained profits of subsidiary companies overseas. In recent years a consider¬
able proportion of net direct investment outflow has been financed in this way.
Sterling finance is available in certain cases when projects promise early and
substantial benefits to Britain’s balance of payments.
Direct investment outflow, excluding oil, was £1,540 million in 1974 com¬
pared with £1,624 million in 1973. The latest available area analysis indicates
that of the 1973 figure £247 million was placed in developing countries,
£519 million in EEC countries and £513 million in North America. With the
inclusion of oil, portfolio and other investment, aggregate private investment
outflows totalled £1,128 million in 1974 compared with £1,861 million in
portfolio disinvestment of £295 million in 1973 increasing to £767
million in 1974. ' '
Britain’s aid programme to the developing countries, which is the responsibility
of the Ministry of Overseas Development, consists of loans and grants for
economic and social development, technical assistance, budget support and
contributions to multilateral agencies providing financial aid and technical
assistance to these countries. To complement the official programme private
investment is encouraged by the provision of government insurance to private
investors by the ECGD (see p. 388). In addition an important contribution
' Direct investment refers mainly to the establishment of subsidiary companies and
banks, while portfolio investment refers to investment in company securities.

Bilateral
Financial Aid
BRITAIN 1976: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
is made to economic development by private voluntary organisations engaged
in relief, development and educational work.
Since 1945 total official aid disbursements have amounted to nearly £4,315
million. The average gross annual disbursement over the four years 1971-74
was about £323-3 million (see Table 37). In 1974 the total was some £386-7
million, of which bilateral aid accounted for £295-7 million including £76-4
million technical assistance; assistance provided through multilateral agencies
was £91 million. Repayments of capital and payments of interest during the
year on loans made previously came to £43-8 million and £41-6 million respec¬
tively. In recognition of the special importance of the role of official develop¬
ment assistance, the strategy for the Second UN Development Decade,
adopted in 1970, included a recommendation that each developed country
should progressively increase its official development assistance to the develop¬
ing countries and exert its best efforts to contribute a minimum net amount of
0-7 per cent of its gross national product (GNP) to them by the middle of the
decade. Britain has now accepted in principle the 0-7 per cent GNP target and
will seek in the years ahead to move towards it. The speed at which it can do
so, however, must be subject to the pace of Britain s own economic recovery
and to other calls on its resources. Britain has also accepted the UN target of 1
per cent of GNP for total net financial flows (that is, including private and
official flows) to developing countries.
In 1974 gross disbursements of British official flows were £386-7 million,
net of amortisation receipts, these amounted to £342-9 million (0-42 per cent
of GNP): net disbursements of official development assistance within this
were £308 6 million (0-38 per cent of GNP). Public expenditure plans for the
aid programme are published annually in the report on public expenditure,
the most recent of which covers the years up to 1978“79 (see Bibliography p.
482). Under this method of aid determination, introduced in 1971, totals at
constant prices, net of amortisation, are agreed by ministers for five years
ahead. The gross total, which is used for allocating funds to various aid pro¬
grammes, is arrived at by adding the estimated amortisation receipts to the
net figure. It is expected that the overall aid programme will continue to rise
in cash terms.
Bilateral financial aid in 1974 totalled £219-3 million; over 33 per cent was in
grants and the rest in loans. Budgetary aid, £6-6 million in 1974, is provided
in the form of grants. Development aid is in grants or loans, depending on
the economic and constitutional circumstances of the recipient countries, the
greater part of it has been in loans, but this will now change following the
decision taken in June 1975 provide future aid to the poorest developing
countries (which include India, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and many African
countries) in the form of grants. The terms of new development loans from
Britain have been progressively softened since 1958 and a policy of making
interest-free loans to lighten the repayment burdens of the poorer developing
countries was introduced in June 1965. In 1974 the total value of bilateral
loan commitments entered into by the British Government, excluding invest¬
ments by the Commonwealth Development Corporation (see p. 397)> was
£174-7 million and of this over 92 per cent was on interest-free terms and over
99 per cent at an interest rate of 2 per cent or less. The recipients included
India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Ethiopia, Bolivia, and Indonesia.
Where loans bear interest it is at fixed concessionary rates ranging from 2
per cent to 6 per cent, and both kinds of loan carry from two to seven years’
grace periods during which repayments of capital are not made. Of all loans

committed in 1974 the average maturity was 25 years. Britain has more than
fulfilled the 1972 recommendations of the Development Assistance Com¬
mittee of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development
(OECD) on easing the terms of financial aid.
Loans and grants are tied to the purchase of goods, equipment and services
from Britain, although there may be a limited element for local costs and a
foreign content not exceeding 20 per cent in contracts financed from tied aid

Discrepancies between totals and their constituent parts
are due to rounding.
in appropriate cases. Loans committed after 1st October 1975, however, will
be untied, if the recipient agrees, to the extent that goods can be purchased
from the poorest developing countries as well as from Britain. Between 1958
and the end of 1974, 426 loans were negotiated involving a commitment of
£1,441 million, of which £1,198 million has been disbursed. The recipients
of the largest amounts have been India and Pakistan. During the same period
bilateral grant commitments amounted to around £1,361 million.
Historically, Britain’s aid programme began as part of the discharge of its
responsibilities towards dependent territories, and the main emphasis re¬
mains on the Commonwealth which includes among its members some of
the world’s poorest countries. In 1974 £235-6 million (80 per cent) of the
bilateral programme was disbursed to Commonwealth countries and depen¬
dencies.
In the past, development aid to the dependent territories was given under
the Colonial Development and Welfare (CD & W) Acts, largely in the form
of grants. Expenditure on economic and social development up to the termina¬
tion of the Acts on 31st March 1970 amounted to some £450 million. The aid
requirements of the few remaining dependencies are now provided under the
authority of the Overseas Aid Act 1966. In 1974 the territories received £24-6
million in bilateral financial aid and technical assistance.
An important role in development assistance is played by the Common¬
wealth Development Corporation (CDC), set up by the British Government

in 1948, to assist the economic development of the then dependent territories.
Subsequent legislation extended its area of operations to independent Com¬
monwealth countries and, with the approval of the Minister of Overseas
Development, to other countries. By the end of 1974 some £203-6 million had
been invested out of a total commitment of £256-8 million. Of the latter, £61-5
million was in East Asia and the Pacific Islands, £62 million in the Carib¬
bean and virtually all of the remainder in Africa. New commitments approved
in 1974 totalled over £26 million.
Expenditure on bilateral technical assistance (the provision of skilled
personnel, advice and training) has increased in recent years and was
£76-4 million, 26 per cent of total bilateral aid, in 1974. The largest component
of expenditure (£39 million in 1974) was on sen(iing or maintaining experts,
including volunteers; the next largest was for students and trainees in Britain
(£12 million).
Under the Overseas Service Aid Scheme (OSAS) and associated schemes
Britain meets the additional costs of employing experienced expatriate British
personnel in the public services of developing countries. The schemes cost
£17-3 million in 1974.
During 1974, of the 9,776 British persons other than volunteers who were
working in developing countries and financed by the British Government,
some 4,623 were engaged in the field of education, 1,695 in public works and
communications, 1,541 in public administration, 1,126 in agriculture and
allied fields, 574 in health services, and 217 in industrial ports.
In addition, under the British Volunteer Programme in 1974 there were
1,904 volunteers, mainly graduates or otherwise qualified, working in develop¬
ing countries, the majority of them teaching. Recruitment, training and placing
overseas is undertaken by four voluntary bodies; 75 Per cen^ British
costs (£0-9 million in 1974) are met by the British Government.
Britain receives large numbers of students and trainees from developing
countries. Over 14,808 were financed in Britain in 1974 under regional pro¬
grammes of technical assistance, by awards under the Commonwealth Educa¬
tion Co-operation Scholarships and Education Fellowship Schemes, and under
the various schemes of the British Council.
Britain is the second largest subscriber (after the United States) to the World
Bank group of institutions—the International Bank for Reconstruction and
Development, the International Development Association (IDA) and the Inter¬
national Finance Corporation. The British commitment to IDA in the three
years 1971-73 (The Third Replenishment) was nearly £141 million; the
contribution to the Fourth Replenishment, which became effective in January
1975, is over £206 million. Britain has contributed, or has agreed to contribute,
to the Asian Development Bank, the Inter-American Development Bank,
the Caribbean Development Bank and the African Development Bank.
Britain has contributed £84 million to the United Nations Development
Programme since its inception in 1950 and has provided more experts and
training places under multilateral schemes than any other country. Many
British nationals were serving in developing countries under the United
Nations and its specialised agencies in 1974. Other contributions include
those to the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees
(UNRWA), the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR),
the World 'Food Programme and the United Nations Children’s Fund
(UNICEF).
TRADE AND PAYMENTS

An increasing proportion of British development assistance is being chan¬
nelled through the European Community’s aid programme. Community
financial aid takes the form principally of assistance from the European
Development Fund (EDF) to those countries which have a special relationship
with the Community under the Convention of Lome (see p. 387). The EDF
for 1975-80 amounts to some £1,600 million, including expenditure on a new
export-earnings stabilisation scheme. Loans are also made to a number of
Mediterranean countries linked to the Community by trade agreements,
which are being extended.
The Community s contribution to the United Nations emergency measures
to assist developing countries most seriously affected by increased prices of
oil and other commodities amounted in 1974-75 to nearly $300 million.
Britain s share of this total, together with its bilateral contributions to the
emergency measures, was about £83 million. It also contributes fully to the
Community’s food aid programme.
Britain is playing a leading part in developing a new Community aid and
development policy based on the criterion of need and applicable on a world¬
wide basis. This, which would involve all the instruments of Community
development policy, would place greater emphasis on giving help to those
developing countries—many of which are among the world’s poorest—not
covered by the Lome Convention or having any other special relationship
with the Community.
19 Promotion of the
Sciences
The Government is the main source of funds for scientific research and
development as a whole though private industry contributes a larger propor¬
tion of funds for civil research and development. Funds are also provided by
public corporations, independent trusts and foundations, and learned societies.
The Government keeps under review facilities for training scientists and
ensures that adequate research is directed to matters of national interest.
The Pattern of Total expenditure in Britain on scientific research and development in
Expenditure 1972-73 is estimated at ^1,375 million compared with ^658 million in 1961-62.
The proportion this represented of the gross national product remained
fairly steady throughout the 1960s at between 27 and 2-8 per cent, but fell
slightly around the turn of the decade to reach about 2*4 per cent in 1972 73-
There were also divergent trends in some of the components. The share of
defence almost halved during the period whereas that for civil purposes was
rising. Civil research and development financed from non-government funds
represented an increased share of the total claim on resources in 1966 67
compared with earlier years, but has remained fairly constant since. In 1972
73 private industry spent about £750 million of which ^4^2 million was
privately funded and ^268 million came from Government.
The Government continues to finance just over half the research and
development and to carry out about a quarter in its own establishments.
Expenditure by the research councils on research and development is estima¬
ted at about £149 million in 1975-76.
THE GOVERN¬
MENT AND
SCIENTIFIC
RESEARCH
Under the Science and Technology Act 1965 central responsibility for basic
civil science rests with the Secretary of State for Education and Science, who
is advised by the Advisory Board for the Research Councils (see p. 401).
Responsibility for technology rests mainly with the Secretary of State for
Industry. Other government departments are responsible for research and
development related to their executive responsibilities. In 1972 the Govern¬
ment announced its decision (published in Cmnd 5°4^: see Bibliography
p. 483) to extend the customer-contractor approach to all its applied research
and development, as recommended in a report by Lord Rothschild, at that
time head of the Central Policy Review Staff (see p. 46).
The Department The Department of Education and Science (see also p. 48) discharges its
of Education responsibilities for basic and applied civil science mainly through the five
and Science research councils: the Science Research Council (see p. 408), the Medica
Research Council (see p. 4x0), the Agricultural Research Council (see p. 410),
the Natural Environment Research Council (see p. 4i5)> and the Socia
Science Research Council (see p. 415). The department is also responsible
for some aspects of international scientific relations (see p. 418), and helps to
co-ordinate government policy regarding scientific and technical information.

The Advisory Board for the Research Councils advises the Secretary of State
on responsibilities for civil science with special reference to the research
council system, the support of postgraduate students and the proper balance
between national and international scientific activities, and on the allocation
of the science budget between research councils and other bodies; and pro¬
motes close liaison between the councils and users of their research. Its
membership includes the chairman or secretary of each of the five research
councils, the chairman of the University Grants Committee, senior scientists
from departments with a major interest in the work of the research councils,
and independent members drawn from the universities, industry and the
Royal Society of London. One of the independent members is appointed part-
time chairman.
The Department of the Environment is concerned with research and develop¬
ment for a whole range of functions which affect the environment (see p. 49).
The department’s research programme, which is the responsibility of the
Director General of Research, is formulated on the basis of the customer-
contractor relationship. The ‘customers’ are normally the department’s policy
directorates and the ‘contractors’ are the department’s research establish¬
ments. The department has its research requirements committees, each based
on a particular policy subject, to which thecustomer requirements for research
are formulated.
The research programme in the three main policy areas of planning and
transportation, building and construction, and environmental pollution and
resources, is reviewed by the programme review committees, under the chair¬
manship of the Director General of Research. The department receives exter¬
nal advice on its research programme from the Planning and Transport
Research Advisory Council, the Construction and Housing Research Advisory
Council and a special sub-committee of the Royal Commission on Environ¬
mental Pollution.
About half the department’s programme is carried out at the Building
Research Establishment (BRE), the Transport and Road Research Laboratory
(TRRL), and the Hydraulics Research Station (HRS). The other half is the
subject of contracts placed with a wide range of organisations, either by the
research establishments, or by the Department of the Environment, including
its Research Management Division.
The Building Research Establishment, which comprises the former Build¬
ing Research Station, Fire Research Station and Forest Products Research
Laboratory, is concerned with research into all building materials, the tech¬
niques of building design and construction, and the organisation, productivity
and economics of building work. The BRE also conducts research into all
aspects of fire and the danger it represents to life and property.
The Transport and Road Research Laboratory provides technical and
scientific advice and information to help in formulating, developing, and
implementing government policies relating to roads and transport, including
their interaction with urban and regional planning. The TRRL’s main
activities are highway engineering, traffic engineering and safety, and transport
systems. The laboratory also has an overseas unit financed by the Ministry of
Overseas Development (see pp. 53 and 418) as part of the United Kingdom
Programme of Technical Assistance to Developing Countries.
The function of the Hydraulics Research Station is to predict the perfor¬
mance of hydraulic civil engineering works and their effects upon the environ¬
ment. It is concerned with the flow of water in open channels, including the
402

hydraulics of rivers, estuaries, harbours and coasts. The work comprises
background research and specific investigation into the flow of water over
weirs and stillways, the performance of flood prevention works, diffusion and
dispersion of heat and pollutants, the silting of rivers and estuaries, the per¬
formance of sea-defence works, and the design of harbours and off-shore
structures.
The department gives grants-in-aid to a number of research organisations
which include: the Centre for Environmental Studies (see p. 175); the
Operational Research Unit of the Royal Institute of Public Administration,
and the Retail Planning Institute (information and research in retailing). The
Construction Industry Research and Information Association, the Building
Services Research and Information Association, the Timber Research and
Development Association and the Water Research Centre receive grants to
support their co-operative research and related activities. The British Rail¬
ways Board receives a grant towards railway research and the London Trans¬
port Executive one towards the cost of its programme of rapid transit research,
and the Royal Society, to meet costs it incurs as British representative on the
International Institute of Applied Systems Analysis.
The Nature Conservancy Council, which was set up under the Nature
Conservancy Council Act 1973, is funded by the Secretary of State for the
Environment who also appoints its chairman and members. The council is the
Government’s adviser on the development and implementation of policies for,
or affecting, nature conservation. It is also responsible for managing national
nature reserves, and for advising upon, and disseminating knowledge about,
nature conservation. The council may give grants to anyone (including
voluntary bodies) to carry out projects and commissions research relevant
to its duties. This is undertaken mainly by the Institute of Terrestrial Ecology,
a component body of the Natural Environment Research Council (see p. 415).
The council also carries out certain research.
The Department of Industry (see also p. 51) is responsible for the sponsor¬
ship of individual manufacturing industries including the aerospace industry,
for technical services to industry, and for industrial research and development,
including the supervision of the industrial research establishments of the
former Department of Trade and Industry, except for the Safety in Mines
Research Establishment (see p. 357). It also aids, with grants, certain autono¬
mous industrial research associations. .
In accordance with the Government’s customer-contractor principle, the
department administers a number of requirements boards to determine the
objectives and balance of the relevant research and development programmes.
They cover ship and marine technology; mechanical engineering and machine
tools; engineering materials; computers, systems and electronics; chemicals
and minerals; metrology and standards. They are responsible to the Secretary
of State for Industry and include representatives from other departments,
industry and bodies in the public sector. The chief scientist’s boards cover
other relevant branches of technology.
The Department of Prices and Consumer Protection (see p. 54) has responsi¬
bility for standards and weights and measures, for the British Standards
Institution (see p. 223) and for the Metrication Board set up in 1969 to
facilitate the transition to the metric system of weights and measures in
Britain by 1975 (see p. 463). It also operates the British Calibration Service

The Procurement Executive, Ministry of Defence, engages in research for
defence purposes at its research and development establishments and through
contracts placed with industry and universities it also undertakes certain
research for civil purposes, including meteorology (see p. 404), civil aviation
(see p. 329), medical research and space research. For defence aspects see
p. 121.
The Department of Energy (see p. 49) is responsible for the United Kingdom
Atomic Energy Authority; research in support of the exploitation of North
Sea oil and gas; research into novel sources of energy; co-ordination of energy
research within government departments; strategic oversight of the research
programmes of the coal, gas and electricity supply industries; and co-ordina¬
tion of British contributions to energy research and development programmes
sponsored by international organisations.
An Energy Technology Support Unit was set up at Harwell in 1974 to
assist the department in assessing the technological strategy options available
to Britain in energy policy and to advise on long-term research and develop¬
ment programmes.
An Offshore Energy Technology Board to advise the Secretary of State
for Energy on research and development took over from the Ship and Marine
Technology Board in May 1975 responsibility for programmes designed to
ensure the safety and efficiency of offshore operations and improve the com¬
petitive efficiency of the British offshore equipment industry.
Branches of research for which government departments are responsible
include:
The Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew (founded in 1759), together with its 400-
acre estate at Wakehurst Place, Ardingly, Sussex, is administered by the
Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food and has the largest collection
of living plants in the world. Its research departments are: the herbarium
also the largest in the world with between four and five million specimens—
concerned primarily with the classification and accurate determination of
plants; and the Jodrell Laboratory, for the study of plant anatomy and plant
physiology, cytology and genetics. There is a seed bank and seed testing unit,
a biochemistry laboratory under the Agricultural Research Council and a cell
physiology laboratory which has a transmission electron microscope for
investigating reproductive physiology and the behaviour of certain glandular
cells. A scanning electron microscope for studies of the surface structures of
plants and pollen is housed in the Jodrell Laboratory. Three museums are
concerned with public exhibitions and the care of reference collections of
economic plant products. The library, in the same building as the herbarium,
was founded in 1852; it consists of more than 100,000 botanical books, about
140,000 reprints and separately issued items and a collection of over 160,000
drawings and paintings of plants.
The Royal Botanic Garden, Edinburgh (founded in 1670), has, since 1969,
been administered by the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries for Scot¬
land. Together with the associated Logan Botanic Garden at Ardwell, near
Stranraer, and the Younger Botanic Garden at Benmore, near Dunoon, it

research into many tropical groups. The herbarium and library the finest
outside London—are used for research in taxonomy, cytology, anatomy,
mycology and other subjects. A transmission electron microscope is used for
the study of fine detail of plant structures. An exhibition hall was opened on
the occasion of the tercentenary of the garden in 1970. The Scottish National
Gallery of Modern Art is situated within the Garden.
The Post Office, for which the Department of Industry is the responsible
department, undertakes research and development on many aspects of the
science and engineering of communications, both in its own laboratories and
in close association with industry, the universities and government depart¬
ments. Its new research centre at Martlesham Heath, near Ipswich, will, on
completion, fully replace existing stations at Dollis Hill, London, and Backwell,
near Bristol.
The Department of the Environment, under its Secretary of State, is res¬
ponsible for the total strategic approach to environmental management, pro¬
tection and improvement. Other government departments have certain specific
responsibilities for pollution control (for example, the Department of Trade
is responsible for oil pollution at sea and the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries
and Food for pollution from the use of pesticides in agriculture). The Depart¬
ment of the Environment has a small Central Unit on Environmental Pollu¬
tion to co-ordinate the work of all government departments on the control
of pollution and the British contribution to international discussions on the
subject.
In 1970 an independent standing Royal Commission on Environmental
Pollution was set up to advise the Government on national and international
matters concerning the pollution of the environment; on the adequacy of
research; and on the future possibilities of danger to the environment. The
commission has published four reports (see Bibliography p. 4^3)- ^ Clean
Air Council was set up in 1956 and an Advisory Council on Noise in I970,
A National Radiological Protection Board was established under the Radio¬
logical Protection Act 1970 to provide an authoritative point of reference for
Britain on radiological protection. The board, which carries out research,
makes public and occupational health assessments and provides services, has
assumed the functions of the former Radioactive Substances Advisory
Committee, the Radiological Protection Service—hitherto provided jointly by
the Medical Research Council (MRC) and the Health Departments—and
part of the activities carried on by the central Health and Safety Branch of the
United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority (AEA). The board is financed by
Parliament through the Secretary of State for Social Services and by grants
from the AEA and MRC and by income from services.
The Ministry of Defence finances the Meteorological Office, which is respon¬
sible for research in meteorology and some aspects of geophysics, mainly for
civil purposes.
The headquarters of the Office and most of its research sections are at Brack¬
nell, Berkshire. The Ministry of Defence also makes grants for fundamental
meteorological research carried out under the auspices of the Royal Society
(see below) or in university departments.
The Procurement Executive of the Ministry of Defence undertakes research

The sessional Select Committee of the House of Commons on Science and
Technology is one of the specialist committees established to give back-bench
members the opportunity to investigate the policies and administration of the
Government and to participate in the formation of policy (see p. 37). The
members of the committee (not more than 15 in number) are nominated by
the House. The committee has power to call witnesses, generally takes evi¬
dence in public, and reports its findings to the House from time to time.
The Parliamentary and Scientific Committee, founded in 1939, provides for a
regular exchange of information between members of Parliament and scientists.
Membership is open to members of Parliament of any party in both Houses,
and also to nominated representatives of such non-profit-making scientific
and technological organisations as may be affiliated under its constitution.
Although today most research is conducted under other auspices, the learned
societies have retained their traditional function of facilitating the spread of
knowledge. The most eminent of those concerned with science in its broadest
aspects (as distinct from those societies with specialised interests and activi¬
ties) are the Royal Society, Royal.Society of Arts, Royal Institution and British
Association.
The Royal Society, or, more fully the Royal Society of London for Improving
Natural Knowledge, founded in 1660, occupies a unique place in the country’s
scientific affairs and is equivalent to national academies of sciences in other
countries. Election to it is regarded by scientists as a high honour. The Queen
is Patron. There are today three main categories of Fellowship: Royal Fellows,
including the Queen Mother and the Duke of Edinburgh; Foreign Members,
of whom there are about 80; and the main body of Fellows numbering about
800. Election to the Fellowship, which is for life, was for many years restricted
to 25 persons a year and the foreign membership to four a year but in 1965 the
former was increased to 32 with the intention of awarding some of the new
places to applied scientists in both the physical and biological sciences, and in
1975 was further increased to 40, with effect from 1976 elections. The society
is governed by a council of 21 members.
Its activities include the holding of scientific meetings; publication of
research work, mainly in the Philosophical Transactions and the Proceedings-,
the presentation of medals; the giving of endowed lectures; and the award of
research appointments and grants. Among its research appointments are the
Foulerton, Wolfson, Henry Dale and Napier Research Professorships and 12
other research professorships supported by parliamentary grant-in-aid.
Research fellowships in human nutrition supported by the J. Sainsbury
Centenary Grant were inaugurated in 1974. The highest medal awarded is the
Copley Medal, for which scientists from all countries are eligible; there are
also three Royal Medals, and the Rumford, Darwin, Buchanan, Sylvester,
Hughes, Leverhulme and Mullard Medals. There are six lectureships: the
Croonian (biology); the Bakerian (physical sciences); the Ferrier (nervous
system); the Wilkins (history of science); the Leeuwenhoek (microbiology);
the Bernal (social functions of science); and the Clifford Paterson (established
J975 f°r electrical science and technology). The society has set up committees,

some of them jointly with other bodies, to promote improvements in education
in science and to emphasise the importance of applied sciences, especially
engineering.
Although an independent private corporation, the society has always had
a special relationship with the Government, which makes grants for certain of
its activities. The President of the Society is consulted on scientific appoint¬
ments to research councils and Fellows serve on most governmental advisory
councils and committees concerned with research.
The international relations of the Royal Society are extensive. It represents
Britain in the international unions comprising the International Council of
Scientific Unions and appoints national committees for each of them. It also
plays a leading part in international scientific programmes and promotes
exchange visits of scientists with many academies throughout the world. Its
International Fellowship Scheme to foster relations with scientists of Western
European and many other countries receives financial support from the
Government and other sources.
The Royal Society of Arts (properly, the Royal Society for the Encouragement
of Arts, Manufactures and Commerce) has a character at once scientific,
artistic, technical, industrial and commercial. Since its foundation in 1754, one
of the society’s principal objects has been to promote the progress and appli¬
cation to useful ends of all departments of science. Today it fulfils this purpose
chiefly by disseminating new scientific knowledge. The society regularly holds
lectures, and publishes a monthly Journal, thus providing effective media for
the exposition and assessment by leading authorities of developments which
have a public as well as a specialist interest.
The Royal Institution was founded in 1799 as a public body for facilitating
the introduction of useful mechanical inventions and improvements, and for
teaching the application of science to everyday life. Later it undertook the
‘promotion of chemical science by experiments and lectures for improving
arts and manufactures’, and ‘the diffusion and extension of useful knowledge .
Its character, however, was largely determined by the work of Sir Humphry
Davy and Michael Faraday, who established a tradition of research. Today,
the Royal Institution has extensive research laboratories, and lectures are
given on recent developments in science and other branches of knowledge. Its
library includes many early scientific works and manuscripts.
The British Association for the Advancement of Science was founded in 1831
to promote general interest in science and its applications. One of its chief
activities is the annual meeting, attended by many young students as well as
by eminent scientists. In addition the association plans special lectures,
exhibitions and discussions (some designed for young audiences), the publica¬
tion of pamphlets, the organisation of conferences, the appointment of study
groups and liaison with the Press and with sound and television broadcasting
services The association has area committees and three lectureships for
young scientists—the Kelvin, the Darwin and the Lister lectureships, dealing
respectively with the physical, biological and sociological sciences—to en¬
courage scientists to make their activities known to wider audiences. 1 he
British Association has an organised relationship with over 150 scientific
bodies and learned societies. It has also made an important contribution to the
development of science by taking or recommending action to remove obstacles
to the discovery and application of scientific knowledge.

There are at least two bodies concerned with the relationship between science
and society; the British Society for Social Responsibility in Science, founded in
1969; and the Council for Science and Society, formed in 1973 by specialists
in the natural and social sciences, the law, and medicine to support and stimu¬
late research into the social effects of scientific and technological development.
There are numerous technical institutions and professional associations, many
of which are playing a distinguished part in promoting their own disciplines
or are interested in the education and professional well-being of their members.
The Council of Engineering Institutions, the federal body for the chartered
engineering institutions established in 1965, promotes the co-ordination of the
engineering profession. The Council of Science and Technology Institutes—
a federal body with five member institutes representing biologists, chemists,
mathematicians, metallurgists and physicists—was formed in 1969.
The MacRobert Award of £25,000 and a gold medal have been presented
annually since 1969 by the Council of Engineering Institutions on behalf of
MacRoberts Trusts, for successful technological innovations contributing to
the national prestige and prosperity of Britain. A fund was endowed in 1972
by the late Lord Rank to be used to reward outstanding contributions to
human nutrition and crop husbandry, and to opto-electronics and nearly
related phenomena.
In giving awards for technological innovation, the Queen’s Award to
Industry scheme concentrates on the potential application in industry of
outstanding achievements in advanced technology in the form of processes or
products.
Of total estimated university expenditure on scientific research in the academic
year 1973-74 (over £128-1 million), the largest government contribution (over
£93-9 million) was through the University Grants Committee (see p. 160).
Scientific research in the universities (and other institutions of higher
education) is also supported through the research councils. This support takes
two forms. First, about half the postgraduate students in science and tech-
nology in the universities and other institutions receive maintenance awards
from the research councils, through postgraduate studentships. These awards
are in some cases for periods of up to three years of training in research work
and in others for shorter periods for advanced studies. The cost of these
awards is about £11-5 million a year. Second, grants and contracts are given
to the universities and other institutions by the research councils for specified
projects, particularly in new or developing areas of research. These are worth
about £33 million a year. The ARC, MRC and SSRC maintain a number of
research units within universities. In addition the research councils provide
central facilities in their own establishments for use by university research
workers.
The other main channels of support for scientific research in the universities
are various government departments, the Royal Society, industry and the
independent foundations. The contributions from sources other than the
University Grants Committee amount to about a third of the total university
expenditure on research.
Universities in industrial centres have tended to acquire outstanding
reputations in studies relating to their local industries, and on a national scale
close relationships are fostered between the universities, industries and the
Government in numerous joint projects.

BRITAIN 1976: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
According to estimates in a survey published in 1971 (see Bibliography p. 483)
there were in 1968 just over 400,000 persons with qualifications in engineering,
technology and science in Great Britain, of whom one-half were qualified
in science and one-half in engineering. Of those economically active (350,000),
53 per cent (185,000) held engineering qualifications, 12 per cent (4,140) were
out of employment, and 35 per cent employed in manufacturing. Education
employed over 20 per cent and over the years 1959 to 1968 there was a rapid
increase in the service sectors (commerce and consultancy). Within manu¬
facturing the largest increase was in electrical and electronics industries (6 per
cent a year). Over the period 1959 t° 1968 there was a net gain of scientists
from migration and a net loss of engineers and technologists.
The Science Research Council (SRC) was established under Royal Charter in
1965 and consists of a chairman and 10-15 other members. It is supported by
grants-in-aid provided by Parliament through the Secretary of State for
Education and Science, and covers all branches of fundamental science other
than those for which the other research councils are responsible. Provision is
made for it to carry out research and development in science and engineering
through its own establishments; to encourage and support similar research by
any other person or body; to provide and operate equipment for common use
by universities, polytechnics, technical colleges and similar institutions, to
make grants for postgraduate studies; and to disseminate knowledge of science
and technology. Its establishments are the Royal Greenwich Observatory,
Herstmonceux, the Royal Observatory, Edinburgh, the Appleton Laboratory,
the Rutherford Laboratory, the Daresbury Laboratory, and the Atlas Com¬
puter Laboratory. The SRC also provides contributions to the European
Organisation for Nuclear Research (CERN), the civil science programme of
the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO) and part of the United
Kingdom’s contribution to the scientific programme of the European Space
Agency (see p. 413).
The SRC shares with its French and West German partners the control ot
the Institut Max von Laue-Paul Langevin (ILL) which operates a high flux
reactor at Grenoble. The neutron beams produced from it are used for a wide
variety of condensed matter studies in biology, chemistry, materials science
and physics.
The greater part of industrial research in Britain is undertaken in the research
organisations of the larger firms and in government research establishments.
Other main agencies are universities and technical colleges, industrial research
associations, independent institutes for sponsored research and consultant
laboratories.
The Department of Industry is responsible for five government laboratories.
Of these, the National Physical Laboratory has a primary responsibility for
the national system of measurement and for technical aspects of standards.
It also incorporates a maritime institute and carries out research into novel
uses of computers. The National Engineering Laboratory, the Warren Spring
Laboratory, and the Computer Aided Design Centre are concerned with
industrial developments in mechanical engineering, chemicals, and comput¬
ing. . , ,
The Laboratory of the Government Chemist provides analytical and
advisory services to government departments. These establishments also
undertake contract research for British industry and overseas firms.
The department also sponsors research by extra-mural contracts with

industry, the universities, and by contracts with, and grants-in-aid to, research
associations.
The Department of the Environment is responsible for the Transport and
Road Research Laboratory, the Hydraulics Research Station, and the Building
Research Establishment.
The scheme by which the Government has given financial help to firms with
similar interests to form organisations known as research associations, to carry
out industrial research co-operatively, was started in 1917. There are now 29
such associations which have links with the Department of Industry. In
addition there are four (building services; construction industry; timber; and
water) linked with the Department of the Environment, and four (Flour
Milling and Baking; Campden Food Preservation; British Food Manufactur¬
ing Industries; and British Industrial Biological Research) linked with the
Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food. Suitably specialised associations
are now available for about 50 per cent of British industry. They accounted in
1972-73 for j£i8-8 million or nearly 1-4 per cent of national research and
development expenditure. The largest are those dealing with production
engineering, ships, welding, electrical manufacturing, cotton and man-made
fibres, non-ferrous metals and scientific instruments. (See also Chapter 12.)
Government grants, related to the contributions made by the industries con¬
cerned, are now being phased out in favour of extra-mural contract support.
The Textile Research Conference serves as a focal point for the collective
interests of the various textile research associations.
Some of the public corporations which run the nationalised industries have
their own research organisations (see Chapter 13), in particular those con¬
cerned with energy, steel and transport. They also give support to organisa¬
tions concerned with research on matters of interest to them.
Expenditure on research and development carried out within or financed by
private industry in 1972-73 was about £750 million of which £268 million
came from government funds. Expenditure in individual industries, including
funds from government sources, was as follows (in £ million): aerospace 208;
electronics (including computers) 160; other electrical engineering 34;
petroleum products 14; other chemical products 122; mechanical engineering
35; motor vehicles 56; scientific instruments 20; food, drink and tobacco
25; textiles 12. Firms in science-based industries commit large private funds
to research and development in the course of business.
A number of institutes for sponsored research have been established to
extend the facilities for private research for industrial firms by studying
problems which are not within the scope of the average industrial laboratory.
In these institutes research for private firms is carried out confidentially, the
results remaining the property of the sponsor.
The Government gives substantial support to medical research by financing
the Medical Research Council, through block grants to universities distributed
through the Department of Education and Science and the University Grants
Committee, and through the research and development programme of the
Department of Health and Social Security. Certain government-financed
research for defence purposes, for example, at the Microbiological Establish¬
ment at Porton, Wiltshire, has civil applications related to medical science.
BRITAIN 1976: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Important contributions to the support of research in particular subjects
are made by industry, especially the pharmaceutical industry, and by private
charities or voluntary organisations, such as the Nuffield Foundation and the

The Medical Research Council (MRC) was established under Royal Charter
in 1920, as successor to a Medical Research Committee first appointed in I9I3'
The Council, which now consists of a chairman, deputy chairman and 14-18
other members, was granted a new Charter in 1966 (since further amended)
and is supported mainly by grant-in-aid provided by Parliament through the
Secretary of State for Education and Science.
The MRC’s principal objectives are: to advance knowledge that will im¬
prove physical and mental health; and to develop the biomedical sciences as
such, to maintain a fundamental capacity for research and to support higher
education. The council is assisted by four advisory boards: the Neurobiology
and Mental Health Board; the Cell Biology and Disorders Board; the Physio¬
logical Systems and Disorders Board; and the Tropical Medicine Research
Board. The Council is also advised by an Environmental Medicine (Research
Policy) Committee on policy for the support of research on environmental,
occupational and social medicine problems that often extends beyond the
responsibility of its advisory boards. In addition, the MRC is advised by
committees concerned with particular aspects of its work and with research
grants. The MRC’s arrangements for the support of research fall under four
main headings: investigations by members of its scientific staff, mostly work¬
ing in its own establishments; short-term ( project) grants to workers in
universities and elsewhere; long-term grants in support of specific research
programmes in university departments (‘programme grants’ and ‘research
groups’); and research training awards (fellowships and scholarships) tenable
both at home and overseas. The research undertaken ranges from basic
biological research at the molecular level and the extensive laboratory work that
forms the scientific basis of the practice of medicine to the study of patients
and relevant epidemiological and population surveys.
The MRC’s main research establishments are the National Institute for
Medical Research at Mill Hill, London, and the Clinical Research Centre at
Northwick Park, London, which forms an integral part of the new district
hospital. In addition the council has over 60 research units, which are mostly
located in university departments, medical schools and hospitals in Britain.
The MRC also undertakes work overseas and, with additional support from
the Ministry of Overseas Development (see p. 418), maintains laboratories in
The Gambia and a unit in Jamaica.
Agricultural research is carried out by the Agricultural Research Council, the
government agricultural departments and by private industry Fisheries re¬
search is carried out by the government fisheries departments, the White Fis
Authority, the Natural Environment Research Council, the Marine Biological
Association, the Scottish Marine Biological Association and the Freshwater
Biological Association. Expenditure on research and development by t e
Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food was estimated to be £21 million
in 1974-75 and £29-2 million in 1975-76-
The Agricultural Research Council (ARC), established in 1931 under Royal
Charter (since amended), consists of a chairman and 18-21 other members, it
is supported by grant-in-aid provided by Parliament through the Secretary o
State for Education and Science.

The ARC is responsible for 14 independent state-aided agricultural research
institutes and also has eight institutes under its direct control and 10 units
which it has established under distinguished scientists associated with uni¬
versities. Also there are eight independent institutes in Scotland financed by
the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries for Scotland with advice from
the ARC on their scientific programmes, staffing and equipment.
The ARC also makes special research grants to support promising new lines
of work in university departments. It makes a limited number of postgraduate
training awards.
The Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food does both applied and basic
research. At its Central Veterinary Laboratory at Weybridge, research and
laboratory investigations are carried out into the causes, pathology, epi-
zootiology and control of diseases of farm livestock, including poultry; the
diagnosis of animal and poultry diseases (other than foot-and-mouth disease);
and the making and supplying of certain biological products. The laboratory
is, by appointment of the World Health Organisation (WHO), the third
international laboratory for biological standards. The Veterinary Laboratory
at Lasswade, Midlothian, and the Cattle Breeding Centre, Reading, Berkshire,
are departments of the Central Veterinary Laboratory. The Plant Pathology
Laboratory at Harpenden, Herts., is concerned with crop planting material,
pest and disease diagnosis, intelligence and crop loss appraisal, the clearance
of pesticides for safety, including the monitoring of residues in crop products
and official approval for biological efficiency. The Pest Infestation Control
Laboratory at Slough, Berkshire (with stations at Tolworth and Worplesdon,
Surrey), engages in research work on insects, mites and fungi affecting food
storage and on harmful mammals and birds. It provides the scientific basis for
advisory work on their detection and control and acts as an instruction and
liaison centre for home and some overseas work, and is concerned with the
clearance of pesticides for safety.
With the guidance of the Chief Scientific Adviser (Food), the Food Science
Division provides advice on scientific and technical aspects of food. Particular
attention is paid to the safety, quality and nutritive value of food, including
consideration of food additives and contaminants. Close liaison is maintained
with the Department of Health and Social Security, which has responsibilities
for public health, and with other government departments. The division has
facilities for experimental work in Norwich and London concerned with
storage of certain foods, interaction of food additives and food components,
heavy metal contamination and studies arising from food legislation and
safety. There is an increasing demand for advice in connection with inter¬
national work, including the European Community food legislation, and also
regarding the new government policies for the support of research at the four
food research associations and elsewhere.
In Scotland research work at East Craigs, Edinburgh, by the Agricultural
Scientific Services of the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries is mainly
concerned with the problems of cultivar taxonomy, seed testing, healthy seed
potato production, plant pathology, and the ecology of birds, mammals and
insects harmful to agriculture and stored products. In Northern Ireland the
Ministry of Agriculture is responsible for promotion of research in food pro¬
duced by agriculture and in veterinary sciences with the aim of improving
efficiency of production, marketability of foods and the health of plants and
animals. The ministry is also responsible for work on forest science, ecology of
freshwater and marine fish as well as on the biology of freshwater resources.

The ARC, the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food and the
Department of Agriculture and Fisheries for Scotland have set up a Joint
Consultative Organisation to advise them on the programmes and priorities
for government-financed research and development in food and agriculture.
The organisation consists of five boards—three commodity boards, covering
respectively animals, arable crops and forage, and horticulture; and two special
subject boards for food science and technology, and engineering and buildings.
The Chief Scientist, Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, is responsible
for scientific advice to the ministry on the broad range of policy matters
with which it deals and also for framing, commissioning and reviewing the
ministry’s research and development programmes and in determining the
order of priorities.
The Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food maintains five laboratories
for marine fisheries and shellfish research, one for salmon and freshwater
fisheries research, one concerned with landing and preservation of the fish
catch and with studies of fish as food and one specialising in research into fish
diseases. There are four sea-going research ships and several smaller vessels
for inshore and estuarine work. The Department of Agriculture and Fisheries
for Scotland maintains a marine research laboratory and six research ships at
Aberdeen, and a freshwater fisheries research laboratory at Pitlochry.
A Fisheries Research and Development Board representative of govern¬
ment departments and the industry advises fisheries ministers on research
programmes, objectives and priorities. A Controller of Fisheries Research and
Development, responsible jointly to the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and
Food and the Secretary of State for Scotland, co-ordinates the programmes of
the research laboratories.
The Forestry Commission undertakes experimental work relating to silvi¬
cultural and allied problems (see p. 305). By means of grants, it also aids forest
research work undertaken by various universities and other institutions,
including the Commonwealth Forestry Institute, Oxford.
In 1974 the Commission’s research establishments were reorganised. All
research and development activities were amalgamated within a research and
development division; and the study of hardwood trees was given more
emphasis, with the concentration of work on lowland forests, amenity and
landscape at Alice Holt Lodge near Farnham, Surrey, and the replacement of
the Soils Research Branch by two Site Studies Branches.
The Secretary of State for Energy is responsible, under the Atomic Energy
Act 1946, for promoting and controlling the development of nuclear energy
and ensuring that the proper degrees of importance are attached to its various
applications. The United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority (UKAEA), set
up under the Atomic Energy Authority Act 1954, is the main body carrying
out relevant research and development. Under an Act of 1971, the UKAEA s
fuel cycle and radiochemical manufacturing activities were given full com¬
mercial form by the establishment of two statutory companies: British Nuclear
Fuels Ltd., Risley (see p. 273) and, the Radiochemical Centre Ltd., Amersham,
Bucks.; under an Act of 1973 the Atomic Weapons Research Establishment
was transferred to the Ministry of Defence.
As an essential part of the Government’s nuclear power programme, the
UKAEA carries out research and develops new types of nuclear reactors for
electricity generation on a commercial scale and for this purpose it builds and

operates experimental and prototype reactors (see p. 273). The Science and
Technology Act 1965 enables the Authority to carry out contract research
and development outside nuclear energy and these activities now yield an
income of some £6 million a year. Apart from a London Office, the UKAEA’s
establishments are: the Research Group headquarters and Atomic Energy
Research Establishment (AERE) at Harwell and the Culham Laboratory, both
in Oxfordshire, the Reactor Group Headquarters and Risley Engineering and
Materials Laboratory at Risley, near Warrington, and Safety and Reliability
Directorate at Culcheth, the Reactor b uel Element Laboratories at Spring-
fields, Lancs., the Reactor Development Laboratory at Windscale, Cumbria,
the Dounreay Experimental Reactor establishment in Highland and the
Atomic Energy Establishment at Winfrith in Dorset.
Co-operation in nuclear energy between Britain and other countries takes
place within the framework of intergovernmental agreements, membership of
bodies such as the International Atomic Energy Agency and the Nuclear
Energy Agency of OECD, through direct links on the research side between
the UKAEA and equivalent organisations overseas.
Britain became a full member of the European Atomic Energy Community
(Euratom) on 1st January 1973 (see p. 79) under the Treaty of Accession and
under its terms agreed to accept the Treaty of Rome, signed in 1957, under
which Euratom was set up, and rules made under it. Britain is taking part in
the four-year Euratom research and training programme agreed in February
x973 and costing over £70 million. The AEA co-operates in the Community’s
five-year programme of research into thermonuclear fusion.
The provision of facilities for research in high energy physics is the function
of the Science Research Council (SRC) (see p. 408). The SRC establishments
concerned are the Rutherford Laboratory, Chilton, with a 7 GeV (thousand
million electron volt) proton synchrotron (particle accelerator), and the Dares-
bury Laboratory, Warrington, with a 5 GeV electron synchrotron. Experiments
at higher energies are carried out at the European Organisation for Nuclear
Research (CERN) to which Britain contributes through the SRC.
Government responsibility for space activities is undertaken by the Secretary
of State for Education and Science, the Secretary of State for Defence and the
Secretary of State for Industry, according to the nature of the project, while the
Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs is concerned with
international aspects. Total expenditure on space activities in 1973—74 was
about £37 million.
The United Kingdom with other European Governments has established
a European Space Agency (ESA), agreement for which was reached in April
I975> when a British Director-General was appointed. The other member
countries are Belgium, Denmark, France, Federal Republic of Germany, Italy,
Netherlands, Spain, Sweden and Switzerland; the Irish Republic, Austria and
Norway have observer status. This new organisation has superseded the
European Space Vehicle Launcher Development Organisation (ELDO) and
European Space Research Organisation (ESRO) of which the United King¬
dom was also a founder member. It has taken over the existing science pro¬
gramme, four applications satellites and Spacelab—a manned laboratory—in
all of which Britain is actively participating. Among its main responsibilities
will be the fostering of a single co-ordinated European space programme with
a corresponding decrease in purely national activity.

Scientific research, notably in astronomy and geophysics, using space
techniques, is supported by the SRC, which is responsible to the Secretary of
State for Education and Science. Opportunities are provided for research
workers, particularly in universities, to carry out experiments in British
satellites and sounding rockets in the European Space Agency’s scientific
satellite programme and in various collaborative sounding rocket programmes
through bilateral and multilateral arrangements with other countries, includ¬
ing the Commonwealth collaborative programme. Britain is co-operating with
the United States in a programme which includes American launching of the
British Ariel series of scientific satellites, the incorporation of British experi¬
ments in American satellites and the analyses of lunar surface samples. The
Appleton Laboratory provides support and services for the universities’ space-
based experiments and also operates the United States National Aeronautics
and Space Administration (NASA) Satellite Tracking and Data Acquisition
Network (STADAN) station at Winkfield. Optical tracking of satellites is
undertaken by many individual observers in Britain; the prediction and co¬
ordination centre is at the Appleton Laboratory, which is also the home of one
of the three World Data Centres for space research. The Space Department of
the Royal Aircraft Establishment at Farnborough also undertakes long-term
research and development intended to assist industry.
The Royal Society represents Britain in non-governmental international
scientific groups such as the Committee on Space Research (COSPAR) of the
International Council of Scientific Unions (ICSU). ,
Responsibility for industrial sponsorship of the space industry for Britain s
space technology programme and for leading the British delegation to the
European Space Agency rests with the Department of Industry. The tech¬
nology programme, now known as the Domestic Space Technology Pro¬
gramme (DSTP) is intended to develop Britain’s industrial capability in
space applications systems. A series of wholly British technology proving
satellites, which culminated in the launching of Miranda in March 1974, has
been terminated following the decision to set up ESA. Work undertaken
within the DSTP is managed by the Procurement Executive of the Ministry
of Defence on behalf of the Department of Industry.
The Department of Industry, through the Post Office, is responsible for
the use of satellites for civil communications purposes and undertakes research
work in connection with communications systems using satellites. Britain and
88 other countries participate in the permanent International Telecommunica¬
tions Satellite Organisation (INTELSAT) which started operating early in
1973 in place of the consortium formed in 1964. Britain is the second largest
shareholder and is represented on the organisation’s board of governors by the
Post Office. The Post Office ground stations at Goonhilly in Cornwall are
among the most successful in the world; British firms have built such stations
overseas, and are currently fulfilling further export orders as members of
international consortia.
Optical astronomy is carried out in university departments and in the Royal
Greenwich Observatory and the Royal Observatory, Edinburgh, under the
Science Research Council (SRC). The 98-in (245 cm) Isaac Newton Telescope
at the Royal Greenwich Observatory was commissioned in 1967 and is
operated as a national facility. A 150-in (375 cm) telescope has been inaugura¬
ted at Siding Spring Mountain in Australia as a joint Anglo-Austrahan
project, while a British 48-in (120 cm) Schmidt Telescope is working on the
same site. Optical telescopes operated by the South African Astronomical

Observatory, to which the SRC contributes, are available for use by British
astronomers.
Cambridge and Manchester Universities are the main centres for research
in radio astronomy with substantial support from SRC. The fully steerable
25°-ft (76’2 nr) telescope at Jodrell Bank (University of Manchester) has been
modernised. The Cambridge University group at Lord’s Bridge has developed
and made substantial use of the aperture synthesis technique; two telescopes
with i-6i km (1 mile) and 0'8 km (o'5 mile) arrays have been complemented
by a 5 km (3-1 miles) array.
The Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) was established by
Royal Charter in 1965 with responsibility to encourage, plan and execute
research in sciences, physical and biological, relating to man’s natural environ¬
ment and its resources. Such investigations seek to provide a better under¬
standing not only of the nature and processes of the environment in which we
live and on whose resources we depend, but also of their influence on man’s
activities and, of growing importance today, of man’s influence on them.
These researches are broadly grouped and defined as: the Solid Earth—its
physical properties and mineral resources; Seas and Oceans—their behaviour
and living and mineral resources; Inland Waters—their behaviour and living
resources, Terrestrial Environments—wild-life communities and their re¬
sources; Atmosphere—its structure and interactions; and interdisciplinary
studies of the physical and biological properties of the Antarctic environment.
The council carries out research and training through its own institutes,
grant-aided institutes, and by grants, fellowships, and other postgraduate awards
to universities and other institutes of higher education.
The council’s research institutes are: the British Antarctic Survey, the
Culture Centre for Algae and Protozoa, the Experimental Cartography Unit,
the Institute of Geological Sciences, the Institute of Hydrology, the Institute
of Marine Biochemistry, the Institute for Marine Environmental Research,
the Institute of Oceanographic Sciences, the Institute of Terrestrial Ecology,’
and the Unit of Invertebrate Virology. The council also maintains a research
vessel base to service and operate its research vessels.
Research institutes aided by council grants are: the Freshwater Biological
Association, the Marine Biological Association of the United Kingdom, the
Scottish Marine Biological Association, the Unit of Marine Invertebrate
Biology, the Unit of Comparative Plant Ecology, and other smaller units
attached to universities.
The statutory council consists of a chairman and up to 18 members. The
council is financed by a grant-in-aid from Parliament, received through the
Department of Education and Science, and by commissioned research under
the customer-contractor principle (see p. 400).
One of the requirements boards administered by the Department of Industry
(see p. 402), the Ship and Marine Technology Requirements Board, identifies
customer requirements for research and development in exploiting marine
resources other than oil and gas, now the responsibility of the Offshore Energy
Technology Board (see p. 403). J
Several government departments have funds allocated for social research
related to their responsibilities, including the Home Office, which has a large
research unit (see p. 112) carrying out a wide variety of sociological studies.

government departments and from time to time also carries out studies in
collaboration with universities and other independent research organisations.
The Social Science Research Council (SSRC) was established under Royal
Charter in 1965 to encourage, support and carry out research in, and to
disseminate knowledge about, the social sciences. The Council consists of a
chairman and 13-19 other members, and is supported by grant-in-aid provided
by Parliament through the Secretary of State for Education and Science. It
provides grants for research projects at universities and other institutions, and
makes training awards to postgraduate students. It has also set up five
research units: the Industrial Relations Unit, the Cambridge Population Unit,
the Ethnic Relations Unit, and the Survey Unit, and the Social-legal Studies
Centre. The SSRC’s fields of interest include economics; political science;
psychology; social anthropology; social and economic statistics, sociology
and social administration; social science and government; education; manage¬
ment and industrial relations; human geography; linguistics; planning and
various aspects of a wide range of other disciplines.
Zoological research is among the activities of the world-famous Zoological
Gardens, extending over 34 acres in Regent’s Park, London, which were
opened by the Zoological Society of London in 1828. A natural zoo of 500
acres was opened in 1931 Whipsnade, in Bedfordshire, by the Society.
Among other well-known zoos are those at Edinburgh, Bristol, Chester,
Dudley, Chessington, Surrey, and Jersey (a small collection of some of the
rarest animals in the world). There are also several ‘safari parks’ containing
reservations of wild animals through which the public can pass in closed
motor cars.

RESEARCH
The British Museum (Natural History) is the principal centre in the Common¬
wealth for the general study of natural history, particularly for research into
classification (taxonomy); it has extensive collections of extant and fossil
animals and plants and of minerals, rocks and meteorites. The Science
Museum illustrates the development of pure and applied science in all
countries, but chiefly in Britain, which has always held a leading place in
engineering, agriculture, navigation, mining, aeronautics, and in the develop¬
ment of industrial machinery and processes. The geology of Britain is probably
known in more exact detail than that of any other country in the world, and
the Geological Survey has an outstanding collection of exhibits in its Geological
Museum. These three museums are in South Kensington, London. Other
important collections are those of the Museum of Science and Industry, in
Birmingham, and the Museum of the History of Science, at Oxford.
The dissemination of the results of research to other research workers and
to ultimate users has become a problem of some magnitude as the volume of
information has grown. The traditional method of scientific publication, in
which results are written up into papers and published in journals, is still
the main means of communication among scientists. The leading learned
societies have for long been important agencies for communicating scientific
information.
Information A description of general library services which also cater for scientific needs is
Services given on p. 432. Two constituents of the British Library (see p. 432) are
concerned with science and technology—the Lending Division, and the
Science Reference Library. .
The Lending Division collects for loan purposes all literature which is

likely to be of interest to the practising scientist and technologist, covering all
branches of science and technology (including agriculture and medicine) and
the social sciences.
The Science Reference Library is divided between the Holborn Division,
formerly the Patent Office Library, and the Bayswater Branch which has
substantial collections, especially in the life sciences and scientific literature
written in Slavonic and oriental languages.
The rehousing in a new London headquarters of the world’s largest library
devoted to the social sciences—the British Library of Political and Economic
Science, part of the London School of Economics—is planned for completion
by the end of the present decade.
Aslib, representing special libraries and information units in industry,
government departments, universities, colleges and other institutions, carries
out research into the collection, utilisation and dissemination of information,
provides consultancy and advisory services and training courses and offers
members an inquiry and reference service covering all subjects.
The Department of Industry and the AEA devote considerable sums to
advisory and information services. The former has nine regional offices which
make contacts with local industries to promote greater use of existing scientific
and technical knowledge. Its Technology Reports Centre is a national clearing
house for unpublished technical reports made available by various bodies in
Britain and overseas. The industrial research associations circulate research
reports and provide information services to members. Besides information
services provided by its various groups, which include the Ceramics Centre
and the Non-destructive Testing Centre at Harwell, the AEA has an informa¬
tion centre at its London headquarters, and a network of regional advisers on
the use of radioisotopes.
In agriculture, the Commonwealth Agricultural Institutes and Bureaux (see
p. 418) provide abstracts and an information service in various branches of
agricultural science. The ARC publishes an Index of Agricultural Research in
Progress, and gives an account of current developments in its annual reports.
The advisory services of the agricultural departments bring research results
directly to the farmer.
Medical research results are communicated mainly through journals and
periodicals; but the MRC issues special reports and includes special articles
in its annual reports.
The National Research Development Corporation (NRDC) is an independent
public corporation supported as necessary by government loans through the
Department of Industry. Set up under the Development of Inventions Act
1948 its borrowing power for government advances is £50 million. Outstanding
advances total £20 million but the corporation is currently funding its annual
investment in research and development from its income from licences and
levies.
The NRDC’s functions are to promote the manufacture, under NRDC
licence, by industry of new products and processes invented in government
laboratories, universities and elsewhere, advancing money where necessary to
bring them to a commercially viable stage, and to speed up technological
advance by investing money with British industrial firms, on a joint venture
basis, for the development of their own inventions and projects.
Projects so far sponsored include the Cephalosporin C antibiotic, hovercraft,
computers, advanced types of electric motor, diving and other oceanological
equipment, insecticides, micro-electronics and plastics.

Britain is represented on the Scientific and Technical Research Committee
(CREST) of the European Community set up in 1974, the object of which
is to co-ordinate national policies on these matters and to implement joint
projects of interest to the Community. Other intergovernmental organisations
involved in scientific co-operation with which Britain is concerned include:
European Co-operation in Science and Technology (COST); specialised
agencies of the United Nations such as the United Nations Educational,
Scientific and Cultural Organisation (UNESCO), the World Health Organisa¬
tion (WHO), the Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO), the International
Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA); the Nuclear Energy Agency (NEA) and
the International Energy Agency (IEA) of the Organisation for Economic
Co-operation and Development (OECD); the European Organisation for
Nuclear Research (CERN); the European Space Agency (ESA); the Euro¬
pean Molecular Biology Conference (EMBC); the European Molecular
Biology Laboratory (EMBL); and the International Agency for Research on
Cancer (IARC). Among non-governmental organisations, the five research
councils, the Royal Society and the British Academy became founding mem¬
bers of the European Science Foundation (ESF) set up in November 1974.
In nuclear energy Britain also co-operates within the framework of interna¬
tional agreements; through direct links between the AEA and its counterparts;
and through joint companies in, for example, nuclear fuel and radioisotope
manufacture. Britain is also represented on the Committee for Scientific and
Technological policy of the OECD. In areas of non-governmental collaboration
Britain’s main representative is the Royal Society.
More generally, there are scientific counsellors in the British Embassies
or High Commissions in Canada, France, the Federal Republic of Germany,
Japan, the United States, and the Soviet Union who among other things
promote scientific contacts between Britain and the countries to which they
are accredited.
The Ministry of Overseas Development promotes scientific activities in the
interests of developing countries. These include research covering a wide
range of disciplines, specialist advice from Britain, advisory visits, conferences
for exchange of information, training scientists from overseas in universities
and research institutions in Britain, recruiting scientific staff from Britain, and
providing support for existing research services and research projects overseas.
Equipment is sometimes provided for research purposes and to encourage
scientific training. There are three organisations forming part of the ministry,
which are wholly engaged on scientific work to assist developing countries.
They are the Tropical Products Institute, which specialises in the post¬
harvest aspects of agricultural, fish and animal products; the Centre for
Overseas Pest Research, which is concerned with the development and
application of pest control techniques relevant to tropical agriculture; and
the Land Resources Division, which is concerned with all aspects of land
resource appraisal. The ministry also supports the International Agricultural
Research Centres under the aegis of the Consultative Group for International
Agricultural Research. The ministry provides over £12 million a year for
scientific activities including research for the benefit of developing countries.
The Commonwealth Agricultural Bureaux, financed by contributions from
the governments of 28 Commonwealth countries and that of the Irish
Republic comprise four institutes and ten bureaux, all of which except one
institute are in Britain and each of which is concerned with a particular branch
PROMOTION OF THE SCIENCES 419
of agricultural science. They act as clearing houses for the interchange of
information of value to research workers in agricultural science throughout
the Commonwealth and increasingly throughout the world. Some 18 abstract
journals, one primary journal and an index are published periodically and
have a combined annual circulation of about 30,000 copies. The institutes and
bureaux also issue monographs on their own particular subjects and deal with
inquiries received from research workers in all parts of the Commonwealth.
Three of the institutes undertake taxonomic services for all countries of the
Commonwealth and many countries outside it.
Commonwealth
Science
Council
The British
Council
The Commonwealth Science Council (CSC) was established in 1975 as
successor to the Commonwealth Scientific Committee formed in 1958.
It consists, like the committee, of administrators and scientists nominated by
the Governments of Commonwealth member countries and has been brought
into close association with the Commonwealth Secretariat. The new council
will concentrate on the organisation of collaborative projects in science and
technology to be undertaken by member countries. An executive committee
of members from various geographical groups which make up membership
of CSC will review the progress of the programme of its activities between the
organisation s plenary meetings which take place every two years.
The principal aims of the British Council (see p. 165) in the sciences (including
agriculture, medicine and technology) are to foster co-operation between
British scientists and scientists of other countries, to promote among overseas
specialists a better understanding and knowledge of Britain and its scientific
achievements, and, in the developing countries, to assist in curriculum reform
at school level and in the training of teachers of science and mathematics.
Overseas, 60 staff with science or science teaching qualifications assist in
scientific and educational development and in scientific collaboration. Empha¬
sis is placed on facilitating the interchange of scientists and teachers and on the
provision of library and information services related to advances in science and
science education in Britain. Overseas tours are arranged for British specialists
to advise, run courses or discuss matters of common interest, and scientists
are recruited or seconded to posts in overseas universities, teacher-training
colleges, education authorities, schools or curriculum reform centres. The
council invites senior overseas specialists to Britain, and makes awards to
postgraduate students; it also administers the programmes of a large number
of senior specialists and students who travel to Britain under the auspices of
the UN specialised agencies, or under various bilateral technical assistance
schemes, or as private individuals. The council is responsible for administer-
ing grants awarded under the Academic Interchange with Europe Scheme,
the European Academic Links Scheme, the Younger Research Workers’
Interchange Scheme and the Commonwealth University Interchange Scheme.
In Britain, advisory and information facilities are provided by specialist
departments (and libraries) for education, medicine and science including
science education. The council publishes Higher Education in the United
Kingdom, A Survey of Academic Links and Educational Broadcasting Inter¬
national. Other publications include British Medical Bulletin, British Medicine,
a monthly guide to current literature; selected and annotated lists, such as
British Medical Periodicals and British Medical Books for Bostgraduates', Science
Education Newsletter, which lists facilities for education and training in Britain;
British Scientific Documentation Services, which gives details of 99 selected
services; and Scholarships Abroad, which lists awards available to British post¬
graduate students wishing to study overseas.

Arts Councils
The Arts
The Government is concerned with the preservation of the country’s cultural
heritage, the promotion of education in the arts, the dissemination of the arts to
a wider public and the encouragement of high standards in the performing
and creative arts. In Great Britain ministerial responsibility for the arts is
borne by a Parliamentary Under Secretary at the Department of Education
and Science; the Secretaries of State for Wales and Scotland are also concerned
with cultural matters in Wales and Scotland.
Estimated government expenditure on the arts in Great Britain is ^5I-5
million in 1975-76. Direct allocations include ^26-1 million for the Arts
Council of Great Britain and about £16-9 million for museums and galleries.
The Government also finances the British Library (see p. 432), the National
Library of Scotland and the National Library of Wales; in addition it is
responsible through the Department of the Environment, Scottish and
Welsh Offices for the upkeep of ancient monuments and historic buildings and
makes grants towards the maintenance of historic buildings in private hands.
The main educational functions concerning the arts are carried out through
the education departments. They are concerned, in partnership with local
education authorities and voluntary bodies, with art education in schools,
colleges of further education, evening institutes and community centres, and
with the public library service.
Most government support for the creative arts takes the form of grants to
independent agencies. The most important of these is the Arts Council of
Great Britain, established by Royal Charter in 1946, whose main objects are
to develop and improve the knowledge, understanding and practice of the arts,
to increase their accessibility to the public, and to advise and co-operate with
government departments, local authorities and other organisations. The
council promotes music and drama through grants to professional orchestras
and opera, dance and theatre companies, and arranges art exhibitions in
London and the regions. Tours by opera, dance and theatre companies are
organised by the council. A limited amount of assistance is given to individual
artists, including painters, sculptors, photographers, writers and composers,
for particular projects; and the construction of new buildings or improvements
to existing theatres, concert halls and other arts buildings is encouraged by
grants provided under the council’s 'Housing the Arts scheme. The council
also sponsors films on art.
Members of the council are appointed by the minister responsible for the
arts. Advised by panels responsible for different aspects of the arts, the council
itself allocates grants to the main artistic bodies in England, but a growing
proportion of its funds is channelled to regional arts associations (see p. 421)
which allocate funds independently. Organisations in Scotland and Wales
receive their grants from the Scottish and Welsh Arts Councils; these are
committees of the Arts Council of Great Britain which allocates to them a part
of its funds.
In Northern Ireland there is an independent Arts Council with similar aims
and functions to that of Great Britain. It receives an annual grant from the
Northern Ireland Department of Education.

The Government promotes knowledge of English literature and culture over¬
seas mainly through the British Council (see footnote, p. 165), which supports
some 177 libraries of books, periodicals, and records in over 75 countries. The
British Council also sponsors overseas tours by leading British actors, pro¬
ducers, theatre companies, musicians, orchestras and opera and ballet com¬
panies; it promotes exhibitions and lectures overseas on the fine arts in
Britain and organises British participation in international exhibitions; and it
distributes overseas a wide range of specialised films, many of them on the arts.
A major contribution to the arts (particularly music and drama) is made by the
British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) and, to a lesser extent, by the
independent television programme companies and the Independent Broad¬
casting Authority (IBA). The BBC spends some ^3 million each year in copy-
right payments to authors and composers, and has orchestras employing about
a third of the country s full-time professional musicians. Each week it broad¬
casts nearly 100 hours of serious music—both live and recorded—on its Radio
3 channel. It regularly commissions new music, particularly by British com¬
posers, and sponsors concerts, competitions and festivals. Both the BBC and
IBA broadcast a wide range of new drama together with adaptations of novels
and stage plays; they also screen a variety of feature films including selections
of the best British and overseas productions.
Independent television companies make grants for the promotion of the arts
in their regions, particularly to regional arts associations, and the IBA trans¬
mits general magazine programmes on the arts.
Local authorities support the arts in many ways. In addition to their responsi¬
bilities for education (including specialised art education) and the public
library service, many provide and maintain local museums and art galleries. In
Great Britain the authorities have power to incur expenditure on entertain¬
ment in all its forms (including cultural activities). Many authorities make
contributions towards the expenses of professional symphony orchestras and
local theatre companies. Grants are often made towards the capital cost of
new arts buildings, especially theatres; the Greater London Council, for
example, is making a substantial contribution towards the cost of the new
National Theatre.
Valuable support for the arts comes from many voluntary sources including
charitable trusts and foundations, and supporters’ organisations of the major
national institutions. Industrial and commercial concerns provide a certain
amount of patronage, sometimes taking the form of grants to regional arts
associations, local arts festivals and orchestras; some companies sponsor series
of concerts and other cultural events.
The Government encourages regional co-operation in arts patronage through
regional arts associations whose aim it is to ensure that the whole range of the
arts is more widely available to people throughout their areas. There are 15 of
these covering most of England and Wales and they channel financial assistance
to local arts organisations and offer an advisory and promotional service for all
sorts of local arts activities. They are financed by a combination of local
authority, Arts Council and private funds; local authorities and a wide range
of other interests are represented on the associations’ committees.
Similar examples of co-operative patronage are the societies formed to
present some of the many arts festivals in Britain. The outstanding example is

the Edinburgh Festival Society, but other festivals organised on a similar
basis include those held in the City of London, Brighton, King s Lynn, IN orwich
and York.
Arts centres also provide opportunities for enjoyment and participation in the
arts. There are several hundred arts centres and the number is increasing. The
centres are supported mainly by regional arts associations and local authorities
with some help from the Arts Council and other organisations. They may be
small centres for amateur activities or they may offer a professional programme.
A number of theatres and art galleries also provide a focal point for the com¬
munity by offering facilities for other arts.
Britain is one of the world’s major centres of theatrical activity. In London
during the summer season, theatres are packed with foreign visitors, while in
the provinces there is enthusiastic support for the work of local repertory
companies. Less formal are the ‘fringe’ theatre groups particularly in London,
which present short plays often in locations other than theatres. Some of the
groups are itinerant while others use regular locations.
Support for much of the development of British drama comes from growing
government assistance provided through the Arts Councils of Great Britain
and Northern Ireland which grant subsidies to drama companies registered
as charities (that is, are non-profit-distributing), provided that such companies
have given evidence of serious aims and of consistently high standards of
practical competence. The Arts Council assists new drama by offering guaran¬
tees to managements giving the first professional production of selected new
plays; and promising authors may be awarded bursaries. Schemes are also in
operation to tram stage designers, directors, technicians and those wishing to
take up theatre administration.
There are over 220 theatres in professional use in Britain that can accommo¬
date more than 200 persons. Some are owned or rented by non-profit-distribut¬
ing companies, the majority of which are receiving Arts Council subsidies while
the remainder are operated commercially or are owned by local authorities.
The centre of theatrical activity is in London where there are some 48
principal theatres in or near the West End and another 8 in the suburbs.
Most of the theatres are let to producing managements on a commercial basis
but four are occupied by important subsidised companies, including the
National Theatre and Royal Shakespeare companies. The former, which is due
to move into its new building on the South Bank during 197^’ stages classical
and modern plays from all countries; the latter presents Shakespearean plays
in Stratford-upon-Avon and a mixed repertoire in London.
Outside London there are a number of theatres which accommodate pre-
and post-West End tours of the major London productions and performances
by companies specially formed for touring. The number of these theatres has
been declining and several have now been purchased by local authorities.
Many non-repertory theatres outside London present all kinds of drama and
many also put on variety shows and other entertainments. There has, however,
been a growth in the activities of some 60 repertory companies, which receive
financial support from the Arts Council and the local authorities. The reper¬
tory companies employ many leading producers, designers and actors, and
standards are high. Some companies have the use of their own theatres, while
others rent from local authorities. Some 24 new repertory theatres have been
built since 1958.

All plays produced in Great Britain are subject to the provisions of the
Theatres Act 1968. There is no censorship, but the Act makes it a criminal
offence to present or direct an obscene performance of a play in public or in
private (including theatre clubs), an obscene performance being defined as
one which tends to ‘deprave and corrupt persons who are likely ... to attend
it. Provision is made in the Act for a defence against a charge of obscenity on
the grounds that the performance is for the public good in the interests of,
for example, drama, opera or literature.
There are several thousands of amateur dramatic societies in Britain; they are
encouraged by local education authorities, by other public bodies, and by four
special organisations—the British Theatre Association, the National Drama
Conference, the Scottish Community Drama Association and the Association
of Ulster Drama Festivals. Most universities have active amateur drama clubs
and societies; an International Festival of University Theatre is held annually.
Training for the theatre is provided mainly in drama schools. Among the most
important are the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art, the Central School of
Speech and Drama, the London Academy of Music and Dramatic Art, and
the Guildhall School of Music and Drama, all of which are in London; and the
Old Vic School in Bristol. In Scotland there is the Royal Scottish Academy of
Music and Drama in Glasgow. Seven universities offer major courses in
drama.
Theatre for young people has increased in importance in the past 15 years
and annual audience attendances are estimated at about £3 million. In 1970
the Young Vic was opened as a theatre for young people and the National
Youth Theatre has a permanent home in London. There are some ten specialist
companies, including the Unicorn Theatre for Young People, Theatre Centre
and the Polka Company, some of which are supported by the Arts Council. In
the provinces about 20 repertory companies provide programmes and engage
in other types of theatre activity for young people. In Northern Ireland a
company called Interplay Theatre, which is sponsored and administered by
the Arts Council of Northern Ireland, works mainly in schools.
In addition it is estimated that there are some 200 amateur youth theatres
in Britain, most of which are supported by local authorities. Many schools and
youth clubs put on plays and provide some education in drama. The London
education service provides special drama centres for young people.
Music in all its forms plays an important role in British cultural life. ‘Pop’
music, folk music, jazz, light music and brass bands all maintain substantial
followings while the widespread interest in classical music is reflected in the
large audiences at orchestral concerts and at performances of opera, ballet and
chamber music.
Through the Arts Council of Great Britain, the Government encourages
interest in the various forms of classical music and also jazz. The council
makes grants to a number of orchestras, soloists, opera and ballet companies,
music societies and festivals. It also provides bursaries and commissions for
British composers, musicians, designers and choreographers.
In Britain many libraries have collections of records and musical scores
which are available on loan to the public. The City of Westminster houses the
Central Music Library which lends to other libraries and to individuals.

Another well-known music collection is the Henry Watson Music Library at
the Manchester Central Library.
Seasons of orchestral concerts are promoted every year in many of the large
towns and cities of Britain. In London the principal concert halls are the
Royal Festival Hall on the south bank of the Thames, adjacent to which are
the Queen Elizabeth Hall and the Purcell Room which accommodate smaller-
scale performances; the Royal Albert Hall, Kensington, where the annual
summer season of Promenade Concerts is given; and the Wigmore Hall, an
important recital centre.
The leading British symphony orchestras are the London Philharmonic, the |
London Symphony, the Royal Philharmonic, the BBC Symphony, the New |
Philharmonia, the Royal Liverpool Philharmonic, the Halle (Manchester),
the City of Birmingham Symphony, the Bournemouth Symphony and the
Scottish National orchestras. The BBC runs a number of orchestras pro¬
viding broadcast concerts which are often open to the public. There are also
specialised string and chamber orchestras such as the English Chamber
Orchestra, the Academy of St. Martin-in-the-Fields, the London Mozart
Players, the Philomusica of London, the Northern Sinfonia (Newcastle upon
Tyne) and the Scottish Philharmonic Society. Most orchestras (other than i
those of the BBC) receive financial aid through the Arts Council of Great
Britain and local authorities and some also receive assistance from commercial
television and business organisations. In Northern Ireland the Ulster Orches- 1
tra receives financial aid from the Arts Council of Northern Ireland.
Among the principal choral societies in Britain are the Royal Choral Society,
the Bach Choir, the Royal Liverpool Philharmonic Choir, the New Philhar¬
monia Chorus, the Edinburgh Royal Choral Union and the Belfast Philhar-
monic Society. Certain of these are closely associated with famous orchestras |
while others combine with them in major choral works; most choral societies
are affiliated to the National Federation of Music Societies.
Music festivals in Britain, originating with the Three Choirs Festival held i
annually in Gloucester, Worcester or Hereford in rotation, have been in
existence for over 250 years. The famous Edinburgh International Festival
lasts three weeks; other festivals, such as that at King’s Lynn, last a week or
less. Among the better known are the Royal National Eisteddfod of Wales,
the National Gaelic Mod, held at a different place in Scotland each year; the
Cheltenham Festival, largely devoted to contemporary British music; and the
Aldeburgh and Bath festivals. An annual international festival of folk song
and dancing is held by the English Folk Dance and Song Society.
Interest in amateur music-making is encouraged by the work of County
Music Committees (some of which are voluntary and some sub-committees I
of local education authorities), which are aided by the Carnegie United I
Kingdom Trust and united in the Standing Conference for Amateur Music.
The National Federation of Music Societies, which receives an annual grant
from the Arts Council, assists amateur groups with the cost of engaging pro¬
fessional soloists; over 1,000 music societies are members of the federation. ^

Council. The Royal Opera House has a permanent orchestra which plays for
the Royal Opera and the Royal Ballet. Both companies have a high inter¬
national reputation and make overseas tours; they have regular London
seasons and perform in the provinces.
Seasons of opera and operetta in English are given by the English National
Opera which plays in the London Coliseum, and makes provincial tours. Its
former home, Sadler’s Wells Theatre, provides a London stage for visiting
opera and dance companies from the provinces and from abroad.
At Glyndebourne, in Sussex, an opera season, for which an international cast
is specially assembled, is held every summer. Other opera companies include
the English Opera Group, which specialises in the performance of works by
British composers, the New Opera Company which has been associated with
the English National Opera and performs at Sadler’s Wells Theatre, Scottish
Opera and the Welsh National Opera Company. Opera in Northern Ireland
is promoted by the Northern Ireland Opera Trust and the Studio Opera
Group with financial support from the Arts Council of Northern Ireland.
Britain’s dance companies include London’s Festival Ballet and the Ballet
Rambert (Britain’s oldest ballet company), Scottish Ballet, and the Welsh
Dance Theatre. The London Contemporary Dance Theatre provides regular
seasons of modern dance in London besides touring extensively. The Nor¬
thern Dance Theatre concentrates its activities in the north of England al¬
though it makes periodic tours elsewhere. The work of the Patricia Mulholland
Irish Ballet Company in Northern Ireland, which is assisted by the Arts
Council of Northern Ireland, combines traditional music, dancing and mime.
Professional training in music is given at colleges of music, of which the Royal
Academy of Music, the Royal College of Music and Trinity College of Music
in London, and the Royal Scottish Academy of Music and Drama in Glasgow
are grant-aided. Other leading colleges include the Guildhall School of Music
and Drama in London, the Royal Northern College of Music in Manchester
and the Birmingham School of Music. The London Opera Centre provides
advanced training courses for student singers and stage managers. The leading
dance schools are the Royal Ballet School, the Rambert School of Ballet and
the London School of Contemporary Dance which, with many private schools,
have helped in raising British dance to its present high standard.
Young people are encouraged to take an interest in music, opera and ballet.
There are frequent concerts for children and the National Youth Orchestra of
Great Britain, the National Youth Orchestra of Wales, the London Schools’
Symphony Orchestra and several county youth orchestras are noted for their
high standard of performance. A Youth and Music organisation, affiliated to
the international Jeunesses Musicales, encourages opera, ballet and other per¬
formances for young people. The Royal Ballet sponsors a small group, Ballet
for All, to give lecture-demonstrations to the public and to schools. Educa¬
tional Dance Drama Theatre and Dance for Everyone receive financial sup¬
port for their work with young people.
In schools, more children are learning to play musical instruments; and
some 230,000 candidates a year (children and other students) take the exami¬
nations of the Associated Board of the Royal Schools of Music.
There are some 1,600 cinemas in Great Britain and estimated attendance
in 1974 amounted to 143-3 million. British films, actors and creative and

technical talent have received much recognition both at home and abroad,
and regularly achieve success at international film festivals and other events.
The feature film industry is based in the London area where all the main film
studios are centred. Cinema and television films are exported to most countries
in the world. The trade association to which the majority of feature film pro¬
ducers belong is the Film Production Association of Great Britain.
There is no state-owned film production unit in Britain, but the National
Film Finance Corporation lends money for feature film production through
a consortium formed by the corporation and private interests in 1972 And
which operates with funds drawn from the Government and private interests.
There is a levy on cinema admissions which provides a fund to benefit the
makers of eligible British films. Subject to the approval of the Department of
Trade, grants from the levy can be made to the Children’s Film Foundation,
to the British Film Institute for the production of films and to the National
Film School. The remainder of the fund is distributed by a public body—the
British Film Fund Agency—in proportion to a film’s takings, so that the more
successful a film is at the box-office, the more it receives from the fund.
Under legislation dating from 1927 a specified proportion of British films must
be shown in British cinemas each year. For main feature films the quota has
remained at 30 per cent since 1950 and for supporting programmes at 25 per
cent since 1948.
The state takes no part in the censorship of films in Britain, but before it can
be shown a film must be licensed by a local authority or, in some areas, a
magistrate. In considering the suitability of films the authorities normally rely
on the judgment of an independent body, the British Board of Film Censors,
to which most films for public showing are submitted (other than newsreels).
The British Board of Film Censors was set up in 1912 on the initiative of
the cinema industry, to ensure that a proper standard was maintained in the
films offered to the public. The board, which does not use any written code of
censorship, may require cuts to be made before granting a certificate to a
film- very rarely, it refuses a certificate. Films passed by the board are placed
into’one of four categories: ‘U’ (for general exhibition); ‘A’ (for general
exhibition but parents are advised that the film contains material which they
may not wish children under the age of 14 years to see); ‘AA’ (for persons of
not less than 14 years of age); and ‘X’ (for persons of not less than 18 years
of age).
The documentary tradition in short film production in Britain goes back to
1929 when a group of directors began making factual films of a distinctive
and imaginative kind on behalf of the Government, and later for commercial
organisations. The war years saw a big expansion in this field and, since then,
British documentary technicians have continued to produce high quality
factual films which have won numerous international awards. The British
Industrial and Scientific Film Association promotes the use of films in
industry, science and commerce. The Federation of Specialised Film Associa¬
tions is the trade association of documentary, short, industrial, advertising
and cartoon film makers.

The National Panel for Film Festivals assists in the selection of short films
for British entries to international short film festivals.
The Government sponsors a wide range of films to inform audiences over¬
seas about British life and achievements, including documentary films, tele¬
vision programmes and newsreels; they are produced through the Central
Office of Information (COI), which commissions their production by private
companies.
A large number of films are sponsored by industrial concerns and other
organisations, such as the British Tourist Authority and the British Pro¬
ductivity Council. The best of these and industrial films from other countries
are available through the COFs Central Film Library and other agencies.
The Films of Scotland Committee promotes the production of Scottish films
covering the industries and cultural traditions of Scotland.
The development of the film as an art is promoted by the British Film
Institute, founded in 1933, which is financed mainly by an Exchequer grant,
and by the Scottish Council for Educational Technology which also receives
a government grant. The institute offers financial and technical assistance both
to new and experienced film makers who can not find support elsewhere.
The institute encourages the making and showing of good films. It also
administers the National Film Theatre in London and the National Film
Archive, runs an annual summer school, and maintains a film library from
which films may be hired, a library of books on the film and an information
service. It makes grants to the Federation of Film Societies, the British
Universities Film Council and the Society for Education in Film and Tele¬
vision.
The National Film Archive contains about 25,000 films, including newsreels
and other miscellaneous items, besides scripts, art designs, posters and about
1 million photographic stills, selected to illustrate the history and the art of
the film and as significant social and historical records.
The National Film Theatre, on the south bank of the Thames in London,
has two cinemas showing films of outstanding historical, artistic or technical
interest; it holds a unique position as a cinema offering regular programmes
unrestricted by commercial considerations or by the age or nationality of the
films shown. Each year it organises a London Film Festival. The British Film
Institute has promoted the development of some 50 regional film theatres on
the lines of the National Film Theatre and may make grants towards their
recurrent and capital costs. In Scotland the Scottish Film Council as a com¬
mittee of the Scottish Council for Educational Technology is responsible for
regional film theatres and administers the Scottish Central Film Library.
Grants in Northern Ireland are made by the Arts Council of Northern Ireland.
An independent National Film School offers three-year courses for writers,
directors, producers and cameramen. The school, which is financed by grants
from the Government and the British Film Fund Agency, has about 70 students.
Training in film production is also given at the London International Film
School which has over 100 students and at some colleges of further education.
The Cinematograph Act 1952 provided for the making of regulations by the
Home Secretary to protect the health and welfare of children attending film
shows. Cinemas which give children’s shows require a special licence from the
licensing authority, which may impose conditions. There are about 660
children s cinema clubs which provide special programmes on Saturday

mornings. An important contribution to these programmes is made by the
Children’s Film Foundation, which, with the aid of grants from the British
Film Fund Agency, produces and distributes entertainment films specially
designed for children.
A number of modern British painters and sculptors have a high international
reputation, and have received many international prizes and commissions for
major works in foreign cities. The growth of interest in the visual arts at home
has been stimulated by improved methods of display by museums and galleries,
and by the activities of many institutions, societies, and private galleries and
the growing number of local art centres.
State support for painting and sculpture mainly takes the form of mainten¬
ance and purchase grants for the national museums and galleries, purchase
grants for municipal museums and galleries, and grants towards the cost of
local education authority art education.
The Government also encourages high standards of industrial design and
craftsmanship through grants to the Design Council and craft organisations,
particularly the Crafts Advisory Committee.
In addition to direct state assistance, the Arts Council runs the Hayward
Gallery in London, where major loan exhibitions are shown, and the Serpen¬
tine Gallery, which presents the work of young artists. The council also
maintains its own collection of contemporary British art and organises or
offers grants or guarantees towards a variety of touring and other exhibitions.
The Scottish and Welsh Arts Councils maintain galleries in Edinburgh,
Glasgow, and Cardiff respectively. The Arts Council of Great Britain also
supports art societies and independent galleries, and provides commissions
and awards for artists. The Northern Ireland Arts Council owns a gallery in
Belfast.
London is a major centre for the international art market and regular sales of
works of art take place in the main auction houses. Certain items are covered
by export control: these are works of art and other antiques over 100 years old
and worth more than £4,000; documentary and photographic material over
70 years old; and British archaeological material over 100 years old. A licence
is required before such items can be exported but this is granted automatically
in the case of objects imported into Britain within the last 50 years. In other
cases the application for a licence is considered by the Department of Trade,
and if the department’s expert advisers recommend the withholding of a
licence, the matter is referred to the Reviewing Committee on the Export of
Works of Art; if the committee regards a work to be of national importance it
can advise the Government to withhold the export licence for a specified time
to enable a public museum or art gallery to purchase the object at a fair price.
Over 950 museums and art galleries are open to the public in Britain. These
include the major national collections together with a wide variety of munici¬
pally and independently owned institutions. The Government is advised on
grants and policy towards museums by the Standing Commission on Museums
and Galleries.
Of the national museums and art galleries, those in London contain between
them one of the most comprehensive collections of objects of artistic, archaeo¬
logical, scientific, historical and general interest ever to exist within one city.

They are the British Museum, the Victoria and Albert Museum, the National
Gallery, the Tate Gallery, the National Portrait Gallery, the Imperial War
Museum, the National Army Museum, the Royal Air Force Museum, the
National Maritime Museum, the London Museum (to be amalgamated with
the Guildhall Museum into the Museum of London), the Wallace Collection,
the British Museum (Natural History), the Geological Museum and the
Science Museum (see p. 416).
There are three national museums and art galleries in Edinburgh: the
National Museum of Antiquities of Scotland, the Royal Scottish Museum
(including the Scottish United Services Museum), and the National Galleries
of Scotland (comprising the National Gallery of Scotland, the Scottish
National Portrait Gallery, and the Scottish National Gallery of Modern Art).
The National Museum of Wales, in Cardiff, has a branch at St. Fagan’s
Castle where the Welsh Folk Museum is housed; and in Northern Ireland
there is the national Ulster Museum in Belfast.
Most of the national museums and galleries are administered by trustee
bodies, but the Victoria and Albert and Science Museums are the direct
responsibility of the Department of Education and Science, and the Royal
Scottish Museum has a similar relationship with the Scottish Education
Department.
Other important collections in London include the Armouries (Tower of
London), the Public Record Office and the Sir John Soane’s Museum. In
Buckingham Palace there is a small gallery, known as the Queen’s Gallery,
for the exhibition of pictures from the extensive royal collections. Most cities
and large towns and many other towns have a museum devoted to art, archaeo¬
logy and natural history, usually owned by the local government authority
but sometimes by a local learned society or privately by individuals or trustees.
Both Oxford and Cambridge are rich in museums, many of them, as in other
towns, associated with the universities—for example, the Ashmolean Museum
in Oxford, founded in 1683, the oldest in the country, and the Fitzwilliam
Museum in Cambridge. There are important museums and art galleries in
Aberdeen, Birmingham, Bristol, Glasgow, Leeds, Leicester, Liverpool,
Manchester, Norwich, Reading, Southampton and York. In Northern Ireland
there are notable museums and galleries in or near Belfast (the Ulster Folk
Museum and the Arts Council of Northern Ireland Gallery), in Armagh City
and in Londonderry. Many private art collections housed in historic family
mansions, including those in the ownership of the National Trust, are open to
the public. There is an increasing number of open air museums which depict
the regional life of an area or preserve early industrial remains, for example, the
Weald and Downland Museum in Sussex.
A function of the Standing Commission on Museums and Galleries is to
advise the Government on the relationship between national and provincial
institutions. Close relations are fostered by the eight area museum councils
which cover the whole of Great Britain. They are grant-aided by the Govern¬
ment and offer help and advice to museums and galleries in their area.
The Museums Association, to which museums and art galleries and their
staffs throughout the country belong and which also has many overseas
members, is an independent organisation. The association serves as a central
body for the collection of information and the discussion of matters relating
to museum administration, and as a training and examining body for profes¬
sional qualifications.

BRITAIN 1976: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Temporary exhibitions organised and sent on tour by the Arts Councils, the
Circulation Department of the Victoria and Albert Museum, the Science
Museum, the Art Exhibitions Bureau and the area museum councils are a
regular feature of many museums. In London the Hayward Gallery, the Tate
Gallery, the British Museum, the Victoria and Albert Museum and the Royal
Academy are the main centres for loan exhibitions; these are also held at the
Whitechapel Art Gallery, the Camden Arts Centre and the Institute of Con¬
temporary Arts. The Greater London Council exhibits modern sculpture in its
parks periodically. Commercial exhibitions of works by old masters and living
artists are held throughout the year in the galleries of the art dealers of London.
There are a number of national art exhibiting societies, some of which,
notably the Royal Academy at Burlington House, have their own galleries in
London. The Royal Scottish Academy holds annual exhibitions in Edinburgh.
An increasing number of amateur art societies throughout Britain hold local
exhibitions and encourage local interest in the fine arts. There are also
exhibitions of children’s art, including the National Exhibition of Children’s i
Art sponsored annually by the Sunday Minor newspaper.
All national collections are financed chiefly from government funds. Besides |
meeting the administrative and maintenance costs, the Government makes \
provision for annual purchase grants which totalled million in i975—7^’
It also provides special ad hoc purchase grants, and pre-eminent works of art
accepted by the Government in lieu of capital transfer tax are allocated to
public collections.
Local museums and art galleries, which are maintained from rates or endow- •
ments, can be helped in building up their collections through the annual i
government grant administered by the Victoria and Albert, Science and Royal I
Scottish Museums. Financial help and practical assistance is also given to
museums and galleries by certain trusts and voluntary bodies, particularly .
the National Art-Collections Fund and the Contemporary Art Society.
Art and design education is provided in maintained colleges of art, colleges of
further education and polytechnics, which are administered by local education I
authorities. Other institutions offering art and design courses include univer¬
sities, the Royal Academy Schools and some private art schools. At post¬
graduate level there is the Royal College of Art which awards its own degrees. :
Art is also taught at an advanced level at the four Scottish Central (Art)
Institutions administered by the Scottish Education Department. University
art schools include the Slade School of Fine Art and Goldsmiths’ College
(London), the Ruskin Drawing School (Oxford), the Reading School of Art, >
the Department of Fine Art of the University of Newcastle upon Tyne, and
the School of Art of University College, Aberystwyth.
The leading academic institutions for the teaching and study of the history
of art are the Courtauld Institute of the University of London, the Depart¬
ment of Classical Art and Archaeology in University College, London, and
the Warburg Institute, also a part of London University.
In England, Wales and Northern Ireland three-year full-time courses
leading to a degree in art and design are administered by the Council for
National Academic Awards (CNAA). The CNAA also awards postgraduate
degrees in art and design. In Scotland each of the four schools of art awards a
diploma which is roughly equivalent to the pass degree of a university and
three award associateships, which are comparable with an honours degree.
The Ulster College (see p. 163) is the regional college for Northern Ireland.

Art has a place in the curriculum of every type of school, and the Society
for Education through Art, among other activities, encourages the purchase by
schools of original works of art by organising an annual Pictures for Schools
exhibition. Pictures may also be borrowed from an increasing number of
public libraries.
Official responsibility towards the nation’s architecture is concerned with
encouraging the best in new building and preserving the best that has been
inherited from the past (for preservation, see p. 175).
Several government departments are concerned with architecture and help
to promote good design. The Department of the Environment is responsible
for the design, building and maintenance work of government departments
and undertakes research and development work in these subjects. It also
provides advice to local authorities in England and Wales on the best standards
of housing design through a series of Design Bulletins and other publications
and offers annual awards for the best housing designs in both public and
private sectors. Other government departments, such as the Department of
Education and Science and the Department of Health and Social Security,
provide design advice and exercise design control over buildings—such as
schools and hospitals falling within their area of responsibility. In Scotland
statutory responsibility and control of standards are exercised by the Secretary
of State for Scotland.
Government departments are assisted in an advisory capacity by the Royal
Fine Arts Commissions for England and Wales and for Scotland, which also
advise planning authorities and other public bodies on questions of public
amenity or artistic importance, including new building developments.
A number of professional, advisory and other societies and institutions
exist to further the interests of architecture, and the Civic Trust (see p. 171)
seeks to promote high standards in architecture and civic planning and to
encourage interest in the appearance and protection of town and countryside.
The National Trust (see p. 171) acquires land and buildings and protects them
from harmful development for the benefit of the public.
In Britain it is illegal for a person to practise under the title of ‘architect’
unless registered with the Architects’ Registration Council of the United
Kingdom. Most students train at a full-time school of architecture; there are
33 schools recognised for exemption from the examination in architecture of
the Royal Institute of British Architects (RIBA). Some of these schools have
part-time courses and there are five other schools which have courses leading
to the RIBA external examination.
The Royal Institute of British Architects is the leading professional archi¬
tectural institution with a membership of over 21,500 in Britain and 5,600
overseas and over 3,700 students in Britain and overseas countries. The RIBA
has 78 branches in Britain, and allied to it are 31 architectural societies in
overseas countries. It is concerned with a wide range of activities covering pro¬
fessional practice, science, technology, statistics, architectural competitions,
and professional and public relations; arranges lectures and discussions on a
variety of subjects; presents exhibitions; and, through its Board of Education,
exercises control over standards of architectural education. The RIBA has one
of the largest and most important architectural libraries in the world. The
Royal Incorporation of Architects in Scotland with over 2,000 professional
members is allied to and acts for the RIBA in Scotland. Among other associa¬
tions are the Incorporated Association of Architects and Surveyors, the

Institute of Registered Architects and the Faculty of Architects and Surveyors.
Societies include the Architectural Association, the Architecture Club, and
several which cover particular aspects of architecture, such as the Modular
Society.
The study of literature is included in the curricula of all schools, colleges
and universities. There are free public libraries throughout the country, private
libraries and a large number of private literary societies. Book reviews are
featured in the press and on radio and there are numerous periodicals con¬
cerned with literature. Recognition of outstanding literary merit is given in
the form of literary prizes, a number of which are awarded annually, for
instance, the Queen’s Gold Medal for Poetry, the Hawthornden prize for
imaginative writing, and the Somerset Maugham award for young writers.
Government help is given through the Arts Council of Great Britain which ;
supports literature in a number of ways, including grants for writers, transla¬
tors, publishers, little presses and magazines. Similar provision is made through
the Arts Council of Northern Ireland for bursaries, poetry readings, and aid
for publications.
The British Library was created in July 1973 under the British Library Act
1972 from a merger of the British Museum Library with other libraries and
institutions. The Library is organised in three divisions. The Reference
Division includes the Department of Printed Books holding over 8 million |
volumes; the Department of Manuscripts; and the Department of Oriental
Manuscripts and Printed Books and the Science Reference Library. The
Lending Division at Boston Spa, West Yorkshire, has over 2 million volumes
and 44,000 current periodicals available on loan to other libraries in Britain,
it also has access to many millions of books in other libraries and is the national
centre for inter-library lending within Britain and between Britain and foreign
countries. The Bibliographic Services Division processes the acquisitions of
the British Library for inclusion in its catalogues and other bibliographic
services. It publishes the British National Bibliography which lists in a classi¬
fied order (with indexes) all new books and new editions, excluding reprints,
published in Britain. The British Library automatically receives a copy of
each new book published in Britain. In addition the National Library of
Scotland, the National Library of Wales, the Bodleian Library of Oxford
University and the Cambridge University Library are entitled to claim copies.
The Victoria and Albert Museum and the British Museum (Natural History)
in South Kensington also have large libraries and many government depart¬
ments have old-established libraries of considerable size and importance. The
Public Record Office contains the records of the superior courts of law and of
most government departments, as well as such famous historical documents
as Domesday Book. In Scotland, the Scottish Record Office serves the same
purposes. The National Register of Archives (maintained by the Historical
Manuscripts Commission) contains particulars of local and private records.
Besides the few great private collections, such as those of the Signet Li rary,
Edinburgh, and the London Library, there are the rich resources of the||
learned societies and institutions (for scientific societies and institutions, see
p. 40s). Examples are the libraries of the Royal Institute of International
Affairs the Royal Commonwealth Society, the Royal Geographical Society,!1
the Royal Society of Edinburgh, the British Theatre-Association, the Royal
Academy of Music, the National Library for the Blind and the National Book
League.

THE ARTS 433
The ancient university libraries of Oxford and Cambridge are not matched
by any of the more recent foundations, although the combined library resour¬
ces of the colleges and institutions of the university of London total some 5-5
million volumes, the John Rylands University Library in Manchester con¬
tains more than 2 million volumes, and the university libraries of Edinburgh,
Leeds and Glasgow have over a million volumes each, while Birmingham and
Liverpool each has some three-quarters of a million volumes. Many universi¬
ties have succeeded in building up large and important research collections in
special subjects; for example, the Barnes Medical Library at Birmingham.
Other universities are also building collections as are the new polytechnics.
The importance of good libraries is recognised at all levels of the education
system. School libraries, most of which are maintained by local education
authorities, often receive important support services from the public library
service, including loans of books. Schoolchildren are regularly introduced to
the public library system, which they can use in addition to the school library.
Britain is served by a complete network of public libraries, administered by
local public library authorities. These libraries have a total stock of some 113-7
million books.1
Qualified and specialist staff are available for consultation in all but the
smallest service points. About one-third of the total population are members
of public libraries. The Secretary of State for Education and Science is
responsible for the supervision of the public library service in England and in
Wales, and is advised by two library advisory councils. Public library authori¬
ties in England and Wales have a duty to provide an efficient and (with some
limitations) free lending and reference library service for books and periodicals.
Outlying areas may be served by mobile libraries, of which over 600 are in
service, and domiciliary services exist for people who are unable to visit a
library.
In Scotland local authorities have a duty to provide adequate library
facilities and similar duties are imposed on education and library boards in
Northern Ireland.
In addition to lending books, about a half of the library authorities now lend
gramophone records of various kinds and a growing number are adding loan
collections of works of art, either originals or reproductions. Nearly all library
authorities provide children’s departments, while reference sections and art,
music, commercial and technical departments meet the growing and more
specific demands in these fields. Most library authorities possess a significant
collection of books and documents on the history of their localities.
The public library is often a centre for local cultural activities. Film shows,
lectures, adult education classes, book-week exhibitions, drama groups, gramo¬
phone recitals and children’s story hours are among the many activities pro¬
vided by or based upon the local library.
A voluntary system of library co-operation in England and Wales has grown
up since the first quarter of this century. The eight regional library bureaux
in England and Wales (consisting mainly of public libraries in each area) aim
to be largely self-sufficient in the interlending of current British books,
achieved in some regions by a system of co-operative subject specialisation.
They organise co-operation among themselves and through the British Library,
which is responsible for interlending at national and international level.

BRITAIN 1976: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
There is a growing number of local schemes for the exchange of specialist j
books and periodicals and information. These involve industrial, commercial
and sometimes university libraries and are normally centred on a major public J
or technical college library.
The National Library of Scotland carries out functions similar to those of j
the regional bureaux and the lending division of the British Library. In
Northern Ireland access to the stocks of all co-operating libraries is available
on application to the libraries under the control of the five education and ^
library boards and to the Queen’s University and New University of Ulster ,
libraries.
The principal professional organisation is the Library Association, which
has a personal membership of nearly 22,000, of whom more than 2,000 are
from overseas countries. It maintains a Register of Chartered Librarians,
publishes books, pamphlets and official journals, and holds regular conferences.
There are also associations of libraries, for example the Association of Special
Libraries and Information Bureaux (see p. 41?) anc^ Standing Conference
of National and University Libraries.
In 1974 British publishers issued 32,194 separate titles including 7,852 reprints
and new editions. The total of new titles issued was 24^342• increasing
proportion of books—including a wide range of specialised non-fiction is
now sold in paper-back form; Penguin Books are the best-known publishers
of paper-backs. Book clubs make available hard-backed books at a lower price.
Leading organisations representing the interests of those concerned with
book production and distribution are the Publishers’ Association and the
Booksellers’ Association. The British Council also publicises British books and
periodicals through its libraries in over 75 countries, its programme of book
exhibitions (259 exhibitions were mounted in 1973-74) and its bibliographical
publications including the monthly British Booknews. The Book Development
Council promotes British books overseas. (For sales and exports of books in ,
1974 see p. 244.) The National Book League has a membership covering all
who are interested in books; authors, publishers, booksellers, librarians and
readers. It encourages an interest in books and arranges exhibitions in Britain
and overseas.
Societies for the promotion of literature include the English Association and
the Royal Society of Literature. The British Academy for the Promotion of
Historical, Philosophical and Philological Studies, generally known as the
British Academy, is the leading society of humanistic studies and receives a
grant from the Treasury.
A number of societies sponsor poetry readings and recitals, the Poetry
Society and the Apollo Society are among the best known. Poetry also plays
an important part in various annual festivals, including the Royal National
Eisteddfod—the bardic festival held in Wales—the Stratford-upon-Avon
Festival of Poetry, the Cheltenham Festival of Literature, and the annual
poetry festival organised by the Poetry Book Society in London.
Among the specialist societies are the Early English Text Society, the
Bibliographical Society, the Harleian Society, the Saltire Society, and several
societies devoted to particular authors of which the largest is the Dickens
Fellowship. There are a number of clubs and societies, such as the Book
Society and the Poetry Book Society, which exist to distribute selected new
books to their members.
21 The Press
The British press caters for a variety of political views, different levels of
education and a wide range of interests. It is not subject to state control or
censorship.
A large number of newspapers are sold in Britain every day, and although
there are relatively few national newspapers, some of them have circulations
comparable with the greatest in any other part of the world; individual audited
circulation figures range from nearly 200,000 to some 4-2 million.
The national newspapers (daily and Sunday) fall into two categories: popu¬
lar and quality. The tabloid format is more commonly used by the former and
the broadsheet format by the latter. Prices range from £0-05 to ^010 for
dailies and from £0-07 to ^0-15 for Sundays. Separate sections or pages on
finance, business, industry, education, the arts, social services and sport are
common, and some papers carry special supplements on particular subjects,
with related advertising. The quality Sunday newspapers have separate
sections for literature and the arts, business and industry, as well as colour
magazine supplements. Free colour magazine supplements are published by
one morning and two Sunday newspapers: the Daily Telegraph, the Sunday
Times and The Observer.
According to The Newspaper Press Directory1 130 daily and Sunday news¬
papers and 1,134 weekly newspapers are published in Britain. These figures
include certain specialised papers, the circulation of which is limited not by
region, but by interest, for instance, business newspapers, sporting newspapers,
newspapers in foreign languages for groups of nationals of other countries
resident in Britain and religious newspapers.
Britain imports three-quarters of its newsprint requirements, over 1-3
million tonnes annually, while the rest is made mainly from imported raw
materials.
Ownership Newspaper ownership in Britain, as it affects the national daily and Sunday,
London evening and regional daily newspapers, is concentrated mainly in the
hands of a comparatively small number of large press publishing groups.2
Although most enterprises are organised as limited liability companies,
individual and partner proprietorship survives. The seven major newspaper
and periodical publishers are: Reed Publishing Holdings Limited (part of
Reed International); Associated Newspapers Limited; Beaverbrook News¬
papers Limited; the Thomson Organisation Limited; News International
Limited; United Newspapers Limited; and Pearson Longman Limited.
The large national newspaper and periodical publishers are major corpora¬
tions with diversified interests over the whole field of publishing and com¬
munications ; some have shares in independent television and radio contracting
companies. The Independent Broadcasting Authority Act 1973 established
1 Changes in the number of newspapers occur from time to time; figures are based on
the 1975 edition of The Newspaper Press Directory.
2 A Royal Commission on the Press was set up by the Government in 1974 to inquire
into factors affecting the maintenance of the independence, diversity and editorial
standards of newspapers and periodicals, and the choice of newspapers and periodicals
available to the public nationally, regionally and locally.
1^6 BRITAIN 1976: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
the right of local newspapers to hold shares in companies providing local
independent radio services (see p. 448).
Although pronounced views may be expressed in some newspapers and their
political leanings may be obvious, they are financially independent of any
political party and are not obliged to follow any specific party line.1 In order to
preserve their character and traditions, a few newspapers and periodicals are
governed by arrangements which vest ownership of the undertaking in trustees,
or operate it in accordance with a deed of trust, or provide that the transfer
of shares be controlled by trustees. Others have management arrangements
intended to ensure the authority and independence of editors.
Safeguards against the risks inherent in undue concentration of the means
of communication are provided in certain Acts of Parliament, for instance, in
the Independent Broadcasting Authority Act 1973, which stipulates that, if it
appears to the Independent Broadcasting Authority at any time that news¬
paper shareholdings in television programme companies have led or are
leading to results which are contrary to the public interest, the Authority may,
with the consent of the Home Secretary, notify the companies that their
programmes may cease to be transmitted. The Act makes a similar stipulation
for local independent radio and provides that if a local newspaper has a
monopoly in the area, it should not be allowed to have a controlling interest
in the local radio station. In addition the Fair Trading Act 1973 makes
unlawful any transfer of a newspaper or newspaper assets to a newspaper
proprietor whose newspapers have an average daily circulation amounting,
with that of the newspaper to be taken over, to 500,000 or more copies unless
the Secretary of State for Prices and Consumer Protection gives written
consent. Except in certain limited cases, which include transfers of very small
newspapers, consent may be given only after the Secretary of State has re¬
ferred the matter to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission and received
their report.
The ‘National’ Nine morning papers are ‘national’ in the sense of circulating throughout the
Press British Isles, and there are seven national Sunday papers (see Table 38). All 1
the national dailies are produced in London, but those with big circulations
also print northern editions in Manchester. The Scottish Daily Express and
the Scottish Sunday Express are printed in Manchester. The leading Scottish
papers {The Scotsman and The Glasgow Herald) have a considerable circula¬
tion outside Scotland. Each of the (two) London evening papers has owner¬
ship affiliations with a national daily, but both have their distinctive style and
draw their readership very largely from people living in and around London.
English
Regional
Newspapers
The regional newspapers of England (outside London, 85 morning or evening
dailies and Sundays and 717 newspapers appearing once or twice a week)
provide mainly regional and local news. Some of the daily newspapers also
give extensive coverage to national affairs, and a number co-operate to provide
their own foreign news service. The leading regional newspapers have wide
regional circulations; a few have nation-wide reputations.
Generally speaking, regional evening newspapers are non-political, while
the morning newspapers are independent or conservative in outlook.
The total circulation of the regional morning and evening papers is esti¬
mated at about 6-3 million. Of the morning papers the Journal (Newcastle

expresses the views of the Communist Party of Great Britain.

upon Tyne), the Yorkshire Post (Leeds) and the Northern Echo (Darlington)
have circulations of over 100,000 and two provincial Sunday papers—the
Sunday Sun (Newcastle upon Tyne) and the Sunday Mercury (Birmingham)
have circulations of over 200,000. Individual circulation figures of regional
evening papers start at about 17,000; most are in the 30,000—100,000 range; a
few have circulations of over 300,000. Weekly papers are mainly of local appeal;
they are also a valuable medium for local advertising. Most have circulations
in the 5,000-40,000 range.
There are also a number of free distribution newspapers (mostly weekly),
some of which are published by orthodox newspaper publishers.
The London local weeklies (156) include papers for every district in Greater
London. They are assembled mainly in groups of six to eight, affiliated in some
cases to larger groups.
A number of evening newspapers, using the latest production technology,
are published in the outer metropolitan area on the fringe of the circulation
areas of the two London evening newspapers.
Wales has one daily morning newspaper, the Western Mail, published in
Cardiff; it circulates mainly in south Wales. In north Wales the Liverpool
Daily Post gives wide coverage to events in the area. Evening papers pub¬
lished in Wales are the South Wales Echo, Cardiff, the South Wales Argus,
Newport, and the South Wales Evening Post, Swansea. North Wales is served
by the Evening Leader, Wrexham, and the Liverpool Echo. The Shropshire Star
covers parts of mid and north Wales and there is coverage to a smaller extent
by the Manchester Evening News.
The weekly press (over 70 papers) includes English papers, some of which
carry articles in Welsh, and Welsh language papers.
Scotland has seven morning, six evening and three Sunday newspapers. The
morning papers are The Scotsman, published in Edinburgh; The Glasgow
Herald, the Daily Record and The Scottish Daily News (began printing in May
I975)> published in Glasgow; the Courier and Advertiser, published in
Dundee; the Press and Journal of Aberdeen; and the Scottish Daily Express.
The evening papers are the Evening News of Edinburgh, Glasgow’s Evening
Times, Dundee’s Evening Telegraph and Post, Aberdeen’s Evening Express, the
Paisley Daily Express and the Greenock Telegraph. The Sunday papers are
the Sunday Mail, the Sunday Post and the Scottish Sunday Express.
Weekly and local newspapers published in Scotland number about 140.
The most widely known is the People’s Journal, which has several local
editions.
Northern Ireland has two morning newspapers, one evening paper and one
Sunday paper, all published in Belfast: they are The News-Letter (Unionist)
and the Irish News (Nationalist), the evening Belfast Telegraph and the Sunday
News. There are 42 weekly newspapers in Northern Ireland, with circulations
ranging from about 3,300 to about 24,000. The majority are published by
individual companies.
The Channel Islands have two daily (evening) papers (one in Guernsey and
one in Jersey) and two weeklies, which also circulate in Alderney and Sark.
In the Isle of Man there are five weekly newspapers of which the Isle of
Man Examiner has the largest circulation.

There are about 4,500 periodical publications in Britain, classified as general,
‘specialised’ ‘trade’, ‘technical’ and ‘professional’. There are also some 660
‘house magazines’ produced by industrial undertakings, business houses or
public services for the benefit of their employees and/or clients.
General and specialised periodicals include magazines of general interest;
women’s magazines; publications for children; religious periodicals for all
denominations; fiction magazines; magazines dealing with sport, gardening,

hobbies and humour; journals specialising in various subjects such as politics,
finance and economics, science, agriculture, medicine and the arts; and the
publications of learned societies, trade unions, regiments, universities and
other associations.
The weekly periodicals with the highest sales in Britain are: Woman;
Woman's Weekly; Woman's Own; Weekend; Woman’s Realm; Radio Times;
and TV Times. The leading journals of opinion are The Economist, a politically
independent publication covering topics from a wider angle than its title
implies; the New Statesman, which is a review of politics, literature and the
arts with an independent socialist political tendency; the Spectator, which
covers much the same subjects from an independent conservative standpoint;
Tribune, which represents the views of the left-wing of the Labour Party; New
Society, which covers the sociological aspects of current affairs; and New
Scientist, which reports on the progress of science and technology in terms
which the non-specialist can understand. Punch, traditionally the leading
humorous periodical, also devotes attention to public affairs.
Literary and political journals and those specialising in international and
Commonwealth affairs, published monthly or quarterly, appeal generally
speaking to the more serious type of reader.
The publication of trade, technical, business, scientific and professional
journals (covering hundreds of subjects, many of them in considerable depth)
has become one of the more important aspects of the British publishing
industry. In addition to circulating in Britain, these journals have a con¬
siderable circulation outside Britain and are an important medium for selling
British goods overseas. Their publication ranges in frequency from weekly to
quarterly.
Periodicals published in England circulate throughout the United Kingdom.
Weekly papers are also published in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland:
in Wales several monthly and quarterly journals in both Welsh and English;
in Scotland three monthly illustrated periodicals {Scottish Field, Scotland's
Magazine, and Scots Magazine), a weekly paper devoted to farming interests
{Scottish Farmer), a number of literary journals, of which the most famous is
probably Blackwood's, and numerous popular magazines; and in Northern
Ireland weekly, monthly and quarterly publications covering farming, the
linen industry, building, motoring, politics and social work.
There are three principal British news agencies: Reuters Ltd.; the Press
Association Ltd.; and the Exchange Telegraph Company Ltd.
Reuters Ltd. is an international news organisation owned by the newspapers
of Britain, Australia and New Zealand through the Newspaper Publishers
Association, the Press Association, the Australian Associated Press and the
New Zealand Press Association, which are parties to a trust agreement to
safeguard the independence and integrity of the news service. Founded in
Aachen in 1850 and transferred to London in 1851, Reuters now has about
1,100 correspondents in 183 countries and territories, and links with 120
national or private news agencies, which give it access to coverage by many
thousands of local reporters. Some 600,000 to 700,000 words of general news,
sports, and economic services reports are received in London every day over
a global network of leased cable and radio circuits. From these messages
regionalised news services, specially tailored to the needs of recipients in
Britain and main overseas regions, are transmitted to more than 120 countries
for distribution to information media, either direct or through national news
agencies. Reuters Economic Services supply up-to-the-minute information to
^40 BRITAIN 1976: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
business houses throughout the world. Its computerised systems offer virtually
instant coverage of the important stock and commodity markets by computer
interrogation or video display. A computerised message-handling system,
known as the Automatic Data Exchange, is used to speed up the handling and
distribution of news.
The Press Association Ltd., the British national news agency founded in
1868, is co-operatively owned by the principal newspapers of the United
Kingdom outside London, and of the Irish Republic. It provides newspapers,
the broadcasting organisations, Reuters (of which it is a major joint owner)
and other international agencies with a complete service of home news, includ¬
ing general and parliamentary news, legal reports, and all branches of financial,
commercial and sports news; and includes in its services to regional papers the
world news of Reuters and the Associated Press. News is teleprinted 24 hours
a day from head office in Fleet Street over a network of lines leased from the
Post Office—certain items being available in teletypesetting form.
Through its Photographic Department the Press Association serves London
and regional newspapers with a daily picture service from home and overseas;
these are wired to the regional press. Its Special Reporting Service supplies
reports of local or special interest to daily and weekly papers and periodicals.
All profits are used to develop the service.
The Exchange Telegraph Company Ltd. (Extel), an independent news
agency founded in 1872, is a wholly owned subsidiary of the Exchange Tele¬
graph Company (Holdings) Limited, a public company. It supplies financial
and sporting news to newspapers and broadcasting organisations. Racing ser¬
vices are also supplied by teleprinter and telephone to subscribers in London
and the provinces from offices in all important cities and towns.
The British press and broadcasting organisations are also served by Asso¬
ciated Press Ltd., and by United Press International, which are British
subsidiaries of United States news agencies.
A number of other British, Commonwealth and foreign agencies and news
services have offices in London, and there are minor agencies in other cities,
mostly specialising in various aspects of newspaper and periodical require¬
ments. Syndication of features is not as common in Britain as in some countries,
but a few agencies specialise in this type of work.
Training for The Printing and Publishing Industry Training Board (PPITB) is responsible
Journalism for training in the printing, publishing and professional photography indus¬
tries. The responsibilities of the board (which has a chairman, a deputy chair¬
man and 23 other members, representing employer, employee and educational
interests) include the formulation of training schemes, the establishment of
standards, ensuring that adequate facilities exist, and the provision of a
regional advisory service.
The National Council for the Training of Journalists (NCTJ), composed of
the major representative organisations in journalism and the press, works in
partnership with the Board. Its functions include superintending activities
concerning entry into journalism, setting and conducting examinations; and
organising short training courses and seminars for journalists.
There are two normal methods of entry to newspaper journalism: (1) by
selection for a place on a full-time course lasting for one academic year and
(2) by direct recruitment to a regional or local newspaper. Students selected
for a pre-entry course must have gained two passes at the Advanced level of
the General Certificate of Education (GCE) and be under the age of 20 at the
beginning of a course. Some pre-entry students are sponsored by newspapers;
THE PRESS
Press
Institutions
441
the others are assisted by the NCTJ to find employment on completion of the
course. The minimum educational requirement for direct entry is five GCE
passes at Ordinary level.
Under collective agreements between the employers’ associations in pub¬
lishing, the National Union of Journalists and the Institute of Journalists,
systematic training under NCTJ arrangements is obligatory for all entrants to
the regional and local newspaper publishing sector under the age of 31. The
scheme consists of on-the-job training, and block-release courses for those who
have not attended a pre-entry course. A similar syllabus covering practical
journalism, shorthand, use of language, law, public administration and current
affairs is used at both kinds of course. Eight centres (five in England, and one
each in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland) provide courses for reporters
and there is one centre for newspaper photographers.
All entrants to regional and local newspapers who are under the age of 24
serve an apprenticeship of up to three years (two years in the case of graduates)
depending on educational qualifications on entry. For direct entrants appren¬
ticeship follows six months’ probation. Entrants from pre-entry courses serve
three months’ probation, after which apprenticeship is back-dated to the start
of the probation period. After minimum qualifying service under NCTJ
regulations trainees take a proficiency test which carries a salary bonus and
promotion to senior qualified status after completion of apprenticeship.
Both the PPITB and the NCTJ have given attention to the development
of comparable arrangements for entrants to periodical publishing. NCTJ
accredited courses (including pre-entry) are available in central London
(where the greater part of the periodical publishing sector is situated) and the
PPITB has drawn up a recommendation on systematic training for the editorial
staff of periodicals to facilitate the preparation of in-company schemes which
now exist in most major groups. The NCTJ courses are arranged in association
with the London College of Printing and include a one-year pre-entry course
in periodical journalism, and day release, and occasional block release courses.
While most training in journalism in Britain takes place at below university
level and there are no courses offering degrees in journalism, the Centre for
Journalism Studies at the University College, Cardiff, has a one-year post¬
graduate diploma course in journalism which is available to any holder of a
degree from a British university or a recognised equivalent. In addition a wide
range of training courses, covering circulation, advertising, industrial relations
and supervisory management are provided for the regional newspaper industry
by the Newspaper Society Training Service and for the national newspapers
by the Newspaper Publishers Association. Short general management courses
are also run in conjunction with the University of Aston in Birmingham.
Under the Commonwealth Press Union Travelling Fellowship Scheme for
the training and education of young journalists throughout the Common¬
wealth, about ten journalists from overseas spend four months in the United
Kingdom each year, partly in the offices of newspapers or periodicals and
partly acquiring a general idea of life in Britain. A limited number of travelling
scholarships are also awarded to British journalists to enable them to visit
Commonwealth countries overseas.
The Thomson Foundation offers scholarships and organises training courses
for journalists from all parts of the world at its Editorial Studies Centre in
Cardiff, and provides consultants and tutors for courses for journalists overseas.
The most important organisations to which employers in the industry belong
are the Newspaper Publishers Association, whose members publish national

newspapers in London and Manchester; the Newspaper Society, which repre¬
sents the regional, local and London suburban press; the Scottish Daily
Newspaper Society, which represents the interests of daily and Sunday news¬
papers in Scotland; the Scottish Newspaper Proprietors Association, which
represents the owners of weekly newspapers in Scotland; Associated Northern
Ireland Newspapers, whose members are the proprietors of weekly news¬
papers in Northern Ireland; and the Periodical Publishers Association, whose
membership embraces the independent publishers of trade and technical
publications and general magazines. On the journalists’ side there are the
Institute of Journalists (loj), founded in 1884 as the National Association of
Journalists, and the National Union of Journalists (NUJ), founded in 1907.
All practising journalists (including those engaged in radio, television, public
relations and freelance journalism) are eligible for membership of either of
these organisations. The NUJ has 29,500 members and the loj about 2,300.
The main aims of the Guild of British Newspaper Editors are to sustain the
dignity of editorship, to raise and safeguard the professional status of editors,
to protect the rights and freedom of the press, and to improve the education
and training of journalists: the Guild has about 430 members. The British
Association of Industrial Editors is the professional organisation to which most
editors of house journals belong.
The Press Council, established in 1953 and reconstituted in 1963, has a lay
chairman and 30 members. Its aims are: to preserve the established freedom
of the British press; to maintain the character of the British press in accor¬
dance with the highest professional and commercial standards; to keep under
review any developments likely to restrict the supply of information of public
interest and importance; to deal with complaints about the conduct of the
press or the conduct of persons and organisations towards the press; to report
on developments in the British press which may tend towards greater con¬
centration or monopoly; to make representation on appropriate occasions to
the Government, to organs of the United Nations and to press organisations
abroad; to publish its adjudications and periodic reports recording its work,
and to review from time to time developments in the British press and the
factors affecting them. The council publishes annual reports, which include
statistics of the newspaper and periodical press and a series of articles examin¬
ing the structure of the leading press groups.
The press in Britain has the same freedom as the individual to do and say
what it likes provided it does not transgress the law; in general, it is at liberty
to comment on matters of public interest. Apart from enactments relating
directly to such matters as the registration of newspapers for postal purposes,
there are no specific press laws but certain statutes include clauses which
apply, in particular or incidentally, to the press. These relate to such matters
as the extent of newspaper ownership in television and radio companies; the
transfer of newspaper assets; restrictions on reporting of preliminary hearings
of indictable offences (in England, Wales and Northern Ireland) ; the right of
press representatives to be admitted to meetings of local authorities, restric¬
tions on the publication of (a) divorce and domestic proceedings in courts of
law, (b) advertisement and investment circulars, which are governed by Acts
dealing with the publication of false or misleading descriptions of goods and
services and with fraud and (c) advertisements of remedies for certain diseases,
which are covered by public health legislation; agreements between the Post ,
Office and newspaper proprietors on telegraphic communications, which must
THE PRESS
443
comply with telegraphs legislation; restrictions on certain types of prize com¬
petition; and copyrights, which come under copyright laws. The press is also
affected by the Trade Descriptions Act which imposes penalties for false or
misleading descriptions of goods or services.
Of particular relevance to the work of the press are the laws on libel,
defamation and contempt of court. A newspaper may not publish comments
on the conduct of judicial proceedings which are likely to prejudice their
reputation for fairness before or during the actual proceedings nor may it
publish before or during a trial anything which might tend to influence the
result. The obtaining and publication of information from state and official
sources of a confidential or security nature is affected by the Official Secrets
Acts. Newspapers are also liable to proceedings for seditious libel and incite¬
ment to disaffection.
Legal proceedings against the press are comparatively infrequent; the
majority of actions that do take place are libel actions brought by private
individuals. In such cases, the editor, proprietor, publisher, printer and
distributor of the newspaper, as well as the author of the article, may all be
held responsible.
22 Broadcasting
Broadcasting by television and radio in Britain is regulated by the Home
Secretary under the Wireless Telegraphy Acts 1949 and 1967, which prohibit
the sending or receiving of wireless communications, except under licence.
Two public bodies—the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) and the
Independent Broadcasting Authority (IBA)—are licensed to provide television
and radio broadcasting services.1 The BBC, which was established by Royal
Charter in 1927, operates two national television services, four national radio
services and 20 local radio stations; it also broadcasts to countries abroad
through its external services division. The IBA, originally established in 1954
as the Independent Television Authority, controls the operation of the single
independent television service and has similar responsibility for the indepen¬
dent local radio stations (see p. 448).
Users of television sets must obtain a receiving licence each year, which can
be bought from most post offices. Licences for sets receiving black and white
pictures cost £8 a year, and for those receiving colour pictures £18 a year.
There were over 17-6 million receiving licences current in Britain in June
1975 of which some 9-8 million were for black and white, and over 7-8
million for colour television.
Broadcasting
Authorities
The British
Broadcasting
Corporation
Both the BBC and the IBA are constitutionally required to provide a ‘public
service’ with the purpose of disseminating information, education and enter¬
tainment. The constitution and finances of the BBC are governed by the new
Royal Charter granted in 1964 and by the Licence and Agreement of 1969,
and those of the IBA by the Independent Broadcasting Authority Acts 1973
and 1974 and its 1973 Licence.
The BBC and the IBA are independent authorities in the day-to-day
operations of broadcasting, including programmes and administration. The
Government, however, retains ultimate control, and the Home Secretary is
answerable to Parliament on broad questions of policy and may issue directions
to the BBC and the IBA on a number of technical and other subjects. Both
organisations are expected to show balance and due impartiality in their |
general presentation of programmes, particularly where matters of public
policy or controversial subjects are concerned, and in this connection the
Home Secretary has powers to prohibit the broadcasting of any particular
item or class of item, or to revoke the licences of the BBC or IBA at any time.
These are treated as major reserve powers and no formal veto has ever been
placed on the broadcasting of a particular item. Both the BBC and the IBA
are required to publish annual reports and accounts.
The Corporation consists of 12 governors (including a chairman, a vice-chairman
and separate national governors for Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland),
each appointed for a period of not more than five years by the Queen on the
advice of the Government. The governors are constitutionally responsible
1 In 1974 a committee of inquiry was appointed by the Government to look into the
future of broadcasting.

for the conduct of the whole broadcasting operation, including the produc¬
tion and presentation of the programmes on television and radio, and the pro¬
vision and working of the necessary installations and equipment. A number
of committees advise them on such matters as the social effects of television,
religious broadcasting, music, agriculture, school broadcasting, further educa¬
tion, programmes for immigrants, science and engineering and charitable
appeals. There is also a programme complaints commission. The governors
appoint the chief executive officer of the BBC—the Director General—with
whom they discuss all major matters of policy and finance. He is chairman of
the BBC’s board of management, which also includes the managing directors
for television, radio and external broadcasting, and the directors of personnel,
finance, public affairs and engineering.
The National Broadcasting Councils for Scotland and Wales control the
policy and content of television and radio programmes intended primarily for
reception in their respective countries. Local radio councils, representative of
the local community, are appointed by the BBC to advise on the development
and operation of local radio stations.
The domestic services of the BBC are financed principally by an annual
grant voted by Parliament (£146 million in 1974-75) which is the income from
the sale of television receiving licences less certain deductions for collection
and other expenses. This is supplemented by profits from trading activities,
including domestic sales of magazines and other publications dealing with
BBC radio and television programmes, and overseas sales of programmes.
Nearly three-quarters of the BBC’s expenditure on domestic services relates
to television. The BBC meets the cost of local radio stations but some local
education authorities have assisted in the making of educational programmes.
The BBC’s external services are financed by a grant determined each year
by the Government; in 1974-75 this amounted to over £20-5 million.
The Independent Broadcasting Authority consists of a chairman, a deputy
chairman and eight other members (three of whom have responsibility for
Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland) appointed by the Home Secretary.
The IB A does not itself produce programmes; these are provided by com¬
mercial programme companies. The authority’s four main functions are to
appoint the programme companies, to supervise the programme arrangements,
to control the advertising and to build, own and operate the transmitting
stations for independent television and independent local radio.
The IBA is advised by a General Advisory Council, by Scottish, Northern
Ireland and Welsh committees, and by committees on educational broad¬
casting, religious broadcasting, charitable appeals and advertising. A specialist
panel advises on medical and allied advertisements. A Complaints Review
Board reviews reports of complaints received and investigated by the I BA’s
staff. Local advisory committees provide advice on local radio services.
The chief executive officer of the IBA is the Director General. There are
also two deputy directors general, and a headquarters and regional office staff
covering all technical and administrative services.
The IBA receives no payments from licence revenue; the finance for its
operations is drawn from annual rental payments made to it by the television
and radio programme companies which amounted to about £13-5 million in
the year ended March 1974. The television programme companies also pay
to the IBA for transfer to the Exchequer a further sum known as the levy.
Previously related to advertising revenue, the levy has, since June 1974, been
related to the profits of the programme companies.

BRITAIN 1976: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Fifteen television programme companies hold contracts to provide television
programmes in the 14 independent television regions of Britain (two com¬
panies share the contract for London, one providing programmes during the
week and the other at the weekend). The companies operate on a commercial
basis, deriving their revenue from the sale of advertising time. The financial
resources, advertising revenue, and programme production of the companies
vary considerably, depending largely on the size of population in their areas.
(Independent television serves a population of some 14 million people in the
London area compared with some 107,000 people in the Channel Islands.)
In consultation with the IBA, each company plans the content of the pro¬
grammes to be broadcast in its area. These consist partly of material produced
by the company itself, partly of that produced by the other programme
companies, and partly of that purchased from elsewhere. The five largest com¬
panies (Thames, ATY, Granada, Yorkshire, and London Weekend) produce
a larger proportion of their own programmes and provide more programmes
for broadcast elsewhere on the national network than do the smaller ones. A
common news service is provided by Independent Television News Limited,
a non-profit-making company in which all the programme companies are
shareholders. The negotiations concerning the supply, exchange and purchase
of programmes and their co-ordinated transmission through the independent
television network take place largely on the Network Planning Committee
which consists of representatives of all the programme companies and of
the IBA.
Local broadcasting by independent radio stations has been introduced by
the IBA. The companies providing programmes are under contract to the
IBA, operate under its control and are financed by advertising revenue.
When a company, on the basis of negotiations with the other companies, has
decided on a programme schedule for its area, it is required to submit this to
the IBA for approval. The authority has wide-ranging powers to control and
regulate the content and quality of programmes; for example, it ensures that
a ‘proper balance’ of views is expressed and has drawn up a code on violence
which includes special precautions to be taken when children are likely to be
viewing. Although newspapers can acquire an interest in programme com¬
panies there are safeguards to prevent their shareholdings leading to results
contrary to the public interest. In certain circumstances local newspapers have
a right to a share in the control of local radio companies.
Television viewing has become by far the most popular recreational activity in
Britain and some 95 per cent of the population now have television in their
own homes. Average viewing time per head of population in i973~74 was
over 17 hours a week. There are three television channels: BBC 1 and ITV
which broadcast on both 405 lines very high frequency (vhf) and 625 lines
ultra high frequency (uhf), and BBC 2 which broadcasts on 625 lines uhf only.
Some 99 per cent of the population live within range of vhf, and more than
95 per cent within range of uhf transmissions. A majority of people possess
uhf receivers, and when most of the old vhf-only receivers have been replaced
the vhf broadcasts of BBC 1 and ITV will cease. Colour programmes were
first introduced on BBC 2 in 1967 and were extended to BBC 1 and ITV in
1969 when they began uhf broadcasts. A high proportion of programmes on
the three uhf services are transmitted in colour, though they can also be
received in black and white.
The Government has accepted in principle the recommendation of a report
BROADCASTING
BBC Television
Independent
Television
BBC Radio
447
on broadcasting coverage (see Bibliography p. 486) that the fourth television
channel in Wales should be allotted to a separate service in which Welsh-
language programmes should be given priority.
Radio attracts its largest audiences during the mornings. In 1973-74 radio
listening averaged some 9 hours a week per head of population.
Apart from a break during the war years the BBC has been providing regular
television broadcasts since 1936. Since 1964 it has operated two services—
BBC 1 and BBC 2. All BBC 2 programmes and the majority of those on BBC 1
are broadcast on the national network. Although many nationally networked
programmes are produced in London some originate from regional studios in
Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland and eight regional centres in England.
In 1973-74 some 4>959 hours were broadcast on the BBC 1 national network
including 908 hours of programmes produced by regional organisations for
network transmission; similar figures for BBC 2 were 3,190 hours including
412 hours of regional productions. Regional studios also originate programmes
of news and local interest intended for regional transmission only; these varied
from 681 hours in Wales (of which 360 were in the Welsh language) to an
average of over 154 hours in each of the eight English regions.
Through co-ordinated planning of programmes on its two services the BBC
is able to cater simultaneously for people of differing interests. While both
services cover the whole range of television output, BBC 1 presents a higher
proportion of programmes of general interest, such as light entertainment,
sport, children’s programmes and outside broadcasts, while BBC 2 places
greater emphasis on minority interests, providing a larger element of news,
documentaries, serious drama and music. Programmes successful on BBC 2
are frequently repeated on BBC 1. Both channels provide a wide range of
education programmes; in 1973-74 over 10 per cent of BBC 1 transmissions
were devoted to schools and further education broadcasts and over 19 per cent
of BBC 2 transmissions to Open University lectures (see p. 160).
During 1973-74 BBC television programmes won 14 international awards
and more than 7,000 screen hours of programmes were sold to nearly 70
countries overseas.
The first regular independent television broadcasts began in London in 1955.
ITV transmissions are provided on a regional basis by 15 programme com¬
panies. In 1973-74 over 9,300 hours of different programmes were shown over
the independent television network: 7,500 hours were produced in the com¬
panies’ own studios of which two-thirds were programmes designed for
regional audiences (including news and magazine programmes) and the
remainder were networked throughout the country. During the year, 13-9
per cent of the programmes screened were of overseas origin.
ITV programmes cover the whole range of television output, and more than
one-third of viewing time is devoted to serious programmes such as news and
news magazines, current affairs and documentaries, religion and education.
The remainder includes a high proportion of drama (often in serial form),
light entertainment, music, sport and feature films. There are about three
short advertising intervals an hour, in and between programmes.
BBC Radio provides listeners with four separate national channels, each of
which has a distinct character. Radio 1 provides a programme of ‘pop’ music,
while Radio 2 provides light music as well as being the principal channel for
the coverage of sport. Radio 3 provides continuous, mainly classical, music
(much of which is in stereo) and in the evening offers, in addition, adult
BRITAIN 1976: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
education programmes and works of artistic and intellectual interest. Radio 4
is the main speech programme, providing the principal news and information
service of the BBC; in addition it presents a wide range of drama, talks and
entertainment programmes as well as broadcasts to schools.
Local radio was started by the BBC as an experiment in eight towns in 1967
and there are now 20 stations. Broadcasting on vhf and the medium waveband,
local radio stations provide between 8 and 17 hours of locally produced pro¬
grammes each day, normally during the early morning, lunch-time and early
evening periods. During the rest of the day they transmit programmes from
the BBC’s national networks. Local broadcasts provide a comprehensive ser¬
vice of local news and information, besides covering local arts and sports
activities and offering residents opportunities to air their views on subjects of
local interest.
Much of the output of the independent local radio stations comprises entertain¬
ment programmes but they are also expected to provide a national and local
news service, information, and programmes on local affairs and community
activities. The first two began broadcasting in London in October 1973;
Capital Radio provides a general entertainment service while a specialist news
and information service is broadcast by the London Broadcasting Company 1
whose associated company, Independent Radio News, supplies national and
international news to the other independent stations. Altogether 19 stations
are expected to be broadcasting by the end of 1975, some of which will broad¬
cast for 24 hours a day.
BBC External The BBC broadcasts to most countries overseas. The main objectives of BBC
Services external broadcasts are to give unbiased news, to reflect British opinion and to
project British life and culture. The BBC broadcasts in 40 languages (including
English) for a total of some 740 hours a week. News bulletins, current affairs
programmes, political commentaries and topical magazine programmes form
the main part of the output. A full service of sports commentaries and results,
all kinds of music, drama, and a wide range of general entertainment pro¬
grammes are also included. |
The languages in which the external services broadcast and the length of
time each language is on the air are prescribed by the Government. Apart j
from this the BBC has full responsibility and it is completely independent in
determining the content of news and other programmes.
The BBC World Service broadcasts for 24 hours a day in English and is
supplemented at peak listening times by additional series of programmes
designed to be of special interest to Africa and Europe.
The foreign language services are divided into areas, namely, the African,
Arabic, Eastern, Far Eastern, Latin American, French (to Europe and Africa),
Central European, South European, German and East European Services.
Broadcasts range from 70 hours a week in Arabic to half an hour in Nepali.
The BBC’s English by Radio and Television Service is the most extensive
language teaching undertaking in the world. Some 280 radio programmes of
English lessons are broadcast weekly with explanations in 27 other languages,
and recorded lessons are supplied to some 300 stations in over 90 countries.
English by Television programmes are shown in more than 60 countries.
BBC news bulletins and other programmes are rebroadcast by the domestic
radio services of many countries. Rebroadcasting involves direct relays from
BBC transmissions and the use of recorded programmes supplied through the
BBC tape and disc transcription service. There are some 3,000 rebroadcasts

weekly of World Service programmes in about 50 countries. The Transcrip¬
tion Service offers programmes to nearly 90 countries.
Another part of the external services is the Monitoring Service which listens
to and reports on foreign broadcasts, supplying a daily flow of significant news
and comment from overseas to the BBC, the Press, and the Government.
Programme links are generally rented by the BBC from the Post Office,
although some are provided by the BBC with Post Office agreement. The
operation and maintenance of the transmitting stations from which its various
programmes are sent out are, however, solely a BBC responsibility.
For its domestic radio programmes, the BBC uses 112 studios in London and
the regions, and for its external services 40 in London. In addition, there are
semi-automatic studios which can be operated by programme officials without
engineering staff. Each BBC local radio station has at least two studios. BBC
television productions come from main studios at the Television Centre in
west London and other studios in various parts of London, and from fully
equipped regional studio centres at Belfast, Birmingham, Bristol, Cardiff,
Glasgow and Manchester. There are also television studios at Aberdeen,
Bangor, Edinburgh, Leeds, Newcastle, Norwich, Plymouth and Southampton.
Outside broadcasting is covered by a number of mobile units.
The IBA transmits programmes from 47 vhf and about 190 uhf stations
throughout Britain, programme links being provided by the Post Office.
Independent television programmes are produced at studio centres in Aber¬
deen, Belfast, Birmingham, Bristol, Cardiff, Carlisle, Dover, Dundee, Edin¬
burgh, Glasgow, Leeds, London, Manchester, Newcastle, Norwich, Plymouth,
St. Helier, and Southampton. The establishment of these studios is the direct
result of the I BA’s policy of encouraging the development of regional tele¬
vision, and the programmes are designed for either local broadcasting or for
transmission on the national network. All companies have facilities for colour
transmission.
The BBC does not give publicity to any individual firm or organised interest
except when it is necessary in order to provide effective and informative pro¬
grammes. Under the terms of its licence and agreement it must not broadcast
sponsored programmes or, without the consent of the Home Secretary, broad¬
cast any matter for payment.
Advertisements are broadcast on independent television and independent
local radio subject to the relevant provisions in the Independent Broadcasting
Authority Act 1973, in particular that there should be no sponsoring of pro¬
grammes by advertisers, that all advertisements should be clearly distinguish¬
able as such and recognisably separate from the programme, and that the
amount of time given to advertising should not be so great as to detract from
the value of the programmes as a medium of information, education and
entertainment. In any one hour of broadcasting the amount of advertising
time on Independent Television is normally limited to seven minutes.
Averaged over the day’s programmes it must not exceed six minutes per hour.
The independent local radio stations are normally limited to up to nine
minutes of advertising each hour. The IBA has drawn up a code governing
standards and practice in advertising on television and radio and giving
guidance about the types and methods of advertisement that may not be used.
Some types of advertising are prohibited, notably that of cigarettes (under

a government ruling of 1965) and for betting. Advertisements may not be
inserted in certain types of programme, for example, in broadcasts to schools.
Broadcasts on political issues include a daily factual and impartial account of
proceedings in Parliament, transmitted on BBC’s Radio 4 when Parliament
is in session, and there is frequent coverage of political subjects in news
bulletins and current affairs programmes on both radio and television.
Ministerial and party political broadcasts are also transmitted periodically
under rules agreed between the major political parties, the BBC and the IBA.
In 1975 the House of Commons decided to allow an experimental four-week
period of sound broadcasting of its proceedings with a view to determining
whether the arrangement should become permanent.
Research into technical problems is carried out by the scientific and engineer¬
ing staffs of the BBC, the IBA, the Home Office, the Post Office, the Govern¬
ment, and the radio industry. Advances by the BBC have included the
electronic conversion of monochrome and colour television pictures between
the European and the American systems, and the development of a sound-
and-vision system known as ‘sound-in-synes’ which enables the television
sound and picture to be carried over a single 625-line vision circuit, and thus
eliminates the operational complexity and expense of a separate circuit for the
sound. IBA engineers have introduced the world’s first fully digital field rate
standards converter (DICE) which improves the interchange of programmes
between areas using the 525-lines system (for example, North America) and
those using the 625-lines system (for example, Europe). The first unit was
taken into operational service by Independent Television News in 1973 and
in 1974 3- 'two-way DICE’ was developed which allows conversation in both
directions. Both the BBC and IBA have produced systems which allow the
broadcasting of written and simple graphical information to ordinary tele¬
vision receivers fitted with special adaptors. In 1974 Home Secretary
approved a two-year experimental period of broadcasting using the systems,
known as CEEFAX (BBC) and ORACLE (IBA).
The BBC and the IBA (together with the Independent Television Companies
Association) are active members of the European Broadcasting Union (EBU),
which was established to advance international broadcasting projects. The
union manages Eurovision, is responsible for the technical and administrative
arrangements for co-ordinating the exchange of programmes over that net¬
work and for intercontinental satellite links, and maintains a technical
monitoring station, where frequency measurements and other observations
on broadcasting stations are carried out.
The BBC belongs to the Commonwealth Broadcasting Association whose
members extend to each other such facilities as the use of studios, recording
channels, and programme contributions. The BBC also provides a large
amount of technical aid, particularly in training the staff of other broadcasting
organisations throughout the world; members of the BBC s staff are seconded
for service overseas.
The BBC is a partner in Visnews, which supplies a service of world news-
film to some 187 television organisations in 98 countries and is the most
widely used newsfilm agency in the world, and a member of the International
Television Federation (Intertel), which produces high-quality information pro¬
grammes which are exchanged overseas. United Press International, Paramount
Pictures and Independent Television News jointly provide an international
BROADCASTING 451
newsfilm service to more than 100 overseas television organisations via the
Eurovision network and by satellite.
The Government spends a considerable amount each year on radio and
television training for overseas students in Britain and largely finances the
British Council (see p. 165), which includes in its activities training in educa¬
tional television and radio for members of broadcasting organisations overseas.
Training in television work is also provided for overseas trainees at the Thom¬
son Television College in Glasgow, run by the Thomson Foundation, a
charitable trust.
The BBC and the IBA participate in the work of the International Tele¬
communications Union (ITU)—the United Nations specialised agency respon¬
sible for the regulation and control of all international telecommunication
services (including radio and television), for the allocation and registration of
all radio frequencies and, through its international consultative committees,
for the promotion and co-ordination of the international study of technical
problems in broadcasting. The BBC is also represented on the United King¬
dom Committee of the International Special Committee on Radio Interference.
23 Leisure and Sport
Home
Interests
Entertainments
Outside the
Home
There is a large variety of leisure and sporting opportunities available in
Britain, both inside and outside the home. An increased standard of living has
enabled many more people to pursue new interests in their leisure time and an
improved range of facilities is being provided.
LEISURE
As a considerable proportion of people’s time is spent in their homes many
leisure activities are of a domestic nature, for example, watching television,
reading newspapers or books, listening to the radio or the record player,
playing musical instruments (guitars are particularly popular among young
people), or entertaining friends. Many people have hobbies of which among
the most popular are gardening, home decorating and repairing, and car
maintenance. The increased percentage of households owning motor cars
(53 per cent in 1973 in Great Britain compared with 47 per cent in 1967) has
resulted in more people taking holidays away from home and visiting the
countryside, historic buildings and museums. All these interests are catered
for by numerous magazines and periodicals.
About one-third of the total population are registered members of public
libraries. Book sales have increased—a wide range of titles, including works
of scholarship, being produced in the cheaper paperback form.
Sales of long playing records by manufacturers have increased sharply
during the past decade, the 1974 figure being 130-5 million. The production
of ‘single records’—on the weekly sales of which the ‘pop’ music popularity
ratings, known as the ‘Top Ten’ and ‘Top Twenty’, are calculated—are also
high; the 1974 manufacturers’ sales figure was 92-4 million.
Most families do home decorating and painting. Gardening is another major
interest; at least half the families in Britain have some garden in spite of the
high proportion of the population living in urban areas. In many places there
are large garden centres where people purchase shrubs and other plants for
outdoor and indoor cultivation. In addition some families have allotments—
plots of land rented for cultivation. Thousands of local horticultural societies
are affiliated to the National Allotment Garden Society and there are many un¬
affiliated societies. The numerous flower and vegetable shows held in town
and country are very popular, and there is a large attendance at the most
important of them, including the annual Chelsea Flower Show.
The diversity of entertainments outside the home includes, for young people,
discotheques and pop concerts. Cinemas are popular, although audiences in
general have been declining for several years, while British theatre has an
international reputation based on the performance standards of many of its
companies. Although the theatre-going public is not large, the subsidised
repertory theatres (see p. 422) are well supported. Ballet, opera and concerts
of classical music also have an enthusiastic and growing public while special
art exhibitions often attract large audiences.
Dancing is popular among most age groups. There are many hundreds of
LEISURE AND SPORT
Clubs and
Groups
453
regular dance halls throughout the country, and over 2,000 schools of dancing.
These include schools of ballroom dancing as well as those teaching ballet,
many of which are attended by young children. Public dances are often
held in other halls, while clubs and societies hold dances occasionally in their
own or hired premises. For younger people dancing to pop music is more
common than formal ballroom dancing which, together with Scottish, English
and Irish traditional dances, retains a following particularly among the over¬
thirties. There is a folk dancing festival held each year at the Royal Albert
Hall in London.
The public house—known as the pub or the local—is a traditional social
centre for many people in Britain. Pubs, besides offering a wide variety of
alcoholic and non-alcoholic drinks and often providing hot and cold food,
serve as places for meeting friends and for entertainment; many have, for
instance, television sets, amusement machines and juke-boxes and provide
facilities for playing darts, billiards, dominoes and similar games. Some also
employ musicians for evening entertainment, such as piano playing, folk
singing and modern jazz.
One of the most popular forms of entertainment is ‘Bingo’, a game of chance
played by groups of people for prizes, which is organised throughout the
country in converted cinemas, club rooms and village halls; legalised by the
gambling Acts of the 1960s, it provides a form of social entertainment of
particular value to the elderly and lonely, and does not involve large sums of
money. There are some 126 commercial gaming clubs which operate under
strict legislative control. Betting shops number some 12,185. The turnover of
money staked by the public on horse and greyhound racing is of the order of
£1,800 million a year, most of it on horse races. Betting on football matches
for smaller stakes, both at fixed odds and through football pools, is widespread.
A number of people in all age groups and occupations are actively involved
in organisations such as church groups, political parties, groups of local business
and professional men (for example the Rotary Clubs), trade unions, social and
cultural groups, charities or voluntary social welfare agencies. The latter
include citizens’ rights groups which advise people on their legal rights and
their entitlement to welfare benefits. Involvement by young people in volun¬
tary work has increased and novel methods of fund raising, such as sponsoring
long-distance walks, have been introduced.
Educational and cultural pursuits are an important part of some people’s
leisure activities; every year about 2 million people attend non-vocational adult
education classes on a wide range of subjects. The Open University (see p.
160) provides an opportunity for study and qualification at university level
to people without educational qualifications, who can follow the courses in
their spare time. Thousands of people are involved in the activities of the
many amateur dramatic and music-making societies.
Some of the longer-established clubs and societies are organised on a
national basis and have branches throughout the country; these include the
Working Men’s Clubs and Institutes, the Townswomen’s Guilds and the
Women’s Institutes. Working Men’s Clubs, affiliated to the Working Men’s
Club and Institute Union, number about 4,000 and have some 4 million
members; primarily social and recreational in nature, the clubs aim at pro¬
viding amenities and entertainments of a very high standard. Some 2,700
Townswomen’s Guilds, with a total membership of over 200,000 are affiliated
to the National Union of Townswomen’s Guilds. The guilds are educational
as well as social in purpose, and they co-operate in many public welfare

activities. The aim of the National' Federation of Women’s Institutes is to
improve rural life and amenities; in villages throughout England and Wales
there are over 9,310 institutes with a total of nearly 500,000 members. In
Scotland and Northern Ireland there are Women’s Rural Institutes with
similar aims and interests.
In addition there are clubs and associations catering for all kinds of interest
and hobby, for example, chess, bridge, stamp collecting, photography, wine
making, archaeology, and rambling.-
In 1974 some 40-5 million holidays (that is, four or more nights away from
home) were taken in Great Britain by British residents while the number of
holiday visits taken abroad was 675 million compared with just over 5 million
in 1966. The popularity of foreign travel is attributable to several factors
besides rising incomes: the attraction of climate which makes Spain, France
and Italy the most popular destinations for the British tourist; the many
charter and other airline services provided; and the ability of the travel trade
to provide reasonably priced (particularly ‘package’) holidays. A by-product
has been an increase in the number of adults who, with the help of radio and
television programmes and by attending adult classes, are improving their
knowledge of foreign languages. Of those who stay in Britain many enjoy j
active holidays, such as canoeing, sailing and pony-trekking; camping under j
canvas, in caravans and in specially equipped vehicles, is popular.
SPORT
The traditionally widespread interest in sport among participants and spec¬
tators has been stimulated by regular broadcast coverage (particularly tele¬
vision) of the major sporting events. Large crowds attend such occasions as
the association football ‘Cup Final’ at Wembley Stadium, the international
rugby matches at Twickenham and Cardiff Arms Park, the Wimbledon lawn |
tennis championships, the classic horse races, and some of the cricket Test
Matches, and millions more watch them on television.
Sportsmen may be professional (paid players) or amateurs. Some sports, for
example, rugby union football, hockey and rowing, are entirely amateur but
in other sports the distinction between amateur and professional status is less
strictly defined. Nevertheless an important feature of British sport is its
amateur element—people who devote time and energy to organising sport and
to teaching and training, as well as the many thousands of all ages who engage
in sport for pleasure alone.
The Government does not undertake the organisation of individual sports in
Britain or the direct provision of facilities. There is, however, a Minister of
State for Sport and Recreation in the Department of the Environment who
exercises on behalf of the Secretary of State a leading responsibility for the
co-ordination of policies and the promotion of research in the field of active
recreation. The Secretaries of State for Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland
exercise similar responsibilities in their countries. The policy of the Govern¬
ment is to foster the development of all aspects of sport and recreation, to
stimulate the provision of facilities and to encourage their use to the fullest
capacity.
The main responsibility for the general development of sport in Great Britain
i

Composite
National Bodies

rests with three independent bodies—the Sports Council (for England and for
general matters affecting Great Britain), the Sports Council for Wales and the
Scottish Sports Council. Members of the councils are appointed by the
Government. The councils have the task, subject only to general ministerial
directives, of allocating funds made available by the Government. They award
grants and loans for sports development, coaching and administration to the
governing bodies of sport and to other national organisations; they pay grants
to voluntary organisations to assist in the provision of sports facilities; they
assist British representatives at international sports meetings; they encourage
links with international and overseas organisations; and they administer
national sports centres. The Sports Council consults with the Central Council
of Physical Recreation, comprising members of the national governing and
representative bodies of sport and physical recreation in England. The Sports
Council is linked with nine regional sports councils in England on which are
represented local authorities and sports interests in each region. The Scottish
Sports Council consults with the Scottish Standing Conference of Sport which
comprises representatives of the national governing bodies of sport in Scot¬
land.
The Sports Council for Northern Ireland acts in an advisory capacity and
can assist voluntary bodies by financial contributions or by providing equip¬
ment, coaching and instruction and in organising international or other events.
It may also provide and run national sports and recreation centres.
Voluntary bodies make substantial provision for sport in Britain, but the
largest provision is by local authorities which made available some £80 million
in 1973-74. Industrial and commercial concerns regularly support and sponsor
sporting events.
A bibliographic service about sport is provided by the National Documenta¬
tion Centre which has been set up by the Sports Council and is based at the
University of Birmingham; the council itself has an information centre provid¬
ing data on a wide range of sports topics at its headquarters. A similar service is
provided by the Sports Council for Wales and the Scottish Sports Council.
The law requires all publicly maintained schools in Britain to provide for the
physical education (for example, gymnastics, games, athletics, dancing and
swimming) of their pupils. Schools in the national systems (except those solely
for infants) must have a playing field, or the use of one, and most secondary
schools have a gymnasium. Some have other amenities such as swimming
pools, sports halls and halls designed for dance and movement; in a number of
areas, physical education facilities in schools are available to the whole com¬
munity outside school hours. Facilities for, and instruction in, many kinds of
sport are likewise provided at the independent preparatory and public schools
and at the universities (some of which have departments of physical education).
Local authorities are the main providers of land and large-scale facilities used
by the community for recreation, for example, playing fields, gymnasia, tennis
courts, golf courses, boating lakes, swimming baths and sports centres and
many arrange further education classes in various physical education subjects.
Large industrial firms often provide sports facilities for their employees and,
in many cases, make them available for the public.
Among the national voluntary bodies most closely connected with the general
development of sport are the British Olympic Association, the National Playing
Fields Association and the British Sports Association for the Disabled.

The British Olympic Association, founded in 1905, organises the participation
of British teams in the Olympic Games. The association’s council is composed
of the British members of the International Olympic Committee, representa¬
tives of the controlling bodies of some 25 sports, representatives of the armed
services’ sports organisations and of certain other affiliated bodies concerned
with sporting activities, and a few co-opted members. It determines the overall
size of the British team; raises funds; makes all the arrangements for the
team’s travel and comfort at the games; organises the provision and transport
of clothing and equipment; and provides a headquarters staff for the overall
management of the team.
The National Playing Fields Association (NPFA) aims to stimulate the provi¬
sion of playing fields, playgrounds and local recreation centres by publicity and
technical and financial assistance. With a council composed of representatives
of the governing bodies of sport, a number of educational bodies, voluntary
youth organisations, physical education associations, local authorities and
individuals, the NPFA gives advice on the provision and layout of sports
facilities, including small recreation centres, on matters relating to the
recreational needs of children from their earliest years, on the play and recrea¬
tional needs of the handicapped, and on the establishment of playgrounds and
play leadership schemes. It also distributes each year grants to some 500
playing field, playground and local recreational centre schemes. The NPFA
is a national charity established by royal charter. It derives its funds mainly
from voluntary contributions, but it also receives a small Sports Council
grant towards administrative costs. It has branches in Scotland and Northern
Ireland and in nearly every English and Welsh county.
The British Sports Association for the Disabled, founded in 1961, encourages
sporting activities for the physically handicapped. The association, which
receives an annual Sports Council grant, provides advice on physical recrea¬
tion through sport for the disabled, arranges sports meetings at the Stoke
Mandeville Sports Stadium for the Paralysed and Other Disabled, and en¬
courages the provision of facilities (including sports clubs) for physically dis¬
abled people. Region and branch committees of the association organise local
and regional games throughout the country.
The policy of establishing sports centres, bringing together people of all ages
and different recreational interests, is an important part of the provision for
physical recreation in Britain.
National centres, some of which were initially financed by funds from volun¬
tary sources, are maintained by the Sports Councils and provide recreational
facilities and a wide range of courses for instructors and performers in many
recreational activities. As well as making residential courses available for
enthusiasts from all over Britain, the national sports centres are used exten¬
sively by local clubs and the local community generally.
There are six national centres in England and Wales. Combined facilities
for ranges of sports are provided at three centres; the Crystal Palace National
Sports Centre in London and the Bisham Abbey and Lilleshall National
Sport centres in Buckinghamshire and Salop respectively. The centre at
Crystal Palace has a main stadium seating 12,000 spectators, a sports hall
seating 2,000 spectators, a swimming hall with pools meeting Olympic require¬
ments, a teaching pool and a gallery for 2,000 spectators, an indoor cricket
school, practice rooms for all indoor activities, a hostel for 140 residents and

staff housing: these facilities are available for international competitions as well
as for training purposes, and are supported by a grant from the Greater
London Council, in addition to the Sports Council grant. The other three are
specialist centres; the Plas-y-Brenin National Mountaineering Centre in
north Wales; the National Sailing Centre in the Isle of Wight; and the Holme
Pierrepont National Water Sports Centre in Nottinghamshire. In addition
there is a National Sports Centre for Wales in Cardiff which is supported by
local authorities, as well as by grants from the Welsh Sports Council.
The Scottish Sports Council operates three national recreation centres:
Glenmore Lodge near Aviemore for outdoor activities; Inverclyde at Largs
for general sports activities; and a national water sports centre in Great
Cumbrae Isle on the Firth of Clyde.
As well as the national sports centres, other centres—such as the Meadow-
bank Sports Centre administered by Edinburgh Corporation—cater for a wide
range of recreational activities and often attract more than purely local interest.
Some 200 indoor sports centres serve local rather than national needs; many
more are planned, some as ‘dual’ projects on school sites. There are also
several national centres catering for specialised interests and generally adminis¬
tered by the sponsoring organisations; these include the National Equestrian
Centre, run by the British Equestrian Federation, and the Stoke Mandeville
Sports Stadium for the Paralysed and Other Disabled, run by the British
Paraplegic Sports Society—the first sports centre of its kind in the world.
In Northern Ireland there are two indoor sports centres provided by district
councils and a Northern Ireland Mountain Centre provided by the Sports
Council for Northern Ireland.
Some of the major sports in Britain are described below.
Perhaps the most popular spectator sport is association football, dating as an
organised game from the nineteenth century, and controlled by separate foot¬
ball associations in England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. In
England over 350 clubs are registered with the English Football Association
(FA) and some 37,000 clubs are affiliated to regional or district associations.
The English FA organises an annual cup competition, the final of which is
played in Wembley Stadium watched by some 100,000 spectators; a similar
competition is run by the Scottish and Welsh Football associations.
The principal professional games in England and Wales are controlled by
the Football League which comprises 92 professional clubs and in Scotland
by the Scottish Football League (38 clubs); the clubs play in four divisions in
England and Wales and three in Scotland. During the season attendances at
Football League matches total about 28 million and at Scottish league matches
around 4 million. Altogether there are about 7,000-8,000 professional foot¬
ballers; these are greatly outnumbered by the nearly 1 million non-profes¬
sional footballers (including schoolboys and members of the armed forces).
National teams representing England, Wales, Scotland and Northern
Ireland compete against each other annually and take part in European com¬
petitions and the World Cup competition.
In England amateur athletics (including track, road and cross-country running,
relay racing, jumping, vaulting, hurdling, steeplechasing, throwing and race
walking) are governed, for men, by the Amateur Athletic Association and, for
women, by the Women’s Amateur Athletic Association. Scotland, Wales, and
Northern Ireland have their own associations and, as in England, there are

Games

Cricket
BRITAIN 1976: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
separate women’s associations. The various organisations encourage the
development of the sport, establish uniform rules and regulations and promote
regional and national championships. Hundreds of clubs are affiliated to the
various national associations.
International athletics and the selection of British teams are the concern of
the British Amateur Athletic Board (BAAB) composed of representatives of
the national associations. British teams compete in the Olympic Games and
separate teams representing England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland
compete in the Commonwealth Games. The BAAB also administers coaching
schemes.
The Highland Games, traditional gatherings of local people in the Highlands
of Scotland, at which sports (including tossing the caber, putting the weight
and throwing the hammer) and dancing and piping competitions take place,
are unique spectacles which attract large numbers of spectators from all over
the world. Among better-known Highland Games are the annual Braemar
Gathering, the Argyllshire and Cowal Gatherings and the meeting at Aboyne.
Boxing as a British sport is one of the oldest, probably originating in Saxon
times. Its modern form, also adopted in many overseas countries, dates from
1865 when the Marquess of Queensberry drew up a set of rules eliminating
much of the brutality that had characterised prize fighting and making skill the
basis of the sport. Boxing is both amateur and professional.
The Amateur Boxing Association controls all amateur boxing in England
including schoolboy boxing, club and association boxing, and boxing in the
armed services. There are separate associations in Scotland, Wales and |
Northern Ireland. The associations organise various amateur boxing competi¬
tions, and teams from England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland take
part in international competitions.
Professional boxing is controlled by the British Boxing Board of Control,
founded in 1929. The board has strict medical regulations which provide for
an examination of boxers before and after each contest, and for an extensive
annual medical examination. In addition the board appoints inspectors,
medical officers and representatives to ensure that the regulations are observed
and to guard against over-matching and exploitation.
Amateur and professional boxing championships are decided at various
weights—11 in amateur and 10 in professional boxing.
Cricket is among the most popular of summer sports and is sometimes called
the English national game. It is known to have been played as early as the
1550s. Among the many clubs founded in the eighteenth century was the
Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) which was founded in London and which
reframed the laws of the game. Cricket in Britain is now governed by the
Cricket Council which consists of representatives of the MCC, the Test and
County Cricket Board (representing first class cricket) and the National
Cricket Association (representing club and junior cricket).
The game is played in schools, colleges and universities, and in most towns
and villages there are amateur teams who play weekly games from late April
to the end of September. In the Midlands and the north of England there is a
network of League cricket contested by teams of Saturday afternoon players
reinforced by professionals, some of whom come from overseas.
Some of the best supported games are the annual series of Test Matches
played between England and a touring team from Australia, New Zealand,
LEISURE AND SPORT
Field Sports

India, Pakistan or the West Indies. The matches last five days and crowds of
up to 25,000 watch them in addition to the millions who follow the progress
of the games on television and radio. A team representing England makes
tours to these countries in December-March. In addition to the Test Matches
there is a First Class County Championship of three-day games played by 17
county teams who also take part in three one-day sponsored competitions—
two of these are knock-out competitions and the other is a Sunday League.
Cricket is also played by women and girls, the governing body being the
Women’s Cricket Association, founded in 1926.
The British Field Sports Society looks after the interests of the most popular
field sports (hunting, game shooting and fishing) which have a long history
and play a considerable part in the life of the countryside.
Fox hunting on horseback with a pack of hounds is the most important
British hunting sport but there is also stag hunting (in Devon and Somerset),
hunting the hare, and otter hunting along river banks. The fox hunting season
lasts from early November to April and is preceded by the hunting of young
foxes when young hounds are trained. There are 200 packs of hounds in
Britain and hunts are financed mainly by subscriptions of their members and
by steeplechase point-to-points which take place at the end of the season and
which attract large crowds.
Game shooting as an organised country sport probably originated in the
early part of the nineteenth century. Game consists of grouse, partridge,
pheasant, snipe and woodcock and these species are protected by law during a
close season when they are allowed to breed in security on numerous estates
supervised by privately employed game-keepers. It is necessary to have a
licence to kill game and a certificate must be obtained from the local police by
anyone who possesses, purchases or acquires a shot gun. The Game Conser¬
vancy, formed by landowners, farmers and others interested in game conser¬
vation, collects information and studies factors controlling game population.
Other shooting sports are wild-fowling which takes place on marshes and
fenlands, and deer stalking which is mainly a sport of the Scottish Highlands.
The deer are preserved in ‘deer forests’ and are protected during close seasons.
The most popular country sport is fishing, there being some 2-7 million
anglers in Britain. Many fish for salmon and trout particularly in the rivers
and lochs of Scotland, but in England and Wales the most widely practised
form of fishing is for coarse fish such as pike, perch, carp, roach, dace, tench,
chub and bream. Angling clubs affiliate to the National Federation of Anglers
(NFA) and many clubs organise match angling—a competitive form of coarse
fishing by weight. A national championship is organised by the NFA which
also enters a team in the International Angling Competition. Freshwater
fishing usually has to be paid for; most coarse fishing is let to angling clubs by
private owners while trout and salmon fishermen either rent a stretch of river,
join a club, or pay for the right to fish by the day, week or month. Coastal and
deep sea fishing are free to all (apart from salmon and sea trout fishing which
is by licence only). In Northern Ireland the Ulster Provincial Council of the
Irish Federation of Sea Anglers and the Ulster Angling Federation look after
the interests of the sport.
Golf originated in Scotland where it has for centuries borne the title of the
Royal and Ancient Game, the headquarters of the Royal and Ancient Golf
Club being situated at St. Andrews on the east coast. The sport is now played
throughout Britain and there are golf courses in the vicinity of many towns

and villages, some of which are owned by local authorities. The main event of
the golfing year is the Open Golf Championship and other important events
include the Walker Cup match for amateurs and the Ryder Cup match for
professionals, both being played between Britain and the United States.
The modern game of lawn tennis was first played in England in 1872 and the
first championships at Wimbledon in 1877. The controlling body, the Lawn
Tennis Association, was founded in 1888. The main event of the season is the
annual Wimbledon fortnight for players from all over the world; these draw
large crowds, the grounds at the All-England Club accommodating over 30,000
spectators. Another important tournament is the British Hard Court Cham¬
pionships. There are also county championships and national competitions
for boys’ and girls’ schools. International events include the Davis Cup for
men and the Federation Cup for women. Women from Britain and the United
States compete for the Wightman Cup.
Among the most popular spectator sports is motor racing; the governing body
is the Royal Automobile Club (RAC) and the motor clubs registered with it
organise annual sporting events. The RAC issues competition licences cover¬
ing all events from hill climbs to full international race meetings. In addition
the RAC organises the British Grand Prix which counts towards the Formula
One World Motor Racing Championship.
Another motor sport is motor cycle racing. The governing body is the Auto
Cycle Union and the most important contest of the year is the Isle of Man
Tourist Trophy. Motor cycle speedway racing is governed by the Speedway
Control Board.
Horse racing takes two forms—flat racing (from late March to early Novem¬
ber) and steeplechasing and hurdle racing (from August to June). The Derby
(for colts and fillies) run at Epsom in early June is the outstanding event in the
flat racing calendar. Other classic races are: the Two Thousand Guineas (for
colts and fillies) and the One Thousand Guineas (for fillies only), both run at
Newmarket; the Oaks (for fillies) run at Epsom; and the St. Leger (for colts
and fillies) run at Doncaster. The most important steeplechase and hurdle race
meeting is the National Hunt Festival Meeting at Cheltenham in March. The
Grand National, run at Aintree near Liverpool, is the best known single
steeplechase.
The Jockey Club controls all horse racing in Britain and its rules are the
basis of universal turf procedure; it also licenses 61 race courses in Great
Britain. Over 900 days’ racing are held each year and 11,000 horses are in
training in Great Britain.
The racing of greyhounds after a mechanical hare takes place at some 105
tracks licensed by local authorities; meetings are usually held two or three
times a week at each track. Rules for the sport are drawn up by the National
Greyhound Racing Club which also licenses track officials and trainers and
promotes veterinary research. Racing can only be conducted at a licensed track
and for 130 racing days in a licensing year (1st July—30th June). Some 10,000
registered greyhounds are in training under the National Greyhound Racing
Club Rules.
Betting takes place on horse and greyhound racing, ‘bookmakers’ providing
facilities on and off race courses and greyhound tracks. Bets laid off course,
mainly through licensed betting offices, comprise 90 P^r cent of the betting
turnover. A form of pool betting (totalisator betting) is organised on and off

course by the Horserace Totalisator Board (HTB). Most greyhound tracks
operate their own totalisators under strict local authority control. Bookmakers
and the HTB have to contribute a ‘betting levy’ to the Horserace Betting Levy
Board which promotes the advancement of veterinary science and the improve¬
ment of breeds of horses (including the work of the National Stud at New¬
market) and horse racing in general.
The authority responsible for equestrian activities (other than racing) in Great
Britain is the British Equestrian Federation which co-ordinates the work of the
British Horse Society and the British Show Jumping Association, and runs the
National Equestrian Centre at Stoneleigh.
The British Horse Society promotes the interests of horse and pony breed¬
ing and furthers the art of riding. It provides tests, lectures, publications, a
film library, courses and examinations and, together with riding schools
approved by it, helps to promote horsemastership. With some 23,000 mem¬
bers, the society is also the parent body of the Pony Club and the Riding Club
movement. Pony Clubs and Riding Clubs run their own national champion¬
ships, the latter organising the annual Riding Club Horseshoe Long Distance
Ride which is a test of stamina for horses and riders.
Horse trials are held during the spring and summer under the auspices of
the society. The three-day events held each year—in April at Badminton,
Avon, in May at Tidworth, Hampshire, and in September at Burghley House,
Lincolnshire—include dressage, cross-country riding and show jumping.
Show jumping is promoted by the British Show Jumping Association
which draws up rules for judging competitions and prescribing the general
standards and height of obstacles for show jumping. The association keeps a
register of horses and ponies taking part in affiliated shows and seeks to im¬
prove the standard of jumping and to provide for the representation of Great
Britain in international competitions. It has 15,000 members and 950 shows
are affiliated to it. The two major show jumping events are the Royal Inter¬
national Horse Show and the Horse of the Year Show.
Rugby football is played according to two different sets of rules: Rugby Union
football, in which there are 15 players in a team, is played by amateurs while
Rugby League football (a 13-a-side game) is played by professionals as well as
amateurs.
Rugby Union is played throughout Britain under the auspices of English,
Welsh, Scottish and Irish rugby football unions. International matches
between England, Scotland, Wales, Ireland and France are played each year
and there are tours by international teams. County championships are
organised by the English and Welsh Rugby Unions.
Rugby League football is played mostly in the north of England. The
governing body is the Rugby Football League which sends touring teams to
Australia and New Zealand. Annual matches are also played against France.
The Rugby League Challenge Cup Final is the major match of the season and
is played at Wembley Stadium in London.
Sailing has always been popular on Britain’s inland and coastal waters. The
Royal Yachting Association has over 1,500 clubs and 41,000 members. It also
has many recognised schools giving courses for novices, manages, with the
Sports Council, the Sailing Centre at Cowes in the Isle of Wight where
instructors are coached and tested, and selects the British Olympic team. One

of the world’s principal regattas takes place each year at Cowes and major
events are held at other British sailing centres.
The governing bodies of some other sports played in Britain are given below.
Most of these are organised on the basis of clubs and regional organisations
linked to a national body. The governing bodies’ functions are broadly similar
and usually include drawing up the rules of the sport, organising regional and
national competitions and maintaining relations with sporting bodies overseas.

Annual Report:
The Sports Council
The Sports Council
Most of the organisations concerned with sport publish year books covering results and records of the
previous season and future prospects; many weekly or monthly periodicals on sport are also published.
Index
Bold type in a sequence of figures indicates main references.
As the main purpose of this book is to inform readers overseas about Britain,
organisations and societies are generally indexed under their subject matter
rather than under Association of3 British, National, Royal, etc. {that is. Accidents,
Royal Society for the Prevention of; Archives, National Register of). In cases
where the first word is not separable, however {for example, Royal Air Force,
Royal Society), entries will be found appropriately.
Items are indexed under England, Northern Ireland, Scotland or Wales only
where they are matters peculiar to these countries; otherwise they are indexed
under the relevant subject headings.
