Introduction
Britain 1993 is the forty-fourth in the
series of Handbooks prepared each year by
the Central Office of Information (COI).
Drawing on a wide range of official and
other authoritative sources, it provides a
factual overview of Government policy and
other important developments. It describes
the workings of government and other
major institutions; the various sectors of
the economy; social, cultural and
environmental matters; international
affairs; and British achievements in many
fields.
The Handbook is widely recognised as
an established work of reference, not only
in Britain but overseas, where it is an
important element of the information
service provided by British diplomatic
posts. It is sold by HMSO and its agents
throughout the world.
New Features
The text has, of course, been fully updated
and revised, and this year a number of
new features have been introduced, some
at the suggestion of readers:
• a list of government departments and
their executive agencies, with a
description of their functions.
Addresses and phone numbers are
given for each of the main
departments;
• a list of the main White Papers and
Green Papers issued since January
1990; and
• a new statistical annex containing a
selection of the main economic
statistics. Detailed statistics continue
to be given in the individual chapters.
Coverage
Every effort is made to ensure that the
information given in the Handbook is
accurate at the time of going to press. The
text, generally, is based on information
available up to September 1992.
As far as possible, the Handbook presents
information that applies to Britain as a whole.
However, this is not always possible. Care
should be taken when using the Handbook to
note whether the information given refers to:
• Britain, formally the United Kingdom of
Great Britain and Northern Ireland;
• Great Britain, which comprises England,
Wales and Scotland;
• England and Wales, which are grouped
together for many administrative and
other purposes; or, in some instances,
• England alone.
Further Information
The Handbook forms part of a series of
factual publications which together provide a
broadly based and continuously updated
information source on British affairs.
• Current Affairs - A Monthly Survey is a
monthly digest of significant
developments in all areas of British
affairs. Published as part of the Aspects of
Britain series, it serves not only to
update the information carried in the
Handbook and the other series titles, but
as a long-term journal of record. Each
issue has separate sections dealing with
governmental; international; economic;
and social, cultural and environmental
affairs; and there is a list of recent
documentary sources for these areas.
• Aspects of Britain is a series of A5
paperbacks that covers in depth Britain’s
political, economic and social structure,
and its place in the international
community. Some titles are extended
versions of the chapters in the Britain
Handbook, but most are completely new
texts. Titles that offer significantly more
information than is given in the
Handbook have been indicated in a
footnote in the relevant chapter. A full
list of titles in the series appears at the
back of the Handbook.
Details on how to obtain these
publications are also given at the back of the
Handbook.
Acknowledgments
The Handbook has been compiled with the
co-operation of around 250 organisations,
including other government departments and
agencies. The editor would like to thank all
those who have contributed their comments.

1 Land and People
Introduction
Britain comprises Great Britain (England,
Wales and Scotland) and Northern Ireland,
and is one of the 12 member states of the
European Community. Its full name is the
United Kingdom of Great Britain and
Northern Ireland.
Physical Features
Britain constitutes the greater part of the
British Isles. The largest of the islands is
Great Britain. The next largest comprises
Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic.
Western Scotland is fringed by the large
archipelago known as the Hebrides and to the
north east of the Scottish mainland are
Orkney and Shetland. All these have
administrative ties with the mainland, but the
Isle of Man in the Irish Sea and the Channel
Islands between Great Britain and France are
largely self-governing, and are not part of the
United Kingdom.
With an area of some 242,500 sq km
(93,600 sq miles), Britain is just under 1,000
km (some 600 miles) from the south coast to
the extreme north of Scotland and just under
500 km (some 300 miles) across in the widest
part.
The climate is generally mild and
temperate. Prevailing winds are south¬
westerly and the weather from day to day is
mainly influenced by depressions moving
eastwards across the Atlantic. It is subject to
frequent changes but to few extremes of
temperature. It is rarely above 32°C (90°F) or
below -10°C (14°F). The average annual
rainfall is more than 1,600 mm (over 60
inches) in the mountainous areas of the west
and north but less than 800 mm (30 inches)
over central and eastern parts. Rain is fairly
well distributed throughout the year, but, on
average, March to June are the driest months
and September to January the wettest.
During May, June and July (the months of
longest daylight) the mean daily duration of
sunshine varies from five hours in northern
Scotland to eight hours in the Isle of Wight;
during the months of shortest daylight
(November, December and January) sunshine
is at a minimum, with an average of an hour
a day in northern Scotland and two hours a
day on the south coast of England.
In recent years there have been some
notable extremes of weather, including:
• a long period of drought in the southern
and eastern areas of England—in January
1992 London experienced its driest
January since records began in 1838;
• the highest temperature officially
recorded in Britain in August 1990—
371°C (98-8°F) at Cheltenham
(Gloucestershire); and
• the great storm of October 1987 w hich in
southern England resulted in about 15
million trees being blown down.
Historical Outline
The word ‘Britain’ derives from Greek and
Latin names probably stemming from a
Celtic original. Although in the prehistoric
timescale the Celts were relatively late
arrivals in the British Isles, only with them
does Britain emerge into recorded history.
The term ‘Celtic’ is often used rather
generally to distinguish the early inhabitants
of the British Isles from the later Anglo-
Saxon invaders.
England and Wales
Roman rule lasted for over 300 years from
ad 43. The final Roman withdrawal in 409

followed a period of increasing disorder
during which the island began to be raided
by Angles, Saxons and Jutes from northern
Europe. It is from the Angles that the name
‘England’ derives. In the next two centuries
the raids turned into settlement and a
number of small kingdoms were established.
The Britons maintained an independent
existence in the areas now known as Wales
and Cornwall. Among these kingdoms, more
powerful ones emerged, claiming overlordship
over the whole country, first in the north
(Northumbria), then in the midlands (Mercia)
and finally in the south (Wessex). However,
further raids and settlement by the Vikings
from Scandinavia occurred, although in the
tenth century the Wessex dynasty defeated
the invading Danes and established a wide-
ranging authority in England.
In 1066, the last successful invasion of
England took place. Duke William of
Normandy defeated the English at the Battle
of Hastings. Normans and others from
Prance came to settle. French became the
language of the nobility for the next three
centuries and the legal and, to some extent,
social structure was influenced by that
prevailing across the Channel.
Wales had remained a Celtic stronghold,
although often within the English sphere of
influence. However, with the death in battle in
1282 of Prince Llywelyn, Edward I launched
a successful campaign to bring Wales under
English rule. Continued strong Welsh
national feeling was indicated by the rising
led by Owain Glyndwr at the beginning of
the fifteenth century. The Acts of Union of
1536 and 1542 united England and Wales
administratively, politically and legally.
Scotland
Scotland was mainly inhabited by the Piets.
In the sixth century, the Scots from Ireland
(or ‘Scotia’) settled in what is now Argyll.
Lothian was populated by the English, while
Welsh Britons moved north to Strathclyde.
During the ninth century, the various parts
of Scotland united in defence against the
Vikings. The powerful monarchy which now
existed in England threatened Scottish
independence throughout the Middle Ages.
The eventual unification of England and
Scotland showed that religious differences
were now more important than old national
antagonisms. In England, Elizabeth I was
succeeded in 1603 by James VI of Scotland
(James I of England). Even so, England and
Scotland remained separate during the
seventeenth century, apart from an enforced
period of unification under Oliver Cromwell.
In 1707, both countries, realising the benefits
of closer political and economic union, agreed
on a single parliament for Great Britain.
Scotland retained its own system of law and
church settlement. The Union became
strained during the reigns of the Protestant
Hanoverians George I and George II, when
two Jacobite risings attempted to restore the
Catholic Stuarts.
Ireland
A number of kingdoms had emerged in
Ireland before the Christian era. Ireland,
however, did not escape the incursions of the
Vikings, who dominated the country during
the tenth century.
In 1169 Henry II of England launched an
invasion of Ireland. He had been granted its
overlordship by the English Pope Adrian IV,
who was anxious to bring the Irish church
into full obedience to Rome. Although a large
part of the country came under the control of
Anglo-Norman magnates, little direct
authority was exercised from England during
the Middle Ages.
The Tudor monarchs showed a much
greater tendency to intervene in Ireland.
During the reign of Elizabeth I, a series of
campaigns was waged against Irish
insurgents. The main focus of resistance was
the northern province of Ulster. With the
collapse of this resistance and the flight of its
leaders in 1607, Ulster became an area of
settlement by immigrants from Scotland and
England.
The English civil wars (1642-51) led to
further risings in Ireland and these were
crushed by Cromwell. There was more
fighting after the deposition of lames II in
1688.
During most of the eighteenth century
there was an uneasy peace; towards its end

BRITAIN 1993: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
various efforts were made by British
governments to achieve stability. In 1782 the
Irish Parliament (dating from medieval times)
was given legislative independence; the only
constitutional tie with Great Britain was the
Crown. The Parliament represented,
however, only the privileged Anglo-Irish
minority and Catholics were excluded from
it. An abortive rebellion took place in 1798,
and in 1801 Ireland was unified with Great
Britain.
The ‘Irish question’ continued as one of
the major problems of British politics during
the nineteenth century. In 1886 the Liberal
Government introduced a Home Rule Bill
which would have given an Irish Parliament
authority over most internal matters while
reserving to Britain control over external
affairs. This led to a split in the Liberal Party
and the failure of the Bill. In 1914 Home
Rule was enacted by the Government of
Ireland Act. Its implementation was
prevented by the threat of armed resistance on
the part of the Protestant majority in Ulster
and by the outbreak of the first world war.
Although a nationalist rising in Dublin in
1916 was suppressed, a guerrilla force known
as the Irish Republican Army (IRA) began
operations against the British administration
at the end of the first world war. The
Government of Ireland Act 1920 provided for
the establishment of two Home Rule
parliaments, one in Dublin and the other in
Belfast. The Act was implemented in 1921 in
Northern Ireland, when six of the nine
counties of the province of Ulster received
their own Parliament and remained
represented in, and subject to the supreme
authority of, the British Parliament. In the
South the IRA continued to fight for
independence from the British administration.
After the signature of a truce in June, the
Anglo-Irish Treaty of December 1921
established the Irish Free State, which
became a republic in 1949.

LAND AND PEOPLE
they have a special relationship with it. The
Channel Islands were part of the Duchy of
Normandy in the tenth and eleventh
centuries. The Isle of Man was under the
nominal sovereignty of Norway until 1266,
and eventually came under the direct
administration of the Crown in 1765. Today
the territories have their own legislative
assemblies and systems of law. The British
Government is responsible for their defence,
their international relations and, ultimately,
their good government.
The Four Lands
In the following pages there are brief
separate descriptions of aspects of social,
economic and political life for England,
Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland, with
some additional material on the political
situation in Northern Ireland.
ENGLAND
England is predominantly a lowland
country, although there are upland regions
in the north (the Pennine Chain, the
Cumbrian mountains and the Yorkshire
moorlands) and in the south west in
Cornwall, Devon and Somerset. Central
southern England has the downs—low chalk
hill ranges. The greatest concentrations of
population are in London and the south
east, the West Yorkshire and north-west
industrial cities, the Midlands conurbation
around Birmingham, the north-east
conurbations on the rivers Tyne and Tees,
and along the Channel coast.
The Church of England, which was
separated from the Roman Catholic Church
at the time of the Reformation, is the
Established Church; the Sovereign must
always be a member of the Church and
appoints its two archbishops and 42 other
diocesan bishops.
The English language is descended from
the German tongue spoken by the Anglo-
Saxons in the fifth and sixth centuries. This
was subsequently influenced by Latin and
Norse vocabulary. The language was
transformed with the settlement by the
Normans from France.
Government
England has no government minister or
department exclusively responsible for its
central administration in domestic affairs, in
contrast to Wales, Scotland and Northern
Ireland. Instead, there are a number of
government departments, whose
responsibilities in some cases also cover
aspects of affairs in Wales and Scotland.
There are 524 Members of Parliament for
England in the House of Commons. In April
1992 England had 319 Conservative Members
of Parliament, 194 Labour, 10 Liberal
Democrat and the Speaker of the House of
Commons. Conservative support is to be
found particularly in suburban and rural areas
and the Conservatives have a large majority
of the parliamentary seats in the southern
half of England and in East Anglia. The
Labour Party derives its main support from
urban industrialised areas.
Local government is administered through
a two-tier system of counties subdivided into
districts. There are 32 single-tier borough
authorities in London and six metropolitan
counties in other parts of England. In June
1992 the Local Government Commission was
established to review the structure of local
government in England.
The English legal system comprises on the
one hand a historic body of conventions
known as ‘common law’ and ‘equity’, and, on
the other, parliamentary and European
Community legislation. In the formulation of
common law since the Norman Conquest,
great reliance was placed on precedent.
Equity law derives from the practice of
petitioning the King’s Chancellor in cases not
covered by common law.
The Economy
In the later eighteenth and nineteenth
centuries Britain became the first
industrialised country, basing its wealth on
coalmining, on the manufacture of iron and
steel, heavy machinery and textiles, on
shipbuilding and on trade.
In the twentieth century a second period
of industrialisation changed the broad pattern
of development in England. In the 1920s and
5
BRITAIN 199.1: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
1930s the northern industrial centres saw
their traditional manufacturing base weakened
owing to fluctuations in world trade and
competition from other industrialising
countries, and, in some cases, from substitute
products. The South East and the West
Midlands generally benefited from the newer
industries such as pharmaceuticals, artificial
fibres, electrical equipment, car manufacture
and a wide range of consumer goods.
In the second half of the century, jobs in
service industries have grown and now
account for over two-thirds of employees in
employment. Expansion has been particularly
marked in financial and business services.
London is one of the world’s leading
centres of banking, insurance and other
financial services. Many high technology
industries in the surrounding regions have
also developed. There has been an increase in
retailing activity, with a trend towards large
shopping developments on the outskirts of
towns, designed for shoppers with cars.
London is also the main English media
centre; the national press is published there,
and the national radio and television networks
have their headquarters there. After London
and the South East (where about three-
quarters of employees are engaged in the
service sector), the South West has the next
highest concentration of service industries.
East Anglia has been the fastest-growing
English region in terms of both population
and employment since the 1960s. Although
largely agricultural, high-technology industry
has in recent years developed throughout the
region. One significant example is the
Cambridge Science Park. It contains a
number of science-based companies and
research organisations, which have close
collaborative links with the University.
Greater London and the industrial cities
of the West Midlands, the North West,
Yorkshire and Humberside, and the North
continue to represent the largest
concentrations of manufacturing industry.
In agriculture, dairying is most common in
the west of England; sheep and cattle are
reared in the hilly and moorland areas of the
North and South West. Arable farming, pig
and poultry farming and horticulture are
concentrated in the east and south.
Horticulture is also important in the West
Midlands. The principal fishing ports are on
the east coast and in the South West.
England has plentiful energy resources in
its coalfields and has access to offshore oil
and gas reserves. Important mineral deposits
include sand, gravel and crushed rock used
by the construction industry; industrial
minerals include clay, salt from the North
West, china clay from Cornwall and gypsum
from the midlands, North and South East.
The motorway network comprises four
long-distance routes linking London and the
cities of the Midlands, the North and North
West and the South West, the London
orbital route, and over 30 shorter motorways.
Considerable investment is being made in
the railways, both to improve inter-city
services and to provide new rolling-stock for
local services. The cross-Channel railway
tunnel will link Britain with the European
rail system and also provide a vehicle shuttle
service on specially designed trains. Services
through the tunnel are planned to start in
autumn 1993.
The major airports are Heathrow (the
busiest international airport in the world) and
Gatwick, both serving London; and
Manchester, Birmingham, Luton and
Stansted.
Tourism and the leisure industries have
expanded in recent years. Over half of
expenditure by overseas visitors in Britain
takes place in London. The South West is the
most popular region for domestic tourism. Of
the many tourist attractions in England, the
most popular of those charging for admission
in 1991 were Madame Tussaud’s waxworks
in London, Alton Towers (Staffordshire) and
the Tower of London with 2 25, L97 and
L92 million visitors respectively. The English
Tourist Board and the other national tourist
boards have designated 1993 as ‘Industrial
Heritage Year’.
Cultural and Social Life
London has a concentration of cultural
features including four major art galleries and
many renowned museums, together with
theatrical, opera, ballet and concert venues.
Other major cities and towns also have a

broad range of cultural interests. xMany
theatres outside London are used for touring
by the national theatre, dance and opera
companies. Many regions and towns have
associations with great English writers and
artists, such as William Shakespeare
(Stratford-upon-Avon), William Wordsworth
(Lake District), Arnold Bennett (Stoke-on-
Trent), the Bronte sisters (Yorkshire),
Thomas Hardy (Dorset) and John Constable
(Essex and Suffolk).
Despite the relatively high population
density and degree of urbanisation, there are
still many unspoilt rural and coastal areas.
There are seven National Parks, six forest
parks, 34 designated ‘areas of outstanding
natural beauty’, ten environmentally sensitive
areas, almost 200 country parks approved by
the Countryside Commission, over 6,000
conservation areas, 800 km (500 miles) ol
designated heritage coastline, and about
2,000 historic buildings and over 3,000
gardens open to the public. There are also
safari and wildlife parks, and ‘theme’ parks,
all offering family activities and
entertainment.
WALES
Wales is a country of hills and mountains,
the highest of which are in Snowdonia in the
north west; the tallest peak is Snowdon
(1,085 m, 3,560 ft). Two-thirds of the
population lives in the southern valleys and
the lower-lying coastal areas. The chief
urban centres are Cardiff, Swansea, Newport
and Wrexham. Wales is a principality; Prince
Charles, the heir to the throne, was invested
by the Queen with the title of Prince of
Wales at Caernarfon Castle in 1969, when he
was 20.
Latest figures suggest that about one-fifth
of the population speaks Welsh, a language
of Celtic origin. Welsh speakers are
concentrated in the rural north and west.
The Welsh name of the country is Cymru.
Welsh has equal validity with English in law
courts; bilingual education in schools is
encouraged, and there has been an extended
use of Welsh for official purposes and in
broadcasting. A Welsh Language Board
advises on matters relating to the Welsh
language. The Government is proposing a
Welsh Language Bill designed to ensure that
Welsh speakers are able to use Welsh when
dealing with public authorities.
There is no established church, the
Anglican church having been disestablished
in 1920 following decades of pressure from
adherents of the Methodist and Baptist
churches. Methodism in particular spread
rapidly in Wales in the eighteenth century,
assuming the nature of a popular movement
among Welsh speakers and finding strong
support later in industrial communities.
Government
The country returns 38 Members of
Parliament and there are special arrangements
for the discussion of Welsh affairs. For the
last 60 years the industrial communities have
tended to support the Labour Party in
elections, ensuring a Labour majority of seats.
Following the 1992 general election, Wales
has 27 Labour Members of Parliament, 6
Conservative, 4 Plaid Cymru (Welsh
Nationalist) and 1 Liberal Democrat.
In 1992 the Government announced
proposals for fundamental changes to
the structure of local government in
Wales. The county authorities and
district councils would be replaced by
about 23 unitary authorities.
Discussions are in progress and a
White Paper and Bill are planned.
The Secretary of State for Wales, who is a
member of the Cabinet, has wide-ranging
responsibilities relating to the economy,
education, welfare services and the provision
of amenities. The headquarters of the
administration is the Welsh Office in Cardiff,
which also has an office in London. Local
government is exercised through a system of
elected authorities similar to that in England,
and the legal system is identical with the
English one.
The Economy
Recent decades have seen fundamental
changes in the basis of the Welsh economy.
LAND AND PEOPLE
The most notable features have been
expansion in service industries and the
development of a more diverse range of
manufacturing industries including many at
the forefront of technology. For example,
Wales is now an important centre for
electronics, information technology,
automotive components, chemicals and
materials, and new high-technology
businesses in related industries have been
established. In services (which account for
two-thirds of employment) the most marked
growth has been in financial and business
services, and leisure services. The traditional
industries of coal and steel have gradually
been contracting, although they continue to
modernise and improve efficiency and
productivity.
Wales has been particularly successful in
attracting investment by overseas companies.
In recent years it has regularly obtained
about 20 per cent of overseas inward
investment into Britain. A record 183 new
projects were secured from abroad and the
rest of Britain in 1991 and are expected to
lead to over 17,000 new jobs and more than
£860 million of capital investment.
Although south Wales remains the
principal industrial area, new industries and
firms have been introduced in north-east
Wales and light industry attracted to the
towns in mid- and north Wales rural areas.
The economic programmes of the Welsh
Office are complemented by the work of the
Welsh Development Agency, which has
wide powers to promote industrial and
environmental change. It expects to spend
£166 million in 1992-93. The south Wales
valleys is one of the main areas to have been
affected by the decline in traditional
industries. The Programme for the Valleys
is the most extensive programme of
economic and urban regeneration undertaken
in Wales. A development corporation has
been set up to stimulate the regeneration of
the Cardiff Bay area and its proposals
include a new barrage across the harbour
mouth. The regeneration is expected to
attract over £1,500 million of private
investment and to create over 25,000 new
jobs.
Agriculture occupies nearly 80 per cent of
the land area, the main activities being sheep
and cattle rearing in the hill regions and
dairy farming in the lowlands. Wales
accounts for over 20 per cent of the Forestry
Commission’s timber production.
The biggest pumped-storage power station
in Europe is at Dinorwig in Gwynedd. Good
communications exist in the south, with
motorway links across the Severn Bridge to
southern England and the Midlands, and
high-speed rail services to a number of
destinations in England. A second major
motorway crossing of the Severn is under
construction, with completion planned in
1996.
Tourism in Wales has expanded
substantially. With its coastal resorts, and
three National Parks (Snowdonia, the Brecon
Beacons and the Pembrokeshire Coast), as
well as other areas of picturesque hill, lake
and mountain country, Wales attracts many
tourists. ‘Garden Festival Wales’, a major
national tourism and leisure event, was held
at Ebbw Vale in spring and summer 1992.
Cultural and Social Life
Welsh literature is one of the oldest and
richest in Europe, and there is a national
library. The Welsh people also have strong
musical traditions; the country is well known
for its choral singing and the Welsh National
Opera has an international reputation. Special
festivals, known as eisteddfodau, encourage
Welsh literature and music. The largest is the
annual Royal National Eisteddfod, consisting
of competitions in music, singing, prose and
poetry entirely in Welsh. Artists from all over
the world come to the town of Llangollen for
the annual International Musical Eisteddfod.
An active local press includes a number of
Welsh language publications.
The education system is similar to that in
England, except for the teaching of Welsh
which is a statutory subject within the
National Curriculum for schools in Wales.
The collegiate University of Wales, founded
in 1893, comprises six member institutions.
Among many sporting activities, there is
particular interest in rugby union football,
which has come to be regarded as the Welsh
national game.

BRITAIN 1993: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
SCOTLAND
Three-quarters of the population of Scotland
and most of the industrial towns are in the
central lowlands. The chief cities are
Edinburgh (the capital), Glasgow, Aberdeen
and Dundee. However, just over half of
Scotland consists of the sparsely populated
highlands and islands in the north. Scotland
contains large areas of unspoilt and wild
landscape, and the majority of Britain s
highest mountains—nearly 300 peaks over
913 m (3,000 ft). The highest are the
Grampians in the central highlands, with
Ben Nevis (1,343 m, 4,406 ft) the tallest
peak.
The established Church of Scotland is a
Protestant church which is Presbyterian in
form; it is governed by a hierarchy of church
courts, each of which includes lay people.
Government
There are special arrangements for the
conduct of Scottish affairs within the British
system of government and separate Acts of
Parliament are passed for Scotland where
appropriate. There are 72 Scottish seats in
the House of Commons. The general election
in April 1992 resulted in the election of 49
Labour Members of Parliament, 11
Conservative, 9 Liberal Democrat and 3
Scottish National.
Scottish administration is the
responsibility of the Secretary of State for
Scotland, a member of the Cabinet, working
through the Scottish Office, which has its
headquarters in Edinburgh and an office in
London.
Local government generally operates on a
two-tier basis broadly similar to that in
England and Wales. The three islands
councils (for Orkney, Shetland and the
Western Isles) are single-tier authorities. The
Government has announced its intention to
replace the two-tier structure by single-tier
local authorities throughout Scotland.
The principles and procedures of the
Scottish legal system differ in many respects
from those of England and Wales. These
differences stem, in part, from the adoption
of elements of other European legal
systems, based on Roman law, during the
sixteenth century.
The Economy
Scotland has experienced the same pressure
on its traditional industries as the north of
England and Wales. However, in recent years
economic growth in Scotland has been
greater than in Britain as a whole and it has
been less affected by the recent recession
than other areas. The most significant
economic development has been the impact
since the early 1970s of the discovery of oil
and gas under the northern North Sea. Up to
about 100,000 jobs are estimated to have
arisen directly or indirectly as a result of
North Sea activities.
As traditional industries, such as coal, steel
and shipbuilding, have declined, rapid growth
has occurred in industries such as chemicals,
electronic engineering, food, drink and
tobacco, and lighter forms of mechanical and
instrument engineering. The electronics
industry, which includes many of the world’s
leading companies in this field, provides 13
per cent of jobs in manufacturing and 20 per
cent of output and investment. By mid-1990
about 210 plants were employing some 47,000
workers, one of the biggest concentrations of
the electronics industry in Western Europe.
Scotland accounts for more than half of
Britain’s output of integrated circuits and for
over 10 per cent of European output.
Some traditional industries, such as high-
quality tweeds and other textiles, and food
and drink products, remain important. The
Scotch whisky industry had exports of over
£1,712 million in 1990.
A marked expansion in services including
banking, finance and insurance has occurred,
and about 70 per cent of the workforce are
now engaged in services. Tourism and leisure
make a significant contribution, directly
providing over 155,000 jobs.
Government measures have helped to
attract firms to Scotland, and investment by
overseas companies has helped to make a
significant contribution to the growth of
modern technologically based industries.
Recent changes to the mechanism for
government support for enterprise and
10
LAND AND PEOPLE
training led in 1991 to the creation of
Scottish Enterprise and Highlands and
Islands Enterprise, which both have general
functions in economic development, training
and environmental improvement in the
Scottish lowlands and the Highlands and
Islands respectively. They contract with 22
Local Enterprise Companies (led by the
private sector) which arrange the provision of
training and business support.
Scotland has about one-third of Britain’s
agricultural land, but 70 per cent consists of
rough grazing (including common grazing) for
cattle and sheep. About 11 per cent of the
agricultural area is used for crops. The
principal crop is barley, which is used in the
making of whisky and beer. Scotland accounts
for nearly half of Britain’s forest area and for
over one-third of timber production. The
bulk of new planting in Britain takes place in
Scotland, mostly in the upland and mountain
areas. Fishing remains an important activity;
about 75 per cent of total landings of Fish in
Britain are made at Scottish ports.
Nuclear and hydro-electric generation
supply a higher proportion of energy than in
any other part of Britain. About 40 per cent
of Scotland’s electricity comes from nuclear
power, with hydro-power and other
renewables contributing a further 10 per cent.
Communications, both domestic and
international, have improved in many parts of
Scotland. The electrification scheme of the
Edinburgh to London rail line was completed
in 1991. Further improvements are planned
in the strategic trunk road network.
Cultural and Social Life
One of the major contributions to the arts is
the annual Edinburgh International Festival,
one of the world’s leading cultural events.
Held annually in August, it is the largest of
its kind in the world. Since 1982 Glasgow has
also held its own international arts festival,
the Mayfest, which is now the second largest
festival in Britain. Scotland possesses a
number of major collections of the fine and
applied arts. A new Museum of Scotland is to
be built in Edinburgh to house the National
Museums’ Scottish collection.
Gaelic, a language of ancient Celtic origin,
is spoken by some 80,000 people; the greatest
concentration of Gaelic speakers is in the
islands of the Hebrides.
An active press includes six national daily
morning newspapers, six local evening
newspapers and four national Sunday
newspapers. Television programmes are
produced by BBC Scotland and by three
independent companies, covering the high¬
land, lowland and border regions. BBC Radio
Scotland covers most of the population.
The concept of universal education was
accepted in Scotland as early as the sixteenth
century. The Scottish education system has a
number of distinctive features, for example
on examinations. Four universities—St
Andrews, Glasgow, Aberdeen and
Edinburgh—were established in the fifteenth
century, and four more in the 1960s. Many
Scots have achieved eminence in arts and
sciences.
Over 57 per cent of Scotland’s housing
has been built since 1945, a higher proportion
than in either England or Wales. The tenure
pattern is very different from that in the rest
of Britain, with 42 per cent of housing rented
from the public sector, compared with 25 per
cent for Great Britain as a whole. As in the
rest of Britain, there has been a noticeable
growth in owner-occupied housing in recent
years. Some areas, particularly peripheral
housing estates and inner city areas, have
been affected by urban deprivation. A
number of projects are in hand to tackle the
problems, including a series of partnerships
between the Scottish Office and other groups
including local communities and the private
sector.
The sport of golf originated in Scotland,
and courses at St Andrews, Gleneagles,
Turnberry, Muirfield, Troon and Prestwick
are internationally renowned. There are also
winter sports centres at Aviemore, Glenshee,
Glen Coe, Aonach Mhor and the Lecht.
NORTHERN IRELAND
Northern Ireland 1 is at its nearest point only
21 km (13 miles) from Scotland. It has a
1 For further details see Northern Ireland (Aspects of Britain:
HMSO, 1992).
11
BRITAIN 1993: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
488-km (303-mile) border in the south and
west with the Irish Republic. At its centre lies
Lough Neagh, Britain’s largest freshwater
lake (381 sq km, 147 sq miles). Many of the
principal towns lie in valleys leading from the
Lough, including the capital, Belfast, which
stands at the mouth of the river Lagan. The
Mourne Mountains, rising sharply in the
south east, include Slieve Donard, Northern
Ireland’s highest peak (852 m, 2,796 ft).
Just under two-thirds of the population are
descendants of Scots or English settlers who
crossed to north-eastern Ireland mainly in the
seventeenth century; most are Protestants,
British by culture and tradition and
committed to maintaining the constitutional
link with the British Crown. The remainder,
just over a third, are Roman Catholic, Irish
by culture and history and favour union with
the Irish Republic.
Government
Background to Civil Disturbances
For 50 years from 1921 Northern Ireland had
its own devolved Parliament in which the
mainly Protestant Unionists consistently
formed the majority and therefore constituted
the Government after successive elections.
Nationalists resented this domination and
their effective exclusion from political office.
An active and articulate civil rights
movement emerged during the late 1960s.
Although reforms were made in response,
sectarian disturbances developed and this
required the introduction of Army troops in
1969 to support the police in keeping order.
Subsequently, sectarian divisions were
exploited by the actions of terrorists from
both sides, but most notably by the
Provisional Irish Republican Army, who
claimed to be protecting the Roman Catholic
minority.
From 1969 the Northern Ireland
Government enacted a number of reforms
aimed at securing the minority’s right to an
effective voice in public bodies. These
reforms included:
• the creation of a police authority
representative of all sections of the
community;
• the appointment of commissioners to
investigate complaints of
maladministration, including
discrimination, against government
departments and local authorities;
• the creation of a central housing
executive with responsibility for all
public sector house-building and for
allocating housing according to need; and
• a restructuring of local government,
including the franchise and arrangements
for reviewing local government
boundaries.
Direct Rule and Political Initiatives
Despite this reform programme, the inter-
communal violence continued, leading to a
decision by the British Government to take
over responsibility for law and order in 1972.
The Northern Ireland Government resigned
in protest against this decision and direct rule
began. Northern Ireland continues to be
governed by direct rule under legislation
passed in 1974. This allows the Parliament in
Westminster to approve all laws for Northern
Ireland and places its government
departments under the direction and control
of the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland
who is a Cabinet minister.
Legislation passed in 1973 and 1982
provided for a measure of devolved
government in Northern Ireland. This was
implemented in January 1974 following
agreement between Northern Ireland political
parties to form a power-sharing Executive.
The Executive, however, collapsed in May
1974 as a result of a protest strike by
‘loyalists’.
Attempts have been made by successive
British Governments to find a means of
restoring a widely acceptable form of
devolved government to Northern Ireland. A
78-member Assembly was elected by
proportional representation in 1982. Four
years later this was dissolved after it ceased to
discharge its responsibilities to make
proposals for the resumption of devolved
government and to monitor the work of the
Northern Ireland government departments.
One of the reasons for the Assembly’s
12
LAND AND PEOPLE
dissolution was in part the Unionists’ reaction
to the Anglo-Irish Agreement between the
British and Irish governments in November
1985.
The objectives of the Agreement are to:
• promote peace and stability in Northern
Ireland;
• create a new climate of friendship and co¬
operation between the peoples of Britain
and the Irish Republic; and
• improve co-operation in fighting
terrorism.
The Agreement commits both governments to
the principle that Northern Ireland shall
remain part of Britain for so long as that is
the wish of a majority. It recognises that at
present a majority there wishes to remain part
of Britain. Both governments have undertaken
that, should a majority in Northern Ireland
formally consent to the establishment of a
united Ireland, they would introduce and
support the necessary legislation. The
Agreement binds Britain and the Irish
Republic to these commitments in
international law.
The Agreement also established an Inter¬
governmental Conference through which the
Irish Government can put forward views and
proposals on specified matters affecting
Northern Ireland affairs. This only applies if
these matters are not the responsibility of a
devolved administration in Northern Ireland
and where cross border co-operation can be
promoted in the interests of both countries.
Each government retains sovereignty and full
responsibility for decisions and administration
within its own jurisdiction.
The British Government remains
committed to the principle of a locally
accountable administration acceptable to, and
enjoying the support of, both sections of the
community. In March 1991 the Northern
Ireland Secretary announced, following
lengthy consultations with the four main
constitutional parties—the Ulster Unionists,
Democratic Unionists, Alliance Party and
Social Democratic and Labour Party—that
agreement had been reached on a basis for
formal political talks. This agreement
envisaged that any talks would take place
during an interval between Inter¬
governmental Conferences, held under the
Anglo-Irish Agreement, and that they would
consider three sets of relationships relevant to
the Northern Ireland problem: those between
the two main traditions in Northern Ireland,
between the peoples of the island of Ireland
as a whole, and between the two
governments. It was further agreed that the
talks would take place in three phases or
‘strands’ corresponding to the three sets of
relationships. The British and Irish
governments also made clear that they were
prepared to consider a new and more broadly
based Anglo-Irish Agreement if one could be
arrived at through direct discussion and
negotiation in the talks.
Discussions in the first strand began in
Belfast on 30 April 1991 between the British
Government and the constitutional parties.
After procedural issues had been resolved,
there were useful discussions between the
parties, among other things about the
identities of the two traditions in Northern
Ireland. The talks were concluded on 3 July
1991.
During the autumn and winter of 1991 the
British Government sought agreement on a
basis for new talks; these subsequently began
in Belfast on 9 March 1992. The British
Government and the four Northern Ireland
parties undertook intensive consideration,
during May and June, of the relationships
between the two main parts of the
community in Northern Ireland and the
nature of new political institutions which
might command widespread support.
On 6 July the talks moved into the second
strand, when the Irish Government joined
the discussions. The talks in this strand are
being overseen by an independent chairman.
The third strand began in Dublin on 28 July
■with a meeting between the two governments.
The talks are scheduled to run into
November 1992.
Northern Ireland returns 17 members to
the United Kingdom Parliament. In the most
recent general election in April 1992 the
Ulster Unionists won 9 seats, the Democratic
Unionists 3, the Ulster Popular Unionists 1
and the Social and Democratic Labour Party
4. The Sinn Fein member lost his seat. The
Alliance Party, set up to offer an alternative
13
BRITAIN 1993: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
to unionist and nationalist parties, did not
obtain a seat.
Human Rights
The Government is committed to the
protection of human rights in Northern
Ireland. Legislation passed in 1973 outlaws
discrimination by public bodies, including the
Government, on the grounds of religious
belief or political opinion. It also set up the
independent Standing Advisory Commission
on Human Rights, which advises the
Government on the effectiveness of anti-
discrimination legislation and on other human
rights issues. In 1987 a central community
relations unit was established within the
Government to advise on the impact ot
government policies and programmes on
community relations and to bring forward
ideas on future action.
Direct and indirect discrimination in
employment by public and private employers
is also illegal. Legislation passed in 1976
made discrimination on the grounds of
religion or politics unlawful and established a
Fair Employment Agency to promote equal
opportunities and work towards the
eradication of discrimination.
New laws came into effect in 1990. These
strengthened the 1976 measures by requiring
employers to:
• monitor the religious composition of their
workforce and job applicants;
• take firm action, where necessary, to
provide for a fair distribution of jobs
between the two communities;
and
• review their employment practices every
three years.
The legislation also provides for fines and
economic sanctions against employers found
guilty of bad practice.
The Fair Employment Agency was
renamed as the Fair Employment
Commission which has increased powers and
resources to enable it to investigate
employment practices, prescribe affirmative
measures and offer advice and guidance. The
new Fair Employment Tribunal deals with
individual complaints of alleged
discrimination and appeals by employers
against directions of the Commission.
The effectiveness of the legislation will be
formally reviewed after five years.
Security Policy
While terrorism continues, certain emergency
powers are in force. These include special
powers of arrest in respect of certain serious
crimes, non-jury courts to try certain terrorist
offences, and the banning of terrorist
organisations. The powers are balanced by
specific safeguards; the measures are
temporary, need annual renewal by
Parliament and are subject to annual
independent review.
Most traditional rights, including
freedom from persecution and freedom of
speech, remain in force. The Government
has, however, issued restrictions on the
broadcasting on television and radio of
direct statements made by representatives
of terrorist organisations or their
supporters.
The security forces are accountable to the
law; if they break it, their members are liable
to prosecution like any other members of the
community. An independent police
complaints commission supervises police
investigations into more serious complaints
and, at its discretion, the investigation of
others. Northern Ireland’s legal system, and
the safeguards it enshrines, are broadly
similar to those in England and Wales.
The use of violence has been condemned
by the overwhelming majority of people
living in Northern Ireland and, although
terrorism continues, the overall level of
violence is lower than in the early 1970s.
Since 1969 some 3,000 people have been
killed as a result of terrorist campaigns. The
police take the primary role in maintaining
order; the Army’s task is one of assisting the
civil authorities. Terrorists are brought to
justice through the courts and are tried for
criminal offences, not political beliefs.
The Economy
Around a half of the population and most
industry are settled on the eastern
14
LAND AND PEOPLE
seaboard, the centre of which is Belfast.
The remainder of Northern Ireland is
predominantly rural in character.
The province had a gross domestic
product of about £10,000 million in 1990
and a working population of some 702,000 in
1991. Trends in output, employment and
unemployment tend to reflect overall trends
in Britain. Almost half of manufacturing
output is sold to the rest of Britain and a
quarter is sold locally.
Total employment increased by 1-2 per
cent between 1979 and 1990, although there
have been major changes in parts of the
economy. In the 1980s employment fell in
manufacturing and rose in services.
Unemployment is higher than in the rest of
Britain and reached 14-5 per cent in June
1992, compared with 9 5 per cent in Great
Britain.
An economic development strategy
published by the Government in 1990
concluded that long-term growth could only
be generated by improvements in
international competitiveness led by the
private sector. Its main features include:
• identifying and removing obstacles to
growth;
• an intensified drive for inward
investment;
• building up management and workforce
skills;
• stimulating the development of an
enterprise culture;
• giving a new impetus to support for
innovation and research and
development; and
• targeting programmes, where necessary,
on areas of social and economic
deprivation and on the needs of long¬
term unemployed people.
The execution of industrial development
policy is carried out by four agencies
associated with the Department of Economic
Development:
• the Industrial Development Board,
which deals with companies with more
than 50 employees and with inward
investment;
• the Local Enterprise Development Unit,
which is responsible for promoting
enterprise and the development of small
businesses employing up to \50
employees;
• the Training and Employment Agency,
which is responsible for developing the
workforce through training; and
• the Industrial Research and Technology
Unit, which provides advice and
assistance to encourage research and
development and technology transfer.
Considerable public expenditure is devoted
to urban renewal in Belfast and Londonderry.
The Department of the Environment has a
grant scheme which has generated over
£256 million of private investment at a
private/public funding ratio of over 3:1. In
addition, under the Making Belfast Work
Programme for the period from 1988 and
1994, over £100 million has been made
available to increase jobs and businesses,
improve training, and make improvements to
the environment and living conditions. There
is also a government and private scheme
designed to redevelop the banks of the river
Lagan in the heart of the city. In
Londonderry there is a town centre
development programme and community
action to create more jobs.
Northern Ireland has parity with England,
Scotland and Wales on taxation and services.
The British Government makes a
contribution (£2,549 million in 1991-92) to
maintain social services at the level of those
in Great Britain, to meet the cost of security
measures and to compensate for the natural
disadvantages of geography and lack of
resources. The Government has a programme
designed to focus resources on those suffering
the highest level of social and economic
disadvantage.
In 1986 the British and Irish governments
established the International Fund for Ireland
to promote social and economic advance.
Some three-quarters of the Fund is spent in
Northern Ireland, the rest going to border
areas in the Republic. Programmes financed
by the Fund cover business enterprise,
tourism, community relations, urban
development, agriculture and rural
15
BRITAIN 1993: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
development. Donors to the Fund include the
United States, the European Community,
Canada and New Zealand.
Cultural and Social Life
Northern Ireland’s heritage is preserved and
portrayed by the Ulster Museum in Belfast
and the Ulster Folk and Transport Museum
in County Down and by a number of smaller
museums and interpretive centres. The
Ulster-American Folk Park specialises in the
history of Irish emigration to America; it is
developing an extensive computer database on
emigrants which will be available to the
public.
Local arts festivals are an important
feature of the arts calendar, the highlight
being the Belfast Festival based at Queen’s
University. A success story has been the
development of the Ulster Orchestra as a
major musical force. Government support for
the arts is channelled through the Northern
Ireland Arts Council which gives financial
help and advice to opera and drama
companies, orchestras and festivals, arts
centres, writers and artistic groups; the
Council has its own gallery in Belfast.
Leisure facilities include 50 centres and 40
swimming pools. Government funds are
provided through the Sports Council for
Northern Ireland.
Health and personal social services
correspond fairly closely to those in the rest
of Britain, although the administrative system,
is different.
Although publicly maintained schools must
be open to children from all religions, in
practice Roman Catholic and Protestant
children are mainly educated in separate
schools. A common curriculum is, however,
being introduced and this includes history
courses designed to help pupils gain a better
understanding of the two traditions in
Northern Ireland. There are about 16
integrated schools providing education for
some 2,800 Protestant and Roman Catholic
children and this process is being encouraged
by the Government.
In the last ten years the housing stock has
increased by about 12 per cent and owner-
occupation from 54 per cent to 65 per cent.
The Housing Executive is the sole public
housing authority and allocates homes to
those in greatest need.
Local television and radio programmes are
broadcast and there is a local press. National
television and radio broadcasts are also
received and the national press is sold widely.
The Social Framework
The underlying causes of the changing
lifestvle in Britain in the second half of the
twentieth century include a lower birth rate,
longer life expectancy, a higher divorce
rate, wider educational opportunities,
technological progress and a higher standard
of living.
POPULATION
According to mid-1990 estimates, Britain’s
population is 5/4 million. It ranks sixteenth
in the world in terms of population. Statistics
are derived from the census of population
(taken every ten years), with allowance for
subsequent births and deaths (obtained from
compulsory registration) and migration. The
1991 census included for the first time a
question on ethnic grouping.
The British population is expected, on
mid-1989 based projections, to be 59 2
million in 2001 and 60 million in 2011.
Birth Rates
In 1991 there were 792,500 live births,
slightly fewer than in 1990 but above the
level of the late 1980s. The total period
fertility rate (an indication of the average
family size) remains below 21, the level
leading to the long-term replacement of the
population, although it is projected to
increase from F8 in 1989 to 2 for women
born in or after 1980.
Contributory factors to the relatively low
birth rate in recent years (13-8 live births per
1,000 population in 1991) include:
• the trends towards later marriage and
towards postponing births, which have
led to an increase in the average age of
women having children—27 5 years in
1990 compared with 26-7 in 1980;
16
LAND AND PEOPLE
• the current preference for smaller families
than in the past, which has led to a
significant decline in the proportion of
families with four or more children. In
1990, 65 per cent of families consisted of
a married couple with one or two
dependent children, compared with 14
per cent of families consisting of a
married couple with three or more
dependent children; and
• more widespread and effective
contraception, making it easier to plan
families. Voluntary sterilisation for men
and women has also become more
common.
Mortality
At birth the expectation of life for a man is
about 73 years and for a woman 78 years,
compared with 49 years for men and 52 years
for women in 1901. There has only been a
small increase in life expectancy in the older
age groups.
The general death rate has remained
roughly the same for the past 40 years, at
about 12 per 1,000 population, although in
recent years it has been nearer to 11 per
1,000 population. There has been a decline in
mortality at most ages, particularly among
children. The infant mortality rate (deaths of
infants under one year old per 1,000 live
births) was 7-4 in 1991; neonatal mortality
(deaths of infants under four weeks old per
1,000 live births) was 4-4 in 1991; and
maternal mortality is about 0 07 per 1,000
total births. The decline in mortality reflects
better nutrition, rising standards of living, the
advance of medical science, the growth of
medical facilities, improved health measures,
better working conditions, education in
personal hygiene and the smaller size of
families.
Deaths caused by circulatory diseases
(including heart attacks and strokes) now
account for nearly half of all deaths, and
mortality from heart disease in England and
Wales remains high compared with that of
other developed countries. The next largest
cause of death is cancer, which is responsible
for nearly one-quarter of deaths.
Cigarette smoking is the greatest
preventable cause of illness and death in
Britain. However, there has been a significant
decline in the incidence of smoking, with 31
per cent of adult males and 29 per cent of
adult females smoking cigarettes in 1990, as
against 52 and 41 per cent respectively in
1972. In July 1992 the Government set out
strategies in England and Scotland for
continuing the overall improvement in health,
emphasising disease prevention and health
promotion.
The Government is pursuing a
comprehensive strategy against drug misuse
in Britain. Initiatives are aimed at reducing
both the supply of, and demand for, drugs. A
number of government priorities, to support
the overall aims of improving the country’s
health and providing high-quality care for
those who need it, have been listed.
Marriage and Divorce
In 1990 there were 375,400 marriages in
Britain, of which 36 per cent were
remarriages of one or both parties. Some 34
per cent of all marriages in 1991 were
remarriages where one or both parties had
been divorced. Of the population aged 16 or
over in England and Wales in 1990, 58 per
cent were married, 27 per cent single, 9 per
cent widowed and 6 per cent divorced. The
average age for first marriages in England and
Wales is now about 26-1 for men and 24 3 for
women.
In 1990 about 13 decrees of divorce were
made absolute for every 1,000 married couples
in England and Wales. The rates are lower in
Scotland and Northern Ireland. In 1990,
153,400 divorces were granted in England
and Wales. The average age of people at the
time of divorce in England and Wales is now
about 38-4 for men and 35 9 for women.
Another feature, common to many other
Western European countries, has been an
increase in cohabitation. Nearly half of
women aged 16 to 55 in Great Britain
marrying during the period 1985 to 1989,
where the marriage was the first for both
parties, had lived with their husbands before
marriage (compared with 7 per cent for those
married in the early 1970s). About 17 per
17
BRITAIN 1993: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
cent of non-married women aged 16 to 59
were cohabiting during 1990. Cohabitation
occurs more frequently for separated or
divorced women than for single women.
There is some evidence of a growing
number of stable non-married relationships.
Half of all births outside marriage (which
now account for 28 per cent of live births in
Britain) are registered by both parents giving
a single address as their place of residence.
Age and Sex Structure
The total population has remained relatively
stable over the last decade. The proportion of
young people aged under 16 fell steadily in
the early 1980s, but numbers in this age
group have increased slightly in the last two
years. The proportion of elderly people,
especially those aged 85 and over, has
continued to increase. The age distribution of
the British population in mid-1990 was
estimated as follows:
• 20-2 per cent under 16 years of age;
• 64-1 per cent between 16 and 64 years;
and
• 15-7 per cent aged 65 and over.
Some 18 per cent of the population were over
the normal retirement ages (65 for men and
60 for women), compared with 15 per cent
in 1961.
There is a ratio of about 105 females to
every 100 males. There are about 5 per cent
more male than female births every year.
Because of the higher mortality of men at all
ages, there is a turning point, at about 50
years of age, beyond which the number of
women exceeds the number of men. This
imbalance increases with age so that there are
many more women among the elderly.
Distribution of Population
The population density is about 237
inhabitants per sq km, which is well above
the European Community average of about
145 per sq km. Of the four lands, England is
the most densely populated with 367 people
per sq km. Scotland is the least densely
populated with 66 people per sq km. Wales
and Northern Ireland have 139 and 113
people per sq km respectively.
Since the nineteenth century there has
been a trend, especially in London, for
people to move away from congested urban
centres into the suburbs. There has also been
a geographical redistribution of the
population from Scotland and the northern
regions of England to the South East, East

Anglia, the South West and the East
Midlands in recent decades. An increase in
the rate of retirement migration has also
occurred, the main recipient areas (where in
some towns the retired constitute over one-
quarter of the population) being the south
coast of England and East Anglia.
Migration
From 1987 to 1991 nearly 11 million people
left Britain (excluding the Channel Islands
and the Isle of Man) to live abroad and about
1-2 million came from overseas to live in
Britain, so that net immigration increased the
population by about 89,000. (These figures
exclude migration to and from the Irish
Republic.)
In 1991 the total inflow of people
intending to stay in Britain was 267,000, the
same as in 1990. The outflow of people
leaving to live abroad, at 239,000, was 3 per
cent higher than in 1990.
Of the 239,000 departing residents in 1991:
• 27 per cent left for Australia, Canada or
New Zealand;
• 15 per cent for other Commonwealth
countries;
• 30 per cent for other European
Community countries;
• 13 per cent for the United States;
• 5 per cent for the Middle East; and
• 3 per cent for South Africa.
Of the 267,000 new residents in 1991:
• 18 per cent came from Australia, Canada
or New Zealand;
• 25 per cent from other Commonwealth
countries;
• 27 per cent from other European
Community countries;
• 9 per cent from the United States;
• 3 per cent from the Middle East; and
• 3 per cent from South Africa.
Nationality
Under the British Nationality Act 1981 there
are three main forms of citizenship:
• British citizenship for people closely
connected with Britain, the Channel
Islands, and the Isle of Man;
• British Dependent Territories citizenship
for people connected with the dependent
territories; and
• British Overseas citizenship for those
citizens of the United Kingdom and
Colonies who did not acquire either of
the other citizenships when the 1981 Act
came into force.
British citizenship is acquired
automatically at birth by a child born in
Britain if his or her father or mother is a
British citizen or is settled in Britain. A child
adopted in Britain by a British citizen is a
British citizen. A child born abroad to a
British citizen born, adopted, naturalised or
registered in Britain is a British citizen by
descent. The Act safeguards the citizenship
of a child born abroad to a British citizen in
Crown service, certain related services, or in
service under a European Community
institution.
British citizenship may also be acquired:
• by registration of certain children,
including those born in Britain who do
not automatically acquire such citizenship
at birth or who have been born abroad to
a parent who is a citizen by descent;
• by British Dependent Territories citizens,
British Overseas citizens, British subjects
under the Act (three very limited
categories), and British Nationals
(Overseas) and British protected persons
after five years’ residence in Britain
(except for people from Gibraltar, who
may be registered without residence); and
• by naturalisation for Commonwealth
citizens, citizens of the Irish Republic,
and foreign nationals aged 18 or over.
Naturalisation is at the Home Secretary’s
discretion: it requires five years’ residence,
good character, sound mind, the intention to
have one’s home in Britain thereafter and
sufficient knowledge of English, Welsh or
Scottish Gaelic, except for the spouse of a
British citizen, who needs only three years’
residence and no language or future
intentions qualification.
19
BRITAIN 1993: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Legislation passed in 1983 conferred
British citizenship on those Falkland Islanders
who did not acquire it under the 1981 Act.
Special arrangements covering the status of
British Dependent Territories citizens
connected with Hong Kong when the
territory returns to the People’s Republic of
China in 1997 are made by the Hong Kong
(British Nationality) Order 1986. Under this,
such citizens are entitled, before 1997, to
acquire a status known as British National
(Overseas) and to hold a passport in that
status. In addition, the British Nationality
(Hong Kong) Act 1990 made provision for
the registration as British citizens before 30
June 1997 of up to 50,000 persons who are
able to meet certain criteria and who are
recommended by the Governor.
In 1991, 58,600 people acquired British
citizenship by naturalisation or registration in
Britain.
Immigration
Immigration into Britain is controlled under
the Immigration Rules made in accordance
with legislation passed in the 1970s and
1980s.
British citizens under the British
Nationality Act 1981 and those
Commonwealth citizens who had the right of
abode before 1 January 1983 (when the 1981
Act came into force) maintain the right of
abode and are not subject to immigration
control. Those who do not have this right
require permission to enter and remain in
Britain; this is given in accordance with the
Immigration Rules, which are subject to the
scrutiny of Parliament and which set out the
requirements to be met by those seeking
entry or to remain for a further period.
The nationals of certain specified countries
or territorial entities must obtain a visa before
they can enter Britain. Other nationals subject
to immigration control require entry clearance
when coming to work or to settle in Britain.
Visas and other entry clearances are normally
obtained from the nearest British diplomatic
post in a person’s home country.
In accordance with Britain’s obligations
under the Treaty of Rome, European
Community nationals do not require entry
clearances, nor are they subject to restrictions
on their freedom to take or seek work in
Britain. Britain similarly respects its
obligations under the United Nations
Convention and Protocol relating to the
Status of Refugees. These include granting
refugees the right of access to courts and the
right to work, to education, to social security
and to freedom of religion.
In 1991, 81 million foreign and
Commonwealth nationals (excluding
European Community nationals) were
admitted to Britain and 53,900 persons were
accepted for settlement.
THE ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL
PATTERN
The average size of households in Great
Britain has fallen from over four people in
1911 to 3 09 in 1961 and 2-48 in 1991. The
fall reflects a greater number of people living
on their own (11 per cent), or in one-parent
families, the increasing number of old people
(more of whom are living alone) and the
preference for smaller families.
Housing, Transport and the
Environment
A large proportion of households, 67 per
cent, own or are buying their own homes.
Owner-occupation is higher among married
couples than for single, divorced or widowed
household heads. The number of owner-
occupied dwellings rose from over 4 million
in 1951 to over 15 million in 1990. Four-
fifths of British households live in houses
rather than flats.
An important influence on the planning of
housing and services has been the growth of
car ownership; in 1991, 67 per cent of
households had the use of at least one car or
van, including 23 per cent with the use of
two or more. Greater access to motorised
transport and the construction of a network
of modern trunk roads and motorways have
resulted in a considerable increase in personal
mobility and changed leisure patterns. Most
detached or semi-detached houses in new
suburban estates have garages. Out-of-town

shopping centres, often including large
supermarkets and do-it-yourself stores,
are usually planned with the motorist in
mind.
The growth in car ownership has brought
great benefits but also a number of problems,
notably, in many towns and cities, increased
congestion, noise and air pollution arising
from motor vehicle emissions. Cars, taxis and
motor cycles accounted for 86 per cent of all
passenger transport in Great Britain in 1990,
compared with 55 per cent in 1961. To
relieve road congestion, the Government
regards carefully targeted improvements to
the road system as essential.
century. According to a United Nations
report on human development published in
1992, Britain ranked tenth out of 160
countries on a human development index that
combines life expectancy, education levels
and basic purchasing power.
Britain has also performed well
economically. Growth between 1980 and 1990
was higher than in all other major European
Community countries except Spain. In the
early 1990s Britain and many other
industrialised countries have been affected by
recession. Gross domestic product in Britain
grew by 0 8 per cent in 1990, but declined by
2 4 per cent in 1991.

vegetables and fruit, while home consumption
per person of mutton and lamb, beef and
veal, bread, potatoes, eggs, milk, butter,

However, another feature has been an
increase in the number of meals eaten away
from home, either at work or in restaurants,
and a growth in the consumption of food
from ‘take-away’ and ‘fast-food’ shops. In
addition, the proportion of convenience foods
eaten has grown as women who work outside
the home and single people living alone have
less time or inclination to prepare meals.
Average mineral and nutrient intakes are
generally above the daily amounts
recommended by the Department of Health.
There has been a steady fall in fat intakes,
and a small increase in the intake of fibre.
There is some evidence that health
considerations influence food consumption.
The Government encourages the widest
availability of wholesome food, while giving
high priority to consumer safety.
The Food Safety Act 1990 covers all of
Great Britain. It
• strengthens the enforcement of existing
law;
• gives powers for immediate closure of
food premises when the public health is
at risk;
• extends controls throughout the food
chain;
• enables detailed legislation to be
introduced to keep pace with new
technology; and
• increases the penalties for food safety
offences.
There has been little change in alcohol
consumption in recent years. Beer, lager (now
estimated to account for over half of beer
sales) and cider are the most popular drinks
among male drinkers whose overall
consumption is significantly higher than that
of women. The largest consumers of alcohol
are those aged 18 to 24, with consumption
generally declining with age. Consumption of
light (table) wine has grown, although there
has been little change in the consumption of
higher strength wines such as sherry and
port. The pattern of spirits consumption has
also been changing, with a decline in whisky
and gin, and higher consumption of some
other spirits.
A high proportion of beer is drunk in
public houses (‘pubs’), a traditional social
centre for many people, and in clubs. The
Licensing Act 1988 relaxed restrictions on the
opening hours of public houses, but this has
not resulted in a significant increase in
consumption. There are signs that they are
becoming more popular with families: more
meals are being served and the consumption
of non-alcoholic drinks is increasing.
The Workforce
In recent years the economic activity rate (the
proportion in work or looking for work) has
been increasing, although there was a slight
fall in 1991. Of those aged 16 and over, 75
per cent of men and 53 per cent of women
were economically active. The rate is higher
for married women (59 per cent) than for
non-married women (44 per cent). While
employment in Great Britain rose by 7 per
cent between 1984 and 1991, there was a
much larger increase—27 per cent—in the
number of self-employed.
The educational standards of adults have
risen. Over 70 per cent of the workforce has
a qualification, compared with 54 per cent in
1981. Some 17 per cent of those in
employment are graduates, including over
one-quarter of those with managerial or
professional jobs.
Income and Wealth
Earnings from employment are the main
source of income for most people; in 1990
wages and salaries accounted for 59 per cent
of household income.
The distribution of pre-tax income has
remained relatively stable over a long period,
the lower 50 per cent of income earners
accounting for some 22 to 24 per cent of pre¬
tax income since 1949. The combined effect
of the tax system and the receipt of benefits
is to redistribute incomes on a more equal
basis.
Wealth is less evenly distributed, with the
richest 1 per cent of the population aged 18
or over owning 18 per cent of marketable
22
LAND AND PEOPLE
wealth in 1989, and the richest 10 per cent
having 53 per cent. The inclusion of ‘non-
marketable’ rights in occupational and state
pension schemes reduces these shares
substantially, to 11 and 38 per cent
respectively. Since the mid-1970s there has
been little change in the distribution of
marketable wealth.
A growing proportion of personal wealth—
37 per cent in 1989—is in dwellings. The
proportion of net wealth held in shares
declined up to 1984, but has since increased.
The Government’s privatisation programme
has had a major effect on the pattern of share
ownership. In early 1992 over one-fifth of the
adult population in Great Britain owned
shares, compared with one in 13 people in
1979.
Women
The economic and domestic lives of women
have been transformed in the twentieth
century. These changes are due partly to the
removal of much of sex discrimination in
political and legal rights. At the heart of
women’s changed role has been the rise in the
number of women, especially married women,
at work. With later marriages and the
availability of effective contraception there has
been a decline in family size. Women are
involved in childbearing for a shorter time and
this, together with technological advances
which have made housework less onerous and
time-consuming, has made it possible for
women with children to combine child-rearing
with paid employment. The growth of part-
time and flexible working patterns, and
training and retraining schemes, allows more
women to take advantage of employment
opportunities.
Women make up more than two-fifths of
the workforce. Over two-thirds of non-married
women work full time, compared with under
half of married women. Married women are
most likely to be in full-time work if they are
aged 16 to 29 with no children. More than
two-fifths of all women in employment work
part-time, representing almost nine-tenths of
all part-time workers.
Although equal pay legislation was intended
to narrow the gap, there is still a difference
between men’s and women’s earnings. In
1991 women’s average hourly earnings were
78 per cent of men’s. Women’s wages remain
relatively low because they tend to work in
the lower-paid sectors of the economy and
work fewer hours than men (the latter
because of their domestic commitments). A
major reform in the taxation of women came
into effect in 1990, when their earnings began
to be taxed separately rather than being
treated as part of their husbands’ income for
tax purposes.
In April 1992 the Department of
Employment assumed responsibility for co¬
ordinating policy and strategy on women’s
issues. The Secretary of State set up a
working group to advise on practical
measures to extend equal opportunities for
women in the workplace and elsewhere.
In October 1991 the Government, as an
employer, joined the ‘Opportunity 2000’
campaign, an employer-led initiative to
increase the quantity and quality of women’s
participation in the workforce. Within six
months of the launch, membership had
doubled, with some 20 per cent of the
workforce being covered by the campaign. By
joining the campaign, employers agree to set
voluntary goals to achieve the aims of the
campaign.
Equal Opportunities
The Sex Discrimination Acts 1975 and 1986
make discrimination, in certain circumstances,
between men and women unlawful in
employment, education, training and the
provision of housing, goods, facilities and
services. Discriminatory job recruitment
advertisements are also unlawful. Complaints
of discrimination concerning employment are
dealt with by industrial tribunals; other
complaints are taken before county courts in
England and Wales or the Sheriff Court in
Scotland. Under the Equal Pay Act 1970, as
amended in 1984, women in Great Britain are
entitled to equal pay with men when doing
work that is the same or broadly similar, or
work which is rated as equivalent or work
which is of equal value. Parallel legislation on
sex discrimination and equal pay is in
operation in Northern Ireland.
BRITAIN 1993: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
The Equal Opportunities Commission, set
up in 1975 (1976 in Northern Ireland under
separate laws), has powers to enforce some
parts of the Sex Discrimination and Equal
Pay Acts. Its statutory duties are to work
towards the elimination of sex discrimination
and to promote equality of opportunity. The
Commission may advise people of their rights
under the Acts and may give financial or
other assistance to help individuals conduct a
case before a court or tribunal. It is
empowered to carry out formal investigations
and issue notices requiring discriminatory
practices to stop. The Commission also keeps
sex discrimination and equal pay legislation
under review and submits proposals for
amending it to the Government.
Ethnic and National Minorities
For centuries people from overseas have
settled in Britain, either to escape political or
religious persecution or in search of better
economic opportunities.2
The Irish have long formed a large section
of the population. Jewish refugees who came
to Britain towards the end of the nineteenth
century and in the 1930s were followed by
other European refugees after 1945.
Substantial immigration from the Caribbean
and the South Asian sub-continent dates
principally from the 1950s and 1960s. There
are also sizeable groups from the United
States and Canada, as well as Australians,
Chinese, Greek and Turkish Cypriots,
Italians and Spaniards. More recently people
from Latin America, Indo-China and Sri
Lanka have sought refuge in Britain.
In 1989-91, according to the results of the
Labour Force Survey, the ethnic minority
population of Great Britain numbered about
2 7 million (some 4 9 per cent of the total
population), of whom 46 per cent were born
in Britain. Just over half of the ethnic
minority population was of Indian, Pakistani
or Bangladeshi origin; less than one-fifth was
of Afro-Caribbean ethnic origin; and over one
in ten was of mixed ethnic origin.
The survey also indicated that the
2For further information see Ethnic Minorities (Aspects of
Britain: HMSO, 1991).
proportion of men of working age in Great
Britain who were economically active was
higher among the white population (89 per
cent) than among those from minority ethnic
groups (84 per cent of Afro-Caribbeans and
Indians and 75 per cent of those of
Pakistani/Bangladeshi origin). Among women
the variation was greater: 76 per cent of those
from the Afro-Caribbean ethnic group were
economically active, compared with 72 per
cent in the white group, 60 per cent in the
Indian group and only 25 per cent in the
Pakistani/Bangladeshi group.
Alleviating Racial Disadvantage
Although many members of the black and
Asian communities are concentrated in the
inner cities, where there are problems of
deprivation and social stress, progress has
been made over the last 20 years in tackling
racial disadvantage in Britain.
Many individuals have achieved distinction
in their careers and in public life, and the
proportion of ethnic minority members
occupying professional and managerial
positions is increasing. In law, for example,
an estimated 6 per cent of practising
barristers are of ethnic minority origin. There
are at present six ethnic minority Members of
Parliament, and the number of ethnic
minority councillors in local government is
growing. There has also been an expansion of
commercial enterprise, and numerous self-
help projects in ethnic minority communities
have been established. Black competitors have
represented Britain in a range of sporting
activities, and ethnic minority talents in the
arts and in entertainment have increasingly
been recognised.
The principal means of combating
disadvantage is through the economic,
environmental, educational and health
programmes of central government and local
authorities. There are also special allocations,
mainly through Home Office grants and the
Urban Programme, which channel extra
resources into projects of specific benefit to
ethnic minorities. These include, for example,
the provision of specialist teachers for
children needing English language tuition,
business support services, and measures to
24
LAND AND PEOPLE
revive local economies and improve the inner
city environment. Cultural and recreational
schemes and the health and personal social
services also take account of the particular
needs of ethnic minorities.
The Government is encouraging the
development of black businesses in inner city
areas through the Ethnic Minority Business
Initiative. It is also promoting equal
opportunities for ethnic minorities through
training programmes, including greater
provision for unemployed people who need
training in English as a second language.
Ethnic Minorities and the Police
In recognition of the tensions that can arise
between the police and ethnic minorities,
there is statutory consultation between the
police and the community. In addition, liaison
work is undertaken in schools.
Police training in race relations has
received particular attention. A specialist unit,
launched in 1989 and run by an independent
company, provides police forces with practical
help and support in community and race
relations training.
Campaigns are run by the police to
encourage the recruitment of officers from
the ethnic minority communities and racially
discriminatory behaviour by officers has been
made an offence under the police discipline
code. All police forces are fully aware of the
need to respond to reports of racially
motivated crime as a priority.
Race Relations Act 1976
Equal opportunities policies are backed up by
legislation against racial discrimination. The
Race Relations Act 1976, which strengthened
previous legislation passed in the 1960s, makes
discrimination unlawful on grounds of colour,
race, nationality or ethnic or national origin in
the provision of goods, facilities and services,
in employment, in housing and in advertising.
The 1976 Act also gave complainants direct
access to civil courts and, for employment
complaints, to industrial tribunals.
It is a criminal offence to incite racial
hatred under the provisions of the Public
Order Act 1986.
Commission for Racial Equality
The Commission for Racial Equality was
established by the 1976 Act. It has power to
investigate unlawful discriminatory practices
and to issue non-discrimination notices,
requiring such practices to cease. It has an
important educational role and has issued
codes of practice in employment, education,
health care and housing. It also provides the
main advice to the general public about the
Race Relations Act and has discretion to
assist individuals with their complaints about
racial discrimination. In 1991 the Commission
registered 1,655 applications for assistance
and handled successfully 137 litigation cases.
It can also undertake or fund research.
The Commission supports the work of
over 80 race equality councils, which are
autonomous voluntary bodies set up in most
areas with a significant ethnic minority
population to promote equality of
opportunity and good relations at the local
level. It helps pay the salaries of the race
equality officers employed by the councils,
most of whom also receive funds from their
local government authorities, and gives grants
to ethnic minority self-help groups and to
other projects run by or for the benefit of the
minority communities.
Leisure Trends
Agreed hours of full-time work are usually
from 35 to 40 hours a week, although many
people actually work longer because of
voluntary overtime.
Over 13 per cent of total household
expenditure went on leisure goods and
services in 1990. The most common leisure
activities are home-based, or social, such as
visiting relatives or friends. Television
viewing is by far the most popular leisure
pastime, and nearly all households have a
television set, with 95 per cent in 1991
having a colour set. Average viewing time is
about 24 hours a week. Television viewing
has been declining slightly, but there has
been a significant increase in watching video
cassettes. Some 68 per cent of households
now have at least one video recorder,
compared with 31 per cent in 1985.
25
BRITAIN 1993: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Purchases of compact discs have risen very
rapidly, and the proportion of households
with a compact disc player has grown
considerably, from 15 per cent in 1989 to 27
per cent in 1991. In 1990 people made on
average 15 visits to the cinema (compared
with 23 in 1959).
Other popular pursuits include: listening to
radio, reading, do-it-yourself home
improvements, gardening and going out for a
meal or for a drink. About half of households
have a pet, the most common being dogs and
cats, of which there are thought to be roughly
7 million of each in Britain.
Many people give up free time to work for
voluntary organisations, of which there are
over 250,000 in England and Wales. It is
estimated that about one-quarter of the
population is involved in some way in
voluntary work in Britain. Fund-raising is the
most frequently mentioned activity. Voluntary
environmental organisations, for example,
have experienced consistent growth since
1971. The largest of these is the National
Trust, with over 2 million members.
Holidays
In 1990, about 90 per cent of full-time
manual employees were entitled to more than
four weeks paid holiday and 30 per cent to
five weeks; in 1961, 97 per cent were entitled
to only two weeks. In 1991, 60 per cent of
the adult population took at least one long
holiday of four or more nights away from
home. The number of long holidays taken by
British residents was 54 million in 1991
(compared with 48 million in 1978), of which
34 million were taken in Britain. The most
frequented free attraction in 1991 was
Blackpool Pleasure Beach (Lancashire). The
most popular destinations for summer
holidays are the West Country, Scotland,
and Wales.
In 1991 the most popular destinations
for overseas holidays by British
residents were:
• Spain (23 per cent);
• France (15 per cent);
• the United States (9 per cent); and
• Greece (7 per cent).
In all, British residents took 20 million
holidays overseas in 1991, of which 54 per
cent involved ‘package’ arrangements. About
74 per cent of all holidays abroad are taken in
Europe. The proportion of adults taking two
or more holidays a year was 24 per cent in
1991.

Government
Development of the British
System of Government
The growth of political institutions in
England can be traced back to the period of
Saxon rule, which lasted from the fifth
century AD until the Norman Conquest in
1066 (see p 2). This period saw the origins of
the institution of kingship, and of the idea
that the king should seek the advice of a
council of prominent men.
The period of Norman rule after 1066 saw
a considerable strengthening of royal control.
However, the monarchy eventually
experienced difficulties in controlling the
growing machinery of government. The
actions of King John (1199-1216) led to
opposition from feudal barons and leading
figures in the Church. In 1215 the barons
forced the King to agree to a series of
concessions embodied in a charter which
became known as Magna Carta. The charter,
which provided for the protection of the
rights of feudal proprietors against the abuse
of royal power, came to be regarded as the
key expression of the rights of the community
against the Crown.
The term ‘Parliament’ was first officially
used in 1236 to describe the gathering of
feudal barons and representatives of counties
and towns which the king summoned if
extraordinary taxation was required. By the
fifteenth century Parliament had acquired the
right to make laws (see p 39).
A clash between the monarchy, which
insisted on its divine right to rule, and
Parliament, which insisted on its legislative
authority, led to the outbreak of the Civil
War in 1642. Following the defeat of the
royalist armies and the execution of King
Charles I in 1649, the monarchy and the
House of Lords were abolished and the
country was proclaimed a republic. However
the republican experiment came to an end in
1660, two years after the death of the ‘Lord
Protector’, Oliver Cromwell. Charles Fs son
was restored to the throne as King Charles II.
Charles IPs successor, King James II
(1685-88), attempted to rule without the
consent of Parliament. As a result, in 1688 a
group of leading men invited William of
Orange (a grandson of Charles I and the
husband of Mary, James IPs eldest daughter)
to ‘secure the infringed liberties’ of the
country. James II fled into exile. Following
the success of the revolution of 1688,
Parliament in 1689 passed the Bill of Rights,
which made it impracticable for the
Sovereign to ignore the wishes of Parliament.
However, the monarch continued to be at the
centre of executive power. To enable the
Sovereign and Parliament to work together to
carry on the government of the country, a
group of ministers, or cabinet, became the
link between the executive and the
legislature. Although the ministers were
appointed by the Sovereign, they had to have
sufficient support in the House of Commons
to enable them to persuade Parliament to
pass legislation and vote for taxation.
Under the Hanoverian dynasty, which
acceded to the throne in 1714, the monarch
ceased to attend Cabinet meetings. Instead,
the Cabinet was presided over by the Lord
Treasurer, who came to be known as the
Prime Minister. The first two Hanoverian
monarchs also ceased to exercise executive
power directly, and thereafter the executive
power wielded by the Cabinet tended to
increase. Sir Robert Peel, Prime Minister
from 1841 to 1846, was probably the first
holder of his office to perform a role similar
to that of a modern Prime Minister. Since
the mid-nineteenth century the Prime
Minister has normally been the leader of the
party with a majority in the House of
Commons.
The Reform Act 1832 reformed the
27
BRITAIN 1993: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
system of parliamentary representation, which
dated from medieval times. It also
standardised the qualifications for the right to
vote. The Act started a train of events which
led to all adults (with a few exceptions—see
p 35) receiving the vote and direct popular
control over the House of Commons, a
process which was completed in the early
part of the twentieth century.
The British Constitution
The British constitution is to a large extent a
product of the historical events described
above, and has thus evolved over many
centuries. Unlike the constitutions of most
other countries, it is not set out in any single
document. Instead it is made up of statute
law, common law and conventions.
(Conventions are rules and practices which
are not legally enforceable but which are
regarded as indispensable to the working of
government; many are derived from the
historical events described above.)
The constitution can be altered by Act of
Parliament, or by general agreement to alter a
convention. The constitution is thus
adaptable to changing political conditions.
The organs of government overlap but can
be clearly distinguished. Parliament is the
legislature and the supreme authority. The
executive consists of:
• the Government—the Cabinet and other
ministers responsible for national policies;
• government departments, responsible for
national administration;
• local authorities, responsible for many
local services; and
• public corporations, responsible for
operating particular nationalised
industries or other bodies, subject to
ministerial control.
The judiciary (see Chapter 5) determines
common law and interprets statutes, and is
independent of both legislature and executive.
The Monarchy
The monarchy is the oldest institution of
government, going back to at least the ninth
century—four centuries before parliament.
Queen Elizabeth II is herself directly
descended from King Egbert, who united
England under his rule in 829. The only
interruption in the history of the monarchy
was the republic, which lasted from 1649 to
1660 (see p 27).1
Today the Queen is not only head of
State, but also an important symbol of
national unity. The royal title in Britain is:
‘Elizabeth the Second, by the Grace of God
of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and
Northern Ireland and of Her other Realms
and Territories Queen, Head of the
Commonwealth, Defender of the Faith’.
In the Channel Islands and the Isle of
Man the Queen is represented by a
Lieutenant-Governor.
The Commonwealth
Although the seat of the monarchy is in
Britain, the Queen is also head of State of a
number of Commonwealth states.2 In each
such state the Queen is represented by a
Governor-General, appointed by her on the
advice of the ministers of the country
concerned and completely independent of the
British Government. In each case the form
of the royal title varies. Other member
states are republics or have their own
monarchies.
In British dependent territories the Queen
is usually represented by governors, who are
responsible to the British Government for the
administration of the countries concerned.
Succession
The title to the Crown is derived partly from
statute and partly from common law rules of
descent. Despite interruptions in the direct
line of succession, the hereditary principle
upon which it was founded has always been
preserved.
Sons of the Sovereign have precedence
■ For further details see The Monarchy (Aspects of Britain:
HMSO, 1991).
2 The other Commonwealth countries of which the Queen is
head of State are: Antigua and Barbuda, Australia, Bahamas,
Barbados, Belize, Canada, Grenada, Jamaica, New Zealand,
Papua New Guinea, Saint Christopher and Nevis, Saint Lucia,
Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, Solomon Islands and
Tuvalu.

BRITAIN 1993: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
over daughters in succeeding to the throne.
When a daughter succeeds, she becomes
Queen Regnant, and has the same powers as a
king. The consort of a king takes her
husband’s rank and style, becoming Queen.
The constitution does not give any special
rank or privileges to the husband of a Queen
Regnant, although in practice he fills an
important role in the life of the nation, as
does the Duke of Edinburgh.
Under the Act of Settlement of 1700,
which formed part of the Revolution
Settlement following the events of 1688
(see p 27), only Protestant descendants
of a granddaughter of James I of
England and VI of Scotland (Princess
Sophia, the Electress of Hanover) are
eligible to succeed. The order of
succession can be altered only by
common consent of the countries of
the Commonwealth.
Accession
The Sovereign succeeds to the throne as soon
as his or her predecessor dies: there is no
interregnum. He or she is at once proclaimed
at an Accession Council, to which all
members of the Privy Council (see p 46) are
summoned. The Lords Spiritual and
Temporal (see p 33), the Lord Mayor and
Aldermen and other leading citizens of the
City of London are also invited.
Coronation
The Sovereign’s coronation follows the
accession after a convenient interval. The
ceremony takes place at Westminster Abbey
in London, in the presence of representatives
of the Houses of Parliament and of all the
great public organisations in Britain. The
Prime Ministers and leading members of the
other Commonwealth nations and
representatives of other countries also attend.
The Monarch’s Role in Government
The Queen personifies the State. In law, she
is head of the executive, an integral part of
the legislature, head of the judiciary, the
commander-in-chief of all the armed forces of
the Crown and the ‘supreme governor’ of the
established Church of England. As a result of
a long process of evolution, during which
the monarchy’s absolute power has been
progressively reduced, the Queen acts on the
advice of her ministers. Britain is governed
by Her Majesty’s Government in the name of
the Queen.
Within this framework, and in spite of a
trend during the past hundred years towards
giving powers directly to ministers, the
Queen still takes part in some important acts
of government. These include summoning,
proroguing (discontinuing until the next
session without dissolution) and dissolving
Parliament; and giving Royal Assent to Bills
passed by Parliament. The Queen also
formally appoints many important office
holders, including government ministers,
judges, officers in the armed forces,
governors, diplomats, bishops and some other
senior clergy of the Church of England. She
is also involved in conferring peerages,
knighthoods and other honours;3 and
pardoning people convicted of crimes. An
important function is appointing the Prime
Minister: by convention the Queen invites
the leader of the political party which
commands a majority in the House of
Commons to form a government. In
international affairs the Queen, as head of
State, has the power to declare war and make
peace, to recognise foreign states and
governments, to conclude treaties and to
annex or cede territory.
With rare exceptions (such as appointing
the Prime Minister), acts involving the use of
‘royal prerogative’ powers are nowadays
performed by government ministers. The
ministers are responsible to Parliament and
can be questioned about particular policies.
Parliamentary authority is not required for
the exercise of these prerogative powers,
although Parliament has the power to restrict
or abolish such rights.
3 Although most honours are conferred by the Queen on the
advice of the Prime Minister, a few are granted by her
personally—the Order of the Garter, the Order of the Thistle,
the Order of Merit and the Royal Victorian Order. For further
details see Honours and Titles (Aspects of Britain: HMSO, 1992).
30
GOVERNMENT
The Queen continues to play an important
role in the working of government. She holds
meetings of the Privy Council, gives
audiences to her ministers and other officials
in Britain and overseas, receives accounts of
Cabinet decisions, reads dispatches and signs
state papers. She must be consulted on every
aspect of national life, and she must show
complete impartiality.
Provision has been made to appoint a
regent to perform these royal functions
should the Queen be totally incapacitated.
The regent would be the Queen’s eldest son,
the Prince of Wales, then those, in order of
succession to the throne, who are of age. In
the event of the Queen’s partial incapacity or
absence abroad, the Queen may delegate
certain royal functions to the Counsellors of
State (the Duke of Edinburgh, the four
adults next in line of succession, and the
Queen Mother). However, Counsellors of
State may not, for instance, dissolve
Parliament (except on the Queen’s
instructions), nor create peers.
Ceremonial and Royal Visits
Ceremonial has always been associated with
the British monarchy, and, in spite of
changes in the outlook of both the Sovereign
and the people, many traditional ceremonies
continue to take place. Royal marriages and
royal funerals are marked by public
ceremony, and the Sovereign’s birthday is
officially celebrated in June by Trooping the
Colour on Horse Guards Parade. State
banquets take place when a foreign monarch
or head of State visits Britain; investitures are
held at Buckingham Palace and the Palace of
Holyroodhouse in Scotland to bestow
honours; and royal processions add
significance to such occasions as the state
opening of Parliament.
Each year the Queen and other members
of the royal family visit many parts of
Britain. Their presence at events of national
and local importance attracts considerable
interest and publicity. They are also closely
involved in the work of many charities. The
Queen pays state visits to foreign
governments, accompanied by the Duke of
Edinburgh. She also tours the other countries
of the Commonwealth. Other members of the
royal family pay official visits overseas,
occasionally representing the Queen, or often
in connection with an organisation or a cause
with which they are associated.
Royal Income and Expenditure
Until 1760 the Sovereign had to provide for
payment of all government expenses,
including the salaries of officials and the
expenses of the royal palaces and households.
These were met from hereditary revenues,
mainly income from Crown lands, and
income from some other sources granted to
the monarch by Parliament. The income
from these sources eventually proved
inadequate and in 1760 King George III
turned over to the Government most of the
hereditary revenue. In return he received an
annual grant (Civil List) from which he
continued to pay the royal expenditure of a
personal character and also the salaries of
government officials and certain pensions.
The latter charges were removed from the
Civil List in 1830.
Present Arrangements
Today the expenditure incurred by the
Queen in carrying out her public duties is
financed from the Civil List and from
government departments (which meet the
cost of, for example, the Royal Yacht and the
aircraft of the Queen’s Flight). All such
expenditure is approved by Parliament. In
1991 Civil List payments were fixed at £7-9
million a year for ten years. About three-
quarters of the Queen’s Civil List provision is
required to meet the cost of staff. These deal
with, among other things, state papers and
correspondence, the organisation of state
occasions, visits and other public
engagements undertaken by the Queen in
Britain and overseas. The Queen’s private
expenditure as Sovereign is met from the
Privy Purse, which is financed mainly from
the revenue of the Duchy of Lancaster;4 her
4 The Duchy of Lancaster is an inheritance which, since 1399,
has always been enjoyed by the reigning Sovereign. It is kept
quite apart from his or her other possessions and is separately-
administered by the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster.
31
BRITAIN 1993: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
expenditure as a private individual is met
from her own personal resources.
Under the Civil List Acts, other members
of the royal family also receive annual
parliamentary allowances to enable them to
carry out their public duties. The Prince of
Wales, however, receives no such allowance,
since as Duke of Cornwall he is entitled to
the income of the estate of the Duchy of
Cornwall. (He voluntarily surrenders a
quarter of this revenue to the Government.)
Each year the Queen pays the Government a
sum equivalent to that provided by
Parliament for certain members of the royal
family.
Parliament
Origins of Parliament
The medieval kings were expected to meet all
royal expenses, private and public, out of
their own revenue. If extra resources were
needed for some emergency, such as a war,
the Sovereign would seek to persuade his
barons, in the Great Council—a gathering of
leading men which met several times a year—
to grant an aid. During the thirteenth century
several kings found the private revenues and
baronial aids insufficient to meet the expenses
of government. They therefore summoned to
their Great Council not only the great feudal
magnates but also representatives of counties,
cities and towns, primarily in order to get
their assent to extraordinary taxation. In this
way the Great Council came to include those
who were summoned by name (those who,
broadly speaking, were to form the House of
Lords) and those who were representatives of
communities—the commons. The two parts,
together with the Sovereign, became known
as ‘Parliament’ (the term originally meant a
meeting for parley or discussion).
Over the course of time the commons
began to realise the strength of their position.
By the middle of the fourteenth century the
formula had appeared which in substance was
the same as that used nowadays in voting
supplies to the Crown—namely, ‘by the
Commons with the advice of the Lords
Spiritual and Temporal’. In 1407 Henry IV
pledged that henceforth all money grants
should be approved by the House of
Commons before being considered by the
Lords.
A similar advance was made in the
legislative field. Originally the King’s
legislation needed only the assent of his
councillors. Starting with the right of
individual commoners to present petitions,
the Commons as a body gained the right to
submit collective petitions. Later, during the
fifteenth century, they gained the right to
participate in giving their requests—their
‘Bills’—the form of law.
The subsequent development of the
power of the House of Commons was built
upon these foundations. The constitutional
developments of the seventeenth century
(see p 27) led to Parliament securing its
position as the supreme legislative authority.
The Powers of Parliament
The three elements which make up
Parliament—the Queen, the House of Lords
and the elected House of Commons—are
constituted on different principles.3 They
meet together only on occasions of symbolic
significance such as the state opening of
Parliament, when the Commons are
summoned by the Queen to the House of
Lords. The agreement of all three elements is
normally required for legislation, but that of
the Queen is given as a matter of course to
Bills sent to her.
Parliament can legislate for Britain as a
whole, or for any part of the country. It can
also legislate for the Channel Islands and the
Isle of Man, which are Crown dependencies
and not part of Britain. They have local
legislatures which make laws on island
affairs.6
As there are no legal restraints imposed by
a written constitution, Parliament may
legislate as it pleases. It can make or change
any law, and overturn established conventions
or turn them into law. It can even prolong its
own life beyond the normal period without
consulting the electorate.

1991).

(Aspects of Britain: HMSO, 1992).
32
GOVERNMENT
In practice, however, Parliament does not
assert its supremacy in this way. Its members
bear in mind the common law and normally
act in accordance with precedent. The
validity of an Act of Parliament, once passed,
cannot be disputed in the law courts. The
House of Commons is directly responsible to
the electorate, and in this century the House
of Lords has recognised the supremacy of the
elected chamber. The system of party-
government helps to ensure that Parliament
legislates with its responsibility to the
electorate in mind.
The European Community
As a member of the European Community,
Britain recognises the various types of
Community legislation and wider policies. It
sends 81 elected members to the European
Parliament (see pp 63-4).
The Functions of Parliament
The main functions of Parliament are:
• to pass laws;
• to provide, by voting taxation, the means
of carrying on the work of government;
• to scrutinise government policy and
administration, including proposals for
expenditure; and
• to debate the major issues of the day.
In carrying out these functions Parliament
helps to bring the relevant facts and issues
before the electorate. By custom, Parliament
is also informed before all important
international treaties and agreements are
ratified. The making of treaties is, however, a
royal prerogative exercised on the advice of
the Government and is not subject to
parliamentary approval.
The Meeting of Parliament
A Parliament has a maximum duration of five
years, but in practice general elections are
usually held before the end of this term. The
maximum life has been prolonged by
legislation in rare circumstances such as the
two world wars. Parliament is dissolved
and writs for a general election are ordered
by the Queen on the advice of the
Prime Minister.
The life of a Parliament is divided into
sessions. Each usually lasts for one year—
normally beginning and ending in October or
November. There are ‘adjournments’ at
night, at weekends, at Christmas, Easter and
the late Spring Bank Holiday, and during a
long summer break starting in late July or
early August. The average number of ‘sitting’
days in a session is about 168 in the House of
Commons and about 150 in the House of
Lords. At the start of each session the
Queen’s speech to Parliament outlines the
Government’s policies and proposed
legislative programme. Each session is ended
by prorogation. Parliament then ‘stands
prorogued’ for about a week until the new
session opens. Prorogation brings to an end
nearly all parliamentary business: in
particular, public Bills which have not been
passed by the end of the session are lost.
The House of Lords
The House of Lords consists of the Lords
Spiritual and the Lords Temporal. The
Lords Spiritual are the Archbishops of
Canterbury and York, the Bishops of
London, Durham and Winchester, and the 21
next most senior diocesan bishops of the
Church of England. The Lords Temporal
consist of:
• all hereditary peers and peeresses of
England, Scotland, Great Britain and the
United Kingdom;
• life peers created to assist the House in
its judicial duties (Lords of Appeal or
‘law lords’);7 and
• all other life peers.
Hereditary peerages carry a right to sit in
the House (with certain exceptions), provided
holders establish their claim and are aged 21
years or over. However, anyone succeeding to
a peerage may, within 12 months of
succession, disclaim that peerage for his or
her lifetime. Disclaimants lose their right to

in Britain and for criminal cases in England, Wales and Northern
Ireland.

sit in the House but gain the right to vote
and stand as candidates at parliamentary
elections.
Peerages, both hereditary and life, are
created by the Sovereign on the advice of the
Prime Minister. They are usually granted in
recognition of service in politics or other
walks of life or because one of the political
parties wishes to have the recipient in the
House of Lords. The House also provides a
place in Parliament for people who offer
useful advice, but do not wish to be involved
in party politics.
In mid-1992 there were 1,211 members of
the House of Lords, including the two
archbishops and 24 bishops. The Lords
Temporal consisted of 758 hereditary peers
who had succeeded to their titles, 19
hereditary peers who have had their titles
conferred on them (including the Prince of
Wales), and 408 life peers, of whom 20 were
‘law lords’. Of the total, 80 peers did not
receive a writ of summons and some 99
peers were on leave of absence from the
House.8 Holders of Irish peerages are not
entitled to membership of the House of
Lords, but some peers of Ireland sit in the
House of Lords as holders of English,
Scottish, Great Britain or United Kingdom
peerages.
Not all peers with a right to sit in the
House of Lords attend the sittings. Peers
who attend the House (the average daily
attendance is some 320) receive no salary for
their parliamentary work, but can claim for
expenses incurred in attending the House
(for which there are maximum daily rates)
and certain travelling expenses.
Officers of the House of Lords
The House is presided over by the Lord
Chancellor, who takes his place on the
woolsack9 as ex-officio Speaker of the
House. In his absence his place is taken by a
8 Some hereditary peers do not establish their claim to succeed
and so do not receive a writ of summons entitling them to sit in
the House. Lords may apply for leave of absence for the
duration, or for the remainder of a Parliament.

with wool from several Commonwealth countries; it is a tradition
dating from the medieval period, when wool was the chief source
of the country’s wealth.
deputy speaker, a deputy chairman or, if
neither is present, by a speaker chosen by
the Lords present. The first of the deputy
speakers is the Chairman of Committees,
who is appointed at the beginning of each
session and normally chairs most
committees. The Chairman and the
Principal Deputy Chairman of Committees
are Lords, but receive salaries as officers of
the House.
The permanent officers of the House
include the Clerk of the Parliaments, who is
responsible for the records of proceedings
and for making known to the public Acts of
Parliament. He is the accounting officer for
money voted to the House, and is in charge
of the administrative staff of the House,
known as the Parliament Office. The
Gentleman Usher of the Black Rod, who is
also Serjeant-at-Arms in attendance upon the
Lord Chancellor, is responsible for security,
accommodation and services in the House of
Lords’ part of the Palace of Westminster.
The Yeoman Usher is Deputy Serjeant-at-
Arms and assists Black Rod in his duties.
The House of Commons
The House of Commons is elected by
universal adult suffrage (see p 35) and
consists of 651 Members of Parliament
(MPs). At present there are 60 women, three
Asian and three black MPs. Of the 651 seats,
524 are for England, 38 for Wales, 72 for
Scotland, and 17 for Northern Ireland.
General elections are held after a
Parliament has been dissolved and a new one
summoned by the Queen. When an MP dies
or resigns,10 or is given a peerage, a by-
election takes place. Members are paid an
annual salary of £30,854 (from January 1992)
and an office costs allowance of up to
£39,960. There are also a number of other
allowances, including travel allowances, a
supplement for London members and, for
provincial members, subsistence allowances
and allowances for second homes. (For
ministers’ salaries see p 45.)
10 An MP who wishes to resign from the House can only do so
by applying for an office under the Crown as Crown Steward or
Bailiff of the Chiltern Hundreds, or Steward of the Manor of
Northstead.
34
GOVERNMENT
Officers of the House of Commons
The chief officer of the House of Commons
is the Speaker, elected by MPs to preside
over the House. Other officers include the
Chairman of Ways and Means and two
deputy chairmen, who act as Deputy
Speakers. They are elected by the House on
the nomination of the Government but are
drawn from the Opposition as well as the
government party. They, like the Speaker,
neither speak nor vote other than in their
official capacity. Overall responsibility for the
administration of the House rests with the
House of Commons Commission, a statutory
body chaired by the Speaker.
Permanent officers (who are not MPs)
include the Clerk of the House of Commons,
who is the principal adviser to the Speaker
on its privileges and procedures. The Clerk’s
departmental responsibilities relate to the
conduct of the business of the House and its
committees. The Clerk is also accounting
officer for the House. The Serjeant-at-Arms,
who waits upon the Speaker, carries out
certain orders of the House. He is also the
official housekeeper of the Commons’ part of
the building, and is responsible for security.
Other officers serve the House in the
Library, the Department of the Official
Report (Hansard), the Finance and
Administration Department and the
Refreshment Department.
Parliamentary Electoral System
For electoral purposes Britain is divided into
constituencies, each of which returns one
member to the House of Commons.11 To
ensure the size of constituencies is kept
roughly equivalent, four permanent
Parliamentary Boundary Commissions, one
each for England, Wales, Scotland and
Northern Ireland, review the constituencies
periodically. They recommend any
adjustment of seats that may seem necessary
in the light of population movements or
other changes. The Government has
introduced legislation to shorten the intervals

Britain: HMSO, 1991).
at which reviews are carried out. Elections
are by secret ballot.
Voters
British citizens, together with citizens of
other Commonwealth countries and citizens
of the Irish Republic resident in Britain, may
vote provided they are aged 18 or over,
included in the annual register of electors for
the constituency and not subject to any
disqualification. People not entitled to vote
include members of the House of Lords,
patients detained under mental health
legislation, sentenced prisoners and people
convicted within the previous five years of
corrupt or illegal election practices. Members
of the armed forces, Crown servants and staff
of the British Council employed overseas
(together with their wives or husbands if
accompanying them) may be registered for an
address in the constituency where they would
live but for their service. The Representation
of the People Act 1989 extended the right to
vote for British citizens living abroad by
increasing from 5 to 20 years the period
during which they may apply to be registered
to vote.
Voting Procedures
Each elector may cast one vote, normally in
person at a polling station. Electors whose
circumstances on polling day are such that
they cannot reasonably be expected to vote in
person at their local polling station—for
example, electors away on holiday—may
apply for an absent vote at a particular
election. Electors who are physically
incapacitated or unable to vote in person
because of the nature of their work or
because they have moved to a new area may
apply for an indefinite absent vote. People
entitled to an absent vote may vote by post
or by proxy, although postal ballot papers
cannot be sent to addresses outside Britain.
Electors who are physically incapacitated or
unable to vote in person because of the
nature of their work may vote either by post
(unless they are abroad at the time of the
election) or by proxy for an indefinite period.
Voting is not compulsory; 76 9 per cent of

BRITAIN 1993: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
a total electorate of 43'3 million people voted
in the general election in April 1992. The
simple majority system of voting is used.
Candidates are elected if they have more
votes than any of the other candidates
(although not necessarily an absolute majority
over all other candidates).
Candidates
British citizens and citizens of other
Commonwealth countries, together with
citizens of the Irish Republic, may stand for
election as MPs provided they are aged 21 or
over and are not disqualified. Those
disqualified include undischarged bankrupts;
people sentenced to more than one year’s
imprisonment; clergy of the Church of
England, Church of Scotland, Church of
Ireland and Roman Catholic Church; peers;
and holders of certain offices listed in the
House of Commons Disqualification Act
1975. The latter include holders of judicial
office, civil servants, some local government
officers, members of the regular armed forces,
police officers, some members of public
corporations and government commissions,
and British members of the legislature of any
country outside the Commonwealth. A
candidate’s nomination for election must be
proposed and seconded by two electors
registered as voters in the constituency and
signed by eight other electors.
Candidates do not have to be backed
by a political party. A candidate must
also deposit £500, which is returned if
he or she receives 5 per cent or more
of the votes cast.
The maximum sum a candidate may spend
on a general election campaign is £4,330 plus
3 7 pence for each elector in a borough
constituency, or 4 9 pence for each elector in
a county constituency. Higher limits have
been set for by-elections in order to reflect
the fact that they are often regarded as tests
of national opinion in the period between
general elections. The maximum sum is
£17,323 plus 14-7 pence for each elector in
borough seats, and 19-4 pence for each elector
in county seats. A candidate may post an
election address to each elector in the
constituency, free of charge. All election
expenses, apart from the candidate’s personal
expenses, are subject to the statutory limit.
The Political Party System
The party system, which has existed in one
form or another since the eighteenth century,
is an essential element in the working of the
constitution.12
The present system depends upon the
existence of organised political parties, each
of which presents its policies to the electorate
for approval. The parties are not registered or
formally recognised in law, but in practice
most candidates in elections, and almost all
winning candidates, belong to one of the
main parties.
For the last 150 years a predominantly
two-party system has existed. Since 1945
either the Conservative Party, the origins of
which go back to the eighteenth century, or
the Labour Party, which emerged in the last
decade of the nineteenth century, has held
power. A new party—the Liberal
Democrats—was formed in 1988 when the
Liberal Party, which could trace its origins to
the eighteenth century, merged with the
Social Democratic Party, which was formed
in 1981. Other parties include two nationalist
parties, Plaid Cymru (founded in Wales in
1925) and the Scottish National Party
(founded in 1934). In Northern Ireland there
are a number of parties. They include the
Ulster Unionist Party, which was formed in
the early part of this century; the Democratic
Unionist Party, founded in 1971 by a group
which broke away from the Ulster Unionists;
and the Social Democratic and Labour Party,
founded in 1970.
Since 1945 eight general elections have
been won by the Conservative Party and six
by the Labour Party; the great majority of
members of the House of Commons have
belonged to one of these two parties. The
percentages of votes cast for the main
political parties in the last general election of
April 1992 and the resulting distribution of
12 For further details see Organisation of Political Parties (Aspects
of Britain: HMSO, 1991).

GOVERNMENT
seats in the House of Commons are shown in
Table 2.1.
The party which wins most seats (although
not necessarily the most votes) at a general
election, or which has the support of a
majority of members in the House of
Commons, usually forms the Government. By
tradition, the leader of the majority party is
asked by the Sovereign to form a government.
About 100 of its members in the House of
Commons and the House of Lords receive
ministerial appointments (including
appointment to the Cabinet—see p 45) on the
advice of the Prime Minister. The largest
minority party becomes the official
Opposition, with its own leader and ‘shadow
cabinet’.
The Party System in Parliament
Leaders of the Government and Opposition
sit on the front benches of the Commons
with their supporters (the backbenchers)
sitting behind them.
Similar arrangements for the parties also
apply to the House of Lords; however, Lords
who do not wish to be associated with any
political party may sit on the ‘cross-benches’.
The effectiveness of the party system in
Parliament rests largely on the relationship
between the Government and the opposition
parties. Depending on the relative strengths
of the parties in the House of Commons, the
Opposition may seek to overthrow the
Government by defeating it in a vote on a
‘matter of confidence’. In general, however,
its aims are to contribute to the formulation
of policy and legislation by constructive
criticism; to oppose government proposals it
considers objectionable; to seek amendments
to government Bills; and to put forward its
own policies in order to improve its chances
of winning the next general election.
Government business arrangements are
settled, under the direction of the Prime
Minister and the Leaders of the two Houses,
by the Government Chief Whip in
consultation with the Opposition Chief Whip.
The Chief Whips together constitute the
‘usual channels’ often referred to when the
question of finding time for a particular item
of business is discussed. The Leaders of the
two Houses are responsible for enabling the
Houses to debate matters about which they
are concerned.
Outside Parliament, party control is
exercised by the national and local
organisations. Inside, it is exercised by the
Chief Whips and their assistants, who are
chosen within the party. Their duties include
keeping members informed of forthcoming
parliamentary business, maintaining the
party’s voting strength by ensuring members
attend important debates, and passing on to
the party leadership the opinions of
backbench members. The Whips indicate the
importance their party attaches to a vote on a
particular issue by underlining items of
business (once, twice or three times) on the
notice sent to MPs. Failure to comply with a

usually seen as a rebellion against the party.
Party discipline tends to be less strong in the
Lords than in the Commons, since Lords
have less hope of high office and no need of
party support in elections.

Whip in the Commons is Parliamentary
Secretary to the Treasury. Of the other
Government Whips, three are officers of the
Royal Household (one of these is Deputy
Chief Whip), five hold titular posts as Lords
Commissioners of the Treasury and five are
Assistant Whips. Salaries are also paid to the
Opposition Chief Whips in both Houses and
to two of the Opposition Assistant Whips in
the Commons. The Government Whips in
the Lords hold offices in the Royal
Household; they also act as government
spokesmen.
Financial Assistance to Parties
Annual assistance from public funds helps
opposition parties carry out their
parliamentary work at Westminster. It is
limited to parties which had at least two
members elected at the previous general
election or one member elected and a
minimum of 150,000 votes cast. The amount
is £2,550 for every seat won, plus £5-10 for
every 200 votes.
Parliamentary Procedure
Parliamentary procedure is based on custom
and precedent. The system of debate is
similar in both Houses. The subject starts off
as a proposal or ‘motion’ by a member. At
the end of each debate the question may be
decided without voting, or by a simple
majority vote. The main difference between
the two Houses is that the Lord Chancellor,
who acts as Speaker of the Lords, has no
authority to curtail debate. Such matters are
decided by the general feeling of the House.
In the Commons the Speaker has full
authority to enforce the rules of the House
and must guard against the abuse of
procedure and protect minority rights. The
Speaker has discretion on whether to allow a
motion to end discussion so that a matter
may be put to the vote and has powers to put
a stop to irrelevance and repetition in debate,
and to save time in other ways. In cases of
grave disorder the Speaker can adjourn or
suspend the sitting. The Speaker may order
members who have broken the rules of
behaviour of the House to leave the Chamber
or he or she can initiate their suspension for
a period of days.
The Speaker supervises voting in the
Commons and announces the final result. In
a tied vote the Speaker gives a casting vote,
without expressing an opinion on the merits
of the question. The voting procedure in the
House of Lords is similar, except that the
Speaker or chairman has an ordinary vote,
and no casting vote.
MPs' Financial Interests
The Commons has a public register of MPs’
financial interests. Members with a financial
interest in a debate in the House must declare
it when speaking. To act as a disqualification
from voting the interest must be direct,
immediate and personal. In other proceedings
of the House or in dealings with other
members, ministers or civil servants, MPs
must also disclose any relevant financial
interest.
There is no register of financial interests
in the Lords, but Lords speaking in a debate
in which they have a direct interest are
expected to declare it. Lords by custom speak
‘on their honour’.
Public Access to Parliamentary Proceedings
Proceedings of both Houses are normally
public. The minutes and speeches (Hansard)
are published daily.
The records of the Lords from 1497 and
of the Commons from 1547, together with
the parliamentary and political papers of a
number of former members of both Houses,
are available to the public through the House
of Lords Record Office.
The proceedings of both Houses of
Parliament may be broadcast on television
and radio, either live or, more usually, in
recorded or edited form. Complete coverage
is available on cable television.
38
GOVERNMENT
The Law-making Process
The law undergoes constant reform in the
courts as established principles are clarified or
reapplied to meet new circumstances.
Fundamental changes are the responsibility of
Parliament and the Government through the
normal legislative process.
Draft laws take the form of parliamentary
Bills. Most are public Bills involving
measures relating to public policy. Private
Bills are promoted by people or organisations
outside Parliament (often local authorities) to
give them special legal powers. They go
through a similar procedure to public Bills,
but most of the work is done in committee,
where procedures follow a semi-judicial
pattern. The promoter must prove the need
for the powers sought and the objections of
opposing interests are heard. Both sides may
be legally represented. Hybrid Bills are public
Bills which may affect private rights. As with
private Bills, the passage of hybrid Bills
through Parliament is governed by special
procedures which allow those affected to put
their case. Public Bills can be introduced, in
either House, by a government minister or by
an ordinary member. Most public Bills that
become law are sponsored by the Government.
Before a government Bill is drafted, there
is normally considerable consultation with
professional bodies, voluntary organisations
and other agencies interested in the subject.
These include major interest and pressure
groups which seek to promote specific causes.
Proposals for legislative changes are
sometimes set out in government ‘White
Papers’, which may be debated in Parliament
before a Bill is introduced. From time to time
consultation papers, sometimes called ‘Green
Papers’, set out government proposals which
are still taking shape and seek comments from
the public.
Bills must normally be passed by both
Houses. Government Bills likely to raise
political controversy usually go through the
Commons before being discussed in the
Lords, while those of a technical but non¬
political nature often pass through the Lords
first. A Bill with a mainly financial purpose is
nearly always introduced in the Commons,
and a Bill involving taxation must be based
on resolutions agreed by that House, often
after debate, before it can be introduced. If
the main object of a Bill is to create a public
charge, it must be introduced by a
government minister in the Commons or, if
brought from the Lords, be taken up by a
government minister. This gives the
Government considerable control over
financial legislation.
Private Members ’ Bills
At the beginning of each session private
members of the Commons ballot (or draw
lots) for the opportunity to introduce a Bill
on one of the Fridays specially allocated; the
first 20 are successful. Private members may
also present a Bill after question time (see
p 42). They may also seek to introduce a Bill
under the ‘ten minute rule’. This allows two
speeches, one in favour of and one against
the measure, after which the House decides
whether to allow the Bill to be brought in.
Private members’ Bills quite often do not
proceed very far, but quite a few become law
each session. If one secures a second reading,
the Government usually introduces any
necessary money resolution. Private members’
Bills may be introduced in the House of
Lords at any time, but no time is allocated
for their discussion in the Commons.
Passage of Public Bills
The process of passing a public Bill is similar
in both Houses. On introduction, the Bill
receives a first reading, without debate, and is
printed. After between one day and several
weeks, depending on the nature of the Bill, it
is given a second reading after a debate on its
general principles. In the Commons a non-
controversial Bill may be referred to a second
reading committee for its second reading
debate. After a second reading in the
Commons, a Bill is usually referred to a
standing committee for detailed examination
(see p 41). If the House so decides, the Bill
may be referred to the whole House sitting in
committee. The committee stage is followed
by the report stage in the whole House,
during which further amendments may be
considered.
39
BRITAIN 1993: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
At the third reading a Bill is reviewed in
its final form and may be debated again. The
House may vote to limit the time devoted to
examining a Bill by passing a government
timetable motion, commonly referred to as a
‘guillotine’.
After the third reading a Commons Bill is
sent to the Lords. After the second reading
in the Lords, a Bill is considered by a
committee of the whole House, unless the
House takes the rare decision to refer it to a
Public Bill Committee. It is then considered
on report and read a third time; at all these
stages amendments may be made.
A Bill which starts in the Lords and is
passed by that House is then sent to the
Commons for all its stages there.
Amendments made by the second House
must generally be agreed by the first, or a
compromise reached, before a Bill can
become law.
Royal Assent
When a Bill has passed through all its
parliamentary stages, it is sent to the Queen
for Royal Assent, after which it is part of the
law of the land and known as an Act of
Parliament. The Royal Assent has not been
refused since 1707.
Limitations on the Power of the Lords
Most government Bills introduced and passed
in the Lords pass through the Commons
without difficulty, although a Lords Bill
which was unacceptable to the Commons
would not become law. The Lords, on the
other hand, do not generally prevent Bills
insisted upon by the Commons from
becoming law, though they will often amend
them and return them for further
consideration by the Commons. By
convention the Lords pass Bills authorising
taxation or national expenditure without
amendment. Under the Parliament Acts 1911
and 1949, a Bill that deals only with taxation
or expenditure must become law within one
month of being sent to the Lords, whether or
not they agree to it, unless the Commons
directs otherwise. If no agreement is reached
between the two Houses on a non-financial
Commons Bill the Lords can delay the Bill
for a period which, in practice, amounts to at
least 13 months. Following this the Bill may
be submitted to the Queen for Royal Assent,
provided it has been passed a second time by
the Commons. The Parliament Acts make
one important exception: any Bill to lengthen
the life of a Parliament requires the full
assent of both Houses in the normal way.
The limits to the power of the Lords,
contained in the Parliament Acts, are based on
the belief that nowadays the main legislative
function of the non-elected House is to act as
a chamber of revision, complementing but not
rivalling the elected House.
Delegated Legislation
In order to reduce pressure on parliamentary
time, much legislation gives ministers and
other authorities the power to regulate
administrative details by making ‘delegated
legislation’. To minimise the risk that powers
given to the executive might undermine
parliamentary government, they are normally
delegated to authorities directly responsible to
Parliament. Moreover, the Acts of Parliament
concerned often provide for some measure of
parliamentary control over the delegated
legislation, by giving Parliament the right to
affirm or annul it. Certain Acts also state that
the organisations affected must be consulted
before rules and orders can be made.
A joint committee of both Houses reports
on the technical propriety of these ‘statutory
instruments’. In order to save time on the
floor of the House, the Commons also uses
standing committees to debate the merits of
instruments; actual decisions are taken by the
House.
Parliamentary Committees
Committees of the Whole House
Either House may pass a resolution setting
itself up as a committee of the w hole House
to consider Bills in detail after their second
reading. This permits unrestricted discussion:
the rule that an MP or Lord may speak only
once on each issue does not apply in
committee.
40
GOVERNMENT
Standing Committees
House of Commons standing committees
debate and consider amendments to public
Bills at the committee stage and, in certain
cases, discuss them at the second reading
stage. They include two Scottish standing
committees, and the Scottish and Welsh
Grand Committees. Ordinary standing
committees do not have names but are
referred to simply as Standing Committee A,
B, C, and so on; a new set of members are
appointed to them to consider each Bill. Each
committee has between 16 and 50 members,
with a party balance reflecting as far as
possible that in the House as a whole. The
Scottish Grand Committee comprises all 72
Scottish members (and may be convened in
Edinburgh). It may consider the principle of
Scottish Bills referred to it at second reading
stage. It also debates Scottish estimates and
other matters concerning Scotland only which
may be referred to it. The Welsh Grand
Committee, with all 38 Welsh members and
up to five others, considers Bills referred to it
at second reading stage, and matters concern¬
ing Wales only. There is also provision for a
Northern Ireland committee to debate matters
relating specifically to Northern Ireland.
The Lords’ equivalent to a standing
committee, a Public Bill Committee, is rarely
used.
Select Committees
Select committees are appointed, normally for
the duration of a Parliament, to examine
subjects by taking written and oral evidence.
After private discussion they report their
conclusions and recommendations. Some
select committees may be appointed to help
Parliament with the control of the executive
by examining aspects of public policy and
administration. These include the 15
committees established by the House of
Commons to examine the work of the main
government departments. The Foreign Affairs
Committee, for example, ‘shadows’ the work
of the Foreign & Commonwealth Office. The
committees are constituted on a basis which is
in approximate proportion to party strength
in the House.
Other regular Commons committees
include those on European Legislation, Public
Accounts, Members’ Interests, and the
Parliamentary Commissioner for
Administration. ‘Domestic’ select committees
also cover the internal workings of
Parliament. The Committee of Selection and
the Standing Orders Committee have duties
relating to private Bills, and the Committee
of Selection also chooses members to serve
on standing and select committees. A Liaison
Committee considers general matters relating
to select committees. On rare occasions a
parliamentary Bill is examined by a specially
appointed select committee, in addition to the
usual legislative process: this occurs, for
example, every few years for the Armed
Forces Bill.
In their examination of government
policies and administration, the committees
question ministers, senior civil servants and
interested bodies and individuals. Through
hearings and published reports, they bring
before Parliament and the public an extensive
body of fact and informed opinion on many
issues, and build up considerable expertise in
their subjects of inquiry.
In the House of Lords, besides the Appeal
and Appellate Committees, in which the bulk
of the House’s judicial work is transacted,
there are two major select committees (with
several sub-committees), on the European
Communities and on Science and
Technology. There are also select committees
on House of Lords’ Offices, Hybrid
Instruments, Leave of Absence and Lords’
Expenses, Personal Bills, Private Bill
Standing Orders, Privileges, Procedure,
Selection and Broadcasting.
Joint Committees
Joint committees, with a membership drawn
from both Houses, are appointed in each
session to deal with Consolidation Bills and
delegated legislation. The two Houses may
also agree to set up joint select committees on
other subjects.
Party Committees
In addition to the official committees of the
41
BRITAIN 1993: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
two Houses there are several unofficial party
organisations or committees. The Conserva¬
tive and Unionist Members’ Committee (the
1922 Committee) consists of the backbench
membership of the party in the House of
Commons. When the Conservative Party is
in office, ministers attend its meetings by
invitation and not by right. When the party
is in opposition, the whole membership of
the party may attend meetings. The leader
appoints a consultative committee, which acts
as the party’s ‘shadow cabinet’.
The Parliamentary Labour Party
comprises all members of the party in both
Houses. When the Labour Party is in office,
a parliamentary committee, half of whose
members are elected and half of whom are
government representatives, acts as a channel
of communication between the Government
and its backbenchers in both Houses. When
the party is in opposition, the Parliamentary
Labour Party is organised under the direction
of an elected parliamentary committee, which
acts as the ‘shadow cabinet’.
Other Forms of Parliamentary Control
House of Commons
The effectiveness of parliamentary control of
the Government is a subject of continuing
discussion, both inside and outside
Parliament. In addition to the system of
scrutiny by select committees, the House of
Commons offers a number of opportunities
for the examination of government policy by
both the Opposition and the Government’s
own backbenchers. These include:
1. Question time, when for an hour on
Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday and
Thursday, ministers answer MPs’ questions.
The Prime Minister’s question time is on
Tuesday and Thursday. Parliamentary
questions are one means of seeking
information about the Government’s
intentions. They are also a way of raising
grievances brought to MPs’ notice by
constituents. MPs may also put questions to
ministers for written answer; the questions
and answers are published in Hansard, the
official report. There are some 40,000
questions every year.
2. Adjournment debates, when MPs use
motions for the adjournment of the House to
raise constituency cases or matters of public
concern. There is a half-hour adjournment
period at the end of the business of the day,
while immediately before the adjournment for
each recess (Parliament’s Christmas, Easter,
spring and summer breaks) a full day is spent
discussing issues raised by private members.
There are also adjournment debates following
the passage, three times a year, of
Consolidated Fund13 or Appropriation
Bills.14 These take place after the House has
voted the necessary supplies (money) for the
Government.
In addition, an MP wishing to discuss a
‘specific and important matter that should
have urgent consideration’ may, at the end of
question time, seek leave to move the
adjournment of the House. If the Speaker
accepts the terms of the motion, the MP asks
the House for leave for the motion to be put
forward. Leave can be given unanimously, or
it can be given if 40 or more MPs support
the motion or if fewer than 40 but more than
ten support it and the House (on a vote) is in
favour. If leave is given, the matter is debated
for three hours in what is known as an
emergency debate, usually on the following
day.
3. The 20 Opposition days each session,
when the Opposition can choose subjects for
debate. Of these days, 17 are at the disposal
of the Leader of the Opposition and three at
the disposal of the second largest opposition
party.
4. Debates on three days in each session on
details of proposed government expenditure,
chosen by the Liaison Committee (see p 41).
Procedural opportunities for criticism of
the Government also arise during the debate
on the Queen’s speech at the beginning of
each session, during debates on motions of
censure for which the Government provides
time, and during debates on the
Government’s legislative and other proposals.
n At least two Consolidated Fund Acts are passed each session
authorising the Treasury to make certain sums of money available
for the public service.
14 The annual Appropriation Act fixes the sums of public money
provided for particular items of expenditure.
42
GOVERNMENT
House of Lords
Opportunities for criticism and examination
of government policy are provided in the
House of Lords at daily question time and
during debates on general motions. Other
opportunities include ‘unstarred’ questions
(which can be debated) at the end of the
day’s business and debates on proposed
legislation.
Control of Finances
The main responsibilities of Parliament, and
more particularly of the House of
Commons, in overseeing the revenue of the
State and payments for the public service,
are to authorise the raising of taxes and
duties and the various objects of
expenditure and the sum to be spent on
each. It also has to satisfy itself that the
sums granted are spent only for the
purposes which Parliament intended. No
payment out of the central government’s
public funds can be made and no taxation
or loans authorised, except by Act of
Parliament. However, limited interim
payments can be made from the
Contingencies Fund.
The Finance Act is the most important
of the annual statutes, and authorises the
raising of revenue. The legislation is based
on the Chancellor of the Exchequer’s
Budget statement, normally made in March
or April each year. It includes a review of
the public finances of the previous year, and
proposals for the estimated expenditure of
the coming year. Scrutiny of public
expenditure is carried out by House of
Commons select committees (see p 41).
European Community Affairs
To keep the two Houses informed of
European Community developments, and to
enable them to scrutinise and debate
Community policies and proposals, there is
a select committee in each House (see p 41)
and two standing committees debate specific
European legislative proposals. Ministers
also make regular statements about
Community business.
The Commons ’ Ability to Force the Government
to Resign
The final control is the ability of the House
of Commons to force the Government to
resign by passing a resolution of ‘no
confidence’. The Government must also
resign if the House rejects a proposal which
the Government considers so vital to its
policy that it has made it a ‘matter of
confidence’ or if the House refuses to vote
the money required for the public service.
Parliamentary Commissioner for Administration
The post of Parliamentary Commissioner for
Administration (the ‘Parliamentary
Ombudsman’) was established by the
Parliamentary Commissioner Act 1967. He or
she investigates, independently, complaints of
maladministration when asked to do so by
MPs on behalf of members of the public.
Powers of investigation extend to
administrative actions by central government
departments and certain executive and non-
departmental bodies. They do not include
policy decisions (which can be questioned in
Parliament) and matters affecting relations
with other countries. Complaints by British
citizens arising from dealings with British
diplomatic posts overseas are open to
investigation in some circumstances. The
Commissioner has access to departmental
papers and reports the findings to the MP
who presented the complaint. The
Commissioner is required to report annually
to Parliament. He or she also publishes
details of selected investigations at quarterly
intervals and may submit other reports where
necessary. A Commons select committee
oversees the Commissioner’s work.
Parliamentary Privilege
Each House of Parliament has certain rights
and immunities to protect it from obstruction
in carrying out its duties. The rights apply
collectively to each House and to its officers
and individually to each member.
For the Commons the Speaker formally
claims from the Queen ‘their ancient and
undoubted rights and privileges’ at the
43
BRITAIN 1993: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
beginning of each Parliament. T hese include
freedom of speech; freedom from arrest in civil
actions; exemption from serving on juries, or
being compelled to attend court as witnesses;
and the right of access to the Crown, which is
a collective privilege of the House. Further
privileges include the rights of the House to
control its own proceedings (so that it is able,
for instance, to exclude ‘strangers’^ if it
wishes); to decide upon legal disqualifications
for membership and to declare a seat vacant on
such grounds; and to punish for breach of its
privileges and for contempt.
The privileges of the House of Lords are
broadly similar to those of the House of
Commons.
Her Majesty’s Government
Her Majesty’s Government is the body of
ministers responsible for the administration of
national affairs. The Prime Minister is
appointed by the Queen, and all other
ministers are appointed by the Queen on the
recommendation of the Prime Minister. Most
ministers are members of the Commons,
although the Government is also fully
represented by ministers in the Lords. The
Lord Chancellor is always a member of the
House of Lords.
The composition of governments can vary
both in the number of ministers and in the
titles of some offices. New ministerial offices
may be created, others may be abolished, and
functions may be transferred from one
minister to another.
Prime Minister
The Prime Minister is also, by tradition, First
Lord of the Treasury and Minister for the
Civil Service. The head of the Government
became known as the Prime Minister during
the eighteenth century. The Prime Minister’s
unique position of authority derives from
majority support in the House of Commons
and from the power to appoint and dismiss
ministers. By modern convention, the Prime
Minister always sits in the House of
Commons.
15 All those who are not members or officials of either House.
The Prime Minister presides over the
Cabinet, is responsible for the allocation of
functions among ministers and informs the
Queen at regular meetings of the general
business of the Government.
The Prime Minister’s other responsibilities
include recommending a number of
appointments to the Queen. These include:
• Church of England archbishops, bishops
and deans and some 200 other clergy in
Crown ‘livings’;
• senior judges, such as the Lord Chief
Justice;
• Privy Counsellors; and
• Lord-Lieutenants.
They also include certain civil
appointments, such as Lord High
Commissioner to the General Assembly of
the Church of Scotland, Poet Laureate,
Constable of the Tower, and some university
posts; and appointments to various public
boards and institutions, such as the British
Broadcasting Corporation (BBC), as well as
various royal and statutory commissions.
Recommendations are likewise made for the
award of many civil honours and distinctions
and of Civil List pensions (to people who
have achieved eminence in science and the
arts and are in financial need). The Prime
Minister also selects the trustees of certain
national museums and institutions.
The Prime Minister’s Office at 10
Downing Street (the official residence in
central London) has a staff of civil servants
who assist the Prime Minister. The Prime
Minister may also appoint special advisers to
the Office from time to time to assist in the
formation of policies.
Departmental Ministers
Ministers in charge of government
departments are usually in the Cabinet; they
are known as ‘Secretary of State’ or
‘Minister’, or may have a special title, as in
the case of the Chancellor of the Exchequer.
Non-Departmental Ministers
The holders of various traditional offices,
namely the Lord President of the Council,
44
GOVERNMENT
the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, the
Lord Privy Seal, the Paymaster General and,
from time to time, Ministers without Portfolio,
may have few or no departmental duties.
They are thus available to perform any duties
the Prime Minister may wish to give them.
Lord Chancellor and Law Officers
The Lord Chancellor holds a special position,
as both a minister with departmental
functions and the head of the judiciary (see
Appendix 1). The four Law Officers of the
Crown are: for England and Wales, the
Attorney General and the Solicitor General;
and for Scotland, the Lord Advocate and the
Solicitor General for Scotland.
Ministers of State
Ministers of State usually work with ministers
in charge of departments. They normally
have specific responsibilities, and are
sometimes given titles which reflect these
functions. More than one may work in a
department. A Minister of State may be given
a seat in the Cabinet and be paid accordingly.
Junior Ministers
Junior ministers (generally Parliamentary
Under-Secretaries of State or, where the
senior minister is not a Secretary of State,
simply Parliamentary Secretaries) share in
parliamentary and departmental duties. They
may also be given responsibility, directly
under the departmental minister, for specific
aspects of the department’s work. The
Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasury and
other Lords Commissioners of the Treasury
are the formal titles of the Government
Whips (see p 37).
Ministerial Salaries
The salaries of ministers in the House of
Commons range from £44,611 a year for
junior ministers to £63,047 for Cabinet
ministers. In the House of Lords salaries
range from £37,689 for junior ministers to
£50,558 for Cabinet ministers. The
Prime Minister receives £76,234 and the
Lord Chancellor £106,750. (The Leader of
the Opposition receives £59,736 a year; two
Opposition whips in the Commons and the
Opposition Leader and Chief Whip in the
Lords also receive salaries.)
The Cabinet
The Cabinet is composed of about 20
ministers (the number can vary) chosen by
the Prime Minister and may include
departmental and non-departmental ministers.
The functions of the Cabinet are initiating
and deciding on policy, the supreme control
of government and the co-ordination of
government departments. The exercise of
these functions is vitally affected by the fact
that the Cabinet is a group of party
representatives, depending upon majority
support in the House of Commons.
Cabinet Meetings
The Cabinet meets in private and its
proceedings are confidential. Its members are
bound by their oath as Privy Counsellors not
to disclose information about its proceedings,
although after 30 years Cabinet papers may
be made available for inspection in the Public
Record Office at Kew, Surrey.
Normally the Cabinet meets for a few
hours once a week during parliamentary
sittings, and rather less often when
Parliament is not sitting. To keep its
workload within manageable limits, a great
deal of work is carried on through the
committee system. This involves referring
issues either to a standing Cabinet committee
or to an ad hoc committee composed of
the ministers directly concerned. The
committee then considers the matter in
detail and either disposes of it or reports
upon it to the Cabinet with recommendations
for action.
The membership of all ministerial Cabinet
committees is published. Where appropriate,
the Secretary of the Cabinet and other senior
officials of the Cabinet Office attend meetings
of the Cabinet and its committees.
Diaries published by several former
ministers have given the public insight into
Cabinet procedures in recent times.
45
BRITAIN 1993: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
The Cabinet Office
The Cabinet Office, headed by the Secretary
of the Cabinet (who is also Head of the
Home Civil Service), under the direction of
the Prime Minister, comprises the Cabinet
Secretariat, the Office of Public Service and
Science and the Historical and Records
Section.
The Cabinet Secretariat serves ministers
collectively in the conduct of Cabinet
business, and in the co-ordination of policy at
the highest level.
The Office of Public Service and Science
is responsible for the provision of services in
the field of recruitment, training and
occupational health; policies for the
management and development of staff; and
equal opportunities. It is also responsible for
the Citizen’s Charter Unit (see p 50), the
Efficiency Unit and the programme for
creating Next Steps Agencies (see p 50).
The Office of Science and Technology is
part of the Office of Public Service and
Science (see p 50).
The Historical and Records Section of the
Cabinet Office is responsible for Official
Histories and managing Cabinet Office
records.
Ministerial Responsibility
‘Ministerial responsibility’ refers both to the
collective responsibility for government policy
and actions, which ministers share, and to
ministers’ individual responsibility for their
departments’ work.
The doctrine of collective responsibility
means that the Cabinet acts unanimously
even when Cabinet ministers do not all agree
on a subject. The policy of departmental
ministers must be consistent with the policy
of the Government as a whole. Once the
Government’s policy on a matter has been
decided, each minister is expected to support
it or resign. On rare occasions, ministers have
been allowed free votes in Parliament on
government policies involving important
issues of principle.
The individual responsibility of ministers
for the work of their departments means that
they are answerable to Parliament for all their
departments’ activities. They bear the
consequences of any failure in administration,
any injustice to an individual or any aspect of
policy which may be criticised in Parliament,
whether personally responsible or not. Since
most ministers are members of the House of
Commons, they must answer questions and
defend themselves against criticism in person.
Departmental ministers in the House of
Lords are represented in the Commons by
someone qualified to speak on their behalf,
usually a junior minister.
Departmental ministers normally decide all
matters within their responsibility. However,
on important political matters they usually
consult their colleagues collectively, either
through the Cabinet or through a Cabinet
committee. A decision by a departmental
minister binds the Government as a whole.
On assuming office ministers must resign
directorships in private and public companies,
and must ensure that there is no conflict
between their public duties and private
interests.
The Privy Council
The Privy Council was formerly the chief
source of executive power in the State; its
origins can be traced back to the Curia Regis
(or King’s Court), which assisted the Norman
monarchs in running the government. As the
system of Cabinet government developed,
however, the Privy Council became less
prominent. Many powers were transferred to
the Cabinet as an inner committee of the
Council, and much of its work was handed
over to government departments, some of
which were originally committees of the Privy
Council.
Nowadays the main function of the Privy
Council is to advise the Queen to approve
Orders in Council, including those made
under prerogative powers, such as Orders
approving the grant of royal charters of
incorporation, and those made under
statutory powers. Responsibility for each
Order, however, rests with the minister
answerable for the policy concerned,
regardless of whether he or she was present
at the meeting where approval was given.
The Privy Council also advises the Crown
46
GOVERNMENT
on the issue of royal proclamations, some of
which are prerogative acts, such as
summoning or dissolving Parliament. The
Council’s own statutory responsibilities,
which are independent of the powers of the
Sovereign in Council, include supervising the
registering bodies for the medical and allied
professions.
Cabinet ministers must be Privy
Counsellors and are sworn in on first
assuming office. Otherwise membership of
the Council (retained for life, except for very
occasional removals) is accorded by the
Sovereign, on the recommendation of the
Prime Minister, to eminent people in Britain
and the independent monarchies of the
Commonwealth. There are about 400 Privy
Counsellors. A full Council is summoned
only on the accession of a new Sovereign or
when the Sovereign announces his or her
intention to marry.
Committees of the Privy Council
There are a number of advisory Privy
Council committees. These include
prerogative committees, such as those dealing
with legislation from the Channel Islands and
the Isle of Man, and with applications for
charters of incorporation. Committees may
also be provided for by statute, such as those
for the universities of Oxford and Cambridge
and the Scottish universities.
The Judicial Committee of the Privy
Council is the final court of appeal for certain
independent members of the Commonwealth,
the British dependent territories, the Channel
Islands and the Isle of Man. It also hears
appeals from the disciplinary committees of
the medical and allied professions and certain
ecclesiastical appeals.
Administrative work is carried out in the
Privy Council Office under the Lord
President of the Council, a Cabinet minister.
Government Departments
Government departments and their agencies
are the main instruments for implementing
government policy when Parliament has
passed the necessary legislation, and for
advising ministers. They often work alongside
local authorities, statutory boards, and
government-sponsored organisations
operating under various degrees of
government control.
A change of government does not
necessarily affect the number or general
functions of government departments,
although major changes in policy may be
accompanied by organisational changes.
The work of some departments (for
instance, the Ministry of Defence) covers
Britain as a whole. Other departments (such
as the Department of Employment) cover
England, Wales and Scotland, but not
Northern Ireland. Others, such as the
Department of the Environment, are mainly
concerned with affairs in England. Some
departments, such as the Department of
Trade and Industry, maintain a regional
organisation, and some which have direct
contact with the public throughout the
country (for example, the Department of
Employment) also have local offices.
Departments are usually headed by
ministers. Certain departments in which
questions of policy do not normally arise are
headed by permanent officials, and ministers
with other duties are responsible for them to
Parliament. For instance, ministers in the
Treasury are responsible for HM Customs
and Excise, the Inland Revenue, the National
Investment and Loans Office and a number
of other departments as well as executive
agencies such as the Royal Mint.
Departments generally receive their funds
directly out of money provided by Parliament
and are staffed by members of the Civil
Service.
The functions of the main government
departments are set out in Appendix 1.
Non-Departmental Public Bodies
A number of bodies with a role in the
process of government are neither
government departments nor part of a
department (in April 1992 there were 1,444).
Non-departmental public bodies are of three
kinds: executive bodies, advisory bodies and
tribunals. The last of these are a specialised
group of judicial bodies (see p 111).
47
BRITAIN 1993: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Executive Bodies
Executive bodies normally employ their own
staff and have their own budget. They are
public organisations whose duties include
executive, administrative, regulatory or
commercial functions. They normally operate
within broad policy guidelines set by
departmental ministers but are in varying
degrees independent of government in
carrying out their day-to-day responsibilities.
Examples include the Arts Council of Great
Britain, the British Council, the
Commonwealth Development Corporation
and the Commission for Racial Equality.
Advisory Bodies
Many government departments are assisted
by advisory councils or committees which
undertake research and collect information,
mainly to give ministers access to informed
opinion before they come to a decision
involving a legislative or executive act. In
some cases a minister must consult a standing
committee, but usually advisory bodies are
appointed at the discretion of the minister.
Examples include the Industrial Injuries
Advisory Council and the Committee on
Safety of Medicines.
The membership of the advisory councils
and committees varies according to the nature
of the work involved, but normally includes
representatives of the relevant interests and
professions.
In addition to the standing advisory
bodies, there are committees set up by the
Government to examine specific matters and
make recommendations. For certain
important inquiries Royal Commissions,
whose members are chosen for their wide
experience, may be appointed. Royal
Commissions examine evidence from
government departments, interested
organisations and individuals, and submit
recommendations; some prepare regular
reports. Recent examples include the standing
Royal Commission on Environmental
Pollution, which was set up in 1970 and the
Royal Commission on Criminal Justice, set
up in 1991. Inquiries may also be undertaken
by departmental committees.
Government Information Services
Each of the main government departments
has its own information division, public
relations branch or news department. These
are normally staffed by professional
information officers responsible for
communicating their department’s activities
to the news media and the public (sometimes
using publicity services provided by the
Central Office of Information—see
Appendix 1). They also advise their
departments on the public’s reaction.
The Lobby
As press adviser to the Prime Minister, the
Prime Minister’s Press Secretary and other
staff in the Prime Minister’s Press Office have
direct contact with the parliamentary press
through regular meetings with the Lobby
correspondents. The Lobby correspondents
are a group of political correspondents who
have the special privilege of access to the
Lobby of the House of Commons where they
can talk privately to government ministers and
other members of the House. The Prime
Minister’s Press Office is the accepted
channel through which information about
parliamentary business is passed to the media.
Administration of Scottish, Welsh and
Northern Ireland Affairs
Scotland
Scotland has its own system of law and wide
administrative autonomy. The Secretary of
State for Scotland, a Cabinet minister, has
responsibility in Scotland (with some
exceptions) for a wide range of policy matters
(see Appendix 1).
The distinctive conditions and needs of
Scotland and its people are also reflected in
separate Scottish legislation on many
domestic matters. Special provisions applying
to Scotland alone are also inserted in Acts
which otherwise apply to Britain generally.
British government departments with
significant Scottish responsibilities have
offices in Scotland and work closely with the
Scottish Office.
48
GOVERNMENT
Wales
Since 1964 there has been a separate
Secretary of State for Wales who is a member
of the Cabinet and is responsible for many
aspects of Welsh affairs. (For further details
see Appendix 1.)
Northern Ireland
Since the British Government’s assumption
of direct responsibility for Northern Ireland
in 1972 (see p 12), the Secretary of State for
Northern Ireland has been the Cabinet
minister responsible for Northern Ireland
affairs. Through the Northern Ireland Office
the Secretary of State has direct
responsibility for constitutional developments,
law and order, security, and electoral matters.
The work of the Northern Ireland
departments is also subject to the direction
and control of the Secretary of State (see
Appendix 1).
The Civil Service
The Civil Service is concerned with the
conduct of the whole range of government
activities as they affect the community. These
range from policy formulation to carrying
out the day-to-day duties of public
administration.
Civil servants are servants of the Crown.
For all practical purposes the Crown in this
context means, and is represented by, the
Government of the day. There are special
cases in which certain functions are conferred
by law upon particular members of the public
service. However, in general the executive
powers of the Crown are exercised by, and
on the advice of, Her Majesty’s Ministers,
who are in turn answerable to Parliament.
The Civil Service as such has no
constitutional responsibility separate from
that of the duly constituted Government of
the day. The duty of the individual civil
servant is first and foremost to the Minister
of the Crown who is in charge of the
Department concerned. A change of minister,
for whatever reason, does not involve a
change of staff. Ministers sometimes appoint
special advisers from outside the Civil
Service. The advisers are normally paid from
public funds, but their appointments come to
an end when the Government’s term of office
finishes, or when the Minister concerned
leaves the Government or moves to another
appointment.
The number of civil servants has
fallen from 732,000 in April 1979 to
565,000 in April 1992, reflecting the
Government’s policy of controlling the
cost and size of the Civil Service and
of improving its efficiency.
About half of all civil servants are engaged
in the provision of public services. These
include paying sickness benefits and pensions,
collecting taxes and contributions, running
employment services, staffing prisons, and
providing services to industry and
agriculture. Around a quarter are employed
in the Ministry of Defence. The rest are
divided between: central administrative and
policy duties; support services; and largely
financially self-supporting services, for
instance, those provided by the Department
for National Savings and the Royal Mint.
The total includes about 61,000 ‘industrial’
civil servants, mainly manual workers in
government industrial establishments. Four-
fifths of civil servants work outside London.
Equality of Opportunity
The Government is committed to achieving
equality of opportunity for all its staff. In
support of this commitment, the Civil
Service is actively pursuing policies to
increase employment and career opportunities
for women, ethnic minorities and people with
disabilities. The number of black and Asian
people now employed in the Civil Service is
proportionate to their representation in
Britain’s population.
Management Reforms
Reforms of the management of government
departments are being implemented to ensure
improved management performance, in
particular through the increased
accountability of individual managers, based
49
BRITAIN 1993: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
on clear objectives and responsibilities. These
reforms include performance-related pay
schemes and other incentives.
Executive Agencies: Next Steps Initiative
The Next Steps Initiative, launched in 1988,
is intended to improve management in the
Civil Service and the efficiency and quality of
services provided to the public and to
customers within government. This has
involved setting up, as far as practicable,
separate units or agencies to perform the
executive functions of government. Agencies
remain part of the Civil Service but under
the terms of individual framework documents
they enjoy greater delegation on financial, pay
and personnel matters. Agencies are headed
by chief executives who are personally
responsible for the performance of the
agency. By July 1992 more than 75 agencies
had been set up, together with 30 in Customs
and Excise and 34 executive offices within
the Inland Revenue. Over 295,000 civil
servants work in organisations run on Next
Steps lines, amounting to over half the Civil
Service.
Efficiency Measures
In November 1991 the Government
announced further proposals to extend
competition and choice in the provision of
public services. Savings in public expenditure
are being sought by market testing and
competitive tendering of many services
carried out by government departments.
Services are contracted out to the private
sector whenever the evaluation of tenders
indicates that better value for money can be
achieved.
Citizen’s Charter
Government proposals to raise standards in
the public services were set out in a White
Paper, The Citizen's Charter, published in
July 1991. The proposals, which cover all
public services and the privatised utilities,
involve more privatisation, wider competition,
further contracting-out and pay more closely
related to performance. They also include
requirements for published standards of
service and results achieved, comprehensive
information on services, consultation with
users of services, better redress for the citizen
when things go wrong, and tougher and more
independent inspectorates and auditing. All
major public services are expected to publish
separate charters, and so far some 19 have
been issued. (Details of many of these can be
found in the relevant chapters.)
A new Charter Mark has been introduced
to recognise and reward excellence in
delivering services to the public: winners will
be judged by the Prime Minister’s Citizen’s
Advisory Panel. The first awards were made
in September 1992, when 36 public service
organisations received the Charter Mark.
Implementation of the measures is being
co-ordinated by the Citizen’s Charter Unit,
part of the Office of Public Service and
Science (see below).
Executive agencies are expected to comply
fully with the principles of the Citizen’s
Charter. The Government will introduce
legislation to remove obstacles to the
delegation of decisions to civil servants.
Performance-related pay is being introduced
for most staff.
Central Management and Structure
Responsibility for central co-ordination and
management of the Civil Service is divided
between the Treasury and the Cabinet Office
(Office of Public Service and Science). In
addition to its other functions, the Treasury
is responsible for the structure of the Civil
Service. It is also responsible for recruitment
policy and for controlling staffing, pay,
pensions and allowances. The Office of
Public Service and Science, which is under
the control of the Prime Minister, as
Minister for the Civil Service, is responsible
for the organisation, non-financial aspects of
personnel management and overall efficiency
of the Service. The function of official Head
of the Home Civil Service is combined with
that of Secretary to the Cabinet.
At the senior levels, where management
forms a major part of most jobs, there are
common grades throughout the Civil Service.
These unified grades 1 to 7 are known as the
50
GOVERNMENT
Open Structure and cover grades from
Permanent Secretary level to Principal level.
Within the unified grades each post is filled
by the person best equipped in terms of
skills, ability and experience, regardless of the
occupational group to which he or she
previously belonged.
Below this the structure of the non¬
industrial Civil Service is based on a system
of occupational groups, which are the basic
groupings of staff for the purposes of
personnel management. Occupational groups
assist the recruitment and matching of skills
to posts and offer career paths in which
specialist skills can be developed. Some
occupational groups are specific to individual
departments or agencies requiring such skills;
others are more common throughout the
Service.
Departments and agencies are being
encouraged to develop their own pay and
grading arrangements. These are expected to
produce value-for-money benefits which are
greater than those available through centrally
controlled negotiation.
The Diplomatic Service
The Diplomatic Service, a separate service of
some 6,700 or so people, divided between
Diplomatic Service and Home Civil Service
grades, provides the majority of the staff for
the Foreign & Commonwealth Office (see
Appendix 1) and at British diplomatic
missions and consular posts abroad.
The Service has its own grade structure,
linked for salary purposes with that of the
Home Civil Service. Terms and conditions of
service are in many ways comparable, but
take into account the special demands of the
Service, particularly of postings overseas.
Members of the Home Civil Service and the
armed forces, and individuals from the
private sector, may also serve in the Foreign
& Commonwealth Office and at overseas
posts on loan or attachment.
Civil Service Recruitment and Training
Recruitment is based on the principle of
selection on merit by fair and open
competition. Independent Civil Service
Commissioners are responsible for approving
the selection of people for appointment to the
higher levels and to the fast-streams of the
Home Civil Service and the Diplomatic
Service. Recruitment of middle-ranking and
junior staff is the responsibility of
departments and executive agencies; it is
monitored by the Commissioners.
Departments and agencies can choose
whether to undertake this recruitment work
themselves, to employ a private sector
recruitment agency or to use the
Recruitment and Assessment Services Agency
(an executive agency) to recruit on their
behalf.
People from outside the Civil Service may
be recruited directly to all levels, including
the higher levels in the Open Structure,
particularly to posts requiring skills and
experience more readily found in the private
sector. The exchange of staff between the
Civil Service and industry is also encouraged.
Training
Individual government departments and
agencies are responsible for the performance
of their own staff. They provide training and
development to meet their business needs, to
improve performance, and to help staff
respond effectively to changing demands.
The majority of training and development
takes place within departments and agencies.
In addition, the Civil Service College
provides high-quality management and
professional training, mainly for those who
occupy, or hope to occupy, relatively senior
positions. Considerable use is made of other
providers in the private and public sectors.
Many government departments and
agencies employ training officers and tutors
to help organise staff training. Considerable
use is also made of external institutions.
Civil servants under the age of 18 may
continue their general education by attending
courses, usually for one day a week (‘day
release’ schemes). All staff may be entitled to
financial support to continue their education,
mainly in their own time. There are also
opportunities for civil servants to undertake
research and study in areas of interest to
them and to their department or agency.
51
BRITAIN 1993: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Promotion
Departments are responsible for promotion
up to and including Grade 4. Promotion or
appointment to Grades 1 and 2 and all
transfers between departments at these levels
are approved by the Prime Minister, who is
advised by the Head of the Home Civil
Service. Promotions and appointments to
Grade 3 are approved by the Cabinet Office.
Political and Private Activities
Civil servants are required to perform loyally
the duties assigned to them by the
Government of the day, whatever its political
persuasion. It is essential that ministers and
the public should have confidence that the
personal views of civil servants do not
influence the performance of their official
duties, given the role of the Civil Service in
serving successive governments formed by
different parties. The aim of the rules which
govern political activities by civil servants is
to allow them, subject to these fundamental
principles, the greatest possible freedom to
participate in public affairs consistent with
their rights and duties as citizens. The rules
are therefore concerned with activities liable
to give public expression to political views
rather than with privately held beliefs and
opinions.
The Civil Service is divided into three
groups for the purposes of deciding the
extent to which individuals may take part in
political activities. Those in the ‘politically
free’ group, consisting of industrial staff and
non-office grades, are free to engage in any
political activity outside official time,
including adoption as a candidate for the
British or the European Parliament (although
they would have to resign from the Service in
order to be elected). Those in the ‘politically
restricted’ group, which comprises staff in
Grade 7 and above as well as Administration
Trainees and Higher Executive Officers (D),
may not take part in national political
activities but may apply for permission to
take part in local political activities. The
‘intermediate’ group, which comprises all
other civil servants, may apply for permission
to take part in national or local political
activity, apart from candidature for the
British or the European Parliament.
Where required, permission is granted to
the maximum extent consistent with the Civil
Service’s reputation for political impartiality
and the avoidance of any conflict with official
duties. A code of discretion requires
moderation and the avoidance of
embarrassment to ministers.
Generally, there are no restrictions on the
private activities of civil servants, provided
that these do not bring discredit on the Civil
Service, and that there is no possibility of
conflict with official duties. For instance, a
civil servant must comply with any
departmental instruction on the need to seek
authority before taking part in any outside
activity which involves official experience.
Security
As a general rule the political views of civil
servants are not a matter of official concern.
However, no one may be employed in
connection with work which is vital to the
security of the State if they have been
involved in, or associated with, activities
threatening national security. Certain posts
are not open to persons who fall into this
category, or to anyone whose reliability may
be in doubt for any other reason.
Each department is responsible for its own
internal security, advised as necessary by the
Security Service. The Security Commission
may investigate and report on breaches of
security in the public service and advise on
changes in security procedure if requested
to do so by the Prime Minister after
consultation with the Leader of the
Opposition.
Local Government
Although the origins of Britain’s system ol
local government can be traced back to Saxon
times, the first comprehensive system of local
councils was established in the late nineteenth
century. Over the years the range of services
for which local authorities are responsible has
grown and this has been one of the factors
which has led to reforms in the pattern of
local government.
52
GOVERNMENT
Local Government Reform
A major reform of local government took
place in 1974 in England and Wales and in
1975 in Scotland. It was felt at the time that,
while for some services it was more efficient
for local authorities to cover large areas or
serve many people, other services were best
organised through smaller units in order to
meet the needs of individual communities.
Functions were therefore allocated to two
main tiers of local authority: outside London
these were counties and the smaller districts.
In Northern Ireland changes were made in
1973 which left local authorities with fewer
functions than in the rest of Britain.
More recently the Local Government Act
1985 abolished the Greater London Council
and the six metropolitan county councils in
England. In 1986 most of their functions
were transferred to the London boroughs and
metropolitan district councils respectively
(see below).
The Local Government Act 1992 makes
provision for the establishment of a Local
Government Commission to review the
structure, boundaries and electoral
arrangements of local government in England.
The Commission was set up on 1 July. It will
review the structure of local government in
all the shire counties of England over the
next three to four years. It is expected that as
a result of the reviews there will be a
substantial increase in the number of unitary
authorities in England, although there is no
national plan. The Government is also
looking at ways of improving the internal
management of local authorities. Consultation
on these subjects is also taking place in
Scotland and Wales.
Local Authorities’ Powers
Local authorities’ powers and duties are
conferred on them by Parliament, or by
measures taken under its authority.
Administration is the responsibility of the
local authority. In the case of certain services,
however, ministers have powers to secure
some national uniformity in standards in
order to safeguard public health or to protect
the rights of individual citizens. For some
services the minister concerned has wide
powers of supervision; in other cases the
minister’s powers are strictly limited.
Relations with Central Government
The main link between local authorities and
central government in England is the
Department of the Environment, although
other departments such as the Department
for Education and the Home Office are
concerned with various local government
functions. In the rest of Britain the local
authorities deal with the Scottish and Welsh
Offices and the Department of the
Environment for Northern Ireland.
Principal Types of Local Authority
England and Wales (outside Greater London)
are divided into 53 counties, sub-divided into
369 districts. All the districts and 47 of the
counties—the ‘non-metropolitan’ counties—
have locally elected councils with separate
functions. County councils provide large-scale
services, while district councils are
responsible for the more local ones (see p 55).
Greater London—with a population of
some 6 8 million—is divided into 32
boroughs, each of which has a council
responsible for local government in its area;
in addition, there is the Corporation of the
City of London. In the six metropolitan
counties there are 36 district councils; there
are no county councils. A number of services,
however, require a statutory authority over
areas wider than the individual boroughs and
districts. These are waste regulation and
disposal (in certain areas); the police and fire
services, including civil defence, and public
transport (in all metropolitan counties); and
the fire service, including civil defence (in
London). All are run by joint authorities
composed of elected councillors nominated by
the borough or district councils.
In addition to the two-tier local authority
system in England, there are over 8,000
parish councils or meetings. They may
provide and manage local facilities such as
allotments and village halls and may act as
agents for other district council functions.
They also provide a forum for discussion of
53
BRITAIN 1993: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
local issues. In Wales community councils
have similar functions.
On the mainland of Scotland local
government is on a two-tier basis: nine
regions are divided into 53 districts, each of
which has an elected council. There are three
virtually all-purpose authorities for Orkney,
Shetland and the Western Isles. Provision is
also made for local community councils:
although these have no statutory functions,
they can draw attention to matters of local
concern.
The areas and electoral arrangements of
local authorities are kept under review by the
Local Government Boundary Commissions
for England, Wales and Scotland, although
later in 1992 the responsibilities of the Local
Government Boundary Commission for
England will pass to the Local Government
Commission (see p 53).
In Northern Ireland 26 district councils
are responsible for local environmental and
certain other services. Statutory bodies, such
as the Northern Ireland Housing Executive
and area boards, are responsible to central
government departments for administering
other major services (see below).
Election of Councils
Local authority councils consist of elected
unpaid councillors. Councillors may,
however, be entitled to a basic flat rate
allowance and to certain expenses when
attending meetings or taking on special
responsibilities. Parish and community
councillors cannot claim allowances for duties
undertaken within their own council areas.
In England, Wales and Northern Ireland
each council elects its presiding officer and
his or her deputy annually. Some districts
have the ceremonial title of borough, or city,
both granted by royal authority (in Northern
Ireland, by the Secretary of State). In
boroughs and cities the presiding officer is
normally known as the Mayor. In the City of
London and certain other large cities, he or
she is known as the Lord Mayor. In Scotland
the presiding officer of the district council of
each of the four cities is called the Lord
Provost. No specific title is laid down for
those of other councils; some are known as
conveners, while others continue to use the
old title of ‘provost’.
Councillors are elected for four years. All
county councils in England and Wales,
London borough councils, and about two-
thirds of non-metropolitan district councils
are elected in their entirety every four years.
In the remaining districts (including all
metropolitan districts) one-third of the
councillors are elected in each of the three
years between county council elections. In
Scotland local elections are held every two
years, alternately for districts and for regions
and islands authorities. Each election covers
the whole council so that councillors are
elected for four years at a time.
Voters
Anyone may vote at a local government
election in Britain provided he or she is:
• aged 18 years or over;
• is a citizen of Britain or another
Commonwealth country, or a citizen of
the Irish Republic;
• is not subject to any legal incapacity; and
• is on the electoral register.
To qualify for registration a person must
be resident in the council area on the
qualifying date. In Northern Ireland there are
slightly different requirements.
Candidates
A candidate for election as councillor
normally stands as a representative of one of
the national political parties, although there
are some independent candidates, and some
represent local interests. Candidates must be
British citizens, other Commonwealth citizens
or citizens of the Irish Republic, and aged 21
or over. In addition, they must either:
• be registered as local electors in the area
of the local authority to which they seek
election; or
• have lived in or occupied (as owner or
tenant) land or other premises in that
area during the whole of the 12 months
preceding the day on which they are
nominated as candidates; or,
54
GOVERNMENT
• have had their main or only place of work
in the area throughout this 12-month
period.
No one may be elected to a council of
which he or she is an employee, and there are
some other disqualifications. All candidates
for district council elections in Northern
Ireland are required to make a declaration
against terrorism.
Electoral Divisions
Counties in England and Wales are divided
into electoral divisions, each returning one
councillor. Districts in England, Wales and
Northern Ireland are divided into ‘wards’,
returning one councillor or more. In Scotland
the electoral areas in the regions and islands
areas are called electoral divisions, each
returning a single member; the districts are
divided into wards, similarly returning a
single member. For parish or community
council elections in England and Wales, each
parish or community, or ward of a parish or
community, elects one member or more.
Voting Procedure
The procedure for local government voting in
Great Britain is similar to that for
parliamentary elections. In Northern Ireland
local government elections are held on the
basis of proportional representation, and
electoral wards are grouped into district
electoral areas.
Council Functions and Services
In England county councils are responsible for
strategic planning, transport planning,
highways, traffic regulation, education
(although schools may ‘opt out’ of local
government control—see p 151), consumer
protection, refuse disposal, police, the fire
service, libraries and the personal social
services. District councils are responsible for
local services such as environmental health,
housing, decisions on most local planning
applications, and refuse collection. Both tiers
of local authority have powers to provide
facilities like museums, art galleries and parks;
arrangements depend on local agreement.
In the metropolitan counties the district
councils are responsible for all services apart
from the police, the fire service and public
transport and, in some areas, waste regulation
and disposal (see p 53).
In Greater London the boroughs and the
City Corporation have similar functions
but London’s metropolitan police force is
directly responsible to the Home Secretary.
Responsibility for public transport lies with
London Transport.
In Wales the division of functions between
county and district councils is much the same
as that between county and district councils
in non-metropolitan areas of England.
Local authorities in England and Wales
may arrange for any of their functions to be
carried out on their behalf by another local
authority, other than those relating to
education, police, the personal social services
and national parks.
In Scotland the functions of regional and
district authorities are divided up in a similar
way to the counties and districts in England
and Wales. Because of their isolation from
the mainland, Orkney, Shetland and the
Western Isles have single, virtually all¬
purpose authorities; they take part in wider-
scale administration for their police and fire
services, however, and rely on the mainland
for assistance in the more specialised aspects
of education and social work.
In Northern Ireland local environmental
and certain other services, such as leisure and
the arts, are administered by the district
councils. Responsibility for planning, roads,
water supply and sewerage services is
exercised in each district through a divisional
office of the Department of the Environment
for Northern Ireland. Area boards,
responsible to central departments, administer
education, public libraries and the health and
personal services locally. The Northern
Ireland Housing Executive, responsible to the
Department of the Environment, administers
housing.
Internal Organisation of Local
Authorities
Local authorities have considerable freedom
to make arrangements for carrying out their
55
BRITAIN 1993: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
duties. The main policies are decided by the
full council; other matters concerning the
various services are the responsibility of
committees composed of members of the
council. A council may delegate to a
committee or officer any function except
those concerned with raising loans, levying
local taxes or making financial demands on
other local authorities liable to contribute.
These powers are legally reserved to the
council as a whole. Some councils have policy
advisory or co-ordinating committees which
originate policy for implementation by the
full council. The powers and duties of local
authority committees are usually laid down
in formal standing orders. Parish and
community councils in England and Wales
are often able to do their work in full session,
although they appoint committees from time
to time as necessary.
Committees have to reflect the political
composition of the council. In England and
Wales people who are not members of the
council may be appointed to decision-making
committees and are able to speak and take
part in debates; they cannot normally vote.
The legislation also prevents senior officers
and others in politically sensitive posts from
being members of another local authority or
undertaking public political activity. Some of
these provisions have not been introduced in
Northern Ireland.
Public Access
The public (including the press) are admitted
to council, committee and sub-committee
meetings, and have a right of access to
agendas, reports and minutes of meetings and
certain background papers. Local authorities
may exclude the public from meetings and
withhold these papers only in limited
circumstances specified by legislation.
Officers and Employees
Almost 3 million people are employed by
local authorities in Great Britain. These
include administrative, professional and
technical staff, teachers, firefighters, those
engaged in law and order services, and
manual workers.
Nearly half of all local government
workers are employed in the education
service.
Although a few appointments must be
made by all the authorities responsible for the
functions concerned, councils are individually
responsible within national policy
requirements for determining the size and
duties of their workforces. In Northern
Ireland each council must by law appoint a
clerk of the council as its chief officer.
As a general rule, employees are of three
kinds: heads of departments or chief officers;
administrative, professional, clerical and
technical staff; and manual workers. Senior
staff appointments are usually made on the
recommendation of the committee or
committees involved. Most junior
appointments are made by heads of
departments, who are also responsible for
engaging manual workers. Pay and conditions
of service are usually a matter for each council,
although there are scales recommended by
national negotiating machinery between
authorities and trade unions.
Authorities differ in the degree to which
they employ their own permanent staff to
carry out certain functions or use private
firms under contract. The Government’s
policy of promoting value for money is
encouraging the use of private firms where
savings can be made. Authorities are required
to expose to competition the following
services: refuse collection, street cleaning,
school and general catering, vehicle
maintenance, ground maintenance and
building cleaning, sport and leisure
management, construction and building
maintenance and highways work.
Local Authority Finance
Local government expenditure accounts for
about 30 per cent of public spending. The
Government has sought to check local
government spending as part of a general
policy of controlling the growth of public
expenditure. Under the community charge
system, introduced in 1990-91, the
Government has the power to restrain
excessive budgets by setting caps or
maximum limits.
56
GOVERNMENT
In 1991-92 expenditure by local authorities
in Britain amounted to some £63,800 million.
Current expenditure amounted to £52,459
million, and capital expenditure, net of capital
receipts, was £5,749 million and debt interest
£5,600 million.
System of Finance
Local authorities in Great Britain raise
revenue through a community charge, which
is set by each charging local authority and
payable by almost all resident adults. There is
also a grant system, which compensates for
differences in the cost of providing a standard
level of service between authorities. Finally,
in England and Wales, there are uniform
business rates (single rates per pound of
rateable value of business property applying
throughout England and throughout Wales),
the proceeds of which are distributed to
authorities in proportion to the number of
people registered to pay the community
charge. In Scotland progress is being made
towards a uniform business rate. In Northern
Ireland there is, instead of the community
charge, a system of domestic rates (local
property taxes).
Changes to Local Authority Finance
The Government is to replace the community
charge with a council tax with effect from
April 1993. Under the new tax each
household will receive a single bill based on
the market value of property and the number
of adults living in it. Couples on low incomes
will be entitled to rebates of up to 100 per
cent on their council tax bills. There will be
discounts for lone-adult householders and
other less well-off people.
Current Expenditure
In 1991-92 education accounted for 45 per
cent of local authorities’ current expenditure
in England, Scotland and Wales. Most of the
remainder was spent on roads and transport;
housing and other environmental services;
law, order and protective services; and
personal social services.
Capital Expenditure
Local government capital expenditure is
financed primarily by borrowing and from
capital receipts from the disposal of land
and buildings. These sources are
supplemented mainly by capital grants and
contributions from central government.
Control of Finance
Local councils normally have a finance
committee to keep their financial policy
under constant review. Their annual
accounts must be audited by independent
auditors appointed by the Audit
Commission in England and Wales, or by
the Commission for Local Authority
Accounts in Scotland. In Northern Ireland
this role is exercised by a local
government audit section appointed by the
Department of the Environment for
Northern Ireland.
Local Government Complaints System
Citizens’ allegations of injustice resulting
from local government maladministration
may be investigated by independent
statutory Commissions for Local
Administration. The English Commission
has three local commissioners (or local
government ombudsmen). Wales and
Scotland each have a single commissioner.
A report is issued on each complaint
investigated and, if injustice caused by
maladministration is found, the local
ombudsman normally suggests a remedy.
The council must consider the report and
tell the commissioner what action it
proposes to take.
In Northern Ireland a Commissioner for
Complaints deals with complaints alleging
injustices suffered as a result of
maladministration by district councils and
certain other public bodies.

Overseas Relations
Britain’s main foreign policy aims and
objectives are to enhance its security and
prosperity and to promote and protect its
interests overseas through world peace and
economic growth.
It has worldwide interests, including
responsibility for 14 dependent territories and
for over 6 million British citizens who live
overseas. It is one of the world’s leading
trading nations and its overseas investments
are among the largest in the world.
Britain believes that its security and
economic interests can best be protected by
working with other countries. It has
diplomatic or consular relations with 169
countries and is a member ot some 120
international organisations, including the
United Nations (UN), the North Atlantic
Treaty Organisation (NATO) and the
European Community (EC).
Britain has close links with many
developing countries, notably within the
Commonwealth, which links 50 independent
countries. Commonwealth members have the
English language in common and close
professional, academic and commercial ties. In
all, Britain provides development assistance to
over 120 independent countries as well as to
its dependencies.
Britain also has strong links with the
United States, including a common language
and similar democratic and cultural traditions.
Administration
The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary is
responsible for the work of the Foreign and
Commonwealth Office (FCO), which covers
the Diplomatic Service and the Overseas
Development Administration (ODA). He is
supported by four ministers of state and a
parliamentary under-secretary; one of the four
ministers of state is Minister for Overseas
Development.
Work overseas is carried out by
Diplomatic Service staff and locally-engaged
personnel. About 25 per cent of frontline
diplomatic staff are engaged on
political/economic work, 18 per cent on
commercial work, 19 per cent on entry
clearance, 8 per cent on consular work,
4 per cent on information, 6 per cent on aid
administration and 4 per cent on other
activities such as culture, science and
technology. Heads of post account for the
remaining 16 per cent, their time being
divided between functions.
Britain has embassies and high
commissions in 134 countries and
missions at nine international
organisations and conferences. Other
posts include 62 subordinate posts
such as deputy high commissions and
consulates and four British Interest
Sections/Trade Offices. In addition,
there are a further 13 posts staffed
entirely by locally-engaged personnel,
and 203 honorary consulates.
Other departments concerned with
overseas relations include the Ministry of
Defence, the Department of Trade and
Industry (DTI) and the Treasury. When
other departments are involved, the FCO
decides policy in consultation with them. The
department with the main interest usually
takes the lead, particularly in European
Community matters and international
economic policy. The FCO co-ordinates EC
policy through the Cabinet Office European
Secretariat.
The export promotion work of the FCO
and the DTI has been brought together as
the Overseas Trade Service. In April 1991 an
FCO/DTI unit—the Joint Directorate—was
established to ensure the consistent and
coherent presentation and delivery of export

OVERSEAS RELATIONS
services at home and overseas and to improve
the services offered to British business. It is
advised by the British Overseas Trade Board.
Crown Agents helps to arrange purchases
from British aid funds; it also provides
purchasing and management services to
overseas governments and institutions.
The British Council
The British Council is Britain’s principal
agency for cultural relations overseas and has
162 offices in 95 countries. Its main activities
are:
• helping people to study, train or make
professional contacts in Britain;
• enabling British specialists to teach,
advise or establish joint projects abroad;
• teaching English and promoting its use;
• providing library and information
services;
• promoting British education, science and
technology; and
• making British arts and literature more
widely known.
The Council is financed partly by a grant
from the FCO. The training and education
programmes organised by the Council on
behalf of the ODA and the FCO are another
important source of revenue. About a quarter
of its income comes from its own earnings.
DEPENDENT TERRITORIES
Britain’s 14 dependent territories have a
combined population of about 6 million, of
whom 5 8 million live in Hong Kong. Most
territories have considerable self-government,
with their own legislature and civil service.
Britain is generally responsible for defence,
security, external affairs, the civil service and
the judiciary. The territories are:
• Anguilla;
• Bermuda;
• British Antarctic Territory;
• British Indian Ocean Territory;
• British Virgin Islands;
• Cayman Islands;
• Falkland Islands;
• Gibraltar;
• Hong Kong;
• Montserrat;
• Pitcairn, Ducie, Henderson and Oeno;
• St Helena and St Helena Dependencies
(Ascension and Tristan da Cunha);
• South Georgia and the South Sandwich
Islands; and
• Turks and Caicos Islands.
Few are rich in natural resources, and
some are scattered groups of islands. There
are no permanent inhabitants in the British
Antarctic Territory, British Indian Ocean
Territory, South Georgia or the South
Sandwich Islands.
Britain's policy is to help the inhabitants
of the dependent territories to take
independence once that is their
constitutionally expressed wish and where it
is practicable to do so. The reasonable
development needs of the dependent
territories are a first call on the British aid
programme.
The Falkland Islands are the subject of a
territorial claim by Argentina but the
inhabitants wish to retain the link with
Britain. The Government is committed to the
defence of the Islanders’ right to live under a
government of their own choosing. The
Islanders’ right of self-determination is set
out in the 1985 Falkland Islands
Constitution. Argentina also claims South
Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands.
Gibraltar is the subject of a territorial
claim by Spain. Britain wishes to see the
development of practical co-operation
between Gibraltar and Spain to the benefit of
both peoples and remains committed to
honouring the wishes of the people of
Gibraltar as to their future, as set out in the
1969 Gibraltar Constitution.
Hong Kong
In 1984 an agreement was signed between
Britain and the People’s Republic of China
on the future of Hong Kong,1 92 per cent of
'For further details see Britain and Hong Kong (Aspects of
Britain: HMSO, 1992).

BRITAIN 1993: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
which is leased from China until 1997. Under
the Sino-British Joint Declaration, which was
ratified by the two governments in 1985,
Britain is responsible for the administration of
Hong Kong until 30 June 1997. Hong Kong
will then become a Special Administrative
Region (SAR) of China, but its capitalist
system and lifestyle will remain unchanged
for at least 50 years. With the exception of
foreign affairs and defence, the Hong Kong
SAR will enjoy a high degree of autonomy
and its government and legislature will be
composed of Hong Kong people.
In 1990 the British Government
announced that the Hong Kong Government
would introduce 18 directly elected seats into
the 60-seat Legislative Council in 1991.
Elections to these seats took place in
September 1991. The ultimate aim is the
election of all members of the Legislative
Council by universal suffrage.
Legislation was passed in 1990 to give
British citizenship to 50,000 key people (and
their dependants) in Hong Kong without
their having to leave the territory in order to
qualify. Its purpose is to persuade these
people to remain in Hong Kong so that the
territory can remain stable and prosperous up
to and beyond 1997.
Britain and the
United Nations
Britain is fully committed to the principles of
the United Nations and its Charter and
believes that all member states should ensure
that the organisation functions as effectively
as possible to maintain peace, assist
developing countries and protect human
rights and freedoms. Under the Charter, UN
members are committed to refrain from the
threat or use of force against the territory or
political independence of any state and to
seek solutions to their disputes by peaceful
means. Britain is the sixth largest contributor
to the UN budget, contributing about
$49-5 million in 1992.
Because of the Cold War, the Security
Council was for many years unable to
function fully in the ways intended by the
Charter. Now that the Cold War has ended,
Britain believes that the UN has the chance
to revive its authority and to seek to resolve
disputes which threaten international peace
and stability.
Britain is one of the five permanent
members of the UN Security Council,
which has the main responsibility for
maintaining international peace and
security.
As a further step in this process, the
British Prime Minister convened a special
meeting of the Security Council in January
1992—the first ever meeting at the level of
heads of State or Government—in order to
reaffirm the UN’s central role in
strengthening international order and world
peace. At the meeting Council members:
• reaffirmed that all disputes should be
settled peacefully in accordance with the
Charter;
• committed themselves to fighting
terrorism;
• requested the Secretary General to make
recommendations on a more effective role
for the UN in preventive diplomacy and
as peacemaker and peacekeeper
and
• committed themselves to arms control
and the conclusion of a convention on
chemical weapons.
Peacekeeping
Britain is the major contributor to the UN
peacekeeping force in Cyprus and has
provided logistic support to the UN Interim
Force in Lebanon. It contributes personnel to
the United Nations observer mission
established to monitor a demilitarised zone
between Iraq and Kuwait, following the
expulsion of Iraqi forces from Kuwait early
in 1991, and has sent observers to the
western Sahara to participate in the
referendum monitoring operation established
there by the UN. Britain has sent a large
contingent to the UN operation in Cambodia
and has medical personnel in the UN
Protection Force in former Yugoslavia.
60
OVERSEAS RELATIONS
Human Rights
Britain has consistently supported United
Nations efforts to promote human rights
through the establishment of internationally
accepted standards. The UN Charter states
that one purpose of the United Nations is to
achieve international co-operation in
promoting and encouraging respect for
human rights and for fundamental freedoms
for all. Britain believes that expressions of
concern about violations of human rights are
matters of international concern and do not
constitute interference in another state’s
internal affairs.2
UN members pledge themselves to take
joint and separate action in co-operation with
the UN to promote universal respect for, and
observance of, human rights and fundamental
freedoms, without distinction as to race, sex,
language or religion.
Fundamental human rights provisions are
set out in the Universal Declaration of
Human Rights proclaimed by the General
Assembly in 1948, and in the two
International Covenants (one on Economic,
Social and Cultural Rights and the other on
Civil and Political Rights), which impose
legal obligations on those who ratify them
and which came into force in 1976. Britain
has ratified both Covenants. Committees
monitor their implementation by member
states who are parties to the Covenants’
provisions. Britain, in conformity with its
obligations, submits regular reports to the
committees on the measures taken to give
effect to these rights. Britain also recognises
the competence of the committees to receive
and consider state-to-state complaints.
Britain is also a party to international
conventions on:
• the elimination of racial discrimination;
• the elimination of all forms of
discrimination against women;
• prevention of genocide;
• the abolition of slavery;
• the status of refugees and stateless
persons;
• the political rights of women;
• consent to marriage;
• the rights of the child; and
• the ending of torture and other cruel,
inhuman or degrading treatment or
punishment.
Britain is a member of the UN
Commission on Human Rights. British
independent experts also sit on other UN
committees concerned with the observance of
human rights.
In 1985 Britain withdrew from the United
Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural
Organisation (UNESCO). Although Britain
supports the ideals and objectives contained
in UNESCO’s constitution, it had doubts
about the effectiveness with which the
Organisation had pursued them. After a
detailed review of UNESCO activities,
Britain announced in 1990 that the reforms
carried out were not yet sufficient to merit
rejoining the Organisation. The funds saved
from the withdrawal are allocated to a
number of educational, scientific and cultural
programmes in developing countries. Britain’s
contributions to UN aid programmes for
developing countries are described on
pp 77-80.
Membership of the
European Community
Britain is an active and committed member of
the European Community.3
The 1957 Treaty of Rome sets out the
Community’s objectives, which are to
establish:
• a common internal market and closer
union between the peoples of Europe;
• common economic and trade policies;
and
• a framework of Community law.
These objectives have been confirmed and
augmented by the Single European Act 1986
and the Treaty on European Union, which
was agreed by the European Council at
Maastricht in December 1991 (see p 62).
2For further details see Human Rights (Aspects of Britain:
HMSO, 1992).

3 The Community’s 12 member nations are Belgium, Britain,
Denmark, France, Germany, Greece, the Irish Republic, Italy,
Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Portugal and Spain.
BRITAIN 1993: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Member states have agreed to establish a
genuinely free internal market by the end of
1992. The Community, which acts for
member states in international trade
negotiations, accounts for a fifth of world
trade. Over half of Britain’s trade is with the
other member states.
Overseas countries having special links
with the Community are accorded preferential
treatment in aid and the development of
trade.
Treaty on European Union
The Maastricht Treaty comprises changes to
the Treaty of Rome and other new
commitments. It was the result of a year’s
negotiation within two parallel
intergovernmental conferences on political
union and economic and monetary
union.
The Treaty creates the European Union
covering the Community’s existing and
increased responsibilities and has several new
features:
• it introduces the concept of Union
citizenship, provides some measure of
institutional reform and strengthens
control of the Community’s finances;
• it provides—on an intergovernmental
basis rather than within the existing
framework of Community law—for the
establishment of a common foreign and
security policy and for greater co¬
operation on issues concerned with
justice and the law;
• it extends constrained Community
competence to certain defined areas of
policy relating to regional strategy,
consumer protection, education and
vocational training, environmental
objectives and public health;
• it provides for moves towards
economic and monetary union; and
• it embodies the principle of subsidiarity,
under which action is taken at
Community level only if its objectives
cannot be sufficiently achieved by the
member states acting alone.
The European Community

OVERSEAS RELATIONS
The social provisions chapter of the Treaty
of Rome remains unchanged and will
continue to provide the basis of Community
action in social affairs.
A Bill designed to ratify the Maastricht
Treaty has received its second reading in the
House of Commons. The Government has
announced that the remaining stages of the
Bill will start at the end of 1992 or the
beginning of 1993.
Community Institutions
Council of Ministers
Policy decisions are taken by the Council of
Ministers, mostly on the basis of a proposal
made by the European Commission. Some
may be decided by majority or qualified
majority, with votes weighted according to
each country’s size. In other cases the
Council proceeds on the basis of unanimity.
The Single European Act 1986 provided for
increased use of qualified majority voting,
particularly on internal market measures. The
Maastricht Treaty similarly provides for an
extension of majority voting to a limited
number of areas. The Council is the main
Community institution, whose members—-
usually foreign ministers or the ministers
appropriate to the subject under discussion—
represent each country directly in negotiations
between member states.
Member states assume the presidency of
the Council in rotation every six months.
Britain held the office again during the
second half of 1992.
Heads of Government usually meet twice a
year as the European Council, which discusses
Community policies and world affairs generally
and provides guidance on major issues.
European Commission
The European Commission puts forward
policy proposals, executes decisions taken by
the Council of Ministers and ensures that
Community rules are correctly observed. It is
composed of 17 Commissioners (two from
Britain), nominated by member governments
and appointed by common agreement, and is
pledged to act independently of national or
sectional interests.
The Commission administers the
Community’s Structural Funds (see p 66),
prepares a draft budget and negotiates
international agreements on behalf of the
Community.
Under the terms of the Maastricht Treaty,
the Commission and its President would be
subject to the approval of the European
Parliament at the start of their mandate,
which would be for five years, rather than the
current four-year term, from the beginning of
1995.
The Commission can be removed from
office as a whole by a two-thirds majority of
all members of the Parliament in a vote of
censure.
European Parliament
The 518 members of the European
Parliament are directly elected by the people
in member states at five-yearly intervals. Of
Britain’s 81 representatives, 66 are elected in
England, eight in Scotland, four in Wales and
three in Northern Ireland. Members of the
Parliament sit in party political groups and
not national ones. The most recent election
took place in 1989.
Community legislation is enacted by the
Council of Ministers, but the Parliament
must be consulted about major Community
decisions and it has substantial shared power
with the Council over the Community
budget.
The Single European Act 1986 increased
the Parliament’s legislative powers. On certain
proposed legislation, such as that relating to
the internal market, it can voice an opinion on
the Commission’s proposal and on the
common position adopted by the Council of
Ministers. The latter is done at a second
reading, which allows Parliament to make
amendments. The Commission then
reconsiders the proposal and may take account
of the Parliament’s amendments before the
Council makes a final decision. There is a
strict timetable on these consultation
procedures in order to speed decision making.
Under the terms of the Maastricht Treaty
the Parliament would be able, in certain
policy areas, to reject by an absolute majority
63
BRITAIN 1993: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
of its members a proposal adopted by the
Council if agreement could not be reached
between the two institutions in a new joint
Conciliation Committee. This procedure,
applying mainly to Community policies
subject to qualified majority voting in the
Council, would cover internal market
legislation, common policies for research and
development, training and education,
culture, health, consumer affairs and the
environment programme.
The Parliament would also have
additional powers under the Treaty to
investigate alleged contraventions or
maladministration in the implementation of
Community law and to scrutinise the
Commission’s management of Community
finances.
New applications for Community
membership must receive the assent of an
absolute majority of the Parliament, as must
the conclusion of agreements establishing an
association with other countries which
involves reciprocal agreements.
Court of Justice
The Court of Justice, consisting of 13
judges, adjudicates on the meaning of the
Treaties and on any measures taken by the
Council of Ministers and the Commission. It
is the final authority on Community law. Its
rulings must be applied in member states,
which would be fined under the terms of the
Maastricht Treaty for failing to comply with
a judgment of the Court.
There is also a Court of First Instance,
created to relieve the Court of Justice of
some of its workload.
Court of Auditors
The Court of Auditors examines all
Community revenue and expenditure to
see that it has been legally received and
spent, and to ensure sound financial
management. The Maastricht Treaty
would increase the Court’s status by
making it an official Community
institution, alongside the Council of
Ministers, the Commission, the Parliament
and the Court of Justice.
Policy Implementation
Community policies are implemented by:
• regulations which are legally binding on
all member states;
• directives which are binding on the
member states to which they are
addressed, but which allow national
authorities to decide on methods of
implementation;
• decisions which are binding on those to
whom they are addressed, such as
member states, firms or individuals; and
• recommendations and opinions, which
have no binding force.
The Council of Ministers can also indicate
a general policy direction through resolutions.
Finance
The Community is financed by:
• a system of levies on agricultural imports;
• customs duties;
• contributions from member states based
on value added tax (VAT) levied on a
harmonised base, which is capped at 55
per cent of a member’s gross national
product (GNP); and
• contributions from member states based
on GNP.
These are known as ‘own resources’.
When it first joined the Community,
Britain made a net contribution to the
Community substantially in excess of that
justified by its share of GNP. Following
negotiations to put this right, Britain has
received since 1984 an annual abatement of
its contribution equal to two-thirds of the gap
(in the previous year) between what Britain
would have paid to the allocated budget if it
had been financed by uncapped VAT, and its
share of receipts.
Internal Policies
The Single Market
The Single European Act commits member
states to establish a genuine single market by
the end of 1992. The single market
64
OVERSEAS RELATIONS
programme covers, among other things, the
liberalisation of capital movements, the
mutual recognition of professional
qualifications and the opening up of public
procurement markets.
Completion of a single internal
Community market for goods and services
should reduce business costs, stimulate
increased efficiency and improve European
competitiveness in world markets. Britain
regards the successful completion of the single
market as one of the main priorities during its
presidency, concentrating on the liberalisation
of the energy market and transport.
Transport
Britain fully supports the further
liberalisation of transport in the Community.
Measures taken so far include the 1988
regulation to remove quotas on the
movement of road haulage between member
states by 1993, and a 1991 regulation
increasing access to the market for air cargo
operators licensed by member states. Further
measures to liberalise civil aviation were
agreed in June 1992. The opening of the
Channel Tunnel will improve Britain’s links
with other member states.
Economic and Monetary Union
The Community has a European Monetary
System consisting of an exchange rate
mechanism (ERM), the European Currency
Unit (ECU) and enlarged short- and
medium-term credit facilities. The ECU is
based on a ‘basket’ of currencies, the value of
which is recalculated daily.
When the European Monetary System was
first formed in 1979, Britain participated in
the system, with the exception of the ERM,
and deposited 20 per cent of its gold and
currency reserves with the European
Monetary Co-operation Fund in exchange for
ECUs.
In October 1990 it joined the ERM, but,
after a period of worldwide turmoil on the
foreign exchange markets, suspended its
membership in September 1992. The British
Government has stated that the pound will
not rejoin the ERM until there has been a
proper review of the way it works, the
intervention rules, and the obligations placed
on the currencies at the top and bottom of
the ERM’s bands.
In 1989 the European Council approved
the first stage of a three-stage plan for
Economic and Monetary Union (EMU),
drawn up by a committee of governors of
central banks. Implementation of this stage
began in July 1990 and envisages:
• improved co-ordination of economic and
monetary policy;
• completion of the single market;
• the strengthening of competition policy;
and
• member states joining the ERM on equal
terms.
Under transitional stage two, responsibility
for policy would be transferred increasingly
from national authorities to new institutions,
including a European system of central banks.
In stage three, exchange rates would become
permanently fixed and national currencies
would be replaced by a single European
currency.
The British Government supports the
main principles of stage one of the plan but
is opposed to the imposition of a single
European currency.
The Maastricht Treaty provides for the
introduction of a single currency by
1 January 1999, although member states
would have to satisfy certain convergence
criteria relating to inflation rates, government
deficit levels, currency fluctuation margins
and interest rates. A special protocol
recognises that Britain would not be obliged
or committed to move to this final stage of
EMU without a separate decision to do so by
the Government and Parliament at the
appropriate time. This would allow Britain to
retain national policies on monetary and
exchange rate policy. Britain would be free to
join EMU later if it satisfied the convergence
conditions set out in the Treaty.
Research and Development
Community industrial collaboration is
promoted primarily through a five-year frame¬
work programme for the period between 1990
65
BRITAIN 1993: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
and 1994, which defines priorities and sets
out the overall level of funding.
The British Government played a major
role in negotiations on the current
programme by ensuring that its objectives
reflect the needs of British industry and that
they complement other national and
international programmes.
Under the current programme, priority is
being given to information technology
(ESPRIT), telecommunications (RACE) and
industrial materials and technologies.
However, there are other important
programmes covering the environment,
biotechnology, agriculture, health and energy,
along with new funding for the application of
information technology—the Telematics
programme. There is also a scheme for the
exchange of researchers.
Together with a number of other
European states and the European
Commission, Britain participates in the
EUREKA programme, which is concerned
with the commercial exploitation of research
and development and with removing barriers
to commercial success.
Structural Funds
The main objectives of the Community’s
three Structural Funds are to:
• promote economic development in poorer
regions;
• convert regions seriously affected by
industrial decline;
• combat long-term unemployment;
• train young people to find jobs; and
• promote development in rural areas.
Infrastructure projects and productive
investments are financed by the European
Regional Development Fund. The European
Social Fund supports training and
employment measures for the long-term
unemployed and young people. The
Guidance Section of the European
Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund
supports agricultural restructuring and some
rural development measures.
Other Community programmes aim to
assist the development of new economic
activities in regions affected by the
restructuring of traditional industries such as
steel, coal and shipbuilding.
In 1991 Britain received just under 12 per
cent of lending within the Community by the
European Investment Bank. As a non-profit-
making institution, the Bank lends at
competitive interest rates to public and
private capital projects. Lending is directed
towards:
• less favoured regions;
• transport infrastructure;
• protection of the environment;
• improving industrial competitiveness; and
• supporting loans to small and medium¬
sized enterprises.
The Bank also provides loans in support
of the Community’s policy of co-operation
with the countries of the Mediterranean
basin, Central and Eastern Europe and the
African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) states.
The Maastricht Treaty provides for the
setting up of a Cohesion Fund by the end of
1993 in order to reduce the gaps between the
prosperity of the poorest member states of
the Community and the others. The Fund
will Finance projects in the areas of
environmental protection and transport
infrastructure for Spain, Portugal, Greece
and the Irish Republic, provided they have an
appropriate economic programme.
Employment and Social Affairs
Britain believes that the Community’s social
dimension should lie in gains in employment
and prosperity as a result of the single
European market, which will create the
climate for improvements in living and
working conditions. The Government
supports:
• practical measures for employment
growth and to reduce unemployment;
and
• the substantial number of measures taken
on health and safety at work, freedom of
movement for workers, Community-wide
recognition of professional and vocational
qualifications, and equal opportunities
and treatment for women at work.
66
OVERSEAS RELATIONS
However, the Government is opposed to
measures which, in its view, would impose
further regulations and costs on employers
and damage Community competitiveness. For
this reason, it could not accept proposals for
new and far-reaching Community powers in
the social area in the Maastricht Treaty.
The Environment
A regulation establishing the European
Environment Agency was adopted by the
Community in 1990. This is designed to
bring together environmental information
from existing bodies for the use of member
states and the Commission.
In 1988 Britain and most of its
Community partners agreed to reduce
substantially their emissions of sulphur
dioxide and nitrogen dioxide from power
stations, refineries and other large industrial
plants and to set stringent emission standards
for new plants.
In 1987 the Community signed the
Montreal Protocol on substances that
deplete the ozone layer. In 1990 the parties
to the Protocol agreed to phase out
chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) and non-essential
use of halons by 2000. Controls on some
other ozone-depleting chemicals were also
agreed. Britain and the Community
subsequently agreed to phase out CFCs by
mid-1997. Britain has pressed for even earlier
action on these lines. The Protocol is to be
reviewed in November 1992. The Community
is proposing that CFCs, halons and carbon
tetrachloride should now be phased out by
the end of 1995.
Member states are also taking action on car
exhaust pollution. Under these measures,
emissions of nitrogen oxide, carbon monoxide
and hydrocarbons from each new car are
being reduced by about 75 per cent. From
the end of 1992, almost all new petrol-
engined cars will be required to use three-way
catalytic converters and run on unleaded
petrol. Apart from meeting limits on gaseous
emissions, diesel cars and trucks, light vans
and buses over 3-5 tonnes will need to
comply with strict smoke limits. Unleaded
petrol is widely available throughout the
Community.
Britain has played a leading role in the
development of a voluntary Community
scheme for labelling less environmentally
harmful products. There are Community
controls on the movement of hazardous waste
and dangerous chemicals.
A new fund for the environment (LIFE) is
being established, bringing together several
existing funds and incorporating new areas
for Community support.
The Community has banned the import of
whale products, harp and hooded seal pup
skins and ivory from the African elephant.
The Council of Ministers agreed a directive
in December 1991 to protect habitats and
wild flora and fauna through the
establishment of a network of special areas of
conservation.
Agriculture and Fisheries
The Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) is
designed to secure food supplies and to
stabilise markets. It has also, however, created
overproduction and unwanted food surpluses,
placing an increasing burden on the
Community budget.
Britain is one of the main advocates of
reform of the CAP, persuading its partners in
1988 to agree a limit on overall agricultural
spending. In May 1992 agriculture ministers
agreed to:
• a progressive reduction in support prices
for cereals by about 30 per cent from the
start of the 1993-94 marketing year. In
compensation, producers will be offered a
direct subsidy on an area basis, provided
that they agree to take 15 per cent of
their arable land out of production;
• a cut in beef intervention prices by 15
per cent over three years from 1 July
1993 and the progressive introduction of
ceilings from 1993 on the annual amount
of beef which may be purchased into
intervention; and
• the freezing of milk support prices for
1992-93 and cuts in butter support prices
by 2 5 per cent a year in 1993-94 and
1994-95.
Britain has a particular interest in the
control of Community fishing, since a
67
BRITAIN 1993: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
sizeable proportion of the total Community
catch comes from British waters. It therefore
takes an active role in Community fisheries
policy negotiations.
Political Co-operation
Common Foreign and Security Policy
The Single European Act 1986 committed
Community member states to the process of
political co-operation under which they
formulate and implement agreed positions on
major international issues. The Maastricht
Treaty provisions for the establishment of a
common foreign and security policy build on
this process and have been fully endorsed by
the British Government.
Under the Maastricht Treaty, common
foreign and security policies would be
implemented through intergovernmental
procedures in the Council of Ministers.
These would be outside Community
competence and the jurisdiction of the Court
of Justice. The Commission would, however,
continue to be fully associated with the work
carried out and the European Parliament kept
regularly informed.
Co-operation on the whole range of foreign
policies would continue. In addition, on the
basis of general guidelines from the European
Council, the Council of Ministers could
decide that some issues should be the subject
of joint action. It would define the scope and
objectives of such action and the means,
procedures and duration of its
implementation. All decisions would continue
to be taken by unanimity in the Council,
though the Council might decide
unanimously that some implementing
decisions could be taken by majority voting.
Member states would be free to take
national action where imperative, provided
that they informed the other member states.
A special provision ensures that Britain’s
responsibilities as a permanent member of the
UN Security Council (see p 60) would not be
prejudiced.
The Maastricht Treaty says that the
common foreign and security policy ‘shall
include all questions related to the security of
the European Union, including the eventual
framing of a common defence policy, which
might in time lead to a common defence’.
The treaty provides that defence
arrangements at the European level should
not prejudice national policies and must
remain compatible with those of NATO. The
Western European Union (see p 74) would be
built up as the defence pillar of the European
Union.
The Middle East
Community policy towards the Arab—Israeli
dispute has been guided by the European
Council’s Venice Declaration of 1980,
requiring the acceptance of two basic
principles—the right of all countries in the
area, including Israel, to live within secure,
recognised and guaranteed frontiers and the
right of the Palestinian people to self-
determination.
The Community and its member states
have given full support to the Middle East
peace negotiations—based on UN Security
Council Resolutions 242 and 338—which
were inaugurated at the Madrid Conference
in October 1991 under the co-sponsorship of
the United States and the former Soviet
Union. The Community and its member
states are determined to play a constructive
and active role, particularly in the multilateral
aspects of these negotiations.
The Community has fully supported UN
efforts to press Iraq to meet its obligations
under UN Security Council resolutions
adopted following its military defeat and
expulsion from Kuwait. It has also made a
major contribution to the international relief
effort in Iraq, in particular for Kurdish
refugees following violent repression by the
Iraqi regime.
The Former Soviet Union
The abortive coup in Moscow in August
1991 led rapidly first to the Baltic states
regaining their independence and then to the
dissolution of the Soviet Union itself. As the
Union dissolved at the end of 1991, Britain
and its Community partners welcomed the
fact that Russia had taken over responsibility
for the former Soviet Union’s international
68
OVERSEAS RELATIONS
obligations. In response to the unprecedented
situation they faced, they agreed to recognise
the independence of the other former
republics but first sought certain assurances.
The Community asked that new states in the
former Soviet Union, and in Eastern Europe,
should undertake to:
• respect the provisions of the UN Charter
and the commitments in the Helsinki
Final Act and the 1990 Charter of Paris
on the rule of law, democracy and human
rights;
• guarantee the rights of minorities and
ethnic and national groups;
• respect the inviolability of all frontiers,
which could be changed only by peaceful
means and common agreement;
• accept all commitments on disarmament
and nuclear non-proliferation and on
regional stability and security; and
• commit themselves to settle by agreement,
all questions concerning state succession
and regional disputes.
Having obtained the necessary assurances,
the Community duly recognised all the
former Soviet republics as independent
countries. The Community has contributed
substantial sums to help sustain political,
economic and social stability in the newly
independent states, and to encourage
democratic reforms, the introduction of
market economies and regional co-operation.
Former Yugoslavia
The main external efforts to find a solution
to the present crisis in former Yugoslavia,
which followed declarations of independence
by Slovenia and Croatia in June 1991, have
been undertaken through the Conference on
Security and Co-operation in Europe
(CSCE), the EC, and more recently the UN.
In an effort to secure a lasting ceasefire,
the EC established a peace conference in
September 1991. To support this, it also set
up a multinational monitoring mission based
in Zagreb to resolve conflict on the ground.
On the basis of the recommendations of
the Arbitration Commission attached to the
conference, the EC recognised Slovenia,
Bosnia-Hercegovina and Croatia early in
1992. In April 1992 Serbia and Montenegro
proclaimed themselves the Federal Republic
of Yugoslavia (FRY). In September the UN
General Assembly decided that the FRY was
not the continuation to former Yugoslavia
and that it should apply for UN membership
in its own right.
The conflict in Bosnia between the three
main parties, Serbs, Croats and Muslims,
escalated dramatically in April 1992, and in
May the UN imposed a wide range of
sanctions on Serbia and Montenegro because
of their failure to take measures to cease
military interference in Bosnia. The conflict
in Bosnia has resulted in over 2 million
displaced persons.
In recognition of international concern at
the suffering in Bosnia, the EC and the UN
called the London Conference in August
1992, which brought together, for the first
time, all parties to the conflict as well as
other interested parties. This secured a
commitment by all parties to clear principles
for a negotiated settlement. The International
Conference in Geneva under the co¬
chairmanship of the EC and the UN is
continuing the work of the previous
conferences.
South Africa
The Community and its member states con¬
tinue to support the peaceful transformation
of South Africa into a democratic and non-
racial society. They welcomed the opening of
the Convention for a Democratic South
Africa (CODESA) in December 1991 and, as
a demonstration of their support for the
negotiating process, lifted their 1985 ban on
oil exports in April 1992.
The Community and its member states
have expressed their deep concern over
continuing violence in South Africa, and have
urged all parties to participate fully in
constitutional negotiations. A group of EC
Foreign Ministers, led by the British Foreign
and Commonwealth Secretary, visited South
Africa in early September: agreement was
reached on the deployment of EC observers
to strengthen National Peace Accord
structures.
69
BRITAIN 1993: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
The Community has substantially
increased its aid programmes to help the
victims of apartheid.
Justice and Home Affairs
Member states have for some time sought to
act jointly against the threat posed by
international and other terrorism. They have
agreed not to export arms or other military
equipment to countries clearly implicated in
supporting terrorist activity and to take steps
to prevent such material being diverted for
terrorist purposes.
The Twelve believe that there should be
no concessions made under duress to
terrorists or their sponsors and that every
effort should be made to prevent terrorism
and to bring the guilty to justice.
Regular meetings of ministers responsible
for police and criminal issues take place to
develop and discuss co-operative measures to
prevent, investigate and prosecute terrorist
offences and other serious crime. Such
measures include the exchange of police
liaison officers, a secure communications link
between police forces and a regular joint
assessment of the terrorist threat. In
December 1991, member states agreed to set
up a central European Police Office
(EUROPOL) to help combat drug trafficking
and other serious forms of organised crime.
This illustrates the great importance
attached by the Twelve to anti-drugs co¬
operation, which focuses also on international
co-operation, assistance to developing
countries, education and health. A committee
co-ordinates anti-drugs work and a European
political co-operation working group deals
with the international aspects. Britain and its
Community partners believe that the problem
of drug misuse requires a comprehensive
strategy designed to tackle demand and
supply. They fully support the work of the
United Nations in combating drug trafficking
and they also participate in regular meetings
of the Council of Europe’s Pompidou Group,
which deals with anti-drug measures.
Under the Maastricht Treaty, work in all
these areas would be intensified through
increased intergovernmental co-operation.
Britain believes that, with the introduction
of the single market at the end of 1992, some
frontier controls will need to be retained to
ensure that terrorists and other criminals do
not enjoy unlimited freedom to move from
one member state to another.
Trade
Under the Treaty of Rome, the European
Commission negotiates on behalf of the
Community in major international trade
negotiations. The Community is seeking to
extend the world open trading system on
which member states depend for future
growth and jobs, and to defend the interests
of its members against protectionist measures.
One of the Community’s priorities is the
successful conclusion of the Uruguay Round
of trade negotiations launched in 1986. The
negotiations seek to:
• strengthen the rules and disciplines of
the General Agreement on Tariffs and
Trade (GATT);
• liberalise trade in services and
investment;
• improve protection of intellectual
property;
• negotiate multilateral tariff reductions;
and
• establish a fair and market-oriented
system for agricultural trade.
The Community has association and co¬
operation agreements with virtually all non¬
member countries with a Mediterranean
coastline, plus Jordan. These give preferential
access to Community markets. Non-
preferential co-operation agreements have also
been made with individual countries in South
Asia and Latin America, as well as with the
People’s Republic of China, the Association
of South East Asian Nations, the Andean
Pact and the Central American states. Trade
relations with the developing countries of
Africa, the Caribbean and the Pacific are
governed by the Lome Conventions
(see p 77).
The Community has concluded association
agreements with Czechoslovakia, Hungary
and Poland, and is negotiating similar
agreements with Romania and Bulgaria.

built between 1456 and 1486
and was once owned by
Henry VIII.
OVERSEAS RELATIONS
Trade and co-operation agreements have been
concluded with Albania and the three Baltic
states. The Community plans to negotiate
enhanced trade and co-operation agreements
with Russia, Belarus and Kazakhstan.
The European Community has
negotiated an agreement with the
European Free Trade Association
(EFTA) on the creation of a European
Economic Area under which the single
market is to be extended to EFTA
members in January 1993. It will
create a market of over 375 million
people, accounting for some 40 per
cent of world trade, and will facilitate
accession to the Community for those
EFTA countries that wish it.
The Community’s Generalised System of
Preferences grants tariff-free access to the
Community market for most industrial goods
from developing countries and varying
degrees of preferential access for their
agricultural produce (mainly processed) and
textiles. The scheme concentrates benefits on
the poorer producers and countries. Very
few categories of exports from the more
competitive producers are excluded.
The Commonwealth
The Commonwealth4 is a voluntary
association of 50 independent states with a
combined population of some 1,500 million,
nearly a quarter of the world total.
Commonwealth members include some of the
richest and poorest nations of the world
community and also some of the largest and
smallest. Their peoples are drawn from
practically all the world’s main races, from all
continents and from many faiths. Britain
participates fully in all Commonwealth
activities.
The members are Antigua and Barbuda,
Australia, Bahamas, Bangladesh, Barbados,
Belize, Botswana, Britain, Brunei, Canada,

Tobago, Tuvalu, Uganda, Vanuatu, Western
Samoa, Zambia and Zimbabwe. Nauru and
Tuvalu are special members, entitled to take
part in all Commonwealth meetings and
activities, with the exception of
Commonwealth Heads of Government
meetings.
The Queen is recognised as head of the
Commonwealth; she is also head of State in
16 of these countries.
Nearly all the Commonwealth countries
were British territories to which
independence was gradually granted, starting
with the older territories such as Canada,
Australia, and New Zealand where European
settlement had occurred on a large scale.
The modern Commonwealth, comprising
republics and national monarchies as well as
monarchies under the Queen, became
possible when it was agreed in 1949 that
India, on becoming a republic, could
continue to be a member. Since then, almost
all of Britain’s former dependent territories
have attained their independence and have
voluntarily joined the Commonwealth.
Consultation
Consultation between Commonwealth
member states takes place through:
• meetings of heads of Government;
• specialised conferences of other
ministers and officials;
• diplomatic representatives known as
high commissioners;
• non-governmental organisations; and
• other international discussions.
Heads of Government meet every two
years. Proceedings are held in private,
facilitating a frank and informal exchange of
views on international issues. No votes are
taken, decisions being reached by consensus.
Common views are set out in the
71
BRITAIN 1993: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
communiques issued at the end of the
meetings. Occasionally, separate declarations
are made on particular issues.
With the apartheid system now being
abolished in South Africa, Britain hopes that
the Commonwealth will join in building the
new society there by helping to restore
growth to the South African economy, and by
drawing on the Commonwealth’s experience
with education and training programmes.
Britain would support any application by a
post-apartheid South Africa to rejoin the
Commonwealth.
The Commonwealth has expressed concern
about the security and development of the
many small states among its members. Britain
supports regional co-operation and provides
economic aid and technical assistance. It is
also British policy to consult with other
Commonwealth states in the event of
aggression against small member nations and
to involve the UN Security Council where
appropriate.
The Commonwealth Secretariat
The Commonwealth Secretariat promotes
consultation and co-operation, disseminates
information on matters of common concern,
and organises heads of Government meetings,
ministerial meetings and other conferences.
Because of its neutral position the Secretariat
has been able to make its good offices
available in cases of dispute and has carried
out, on request, special assignments requiring
demonstrable impartiality.
The Secretariat is financed by all member
governments on an agreed scale, with Britain
contributing 30 per cent of the total.
The Secretary-General is elected by
Commonwealth Heads of Government.
Technical Co-operation
The Commonwealth Fund for Technical Co¬
operation (CFTC), administered by the
Commonwealth Secretariat, provides expertise
to all developing countries within the
Commonwealth. It enables each state to offer
its own skills to others. Britain contributes
about 30 per cent of Commonwealth income
to the Fund.
Britain also contributes 30 per cent of
Commonwealth income to:
• the Special Commonwealth Fund for
Mozambique, which provides technical
assistance to that country and draws
upon the specialised divisions of the
CFTC; and
• the Enhanced Commonwealth Fund for
Namibia, which provides technical
assistance for social and economic
development.
Most of the expenditure by Britain on
bilateral technical co-operation with
Commonwealth developing countries is on
financing staff for service with
Commonwealth governments and in funding
training places in Britain. The British
Government also finances students from
Commonwealth developing countries. Other
assistance includes sending volunteers to
serve overseas, consultancy services, the
supply of training and research equipment,
and advice given by British scientific and
technical institutions. About 70 per cent of
Britain’s gross bilateral aid goes to
Commonwealth countries, including Britain’s
remaining dependencies.
Commonwealth Organisations
Commonwealth Foundation
The Commonwealth Foundation, financed by
member governments, promotes co-operation
among professional and other non¬
governmental organisations within the
Commonwealth. It has assisted a wide variety
of Commonwealth professional associations,
and has helped in the creation and growth of
many national ones; it has also supported
multidisciplinary professional centres. It is
encouraging the strengthening of non¬
governmental organisations by establishing
liaison units in each Commonwealth country,
exchanging information and supporting
training, meetings and technical exchange.
The Commonwealth Institute
The Commonwealth Institute in London
promotes the Commonwealth, its countries
72
OVERSEAS RELATIONS
and its peoples to the British public. Funded
mainly by the British Government, it has
galleries of permanent exhibitions and a
changing programme of temporary
exhibitions, conferences and performances. Its
education service runs an extensive
programme of teaching about the
Commonwealth for schools. A wide range
of books and other materials can be borrowed.
Other Organisations
Many unofficial organisations, professional
bodies and voluntary societies are vehicles for
co-operation. They include the
Commonwealth Parliamentary Association,
which organises an annual conference of
parliamentarians, the Commonwealth Press
Union, the Association of Commonwealth
Universities, the Commonwealth Games
Federation and the English Speaking Union
of the Commonwealth.
The Commonwealth Trust is a centre for
study and discussion, its library in London
housing one of the largest collections on the
Commonwealth; the Trust, an umbrella
organisation for the Royal Commonwealth
Society and the Victoria League for
Commonwealth Friendship, has branches in
many countries.
Other International
Organisations
Britain is a member of many other
international organisations, including the
International Monetary Fund, established in
1945 (along with the World Bank) to regulate
the international financial system and to
provide a source of credit for member
countries facing balance-of-payments problems.
Britain is also a member of the
Organisation for Economic Co-operation and
Development (OECD), an instrument for
intergovernmental co-operation among 24
industrialised countries. The basic objectives
of the OECD are to promote the economic
growth of its members, to help less developed
countries within and outside its own
membership and to encourage worldwide
trade expansion.
Other organisations to which Britain
belongs or extends support include the
regional development banks in Africa, the
Caribbean, Latin America and Asia; and
specialist technical, agricultural and medical
institutions.
Britain is a founder member of the
Council of Europe, which is open to any
European parliamentary democracy accepting
the rule of law and the protection of
fundamental human rights and freedoms. The
member states co-operate on culture,
education, sport, social questions, legal
affairs, health, crime and drug prevention,
youth affairs and the improvement of the
environment.
The Council was responsible for the
adoption in 1950 of the European Convention
on Human Rights, which Britain was the first
to ratify in 1951. Britain recognises the right
of individual petition and the compulsory
jurisdiction of the European Court of Human
Rights.
International Peace and
Security
Britain is pledged to maintain effective
defence while seeking to reduce tension in
the world. Since 1949 its defence has been
based on membership of NATO, a defensive
alliance based on the principle of collective
security. In November 1991 NATO members
set out a new strategic concept which
emphasised the role of the Alliance as a
source of stability in Europe. They also
established the North Atlantic Co-operation
Council, which brings together NATO and
the new democracies of Central Europe and
the former Soviet Union, which were
formerly members of the Warsaw Pact. In
June 1992, NATO agreed to support, on a
case-by-case basis, peacekeeping activities
under the responsibility of the Conference on
Security and Co-operation in Europe (CSCE).
European Security and Defence
At the Rome and Maastricht summits in
November and December 1991, Britain
agreed with its partners and allies that a
73
BRITAIN 1993: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
European defence identity should be
developed based on the Western European
Union (WEU) as a means of strengthening
NATO’s European pillar. Since then, Britain
has participated in work to develop the
WEU’s operational role, enlarge its
membership and move its headquarters from
London to Brussels in order to enable it to
liaise closely with NATO and European
Community member states.
East-West Relations
Britain welcomes further improvements in
East-West relations including:
• United States-Russian initiatives in
nuclear weapons control and in the
Middle East peace process;
• the expansion in the number of states
participating in the CSCE; and
• the Open Skies agreement, which will
allow reconnaissance flights over CSCE
member states’ territory.
Britain supports reforms made by the
democratically elected governments in Eastern
and Central Europe, and welcomes the
establishment of the Commonwealth of
Independent States following the break-up of
the Soviet Union at the end of 1991. Britain
is also committed to the need to give the new
independent states support and co-operation.
Economic Assistance
Britain recognises the magnitude of the task
now being undertaken by Russia and the
other new governments in Central and
Eastern Europe in transforming their centrally
planned economies into market-based ones.
The British Government’s ‘Know How’
Fund—some £50 million allocated in
1992-93—is helping them by providing
training and advice in such areas as
management and financial services, banking
and accountancy, commercial law and
privatisation of industry and commerce. Some
500 projects are receiving assistance. Britain
is also supporting debt-rescheduling
schemes being negotiated by the International
Monetary Fund with several Eastern
European countries. In addition, it is
participating in other multilateral assistance
plans, including World Bank loans and
European Community agreements liberalising
trade, aimed at encouraging the development
of market economies.
Conference on Security and Co-operation in
Europe
Britain welcomes the recent and significant
improvements in the implementation of the
provisions of the 1975 Helsinki Final Act,
which established a large number of
important political commitments and a code
of behaviour for a more normal and open
relationship between both governments and
peoples in East and West. In order to achieve
these goals, the signatories of the Final Act
made undertakings about security, respect for
human rights, and co-operation in economic,
humanitarian and other matters. These
commitments were developed at follow-up
meetings, notably the Helsinki meeting in
July 1992, which agreed new commitments
on human rights.
Meeting in Paris in 1990, CSCE states
agreed to the formal end of the Cold War. In
the Charter of Paris for a New Europe, they
expressed their commitment to democratic
principles and to the principle of enshrining
human rights and fundamental freedoms in a
society based on the rule of law. They also
agreed to establish a ministerial council
supported by a committee of senior officials
and a permanent secretariat. Another
permanent CSCE body to deal with future
conflicts, an office for human rights and
democratic institutions, and a CSCE
parliamentary assembly have also been set up.
In 1986 participating states signed the
Stockholm Document on confidence- and
security-building measures, designed to bring
about a greater degree of openness and
predictability in military activities. It provides
for advance notification and observation of
planned military manoeuvres and the
provision of detailed information on their
purpose and size. Verification takes place in
the form of on-site challenge inspections. In
1990 and 1992 CSCE states endorsed further
measures, including more detailed exchange
of information on armed forces. Under the
74
OVERSEAS RELATIONS
Open Skies treaty, signed in March 1992 by
NATO and eight former Warsaw Pact
countries, unarmed reconnaissance flights can
fly over the signatories’ territories to check
military activities.
Arms Control
Together with its NATO allies, Britain is
committed to pursuing further progress in
arms control and confidence-building
measures in order to increase security and
stability. They are also playing an active part
in promoting dialogue and co-operation
between states on the basis of the principles
outlined in the 1990 Paris Charter.
Nuclear Weapons
Britain welcomes the commitment by
members of the Commonwealth of
Independent States to implement the arms
control obligations of the former Soviet
Union. These include the START Treaty
(reducing US and Soviet strategic nuclear
weapons) and an undertaking to eliminate
ground-launched tactical nuclear weapons.
The announcement in May 1992 that all
tactical nuclear weapons had been withdrawn
to Russia for dismantling is a positive step
towards the elimination of these weapons.
Agreement was also reached in May 1992 on
the implementation of the START Treaty
and the removal of the remaining strategic
nuclear weapons from Ukraine, Belarus and
Kazakhstan within the Treaty’s seven-year
implementation period. Britain is providing
Russia with special containers and vehicles
for the safe transport of nuclear warheads at
an overall cost of £30 million.
Britain’s Nuclear Deterrent
Britain is committed to maintaining the
minimum strategic nuclear deterrent
necessary to guarantee its future security and
that of its allies. Britain’s deterrent is only a
fraction of the nuclear forces of the United
States and Russia and will continue to be so,
even after the implementation of the START
Treaty and other strategic arms reduction
proposals. It will continue to be a minimum
deterrent when the existing Polaris strategic
submarine force is replaced by Trident
submarines from the mid-1990s.
Britain believes that negotiations on
strategic weapons should continue to focus on
reducing the arsenals of the United States
and Russia, and strongly supports further
moves to scale down the strategic nuclear
arsenals of these countries. It has never ruled
out the possibility of becoming involved in
strategic arms control talks at the appropriate
time. In the meantime, Britain has announced
significant reductions in its sub-strategic
nuclear capability, including a reduction of
about 50 per cent in its nuclear free-fall
bombs.
Non-Proliferation
Britain is a party to the 1968 Non-
Proliferation Treaty (NPT) designed to stop
the spread of nuclear weapons by ensuring
that nuclear materials in non-nuclear-weapons
states are not used for explosive purposes. It
also protects the right of all countries to use
nuclear energy for peaceful purposes.
Britain was the first nuclear-weapons state
to conclude a voluntary agreement with the
International Atomic Energy Agency for the
application of safeguards to some nuclear
installations. Britain and its EC partners have
made proposals to ensure the continuing
effectiveness of the international safeguards,
including the use of special inspections to
undeclared sites.
Britain looks to Russia to abide by the
obligations of a nuclear-weapons state under
the NPT and believes that all other former
Soviet republics should accede to the Treaty
as soon as possible.
The British Government strongly supports
the agreement between the European
Community, the United States, Japan and
Russia to establish an International Science
and Technology Centre in Russia to fund and
co-ordinate the peaceful employment of
former Soviet military scientists. Britain’s
share of EC funding for the centre is some
£2 5 million.
Britain has also undertaken not to use
nuclear weapons against non-nuclear-weapons
states which are parties to the Treaty or to
75
BRITAIN 1993: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
other internationally binding commitments
not to manufacture or acquire nuclear
explosive devices. This undertaking would
not apply in the case of an attack on Britain,
its dependent territories, its armed forces or
its allies by such a state in association or
alliance with a nuclear-weapons state.
Nuclear Testing
Because of the need to preserve nuclear
deterrence for the foreseeable future, Britain
has a continuing requirement to sustain a
minimum programme of nuclear tests to
maintain the safety and effectiveness of its
nuclear deterrent. A comprehensive test ban
therefore remains a long-term goal. The
Government’s view is that progress towards
such a ban can only be made on a step-by-
step basis, taking account of progress on arms
control and improving prospects for effective
verification.
All Britain’s nuclear tests are carried out
underground at the US Nevada Test Site
under the terms of the 1963 Partial Test Ban
Treaty and the 1974 Threshold Test Ban
Treaty, which sets a ceiling on the yield of
nuclear tests. The British Government is
satisfied that these pose no threat to the
environment or public health.
Nuclear-Weapon-Free Zones
The Government thinks that the
establishment of nuclear-weapon-free zones in
certain parts of the world could contribute to
regional security, to non-proliferation and to
disarmament in general, provided that nuclear
weapons do not already feature in the security
of the region involved and that the balance of
security is maintained.
Conventional Weapons
Conventional weapons are by far the largest
component of national armouries. In
November 1991 Britain ratified the agreement
covering reductions in conventional armed
forces in Europe (the CFE Treaty) which
Britain and 21 other states signed in 1990.
The Treaty is designed to establish a balance
of conventional forces at lower levels, while
eliminating the danger of surprise attacks. In
addition, there is provision for a rigorous and
intrusive verification regime. Britain played a
major role in the negotiations. The Treaty
came into force in July 1992, as did an
agreement on numbers of military personnel.
The Gulf war demonstrated the danger of
a nation building up an arsenal far beyond its
legitimate defensive requirements. In order to
introduce greater transparency in the arms
trade, allow the scale of arms build-up in any
one country to be monitored, and discourage
destabilising sales to regions of tension,
Britain tabled, with other EC countries and
Japan, a UN resolution calling for the setting
up of a register of conventional arms
transfers. The resolution was passed at the
UN General Assembly in December 1991,
and a register came into effect in January
1992.
Chemical and Biological Weapons
Britain is working towards a comprehensive
and verifiable ban on chemical weapons,
having abandoned its own chemical weapons
in the late 1950s. A draft convention has been
agreed by the Conference on Disarmament in
Geneva, and this will open for signature in
1993. Biological weapons are already
prohibited under a 1972 Convention. Parties
to the Convention are currently examining
ways of strengthening the verification
provisions.
Britain is an active member of the
Australia Group of 22 mainly OECD states
which harmonise export controls to prevent
the export of certain materials that could be
used for chemical and biological weapons by
proliferators.
Pending implementation of a global ban on
chemical weapons, Britain and some other
Western nations have imposed export
controls on certain chemicals which may be
used to produce chemical weapons; they are
also discussing ways of curbing further
proliferation of chemical weapons.
Development Co-operation
The aim of Britain’s overseas aid effort to
developing countries is to promote
76
OVERSEAS RELATIONS
sustainable economic growth and social
development in order to improve the quality
of life and reduce poverty, suffering and
deprivation in developing countries.
In 1990-91 gross British aid was worth
£1,688 million. Of this, £1,021 million was
allocated bilaterally and £628 million through
international organisations such as the
European Community (£310 million), the
World Bank Group (£159 million), the
United Nations agencies (£78 million) and
the regional development banks (£35 million).
Some £39 million was spent on
administration of the aid programme.
Britain is the sixth largest aid donor in the
world. Its programme seeks to:
• promote economic reform in developing
countries;
• promote good government;
• reduce poverty;
• improve education and health;
• help developing countries tackle
environmental problems;
• promote the private sector;
• contribute to economic development; and
• improve the co-ordination of
international responses to major
emergencies.
Economic Reform
In Britain’s view sustainable development
requires sound economic policies, including
incentives to producers, control over inflation
and the encouragement of savings and
sensible investment. If economic reform is to
succeed, the poorest countries need
substantial help to finance essential imports.
Britain has, therefore, committed or pledged
some £550 million to the Special Programme
of Assistance for sub-Saharan Africa, which
aims to mobilise balance-of-payments support
for low-income African countries affected by
debt. Co-ordinated by the World Bank, this
support is conditional on the application of
economic reform. Countries helped by the
Programme include The Gambia, Ghana,
Uganda, Tanzania, Kenya, Malawi,
Mozambique and Zambia.
Britain also contributes to European
Community aid programmes to 69 African,
Caribbean and Pacific countries under the
Lome Convention. If these countries have an
economic reform programme agreed with the
IMF and World Bank, aid worth £250
million is available from the European
Development Fund.
The International Development
Association provides concessional resources
for World Bank-financed reform programmes.
Up to 30 per cent of the Ninth
Replenishment, to which Britain is
contributing £620 million, is available for this
purpose.
Promotion of Good Government
The principal elements of good government
are:
• sound economic policies, effective use of
resources, absence of corruption and
avoidance of excessive military
expenditure;
• freedom of expression and political
pluralism; and
• respect for human rights and the rule of
law.
Good government, in Britain’s view, is
essential for sustainable development. It is
British policy to consider reducing or
stopping development aid in countries which
show no inclination to improve standards.
Such aid has been stopped in Sudan because
of human rights abuses.
Examples of aid designed to promote good
government include:
• advice and training in public
administraion in Botswana, Lesotho,
Tanzania, Uganda, Mozambique,
Namibia, Zambia and Zimbabwe;
• advice on parliamentary procedure in
Namibia;
• support for legal services in Namibia,
Uganda, Kenya, Lesotho and Zimbabwe;
• support for social services management in
Mexico, customs administration in
Anguilla and public sector reform in
Jamaica; and
• the provision of over 100 training awards
in Britain for Indian civil servants.
77
BRITAIN 1993: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Reduction of Poverty
British aid designed to reduce poverty has
four main elements:
• the allocation of 80 per cent of bilateral
aid for the poorest countries;
• support for economic growth;
• finance of poverty reduction activities; and
• ensuring that vulnerable groups are
protected from hardship during economic
reform.
Much of the work in Africa seeks to
improve social conditions by providing direct
assistance to education, health and community
services. Experts and training help develop
local skills, while materials and equipment are
also provided. In Pakistan and Bangladesh
support is being given to community-based
rural development programmes which will be
self-sustaining in the longer term. In India
some 1-5 million people are benefiting from
improvements in their physical environment
and from improved access to health and
education services. Aid expenditure in
support of such projects in India was
£20 million in 1991.
Some £23 million was spent in 1991-92 on
the joint funding scheme, which co-finances
more than 1,400 projects with over 100 volun¬
tary agencies. Evaluations of the scheme, which
started in 1976, have concluded that these
organisations are well placed to meet the basic
needs of the poorest people. The Government
also meets up to 90 per cent of the costs of
recruiting and sending skilled volunteers to
developing countries, with grants totalling
£15-9 million in 1991-92. Volunteers work
with some of the poorest groups; for example,
in remote parts of Nepal they are responsible
for the running of child-care centres and
community development activities.
The British Government has also
encouraged international agencies to allocate
more funds to poorer countries. Partly as a
result of this, the UN Development
Programme is allocating 55 per cent of its
resources to the least developed countries
from 1992 to 1996. Similarly, the UN
Children’s Fund is paying more attention to
the need to strengthen basic health care for
children and the community.
Education and Health
British aid supports several education
programmes in poorer countries, including:
• teacher training for 150,000 primary
teachers in 50,000 schools in Andhra
Pradesh in India; and
• support for regional polytechnics in
Nigeria.
Help is also given to education ministries
to assist educational planning and the access
of disadvantaged groups to educational
facilities.
In 1990 the ODA provided some 8,385
person-years of training in Britain and
overseas for people from developing
countries.
Britain has committed £26 million to
the World Health Organisation (WHO)
Global Programme on AIDS; in
addition it has pledged £8 2 million
for national and regional AIDS control
programmes in Commonwealth
African and Asian countries and in
Britain’s Caribbean Dependent
Territories.
Health services in over 20 countries are
being supported by the British aid
programme. Special attention is being given
to:
• strengthening primary health care
services, particularly for women and
children;
• improving control of communicable
diseases;
• helping to establish management systems
to ensure the provision of good quality
care at an affordable cost; and
• improving access to reproductive health
services.
Some £90 million has been allocated to
population projects over the last five years.
The aims are to help improve the coverage of
reproductive health services and the reliability
of contraceptive supplies, and to enable
women to take greater control of their lives.
A major contribution is to be made to a
78
I
OVERSEAS RELATIONS
World Bank-led project in Bangladesh where
more than one-third of couples are taking
part in family planning. In the Indian state of
Orissa a British-assisted project is making
progress on strengthening village health and
population services.
The Environment
British aid strategy on the environment is to:
• assess the environmental impact of all aid
projects and take action to reduce any
negative effects;
• emphasise the conservation of forests and
energy efficiency; and
• help developing countries to carry out
studies and participate in discussions on
environmental issues.
In 1989 Britain undertook to commit a
further £100 million towards tropical forestry
projects over a three-year period. Over 120
projects have been approved at a cost of
£62 million. Examples of British aid include:
• the funding of forestry management
experts in Nigeria and Cameroon;
• a £25 million project for the conservation
of the Western Ghats Forest in India;
• a forestry programme in Brazil designed
to assess the impact of deforestation on
climate; and
• support for the Food and Agriculture
Organisation’s Tropical Forest Action
Programme, which helps developing
countries review forest policies and
co-ordinates aid.
Britain supports the World Bank’s forest
policy under which it no longer finances
projects involving logging in primary tropical
rainforest.
Other environmental research supported
by Britain includes:
• projects on safe drinking water and the
environmental effects of irrigation
systems;
• research by the British Geological Survey
on groundwater and mineral resources;
and
• research by the Transport Research
Laboratory on the design and
maintenance of roads, urban transport
planning, road safety and the
environmental aspects of transport.
The Private Sector
British aid aims to help remove obstacles
faced by small-scale enterprises. In order to
improve the policy climate for private
business, assistance is given on tax
administration and planning of privatisation
of state enterprises. Britain has identified six
countries in which to promote small-scale
enterprises. It has undertaken preparatory
work for a small enterprise programme in
Kenya, and in Zimbabwe co-operation has
begun with the Indigenous Business
Development Centre on small business
advisory services.
The ODA continues its long-standing
support for the Commonwealth Development
Corporation (CDC), which promotes
economic development by providing loans,
equity funds and management services for
financially viable investments in agriculture,
fisheries, minerals, industry, public utilities,
transport, communications and housing. In
1991 the CDC invested just over £173
million in 105 projects in 32 countries. By
the end of 1991, it had investments and
commitments worth nearly £1,331 million in
some 310 projects, including
• £530-1 million in Africa;
• £435-6 million in Asia;
• £236-6 million in the Caribbean and
Latin America;
• £121-9 million in Pacific Islands; and
• £6 7 million in other areas.
Emergency Relief
The ODA’s Disaster and Refugee Units co¬
ordinate the British Government’s response
to natural and man-made disasters worldwide.
They also provide relief to refugees and
displaced people. In addition, the ODA funds
operations carried out by agencies such as the
British Red Cross, Oxfam and Save the
Children.
79
BRITAIN 1993: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
The ODA has the capacity to mount
direct relief operations overseas, in co¬
operation with the key international
agencies; trained personnel are available to
assess need, to co-ordinate the British effort
on the ground and to deploy disaster relief
teams.
In 1991 the UN General Assembly
approved a joint British-German proposal
for a high-level UN official to be given
responsibility for directing prompt responses
to emergencies and for co-ordinating UN
appeals.
British humanitarian assistance in
1990-91 amounted to £156 million. Since
the beginning of 1992 Britain has
contributed £24 million to help starving
people in Somalia. British aid for drought
relief in southern Africa exceeds
£48 million.
Aid Management
Ministers agree an aid strategy each year
which establishes priorities and enables the
ODA to calculate budgets for individual
countries and programmes, looking ahead
over the next three years.
Before funds are committed, projects are
examined to ensure that aid resources will be
used effectively. ODA professional advisers
assist in this process. Before being approved,
projects are appraised to ensure that:
• the design is appropriate;
• every possible environmental problem is
foreseen; and
• the project can be sustained after aid
funding ceases.
In addition, checks are made on the
benefits and sustainability of the project and
whether any groups will be harmed.
Implementation of aid-financed projects is
monitored in order to ensure that it proceeds
to plan. The ODA also considers whether the
planned scope and objectives of the project
remain valid or should be changed.
A project completion report is made
to assess the effectiveness of its implemen¬
tation and to see whether any lessons can
be drawn.

Defence
The primary objectives of Britain’s defence
policy are to ensure the country’s security, to
preserve peace with freedom, and to enable it
to pursue its legitimate interests both within
Britain and overseas. Britain’s policy is based
on membership of the North Atlantic Treaty
Organisation (NATO), a defensive alliance
whose collective strength continues to provide
each of its members1 with far greater
security than any could achieve alone.
Despite the radical changes in recent years in
Europe’s security environment, Britain
believes that its security can best be protected
by the continuing maintenance of collective
defence with its NATO allies.
Changes in Europe
There have been important political and
military developments in Europe during the
past few years, including:
• the Maastricht Treaty on European
Union, agreed by European Community
states in December 1991, which includes
the establishment of a common foreign
and security policy;
• the development of the Western
European Union (WEU)2 as the defence
arm of the European Union and the
principal European forum for co¬
operation and consultation on defence
issues for all NATO European members;
• the creation of the consultative North
Atlantic Co-operation Council, made up
of NATO members, the five Eastern and
Central European countries of the former
Warsaw Pact, the three Baltic states and
the republics of the former Soviet Union;
and
1 NATO’s 16 member countries are Belgium, Britain, Canada,
Denmark, France, Germany, Greece, Iceland, Italy, Luxembourg,
the Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Spain, Turkey and the
United States.
2 WEU members are Belgium, Britain, France, Germany, Italy,
Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Portugal and Spain.
• agreements on arms controls, including
substantial reductions of nuclear and
conventional weapons.
Britain and its NATO partners are
readjusting their military structure
and strategy to the new security
position arising from these changes.
Britain believes that the Atlantic
Alliance is still needed to provide
continuing stability and security
during a period of great political
uncertainty in Europe. NATO also
provides the most effective forum for
transatlantic political co-operation
and consultation on security and arms
control.
NATO Policy
At a summit in London in July 1990, NATO
leaders agreed that the basis for Alliance
strategy should be three principles: dialogue,
co-operation, and the maintenance of
collective defence. At a later summit in
November 1991, a new strategy called
Strategic Concept was adopted, in which
Britain and its allies acknowledged that the
threat of a full-scale attack on all NATO’s
European fronts has been removed. At the
same time, there are other possible risks—
notably, ethnic rivalries and territorial
disputes—which could involve outside powers
or spill over into NATO countries. Also,
account has to be taken of a substantial
nuclear arsenal held in the republics of the
former Soviet Union; Russia, in particular,
remains the largest military power in Europe.
There are other dangers outside Europe,
where developing states have modern
weapons of mass destruction that could reach
NATO territory.
The Alliance has to continue:
• to serve as a principal foundation for
security in Europe;
81
BRITAIN 1993: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
• to deter aggression and defend member
states;
• to act as a forum for transatlantic
consultations on security; and
• to preserve the strategic balance in
Europe, by seeking to enhance security
and stability at the lowest possible level
of forces.
The Alliance’s strategy will continue to be
based on the principle that any aggression
will be met with the minimum force,
including the use of nuclear forces, needed
to restore territorial integrity.
NATO Structure
The allies’ strategy will also require the
deployment of smaller forces in forward
areas, especially in the central region of
Europe. These forces will be more flexible in
order to meet the wider variety of possible
threats, and will become more multinational
to underline Alliance solidarity in a crisis.
The new structure will include:
• reaction forces, ready at short notice to
respond to crises and, if necessary,
contribute to initial defence;
• main defence forces, providing the
majority of units to defend the territorial
integrity of the Alliance; and
• augmentation forces to provide
reinforcements as required.
The reaction forces will be subdivided
into smaller, immediate reaction forces, and
more capable rapid reaction forces. The
latter, which will include a substantial
number of British troops and be under a
British command, is planned to be fully
operational by 1995. The maritime reaction
forces, based on the existing standing
naval forces for the Atlantic and the
Mediterranean, will be ready by 1995, as will
the multinational air element. Britain will
contribute to both.
Britain’s Defence for the
1990s
Britain’s defence policy for the 1990s is
defined in terms of three overlapping roles:
• to ensure the protection and security of
Britain and its dependent territories, even
when there is no major external threat;
• to ensure against any major external
threat to Britain and its allies; and
• to contribute to promoting Britain’s
wider security interests through the
maintenance of international peace and
security.
Britain’s Security
The ultimate guarantee of British security
will continue to be the Royal Navy’s
independent nuclear deterrent and a reduced
sub-strategic nuclear force, provided by dual-
capable aircraft. The Polaris fleet will be
replaced from the mid-1990s by Trident
missile submarines, which will give Britain
the flexibility and capability to ensure its
deterrent needs well into the next century.
The number of Royal Air Force (RAF)
nuclear-capable Tornado squadrons is being
reduced from 11 to eight squadrons (with
four based in Germany). A Buccaneer dual-
capable squadron will be withdrawn by 1994,
following Britain’s decision to give up its
missile and artillery nuclear roles, as well as
its maritime tactical nuclear weapons; free-fall
nuclear bombs will be more than halved in
number.
Protection of Britain
The air defence of Britain will be undertaken
primarily by seven squadrons of all-weather
Tornado F3 aircraft, supplemented by 50
Hawk fighters. Airborne early warning (AEW)
will be the task of a squadron of Boeing
Sentry aircraft. The RAF Regiment will
continue ground-based air defence for the
main RAF bases. Type 42 destroyers also con¬
tribute to maritime air defence. From the end
of the decade the European Fighter Aircraft
will play an increasing role in air defence.
With the changing risks to Britain’s
security, including an increase in warning
time of conflict in Europe, the Territorial
Army (TA) is able to take on greater
responsibility for the direct defence of
Britain. The Home Service Force, formed in
1985 to guard key points, is being absorbed
82
DEFENCE
within the TA. The number of regular
battalions earmarked for the defence of Britain
is being reduced from 21 to 15 by the mid-
1990s.
Northern Ireland
The armed forces continue to support the
Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC) in the
fight against terrorism in Northern Ireland.
The Army provides a basic strength of ten
regular units and 6,000 local soldiers which
are part of the regular Army’s Royal Irish
Rangers. The Royal Navy, which carries out
patrols to prevent arms smuggling, and the
RAF also make substantial contributions; the
Royal Marines support the Army and Navy.
Defence of British Dependent Territories
Britain continues to maintain garrisons in Hong
Kong, the Falkland Islands and Gibraltar. In
Hong Kong, Britain is to reduce the garrison
in stages until 1997, when the territory will
become part of China. Gibraltar provides
headquarters and communications facilities for
NATO in the Western Mediterranean, while
a garrison is maintained in Cyprus.
Defence of Britain and its Allies
This role is discharged through the collective
security provided by the Atlantic Alliance.
Defence of Europe
The British Army’s main contribution to the
defence of mainland Europe will be some
55,000 regular soldiers, assigned to the new
Allied Command Europe Rapid Reaction
Corps. This will involve an armoured division
based in Germany and a more lightly equipped
division based in Britain, together with an
airmobile brigade, the permanent commander
for the Corps, and a contribution to the head¬
quarters infrastructure and combat support.
On mobilisation the British contribution will
be increased by a further 35,000 TA troops.
Britain will also have a reduced brigade in
Berlin until the end of 1994, when the last
troops from the former Soviet Union will
leave the eastern part of Germany.
The number of regular Army
personnel based in Europe in
peacetime will be reduced from some
56,600 in April 1991 to about 23,000 in
the mid-1990s.
RAF Germany will be reduced to four
Tornado GR1 strike/attack aircraft
squadrons, two squadrons of Harrier GR5/7
offensive support aircraft and a squadron of
Chinook and Puma helicopters; two Phantom
air defence squadrons have already been
disbanded, while the number of RAF bases in
Germany is also being reduced from four to
two. From 1994 the front-line air forces
based in Britain available for deployment in
the NATO area will include two Tornado
GRla reconnaissance squadrons, three Jaguar
squadrons and one Harrier squadron; aircraft
from these units will form the British air
component of NATO reaction forces. Two
Tornado GR1 anti-ship squadrons will have a
secondary role for strike/attack.
The RAF Air Transport forces will
continue to provide support to reinforce
Europe. Air-to-air refuelling requirements
will be met by Tristar and VC10 aircraft.
The Royal Navy will retain a substantial
amphibious force including Royal Marines.
Britain’s Amphibious Force, together with its
Dutch counterpart, is assigned to NATO as
part of NATO’s rapid reaction forces.
Maritime Defence
Britain has the largest European NATO
navy, with key roles in the defence of Britain,
in support of NATO and in activities outside
the NATO area.
In addition to its four Trident submarines,
which are replacing the Polaris submarines
from the mid-1990s, the Royal Navy will also
operate 12 nuclear-powered and four
conventional submarines. Three anti¬
submarine warfare (ASW) carriers will be
maintained, carrying Sea Harrier aircraft and
Sea King helicopters. A modernised Sea
Harrier (FRS2) aircraft and EH 101 ASW
helicopters are being developed to join the
Navy’s anti-submarine and anti-surface forces
of about 40 destroyers and frigates, and
Nimrod maritime patrol aircraft.
83
BRITAIN 1993: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Europe and the Alliance
Britain’s contribution to NATO is part of the
wider effort which the European allies make
to Alliance defence.
Britain and its European allies play a full
part in the Independent European
Programme Group, which promotes arms co¬
operation among European allies, and in the
Conference of National Armaments Directors,
the forum for defence equipment
collaboration across the Atlantic. They also
work together in the Eurogroup to improve
their contributions to the Alliance and to
achieve better use of available resources. In
addition, the WEU is providing further
impetus towards European defence and
security co-operation. The WEU helped to
co-ordinate contributions by member
countries in mine clearance operations in the
Gulf during the Iran-Iraq war in the late
1980s; in 1990-91 WEU members co¬
ordinated their participation in the
multinational campaign in the Gulf to force
Iraq to withdraw from Kuwait, which it
invaded in 1990.3
Britain believes that NATO needs a strong
European pillar and wants to see the WEU
built up as an effective bridge between
NATO’s defence structures and the
developing political and security policies of
the European Community (EC) states. In
December 1991 the EC agreed to develop the
WEU as a means of safeguarding European
security, while in June 1992 the WEU
countries agreed to help in implementing
conflict-prevention and crisis measures,
including peacekeeping activities in Europe.
Britain’s Wider Security Interests
The promotion of Britain’s wider security
interests is achieved by military assistance and
training, deployments and exercises, and
support for peacekeeping and other
operations.
In the Middle East, Britain retains the
ARMIULA patrol of two destroyers or
3 in 1992 the WEU and NATO began to co-ordinate naval forces
in monitoring United Nations sanctions on Serbia and
Montenegro.
frigates, with appropriate support, to provide
confidence for British shipping in the Gulf
and to demonstrate Britain’s continuing
commitment to the region.
Garrisons are maintained in Belize and
Brunei at the request of the governments
there. Naval deployments also take place
outside Europe in support of Britain’s
security interests, including a major task
group led by the ASW carrier, HMS
Invincible, visiting countries in the Indian and
Pacific oceans during 1992. These
deployments provide an opportunity to
develop relations with countries and to
exercise with their navies.
British military assistance includes
training for a number of Gulf
countries, Angola, Namibia and
Nigeria. During 1990-91 nearly 4,100
students from 88 countries attended
military training courses in Britain.
More than 450 servicemen were on
loan to 30 states during April 1992.
Britain supports the United Nations in its
efforts to resolve security problems
worldwide. It provides the largest national
troop contingent to the United Nations Force
in Cyprus, as well as participating in
peacekeeping and monitoring forces in
Western Sahara, Cambodia, former
Yugoslavia, and on the Iraq—Kuwait border.
The Armed Forces
Personnel
In April 1992 the strength of the regular
armed forces, all volunteers, was about
293,400: 62,100 in the Royal Navy and the
Royal Marines, 145,400 in the Army and
86,000 in the RAF. The Ministry of Defence
employed 139,500 civilians (based in Britain)
at the same date.
The 19,600 female personnel in the
nursing and women’s services (4,600 in the
Roval Navy, 7,800 in the Army and 7,300 in
the RAF) serve in Britain and overseas.
The new changes will mean a reduction of
20 per cent in the strength of the armed
84
DEFENCE
forces to around 55,000 in the Royal Navy
and the Royal Marines; 116,000 in the Army;
and 75,000 in the RAF. The number of
headquarters staff and civilian personnel
employed by the Ministry of Defence will be
similarly reduced.
Commissioned Ranks
Commissions, either by promotion from the
ranks or by direct entry based on educational
and other qualifications, are granted for short,
medium and long terms. All three Services
have schemes for school, university and
college sponsorships.
Commissioned ranks receive initial training
at the Britannia Royal Naval College,
Dartmouth; the Royal Military Academy,
Sandhurst; or the Royal Air Force College,
Cranwell. This is followed by specialist
training, often including degree courses at
Service establishments or universities.
Higher training for officers is provided by
the Royal Naval College, Greenwich; the
Army Staff College at Camberley; and the
Royal Air Force Staff College at Bracknell.
Selected senior officers and civilian officials
from Britain attend the Joint Services
Defence College, Greenwich, and the Royal
College of Defence Studies, London, which is
also attended by officers and officials from
other countries. These provide the wider
background necessary for those destined to
fill higher appointments.
Non-commissioned Ranks
Engagements for non-commissioned ranks
range from three to 22 years, with a wide
choice of length and terms of service. Subject
to a minimum period of service, entrants may
leave at any time, at 18 months’ notice (12
months for certain engagements). Discharge
may also be granted on compassionate
grounds, by purchase, or on grounds of
conscience.
Throughout their Service careers non¬
commissioned personnel receive basic training
supplemented by specialist training. Study for
educational qualifications is encouraged and
Service trade and technical training lead to
nationally recognised qualifications.
Reserve Forces
Trained reserve and auxiliary forces
supplement the regular forces on mobilisation
and are able immediately to take their places
either as formed units or as individual
reinforcements. They are also a link between
the Services and the civil community. Some
members of these forces become reservists
following a period of regular service (regular
reserve); others are volunteers who train in
their spare time. Volunteer reserve forces
include the TA, which is responsible for the
direct defence of Britain as well as providing
a flexible general reserve.
Other volunteer forces include the Royal
Naval and Royal Marines Reserves, the Royal
Naval Auxiliary Service, the Royal Auxiliary
Air Force and the Royal Air Force Volunteer
Reserve.
In April 1992 regular reserves totalled
260,800 and volunteer reserves and auxiliary
forces 88,300. Cadet forces, which make a
significant contribution to recruitment to the
regular forces, numbered 135,300.
Combat Forces
Strategic Nuclear Forces
The Royal Navy’s Polaris force comprises
four nuclear submarines, each of which can
remain on underwater patrol for long periods
and is capable of carrying 16 nuclear-armed
Polaris missiles. The missile system,
incorporating improvements designed to
penetrate anti-ballistic missile defences, will
maintain the force’s effectiveness until it is
replaced from the mid-1990s by four Trident
nuclear submarines.
The Trident programme, which will
cost an estimated £10,518 million, is
expected to account on average for less than
3 per cent of the defence budget (and less
than 6 per cent of the equipment budget)
during its procurement period. It is also
estimated that about 70 per cent of the
money will be spent in Britain. Three of
the submarines designed to carry Trident
missiles are under construction; the order
for the fourth was announced in July 1992.
85
BRITAIN 1993: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Royal Navy Combat Forces
Britain’s naval forces, while capable of
operating throughout the world when
required, are concentrated in the Eastern
Atlantic and in the Channel, where they
constitute the majority of naval forces
immediately available to NATO. Their
primarv role is anti-submarine warfare. The
Royal Navy includes:
• three Invincible-class ASW carriers,
deploying Sea King anti-submarine and
airborne early warning helicopters, Sea
Harrier aircraft, and Sea Dart air defence
missiles;
• 13 nuclear-powered attack submarines
(with another one on order), equipped
with torpedoes and anti-ship missiles; and
• seven diesel-electric-powered submarines,
including the more powerful Upholder
class, the first three of which have
entered service.
The Royal Navy also has 47 destroyers
and frigates (including the first four of the
new Type 23 frigate) for air defence, anti¬
submarine and general purpose duties. These
are to be reduced to about 40. Most have
weapon-carrying helicopters, and their
armaments include surface-to-surface, air
defence, and anti-ship missiles. There are
also Royal Marines forces, specialist
amphibious shipping and supporting vessels.
Other ships include mine counter-measures
vessels, and patrol vessels for protecting
fishing interests and oil and gas rigs.
In future Britain’s contribution to
NATO’s maritime defence will be made up
of nuclear-powered attack submarines and
advanced diesel-electric conventional
submarines; the Type 23 frigate (of which
four are in service and nine under
construction or on order); and Nimrod
maritime patrol aircraft, equipped with
Searchwater radar and armed with Harpoon
anti-ship missiles and Stingray anti¬
submarine torpedoes. In addition, the surface
fleet has been strengthened by 14 multi-role
Type 22 frigates and by the new Sandown
class of minehunter. A new class of frigate is
planned to replace the Type 42 destroyer at
the end of the century.
New or improved weapons will include the
Harpoon missile for the last four Type 22
and for the new Type 23 frigates, the Sea
Eagle anti-ship missile, Goalkeeper rapid
firing guns, and, for submarines, the
Spearfish torpedo. The Sea Wolf and Sea
Dart air defence missiles are also being
developed or improved. The Type 23 frigate,
to be armed with the ship- or air-launched
Stingray torpedo and the Sea Wolf missile,
will also have the EH101 helicopter when
that enters service later in the decade. The
Sea Harriers are being updated, as is the
Lynx Mk 3 helicopter.
Army Combat Forces
The three armoured divisions deployed in
Germany, equipped with Chieftain and the
more modern Challenger 1 tanks, will be
replaced from the mid-1990s by one
armoured division armed with the new
Challenger 2 and an improved Challenger 1.
This division, and a more lightly-equipped
division based in Britain, will be assigned to
the Rapid Reaction Corps. The mobility and
fire power of the armoured infantry are being
enhanced by the Warrior mechanised infantry
combat vehicle. Deployment also continues of
the SA80 rifle and the light anti-tank weapon
LAW80, which have markedly improved the
infantry’s fire power.
The Army’s anti-tank arsenal is being
increased by the multiple launch rocket
system, which can scatter anti-tank mines at
long range. A new attack helicopter will be
ordered for the Army, while improvements
are being made to the Lynx anti-tank
helicopter, more of which are being acquired.
The delivery of a new 155mm self-propelled
howitzer is planned for 1992-93.
Major improvements to the Army’s air
defences are planned, including the
introduction of the Starstreak missile,
advanced Rapier missiles and a new air
defence command and control system.
Royal Air Force
Following the withdrawal from service of
Phantom aircraft by mid-1993, seven
squadrons of Tornado F3 aircraft together
86
DEFENCE
with Rapier surface-to-air missiles and
Oerlikon guns directed by Skyguard radar—
will provide Britain’s air defence. They will
be assisted by seven Boeing AEW aircraft
which began operations in 1991-92, and the
ground radars and communication systems
of the improved United Kingdom Air
Defence Ground Environment. In addition,
a number of Hawk trainer aircraft have been
equipped with air-to-air missiles and cannon
for local air defence. The strike/attack fleet
is equipped with the Tornado GR1; a
variant of this aircraft is replacing some
Jaguars to provide reconnaissance. Close air
support for ground troops is provided by the
Harrier GR5/7 and Jaguar aircraft.
Nimrod maritime aircraft form part of
Britain’s anti-submarine warfare force, and
also undertake long-range surveillance
operations against surface ships, as well as
providing offshore surveillance and fishery
protection. Two squadrons of maritime
strike Buccaneer aircraft will be replaced by
Tornado GRls armed with Sea Eagle
missiles.
TriStar and VC 10 aircraft are used as
tankers for in-flight refuelling. Tactical
transport is provided by VC 10 and Hercules
aircraft, while Chinook, Puma and Wessex
helicopters provide tactical support to
ground forces. Sea King and Wessex
helicopters perform search and rescue duties
around the British Isles. Weapons in service
include Skyflash, Sparrow, Sidewinder,
Martel and Sea Eagle missiles, and guided
and cluster bombs.
Improvements to Britain’s air defence
include the modernisation of the Tornado
F3 radar, better communications and control
systems and the introduction of the Boeing
AEW aircraft. The ability of the Tornado
GR1 to attack at night will be enhanced; the
new Harrier GR5 is also being upgraded to
a night-attack version, GR7, the first
squadron of which became operational in
1991. New Harrier T10 two-seat trainers are
also being bought. All strike/attack and
offensive support aircraft will be fitted with
advanced electronic warfare equipment to
increase their ability to survive. The
Tornado GR1, already equipped with the
British JP233 airfield attack weapon, will
have the ALARM anti-radiation missile. An
advanced short-range missile is to be
developed for the Harrier. Air-to-air
refuelling capacity is being increased by
converting more VC10 aircraft into tankers.
The Chinook helicopter fleet is being
modernised.
Finance and Management
The defence budget for 1991-92 is £24,557
million. Britain devoted 4-2 per cent of gross
domestic product to defence expenditure in
1991, compared with 5'6 per cent being
spent by Greece, 5-5 per cent by the United
States, 4-8 per cent by Turkey and 3-5 per
cent by France.
Increased competition in the letting of
contracts has improved both quality and
value for money. The purchase of
equipment is estimated to account for about
37 per cent of Britain’s defence expenditure
in 1992-93.
Organisation and Management
Within the Ministry of Defence a military-
civilian Defence Staff is responsible for
defence policy and strategy, operational
requirements and commitments. An Office
of Management and Budget handles budgets
and resources. Each Service Chief of Staff
reports through the Chief of Defence Staff
to the Defence Secretary on matters related
to the fighting effectiveness, management,
efficiency and morale of his Service. The
management of the three services is
exercised through executive committees of
the Service Boards, which are chaired by
their respective Chiefs of Staff and act in
accordance with centrally determined policy
objectives and budgets. The Procurement
Executive deals with the purchase of
equipment, including equipment
collaboration with allies and friendly nations.
Under a new system of budgeting,
military and civilian managers have greater
discretion in the most efficient use of their
allocated resources. This new approach aims
to promote better value for money, and to
provide clear direction for local managers.
87
BRITAIN 1993: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Defence Procurement
About £10,298 million is being spent on
defence equipment in 1992-93, making the
Ministry of Defence British industry’s largest
customer. Contracts are awarded by open
international competition where possible, and
strict guidelines ensure companies are given
the maximum incentive to perform efficiently.
Research and Development
Research is undertaken by the Ministry’s
research establishments and under contract in
industry and the universities.
Nearly all design and development of
defence equipment is carried out by industry.
The Ministry seeks to involve industry in the
research programme and to promote civil
applications. As part of the Government’s
policy of improving the strength of Britain’s
science base, the Ministry, together with the
research councils, makes joint grants to
academic institutions in areas of research
relevant to defence. In order to obtain better
value for money, the Ministry’s main non¬
nuclear research and development
establishments were combined into the
Defence Research Agency, which began
operating in 1991. Another research
organisation—the Chemical and Biological
Defence Establishment—was launched as a
Defence Support Agency in 1991.
Around £474 million is expected to be
spent on defence research and £2,380 million
on development in 1992-93.
Alliance Co-operation
International co-operation has been a feature
of armaments procurement for over 20 years,
and Britain was one of its pioneers in
programmes such as the British-? rench
Jaguar aircraft and the Lynx, Puma and
Gazelle helicopters; the FH70 towed howitzer
developed jointly with Germany and Italy;
and the successful Tornado aircraft developed
and produced with the same two partners.
Britain also worked with the United States on
the Harrier GR5.
In order to make better use of limited
resources, Britain plays an active role in
NATO’s Conference of National Armaments
Directors, and the Independent European
Programme Group. In the latter, ten member
countries are following Britain and France in
publishing bulletins of contract opportunities,
so helping to open up the European defence
equipment market.
Major new collaborative programmes
under way include:
• the EH101 helicopter (with Italy);
• the new European Fighter Aircraft (with
Italy and Spain);
• anti-aircraft missiles (with France and
Italy); and
• anti-tank guided weapons (with France
and Germany).
Civil Defence
Civil defence arrangements are based on the
extended and adapted use of the peacetime
resources of government departments, local
authorities, emergency services and
nationalised industries, supplemented by the
efforts of voluntary organisations and
individual volunteers. Civil defence
regulations require local government
authorities to make and keep up-to-date plans
for a range of essential functions in the event
of war; to arrange training and exercises for
civil defence staff and volunteers; and to
provide suitable emergency centres for the
direction of civil defence in wartime.
Following legislation in 1986, local authorities
may use their civil defence resources in
responding to peacetime emergencies.
Expenditure on civil defence has been
growing steadily and was about £129 million
in 1990-91. This is being used to:
• improve the quality and readiness of
central and local government planning;
• increase training opportunities arranged
by the Home Office;
• help local authorities to plan for better
community involvement in civil defence;
and
• improve the emergency system for
decentralised government control and
communications.

5 Justice and the Law
England and Wales, Scotland and Northern
Ireland all have their own legal systems, with
considerable differences in law, organisation
and practice. However, a large volume of
modern legislation applies throughout Britain.
The main sources of law are government
legislation, common law and European
Community law. Common law is the ancient
law of the land deduced from custom and
interpreted by judges; it has never been
precisely defined or codified but forms the
basis of the law except when superseded by
legislation. European Community law is
confined mainly to economic and social
matters; in certain circumstances it takes
precedence over domestic law. It is normally
applied by the domestic courts, but the most
authoritative rulings are given by the
Community’s Court of Justice.
Changes to United Kingdom law have
been made following rulings of the European
Court of Human Rights. These arose where
domestic law was in breach of the Council of
Europe’s Convention for the Protection of
Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms,
to which Britain is a party.
Criminal Justice
The aims of the criminal justice system are:
• to prevent and reduce crime where
possible;
• to help victims;
• to deal fairly, justly and without delay
with those suspected, accused or
convicted of offences;
• to convict the guilty and acquit the
innocent; and
• to punish suitably those found guilty.
Royal Commission
In the light of cases of miscarriage of justice,
which the Government acknowledges as a
cause for concern, a Royal Commission is
currently examining the effectiveness of the
criminal justice system in England and
Wales. One of the main aims of the review,
which will report in 1993, is to minimise as
far as possible the likelihood of such
miscarriages happening again.
Crime Statistics
Differences in the legal systems, police
recording practices and statistical
classifications in the countries of Britain make
it impracticable to analyse in detail trends in
crime for the country as a whole.
Nevertheless, it is clear that, as in Western
Europe generally, there has been a substantial
increase in crime since the early 1950s.
However, annual official statistics cover only
crime recorded by the police (Table 5.1) and
can be affected by changes in the proportion
of crimes which are undiscovered or
unreported.
The Scottish police recorded 593,000
crimes in 1991, of which 184,400 were
cleared up. In Northern Ireland about 63,500
crimes were recorded, of which almost 20,700
were cleared up. Crime tends to be
concentrated in inner cities and deprived
areas; the risk of burglary in inner city areas
is about twice as high as the national average.
Rising affluence has provided more
opportunities for casual property crime. In
1957, for example, car crime was only
one-tenth of total crime but this has risen to
about a third.
89
BRITAIN 1993: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Most crime is committed by young males,
is opportunist and is not planned by
hardened professional criminals, although
these do exist. Only a small proportion of
young male offenders go on to become
serious repeat offenders.
Crime Prevention
National publicity campaigns, such as ‘Crime
Prevention Week’ in 1991 and the ‘Car
Crime Prevention Year’ campaign during
1992, are a regular feature of the
Government’s programmes. The Home
Office’s Crime Prevention Unit encourages
local agencies to design and implement
preventive measures and to assess the results.
Other government departments are brought
together with the Home Office to formulate
crime prevention strategies. The Department
of the Environment’s programmes are
designed to encourage improvements in the
design, layout and management of housing
estates.
Local crime prevention panels—each one
assisted by the police—identify crime
problems and try to tackle them through
publicity, marking goods and equipment, and
fund-raising to buy security devices. The
police have been closely involved in setting
up 92,000 neighbourhood watch schemes in
England and Wales. There are some 2,000
watch schemes in Scotland.
Crime Concern, a national independent
organisation, encourages local initiatives and
business participation in crime prevention.
In 1986 five local projects were set up
with government support to see how crime
and the fear of crime could be reduced
through action by local government, private
businesses, the police and voluntary agencies.
As part of the Government’s Safer Cities
projects, this model has been adapted for use
in 20 inner city areas in England and Wales.
Each project is led by a committee, drawn
from local agencies and supported by a co¬
ordinator funded by the Home Office. There
is a Safer Cities programme in Scotland and
similar projects are being funded by the
Government in Northern Ireland.
Helping the Victim
Consideration is given to the needs of victims
of crime. There are, for instance, more than
375 victim support schemes, covering 97 per
cent of the population in England and Wales,
with over 7,000 volunteer visitors. They are
co-ordinated by a national organisation,
Victim Support, which receives a government
grant. The Government also finances local
schemes to meet either the salaries of co¬
ordinators or running costs. Victim Support
is also established in Northern Ireland, and a
similar scheme operates in Scotland.
In 1990 the Government published its
Victims' Charter, setting out for the first time
the standards of service that victims of crime
should expect from criminal justice agencies.
Innocent victims of violent crime in
England, Wales and Scotland, including
foreign nationals, may be eligible for
compensation under the Criminal Injuries
Compensation Scheme. Compensation is

JUSTICE AND THE LAW
based on common law damages and is a
lump-sum payment. In Northern Ireland
there is separate, statutory provision in
certain circumstances for compensation to be
paid from public funds for criminal injuries,
and for malicious damage to property,
including the resulting loss of profits.
In 1990 Britain ratified a European
Convention under which mutual
arrangements for compensation apply to
citizens of those countries in which the
Convention is in force.
Strengthening the Law
Measures to strengthen the criminal justice
system have been taken in recent years. The
courts now have powers to trace, freeze and
confiscate the proceeds of drug trafficking. A
court can issue an order requiring the
offender to pay an amount equal to the full
value of the proceeds arising from the
trafficking. The laundering of illegal money
associated with trafficking is unlawful.
Because of the international nature of the
problem, restraint and confiscation orders
made by courts can be enforced against assets
held overseas, and vice versa. These
arrangements apply to countries with which
mutual enforcement agreements have been
concluded. A Government fund—financed
from the proceeds of drug trafficking seized
under international confiscation agreements—
assists international drug investigations and
projects directed against misuse of drugs.
A court may also make a confiscation
order against the proceeds arising from
offences such as robbery, fraud, blackmail
and insider dealing in shares.
A law has been passed to increase controls
on firearms. The private ownership of certain
highly dangerous types of weapon such as
high-powered self-loading rifles and burst-fire
weapons is banned. The police license the
possession of firearms and have increased
powers to regulate their safekeeping and
movement. Similar legislation applies in
Northern Ireland. The Government has
proposed that responsibility for firearms
licensing in England, Wales and Scotland
should pass from the police to a national
civilian control board.
It is unlawful to manufacture, sell or
import weapons such as knuckledusters or, in
England and Wales, to carry a knife in a
public place without good reason.
The Criminal Justice Act 1991 has made a
number of reforms on the early release of
prisoners (see p 104).
Measures to Combat Terrorism
The Government has certain exceptional
powers for dealing with and preventing
terrorist activities. These take account of the
need to achieve a proper balance between the
safety of the public and the rights of the
individual.
Northern Ireland
The security forces in Northern Ireland have
special powers to search, question and arrest.
The maximum period for which the police
can hold a suspected terrorist on their own
authority has been reduced from 72 to 48
hours, although he or she can be held for up
to a further five days with the consent of
the Secretary of State. Legislation allows
terrorist organisations to be banned by the
Government. Terrorist offences which are
tried on indictment are heard and dealt with
in the Crown Court by a single judge sitting
alone without a jury largely because of the
possibility of jurors being intimidated by
terrorist organisations.
Nobody can be imprisoned for political
beliefs. All prisoners, except those awaiting
trial, have been found guilty in court of
criminal offences. The legislation is
reviewed annually by an independent
person whose reports are presented to
Parliament, which has to renew the legislation
each year.
Other Legislation
Other legislation applies throughout Britain
and is renewable annually by Parliament. It
provides for the exclusion from Great Britain,
Northern Ireland or the United Kingdom of
people connected with terrorism related to
Northern Ireland affairs and for the banning
of terrorist organisations in Great Britain. It
91
BRITAIN 1993: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
also gives the police powers to arrest
suspects without warrant and hold them
for 48 hours and, with ministerial approval,
for up to a further five days. This provision
also applies to suspected international
terrorists.
It is a criminal offence to finance terrorism
or receive funds for use in the furtherance of
terrorism. Police can apply for a court order to
freeze a suspect’s assets once he or she has
been charged. Funds can be confiscated if a
person is convicted. The legislation allows for
reciprocal enforcement agreements with other
countries.
The Government believes that there
should be no concessions to terrorist demands
and that international co-operation is essential
in tracking down terrorists and impeding
their movement from one country to another.
THE POLICE SERVICE
Organisation
There are 52 police forces in Britain, mainly
organised on a local basis. The Metropolitan
Police Force and the City of London force
are responsible for policing London. At the
end of 1991 police strength in Britain was
about 150,000, of which the Royal Ulster
Constabulary numbered over 8,200. Each
force has an attachment of volunteer special
constables who perform police duties in their
spare time, without pay, acting mainly as
auxiliaries to the regular force. In Northern
Ireland there is a 4,600-strong part-time and
full-time paid reserve.
Police forces are maintained in England
and Wales by committees of local county
councillors and magistrates, and in Scotland
by regional and islands councils. The Home
Secretary is responsible for London’s
Metropolitan Police Force. In Northern
Ireland the police force is responsible to a
body appointed by the Government. The
police service is financed by central and local
government. Expenditure on the service in
1991-92 was about £6,500 million.
Chief constables are in charge of their
police forces and are responsible for the
appointment, promotion and discipline of all
ranks below assistant chief constable. They
are generally answerable to the police
authorities on matters of efficiency, and must
submit an annual report. Police authorities
appoint the chief constable and other top
officers. They also fix the maximum
permitted strength of the force, subject to
approval by the appropriate Secretary of
State, and provide buildings and equipment.
In the Metropolitan Police area the
commissioner of police and his immediate
subordinates are appointed on the
recommendation of the Home Secretary.
A wide-ranging review of the police service
was announced by the Government in May
1992 to consider the roles, responsibilities,
careers, rank structure and pay arrangements
of police officers; it will report to the Home
Secretary by the end of May 1993.
Central Authorities
The Home Secretary and the Secretaries of
State for Scotland and Northern Ireland
approve the appointment of chief, deputy and
assistant chief constables. Where necessary
they can:
• require a police authority to retire a chief
constable in the interests of efficiency;
• call for a report from a chief constable on
matters relating to local policing; and
• institute a local inquiry.
These ministers can also make regulations
covering:
• qualifications for appointment, promotion
and retirement;
• discipline;
• hours of duty, leave, pay and allowances;
and
• uniform.
Some of these regulations are first
negotiable within the Police Negotiating
Board, which consists of an independent
chairman and representatives of the police
authorities, police staff associations and the
home departments.
All police forces (except the Metropolitan
Police) are inspected by inspectors of
constabulary reporting to central government.
92
JUSTICE AND THE LAW
On request, the inspectorate also undertakes
inspections of selected parts of the
Metropolitan Police.
Members of the police service may not
belong to a trade union, nor may they strike
in furtherance of a trade dispute. All ranks,
however, have their own staff associations to
represent their interests.
Co-ordination of Police Operations
Several common services are provided by
central government and by arrangements
between forces. In England and Wales the
most important of these cover
telecommunications and central and
provincial criminal records. In Scotland the
main common services are centralised police
training, the Scottish Crime Squad and the
Scottish Criminal Record Office.
Certain special services such as liaison
with the International Criminal Police
Organisation (Interpol) are provided for other
British forces by the Metropolitan Police.
The National Drugs Intelligence Unit assists
police forces and the Customs service
throughout Britain. A new National Criminal
Intelligence Service has been set up to
co-ordinate and analyse intelligence; it is
bringing together a number of units,
including the National Drugs Intelligence
Unit and the Interpol Bureau.
The services of the Fraud Squad, which is
run jointly by the Metropolitan Police and
City of London Police to investigate company
frauds, are available in England and Wales.
Regional crime squads, co-ordinated at
national level in England and Wales, deal
with serious crimes, such as drug trafficking,
and are used when operations cannot be dealt
with by individual police forces alone.
In all areas of police work the use of
scientific aids is widespread. A national police
computer helps to rationalise records and
speed up the supply of information.
Police Discipline
A police officer may be sued or prosecuted
for any wrongful act committed when
carrying out duties. Police discipline codes
are designed to prevent any abuse of police
powers and to maintain public confidence in
the impartiality of the service.
The independent Police Complaints
Authority has powers to supervise the
investigation of any serious complaint against
a police officer in England and Wales. In
Scotland complaints against police officers
involving allegations of any form of criminal
conduct are investigated by an independent
procurator fiscal service.
In Northern Ireland the Independent
Commission for Police Complaints is
required to supervise the investigation of a
complaint regarding death or serious injury
and has the power to supervise that of any
other complaint if it so wishes. In certain
circumstances, the Secretary of State may
direct the Commission to supervise the
investigation of matters that are not the
subject of a formal complaint.
Community Relations
Virtually all forces have liaison departments
designed to develop closer contact between
the force and the community. Almost all
areas have police/community consultative
groups. Particular efforts are made to develop
relations with young people through greater
contact with schools. School governing bodies
and head teachers are under an obligation to
describe in their annual reports the steps they
take to strengthen their schools’ links with
the community, including the police.
Emphasis is placed on improving relations
with ethnic minorities. The Government
believes that all police officers should receive
a thorough training in community and race
relations. The Home Office sponsors national
courses in these subjects for community
liaison officers and police managers. There is
also a national specialist support unit which
makes a valuable contribution to improving
community and race relations training for the
police. Discriminatory behaviour by police
officers is an offence under the Police
Discipline Code. The Home Office organises
recruitment advertising campaigns in the
press in order to encourage black and Asian
recruits to the police. At the end of February
1992 there were 1,631 ethnic minority police
officers in England and Wales.
93
BRITAIN 1993: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Police Powers
Officers in Great Britain do not normally
carry firearms, although in an emergency
they can be issued quickly on the authority of
a senior officer. In Northern Ireland police
officers are issued with firearms for personal
protection and other firearms are available for
duty purposes.
Under legislation passed in 1985, the
Government can authorise interception of
postal and telephone services by the police in
order to prevent and detect serious crime, or,
in some cases, to protect national security.
The other ground for interception is the
safeguarding of Britain’s economic well-being.
Any interception outside these procedures is
a criminal offence.
A police officer in England and Wales has
a general power of stop and search if he or
she has reasonable grounds for suspicion that
a person is carrying stolen goods, offensive
weapons or implements that could be used
for theft, burglary and other offences. The
officer must, however, state and record the
grounds for taking this action and what, if
anything, was found.
Arrest
In England and Wales the police have wide
powers to arrest suspects with or without a
warrant issued by a magistrate. For serious
offences, known as ‘arrestable offences’, a
suspect can be arrested without a warrant;
this covers all offences for which a maximum
period of five years’ imprisonment can be
imposed on conviction. Arrest without a
warrant also applies to people suspected of
committing ‘serious arrestable offences’ such
as murder, rape and kidnapping. For lesser
offences, arrest without warrant exists only
when certain criteria are met, for instance, if
it is not possible or appropriate to send out a
summons to appear in court.
Detention, Treatment and Questioning
A statutory code of practice issued by the
Government regulates detention, treatment
and questioning of suspects by the police in
England and Wales. Failure to comply with
its provisions can render a police officer liable
to disciplinary proceedings. Evidence
obtained in breach of the code may be ruled
inadmissible in court.
An arrested person has a statutory right to
consult a solicitor and to ask the police to
notify a relative or other named person likely
to take an interest in his or her welfare.
Where a person has been arrested in
connection with a serious arrestable offence,
but has not yet been charged, the police may
delay for up to 36 hours the exercise of these
rights in the interests of the investigation if
certain strict criteria are met.
The police must caution a suspect before
questions are put for the purpose of obtaining
evidence. The caution informs the suspect
that he or she is entitled to refuse to answer
questions—the so-called ‘right to silence .
Questions relating to an offence may not
normally be put to a person after he or she has
been charged with that offence or informed
that he or she may be prosecuted for it.
The length of time a suspect is held in
police custody before charge is strictly
regulated. For lesser offences this may not
exceed 24 hours. A person suspected ot
committing a serious arrestable offence can be
detained for up to 96 hours without charge
but only beyond 36 hours if a warrant is
obtained from a magistrates’ court. Reviews
must be made of a person’s detention at
regular intervals—six hours after initial
detention and thereafter every nine hours as a
maximum—to check whether the criteria for
detention are still satisfied. If they are not,
the person must be released immediately.
The tape recording of interviews with
suspected offenders at police stations has
become standard practice, and a code of
practice governing these tape recordings has
been approved by Parliament.
A person who thinks that the grounds for
detention are unlawful may apply to the High
Court for a writ of habeas corpus against the
person who detained him or her, requiring
that person to appear before the court to
justify the detention. Habeas corpus
proceedings take precedence over others.
Similar procedures apply in Northern Ireland
and a similar remedy is available to anyone
who is unlawfully detained in Scotland.
94
JUSTICE AND THE LAW
Charging
Once there is sufficient evidence for a
charge, the police have to decide whether
to charge the person with the offence. As
an alternative to charging immediately, they
can, for example, decide to defer charging
or to take no further action and release the
person with or without bail. They may also
issue a caution, which is a warning that
prosecution is likely for a second offence.
If charged with an offence, a person may
be kept in custody if there is a risk that he
or she might fail to appear in court or
might interfere with the administration of
justice. A young person may also be
detained for his or her protection. When no
such considerations apply, the person must
be released on or without police bail.
Where someone is detained after charge, he
or she is brought before a magistrates’
court, usually no later than the next
working day.
Scotland
In Scotland the police may detain and
question a suspected person for a period of
up to six hours. After this period the
person must either be released or charged.
Once a person has been charged with a
criminal offence, only voluntary statements
will normally be allowed in evidence at the
trial. The court will reject statements
unless satisfied that they have been fairly
obtained. In many areas interviews with
suspects in police stations are tape
recorded. Anyone arrested must be brought
before a court with the least possible delay
(generally not later than the first day after
being taken into custody), or—in less
serious cases—liberated by the police, often
on a written undertaking to attend court.
Where an accusation of a more serious
offence is to be made, the accused is
brought before the sheriff in private to be
committed, either for further examination
or until liberated in due course of law. A
judicial examination by the procurator fiscal
may take place. A maximum of eight days
may elapse between committal for further
examination and committal for trial.
Awaiting Trial
There are time limits on the period a
defendant may be remanded in custody
awaiting trial in England and Wales. In cases
tried before a magistrates’ court these are 56
days from first appearance to trial or 70 days
between first appearance to committal for
trial (see p 98) in the Crown Court. The
limit in Crown Court cases is 112 days from
committal to taking of the plea. When a time
limit expires, the defendant is entitled to bail.
The court extends the limit if it is satisfied
that there is a good and sufficient reason, and
that the prosecution has acted expeditiously.
Bail
Most accused people are released on bail
while awaiting trial. They are not remanded
in custody except where strictly necessary. In
England and Wales, the court decides
whether a defendant should be released on
bail. Unconditional bail may only be withheld
if the court has substantial grounds for
believing that the accused would:
• abscond;
• commit an offence;
• interfere with witnesses; or
• otherwise obstruct the course of justice.
A court may also impose conditions before
granting bail. If bail is refused, the defendant
may apply to a High Court judge or to the
Crown Court for bail. An application can also
be made to the Crown Court for conditions
imposed by a magistrates’ court to be varied.
In some cases a court may grant bail to a
defendant on condition that he or she lives in
an approved bail or probation/bail hostel.
The probation service has developed bail
information schemes which provide the
Crown Prosecution Service with verified
information about a defendant. This assists
the Service to decide whether to oppose bail
and enables the courts to take an informed
decision on whether to grant bail.
The Government announced new
measures in February 1992 to reduce the
incidence of continued criminal activities by
some offenders while on bail.
95
BRITAIN 1993: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Scotland
Anyone accused of a crime, except murder
or treason, is entitled to apply for release
on bail. Even in cases of murder or treason,
bail may be granted at the discretion of the
Lord Advocate or a quorum of the High
Court. There is a right of appeal to the
High Court by the accused person against
the refusal of bail, or by the prosecutor
against the granting of bail, or by either
party against the conditions imposed.
If a person charged with a more serious
offence has been kept in custody pending
trial, the trial must begin within 110 days
of the date of full committal. The trial of a
person charged with a summary offence
and held in custody must begin within 40
days of the date of first appearance in
court.
CRIMINAL COURTS
Prosecution
England and Wales
Once the police have decided to charge
someone with an offence, the Crown
Prosecution Service (CPS) assumes control
of the case, reviews the evidence and then
decides whether to prosecute. The CPS is
an independent government department
headed by the Director of Public
Prosecutions (DPP). The DPP is
answerable to Parliament through the
Attorney General, who is the Government’s
chief law officer.
The Service is independent of the
police. It is divided into 31 areas, each run
by a locally-based Chief Crown Prosecutor
appointed by the Director. CPS lawyers
prosecute in the magistrates’ courts while
barristers for the Service appear in the
Crown Court.
The CPS operates in accordance with
the Code for Crown Prosecutors, a public
document published annually in the
Director’s report to the Attorney General.
Under the Code, a prosecution should not
be started or continued unless the
Prosecutor is satisfied that there is
admissible, substantial and reliable evidence
that a criminal offence has been committed.
Once the Prosecutor is satisfied that the
evidence can justify proceedings, he or she
must also consider whether the public
interest requires proceedings to take place.
Cases in which a prosecution is considered to
be inappropriate for either of these reasons
are discontinued. Although the decision to
prosecute is generally delegated to the
lawyers in the area offices, some especially
sensitive or complex cases are dealt with by
the headquarters of the CPS, including
terrorist offences and breaches of the Official
Secrets Acts.
Scotland
Discharging his duties through the Crown
Office and Procurator Fiscal Service, the
Lord Advocate is responsible for prosecutions
in the High Court of Judiciary, sheriff courts
and district courts. There is no general right
of private prosecution. The permanent
adviser to the Lord Advocate on prosecution
matters is the Crown Agent, who is head of
the Procurator Fiscal Service and is assisted
in the Crown Office by a staff of legally
qualified civil servants.
Prosecutions in the High Court of
Justiciary are prepared by procurators fiscal
and Crown Office officials. They are
conducted by the Lord Advocate, the
Solicitor General for Scotland (the Lord
Advocate’s ministerial deputy) and advocates
depute, who are collectively known as Crown
Counsel.
Crimes tried before the sheriff and district
courts are prepared and prosecuted by
procurators fiscal. The police and other law
enforcement agencies investigate crimes and
offences and report to the procurator fiscal,
who decides whether to prosecute, subject to
the directions of Crown Counsel.
When dealing with minor crime, the
procurator fiscal can use alternatives to
prosecution, such as formal warnings,
diversion to social work and offers of fixed
penalties. In the latter case, the offender is
not obliged to accept such an offer, but if he
or she does the prosecution loses the right to
prosecute.
96
JUSTICE AND THE LAW
Northern Ireland
The Director of Public Prosecutions for
Northern Ireland prosecutes all offences
tried on indictment, and may do so in other
(summary) cases. Most summary offences
are prosecuted by the police.
Prosecutions for Fraud
The Serious Fraud Office investigates and
prosecutes the most serious and complex
cases of fraud in England, Wales and
Northern Ireland. Investigations are
conducted by teams of lawyers, accountants,
police officers and other specialists. In
Scotland the Crown Office Fraud Unit deals
with fraud.
Courts
England and Wales
Very serious offences such as murder,
manslaughter, rape and robbery are tried on
indictment only by the Crown Court, where
all contested trials are presided over by a
judge sitting with a jury. Summary
offences—the least serious offences and the
vast majority of criminal cases—are tried by
unpaid lay magistrates or by a few paid
stipendiary magistrates; both sit without a
jury.
A third category of offences (such as
theft, burglary or malicious wounding) are
known as ‘either way’ offences. They can be
tried either by magistrates or by jury in the
Crown Court. Where magistrates consider
an ‘either way’ case to be too serious for
them to deal with, they may commit it for
trial in the Crown Court. If magistrates are
content to deal with the case, the accused
has the right to choose trial by magistrates
or trial by jury in the Crown Court.
All those charged with offences to be
tried in the Crown Court must first appear
before a magistrates’ court, which decides
whether to commit them to the Court for
trial.
A magistrates court, which is open to the
public and the media, usually consists of
three lay magistrates—known as justices of
the peace—who are advised on points of law
and procedure by a legally qualified clerk or a
qualified assistant.
There are nearly 28,000 lay magistrates.
The few full-time, legally qualified
stipendiary magistrates may sit alone and
usually preside in courts in urban areas where
the workload is heavy.
Cases involving people under 18 are heard
in youth courts. These are specialist
magistrates’ courts which either sit apart
from other courts or are held at a different
time. Restrictions are placed on access by
ordinary members of the public, and media
reports must not identify a young person
appearing either as a defendant (unless a
judge directs otherwise) or a witness.
Where a young person under 18 is
charged jointly with someone of 18 or over,
the case is heard in an ordinary magistrates’
court or the Crown Court. If the young
person is found guilty, the court may transfer
the case to a youth court for sentence unless
satisfied that it is undesirable to do so.
In February 1992 the Government
published a White Paper on reform of
magistrates’ courts. The aims are to
modernise the organisation of the
courts to achieve consistently high
standards while retaining local
identity. Under the proposals there
would also be an independent
inspectorate with a lay element to
assist in raising performance.
The Crown Court sits at about 90 centres
and is presided over by High Court judges,
full-time ‘Circuit Judges’ and part-time
Recorders.
In cases of serious or complex fraud, full
committal proceedings in magistrates’ courts
may be bypassed at the discretion of the
prosecution. The accused can apply to the
Crown Court to be discharged on the ground
that there is no case to answer.
Scotland
The High Court of Justiciary, which sits in
Edinburgh and other major towns and cities,
tries the most serious crimes and has
97
BRITAIN 1993: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
exclusive jurisdiction in cases involving
murder, treason and rape. The sheriff court is
concerned with less serious offences and the
district court with minor offences.
Criminal cases in Scotland are heard either
under solemn or summary procedure. In
solemn procedure, the trial takes place before
a judge sitting with a jury of 15 people.
Details of the alleged offence are set out in a
document called an indictment. The judge
decides questions of law and the jury
questions of fact. In summary procedure the
judge sits without a jury and decides
questions of fact and law.
All cases in the High Court and the more
serious ones in sheriff courts are tried by a
judge and jury. Summary procedure is used
in the less serious cases in the sheriff courts,
and in all cases in the district courts. District
court judges are lay justices of the peace. In
Glasgow there are also stipendiary magistrates
who are full-time lawyers with the same
criminal jurisdiction in summary procedure as
the sheriff.
Children under 16 who have committed an
offence are normally dealt with by children’s
hearings (see p 107).
Northern Ireland
Cases involving minor summary offences are
heard by magistrates’ courts presided over by
a full-time, legally qualified resident
magistrate. Young offenders under 17 are
dealt with by a juvenile court consisting of
the resident magistrate and two lay members
(at least one of whom must be a woman)
specially qualified to deal with juveniles.
The Crown Court deals with criminal
trials on indictment. It is served by High
Court and county court judges. Proceedings
are heard before a single judge, and all
contested cases, other than those involving
offences specified under emergency
legislation, take place before a jury.
People accused of terrorist-type offences
are tried by a judge sitting alone without a
jury because of the possibility of jurors being
intimidated by terrorist organisations. The
onus remains on the prosecution to prove
guilt beyond reasonable doubt and the
defendant has the right to be represented by a
lawyer of his or her choice. The judge must
set out in a written statement the reasons for
convicting and there is an automatic right of
appeal against conviction and sentence on
points of fact as well as of law.
Trial
Criminal trials in Britain have two parties:
the prosecution and the defence. The law
presumes the innocence of an accused person
until guilt has been proved. An accused
person has the right to employ a legal adviser
and may be granted legal aid from public
funds (see p 113). If remanded in custody, he
or she may be visited by a legal adviser to
ensure a properly prepared defence.
Disclosure to the Defence
It is for the prosecution to prove that the
defendant committed the crime alleged. In
order for the defendant to understand the
nature of the case against him or her, he or
she must be informed of all the relevant
information that the prosecution has, whether
or not it forms part of its case.
In England and Wales, where cases are to
be tried in the Crown Court, the Crown
Prosecution Service must also disclose all the
statements from the prosecution witnesses
upon whom it proposes to rely. This must be
done before any committal proceedings begin.
This duty does not apply to offences tried in
the magistrates’ court, except when advance
information is requested by the defence in
those cases which could be tried either by
magistrates or in the Crown Court.
In Scotland the prosecution must give to
the defence advance notice of the witnesses it
intends to call and of the documents and
other items on which it will rely.
Trial Procedure
Criminal trials are normally in open court
and rules of evidence, which are concerned
with the proof of facts, are rigorously applied.
If evidence is improperly admitted, a
conviction can be quashed on appeal.
During the trial the defendant has the
right to hear and cross-examine witnesses for
98
JUSTICE AND THE LAW
the prosecution. He or she can call his or her
own witnesses who, if they will not attend
voluntarily, may be legally compelled to do
so. The defendant can also address the court
in person or through a lawyer, the defence
having the right to the last speech at the trial
before the judge sums up. The defendant
cannot be questioned without consenting to
be sworn as a witness in his or her own
defence. When he or she does testify, cross-
examination about character or other conduct
may be made only in exceptional
circumstances. Generally the prosecution may
not introduce such evidence. In Northern
Ireland the judge can draw inferences from a
refusal by a defendant to give evidence.
Child Witnesses
In England, Wales and Northern Ireland,
child witnesses in cases involving offences of
sex, violence or cruelty may now give
evidence in Crown Court proceedings from
outside the courtroom by means of a live
television link. In this way the child need not
see his or her alleged attacker in court. A
child’s sworn statement no longer has to be
corroborated by other evidence for the court
to hear it. In Scotland similar provisions apply.
The Criminal Justice Act 1991 extends
live television links to youth court proceed¬
ings, and makes a number of further reforms
to the law of evidence and procedure relating
to child witnesses in England and Wales. The
presumption that young children are not
competent to give evidence in criminal
proceedings is effectively removed, and
video-recorded interviews become admissible
as the main evidence of a child witness.
Fraud Proceedings
In England, Wales and Northern Ireland the
judge in complex fraud cases may order a
preparatory open Crown Court hearing to be
held. This provides an opportunity for the
judge to determine questions regarding
admissibility of evidence and any other
questions of law relating to the case. The
judge also has the power to order the
prosecution and the defence to serve on each
other certain statements and to prepare the
case in such a way that it is easier to
understand. Appeals may be made to the
Court of Appeal from decisions of the judge
in the preparatory hearings. The law on
evidence has been changed to make it
possible for courts to have before them a
wider range of written evidence in the form
of business documents.
The use of information technology
systems to support the investigation and
prosecution of fraud cases is being
improved. Within the Serious Fraud Office,
a case support section has been set up to
determine and meet the information
technology needs of each case. This work
includes forensic computing (for example,
the seizure of computers and securing of
data for use as evidence) as well as the
provision of technology to manage the large
volume of material generated in fraud
investigations. It also covers graphic
techniques for the presentation of complex
evidence in court.
The Jury
In jury trials the judge decides questions of
law, sums up the evidence for the jury, and
discharges the accused or passes sentence. In
England, Wales and Northern Ireland the
jury is responsible for deciding whether a
defendant is ‘guilty’ or ‘not guilty’, the latter
verdict resulting in acquittal. If the jury
cannot reach a unanimous verdict, the judge
may direct it to bring in a majority verdict
provided that in the 12-member jury there
are no more than two dissenters.
In Scotland the jury’s verdict may be
‘guilty’, ‘not guilty’ or ‘not proven’; the
accused is acquitted if either of the last two
verdicts is given. The jury consists of 15
people and a verdict of ‘guilty’ can only be
reached if at least eight members are in
favour. As a general rule no one may be
convicted without corroborated evidence
from at least two sources.
If the jury acquits the defendant, the
prosecution has no right of appeal and the
defendant cannot be tried again for the same
offence. The defendant, however, has a right
of appeal if found guilty.
A jury is independent of the judiciary.
99
BRITAIN 1993: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Any attempt to interfere with a jury once it
is sworn in is a criminal offence. Potential
jurors are put on a panel before the start of
the trial. In England and Wales the
prosecution and the defence may challenge
individual jurors on the panel, giving
reasons for doing so. In Scotland the
prosecution or defence may challenge up to
three jurors without reason. In Northern
Ireland each defendant has the right to
challenge up to 12 potential jurors without
giving reason.
People between the ages of 18 and 65 (70
in England, Wales and Northern Ireland)
whose names appear on the electoral
register, with certain exceptions, are liable
for jury service and their names are chosen
at random. Ineligible people include, for
example, judges and people who have within
the previous ten years been members of the
legal profession or the police, prison or
probation services. People convicted of
certain offences within the previous ten
years cannot serve on a jury. Anyone who
has received a prison sentence of five years
or more is disqualified for life.
Sentencing
If a person is convicted, the magistrate or
judge (or their Scottish equivalents) decides
on the most appropriate sentence. Account
is taken of the facts of the offence, the
circumstances of the offender and any
previous convictions or sentences.
For serious offenders, a social enquiry
report providing fuller information is given
to the court by a probation officer (or social
worker in Scotland). This gives details about
the character, personality, social and
domestic background of the offender, his or
her education and employment record, and
comments on possible sentences. Under the
Criminal Justice Act 1991, courts must
obtain and consider a ‘pre-sentence’ report
before imposing a custodial sentence or
certain community sentences. Similar to the
social enquiry report, a pre-sentence report
should focus more sharply on the type of
sentence envisaged.
The defence lawyer may make a speech
in mitigation on behalf of the offender.
Appeals
England and Wales
A person convicted by a magistrates’ court
may appeal to the Crown Court against the
sentence imposed if he or she has pleaded
guilty. An appeal may be made against both
conviction and sentence if a ‘not guilty’ plea
has been made. The Divisional Court of the
Queen’s Bench Division of the High Court
hears appeals on points of law and
procedure—by either prosecution or
defence—in cases originally dealt with by
magistrates. If convicted by the Crown
Court, a defendant can appeal to the Court of
Appeal (Criminal Division) against both the
conviction and the sentence imposed. The
House of Lords is the final appeal court, but
it will only consider cases that involve a point
of law of general public importance and
where leave to appeal is granted.
The Attorney General may seek the
opinion of the Court of Appeal on a point of
law arising from a case where a person tried
on indictment is acquitted. The Court has
power to refer the point to the House of
Lords if necessary. The acquittal in the
original case is not affected.
The Attorney General may also refer a
case to the Court of Appeal if he considers
that a sentence passed by the Crown Court is
too lenient. This applies to a case triable only
on indictment in the Crown Court. If the
Court of Appeal agrees, it may increase the
sentence within the statutory maximum laid
down by Parliament for the offence.
The Home Secretary may consider
representations and intervene in cases where
appeal rights have been exhausted and fresh
evidence has emerged.
Scotland
All appeal cases are dealt with by the High
Court of Justiciary and are heard by at least
three judges. In both solemn and summary
procedure, the accused may appeal against
conviction, or sentence, or both. The Court
may authorise a retrial if it sets aside a
conviction. There is no further appeal to the
House of Lords. In summary proceedings the
100
JUSTICE AND THE LAW
prosecutor may appeal on a point of law
against acquittal or sentence. The Lord
Advocate may seek the opinion of the High
Court on a point of law which has arisen where
a person tried on indictment is acquitted. The
acquittal in the original case is not affected.
Northern Ireland
In Northern Ireland, appeals from magistrates’
courts against conviction or sentence are
heard by the county court. An appeal on a
point of law alone can be heard by the
Northern Ireland Court of Appeal, which also
hears appeals from the Crown Court against
conviction or sentence. Procedures for a
further appeal to the House of Lords are
similar to those in England and Wales.
Coroners’ Courts
Coroners in England and Wales investigate
violent and unnatural deaths or sudden
deaths where the cause is unknown. An
inquest is, however, not necessary if a sudden
death was due to natural causes. The coroner
must hold an inquest if the deceased died a
violent or unnatural death or died in prison
or in other specified circumstances. (In
Northern Ireland the coroner investigates the
matter to decide whether an inquest is
necessary). It is the duty of the coroner’s
court to establish how, when and where the
deceased died. A coroner may sit alone or, in
certain circumstances, with a jury.
In Scotland the local procurator fiscal
inquires privately into all sudden and
suspicious deaths and may report the findings
to the Crown Office. In a minority of cases a
fatal accident inquiry may be held before the
sheriff; this is mandatory in cases of death
resulting from industrial accidents and of
deaths in custody.
TREATMENT OF OFFENDERS
The Government’s aim is to ensure that
convicted criminals are punished justly and
suitably according to the seriousness of their
offences. It believes that those who commit
very serious crimes, particularly crimes of
violence, should receive long custodial
sentences, but that many other crimes can
best be punished within the community
through compensation and reparation.
Legislation sets the maximum penalties for
offences, the sentence being entirely a matter
for the courts, subject to these maxima. The
Court of Appeal issues guidance to the lower
courts on sentencing issues when points of
principle have arisen on individual cases
which are the subject of appeal.
In Scotland, where many offences are not
created by statute, the penalty for offences at
common law range from absolute discharge to
life imprisonment.
Custody
England and Wales
The Government believes that custody
should be used only for offenders convicted
of serious criminal offences or where the
public needs to be protected from serious
harm from a violent or sexual offender. The
Court of Appeal has stated that sentencers
should ensure that terms of custody are as
short as is consistent with the courts’ duty to
protect the public and to punish the criminal.
The Criminal Justice Act 1991 requires
a court in England and Wales, before
giving a custodial sentence, to be
satisfied that the offence is serious
enough to merit custody. The court
also has to give reasons if it considers
a custodial sentence to be necessary.
Longer custodial sentences—within the
statutory maxima—are available for
persistent violent and sexual offenders
in order to protect the public from
serious harm.
A magistrates’ court in England and Wales
cannot impose a term of more than six
months’ imprisonment for an individual
offence tried summarily. It can impose
consecutive sentences for ‘either way’
offences (see p 97), subject to an overall
maximum of 12 months’ imprisonment. If an
offence carries a higher maximum penalty,
the court may commit the offender for
sentence at the Crown Court. The Crown
101
BRITAIN 1993: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Court may impose a custodial sentence for any
term up to life, depending on the gravity of
the crime and the maximum penalty available.
For an offence incurring a prison sentence
of not more than two years, a court may
decide that the operation of that sentence
should be fully suspended. A sentence within
this range may be suspended for an
‘operational period’ of at least one year and
not more than two years. The suspended
prison term is not served unless the offender
commits another imprisonable offence during
the period of suspension. The suspended
sentence is then normally served in addition
to any punishment imposed for the second
offence. The court may also order
supervision of the offender by a probation
officer if the suspended sentence is more than
six months.
There is a mandatory sentence of life
imprisonment for murder throughout Britain.
Life imprisonment is also the maximum
penalty for a number of serious offences such
as robbery, rape, arson and manslaughter.
Scotland and Northern Ireland
In trials on indictment in Scotland the High
Court of Justiciary may impose a sentence of
imprisonment for any term up to life, and the
sheriff court any term up to three years. The
latter may send any person to the High Court
for sentence if the court considers its powers
are insufficient. In summary cases, the sheriff
or stipendiary magistrate may normally
impose up to three months’ imprisonment or
six months’ for some repeated offences. The
district court can impose a maximum term of
imprisonment of 60 days.
In Northern Ireland the position is
generally the same as for England and Wales.
A magistrates’ court, however, cannot commit
an offender for sentencing at the Crown
Court if it has tried the case.
The Death Penalty
The death penalty remains on the statute
book for the offences of treason, piracy with
violence and some other treasonable and
mutinous offences. It has, however, not been
used for any of these offences since 1946.
Non-custodial Treatment
The Government believes that more
offenders, particularly those convicted of
property crimes and less serious cases of
violence, should be punished in the
community. In its view this should involve
fines levied on the offender, compensation to
the victim, probation, community service, a
new combined order linking probation and
community service, or a new curfew order to
be used by itself or with other orders.
Fines
About 80 per cent of offenders are punished
with a fine. There is no limit to the fine,
unless set by statute, which the Crown Court
(and High Court of Justiciary in Scotland)
may impose on indictment. The Criminal
Justice Act 1991 provides for an increase in
the maximum fine usually available on
summary conviction from £2,000 to £5,000
in England and Wales.
From October 1992 a unit fine system in
magistrates’ courts in England and Wales is
being introduced, enabling fines to be more
closely related to ability to pay. The court’s
sentence is given in units reflecting the
seriousness of the offence, and the value of
each unit settled according to the offender’s
disposable weekly income. Courts are
empowered to require offenders to supply
statements about their income.
Probation
The locally organised probation service in
England and Wales supervises offenders in
the community under direct court orders and
after release from custody. It also provides
offenders in custody with help and advice.
A probation order, which can last between
six months and three years, can only be made
by a court with the consent of the offender,
who may be sentenced for the original offence
if he or she fails to comply with the order or
commits another offence while on probation.
A probation order requires the offender to
maintain regular contact with the probation
officer. Special conditions attached to the
order may require the offender to attend a
102
JUSTICE AND THE LAW
day centre for up to 60 days. Although
intended as a punishment, the time spent by
offenders under supervision in the
community offers an opportunity for
constructive work to reduce the likelihood of
reoffending. The flexibility of the probation
order means that probation is suitable for
those convicted of offences of differing
degrees of seriousness.
In England and Wales the probation
service also administers supervision orders,
the community service scheme and supervises
those released from prison on parole.
The Criminal Justice Act 1991 makes a
probation order a sentence of the court,
which may be used in combination with a
community service order or a fine for a single
offence. Her Majesty’s Inspectorate of
Probation is being put on a statutory basis
under the same legislation. It will monitor the
work of the voluntary and private sectors
with the probation service in addition to its
inspection and advisory duties. National
objectives and standards are to be introduced
for a wide range of probation work.
In Scotland the supervision of offenders
on probation, supervision order or parole is
the responsibility of local authority social
work services.
In Northern Ireland the service is
administered by a government-funded
probation board, whose membership is
representative of the community.
Community Service
Offenders aged 16 or over (17 in Northern
Ireland) convicted of imprisonable offences
may, with their consent, be given community
service orders. The court may order between
40 and 240 hours’ unpaid service to be
completed within 12 months. Examples of
work done include decorating the houses of
elderly or disabled people and building
adventure playgrounds.
National standards for community service
orders were introduced in 1989 to ensure that
all orders meet a common set of minimum
requirements.
The Criminal Justice Act 1991 provides
for a new court order in England and Wales,
combining community service and probation.
The maximum term for the probation
element is the same as a probation order and
the maximum period of community service is
100 hours.
Curfew Order
The Criminal Justice Act 1991 empowers
courts in England and Wales to issue a
curfew order confining offenders to their
homes at certain times to prevent them going
to places which may be associated with their
offending. It may also be combined with
probation, community service or the new
combination orders. The enforcement of
curfew orders may be assisted by the
inclusion of a requirement for the electronic
monitoring of the offender’s whereabouts.
Compensation and Reparation
The courts may order an offender to pay
compensation for personal injury, loss or
damage resulting from an offence. In England
and Wales courts are required to give reasons
for not awarding compensation to a victim.
Compensation takes precedence over fines.
Courts may order the confiscation of
proceeds gained by a criminal from drug
trafficking and other offences such as
robbery, fraud, blackmail and insider dealing
in shares.
Other Measures
A court in England and Wales may discharge
a person if it believes that punishment should
not be inflicted and a probation order is not
appropriate. If he or she is conditionally
discharged, the offender remains liable to
punishment for the offence if convicted of
another offence within a period specified by
the court (not more than three years).
The Crown Court may ‘bind over’ an
offender by requiring him or her to keep the
peace and/or be of good behaviour. If this
requirement is not complied with, the
offender may be brought before the court and
dealt with for the original offence. Alterna¬
tively, a sum of money may be forfeited if
conditions stated by the court are not met.
In Scotland there is a system of deferral of
103
BRITAIN 1993: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
sentence until a future date. During this
period the accused is required to be of good
behaviour and to meet any other conditions
stipulated by the court. The court may also
warn the offender or grant an absolute
discharge.
Police cautions are used particularly for
young offenders; the caution is a form of
warning and no court action is taken.
Prisons
The Prison Service in England and Wales is
managed directly by the Home Office.
Scotland and Northern Ireland have separate
prison services run by the Scottish and
Northern Ireland Offices. The Prison Service
in England and Wales and the Scottish
Prison Service will become Executive
Agencies from 1 April 1993.
The average inmate population in 1990-91
was 45,185 in England and Wales and 1,755
in Northern Ireland. The figure in 1991 for
Scotland was 4,839.
Prisoners may be housed in accommoda¬
tion ranging from open prisons to high
security establishments. In Great Britain
sentenced prisoners are classified into groups
for security purposes. There are separate
prisons for women. There are no open
prisons in Northern Ireland, where the
majority of offenders are serving sentences
for terrorist offences. People awaiting trial in
custody are entitled to privileges not granted
to convicted prisoners. Those under 21 are,
where possible, separated from convicted
prisoners.
Many prisons in Great Britain were built
in the nineteenth century and require major
repairs to bring them up to modern
standards. In order to ensure that all
prisoners are housed in decent conditions, a
major programme of improvement is in
progress which, in England and Wales for
example, will eliminate cells without access to
integral sanitation. Overcrowding is being
relieved by a prison building programme.
In Northern Ireland there is no
overcrowding in the four prisons and a young
offenders’ centre. Four of these
establishments have been built since 1972. The
incorporation of integral sanitation and other
major improvements to the prison estate are
underway in Scotland where, with some
exceptions, overcrowding is not a problem.
White Paper on the Prison Service in England
and Wales
Building on the recommendations of the
Woolf Report on the 1990 prison
disturbances, a White Paper, published in
September 1991, set out a programme of
reforms for the prison service in England and
Wales, focusing on the main areas of custody,
care and justice.
The White Paper confirmed the
Government’s acceptance of the central
propositions in the Woolf Report that
security and control must be kept in balance
with justice and humanity and that each must
be set at the right level. The aim, reflected in
the priority programme set out in the White
Paper, is to provide a better prison system,
with more effective measures for security and
control, more constructive relationships
between prisoners and staff, and more
stimulating programmes for prisoners.
The Government is seeking to foster
greater private sector involvement in the
prison system of England and Wales. Under
the Criminal Justice Act 1991 the Home
Secretary is empowered to contract out the
management of prisons and to allow escort
and guarding functions to be carried out by
the private sector. From April 1992 a new
remand centre, the Wolds in Humberside,
came into use under private management.
Tenders have been invited for the
management of Blakenhurst local prison, in
Worcestershire, which is due to open early in
1993.
A Home Office controller works in each
private prison and is responsible for
monitoring performance, investigating
allegations against custodial staff and
adjudicating on disciplinary matters.
Early Release of Prisoners
The Criminal Justice Act 1991 has reformed
the remission and parole systems in England
and Wales, introducing new arrangements
from October 1992 for the early release of
104
JUSTICE AND THE LAW
prisoners and for their supervision and
liabilities after release. The Parole Board
continues to advise the Home Secretary on
the early release or recall of long-term
prisoners.
Prisoners serving terms of less than four
years may be released once they have served
half of their sentences in custody. Long-term
prisoners (those serving more than four years)
may be released once they have served two-
thirds of their sentence, although the
legislation provides for the discretionary
release on licence by the Home Secretary, on
the recommendation of the Parole Board, of
long-term prisoners once they have served
one-half of their sentence. All prisoners
sentenced to a year or more may be
supervised on release until three-quarters of
their sentence has passed. Certain sex
offenders may be supervised to the end of
their sentence.
If convicted of another offence punishable
with imprisonment and committed before the
end of the original sentence, a released
prisoner may be liable to serve all or part of
the original sentence outstanding at the time
the fresh offence was committed.
Similar changes are being made in
Scotland.
Northern Ireland
In Northern Ireland prisoners serving a
sentence of more than five days are eligible
for remission of half their sentence. A
prisoner serving a sentence of more than 12
months who is given remission is liable to be
ordered to serve the remainder of this
sentence if convicted of fresh imprisonable
offences during this period.
The rate of remission for those convicted
of terrorist offences and serving sentences of
five years or more is one-third. Any released
prisoners convicted of another terrorist
offence before the expiry of the original
sentence must complete that sentence before
serving any term for the second offence.
Life Sentence Prisoners
Under the Criminal Justice Act 1991, new
procedures operate in England and Wales for
the release of life sentence prisoners
convicted for offences other than murder.
The Home Secretary is required to release
such prisoners after an initial period set by
the trial judge if so directed by the Parole
Board, which has to be satisfied that the
protection of the public does not require
their further confinement. These new
provisions conform with the requirements of
the European Convention on Human Rights.
Similar procedures are being introduced in
Scotland.
People serving life sentences for the
murder of police and prison officers, terrorist
murders, murder by firearms in the course of
robbery and the sexual or sadistic murder of
children are normally detained for at least 20
years.
The release on licence of prisoners serving
mandatory life sentences for murder may
only be authorised by the Home Secretary on
the recommendation of the Parole Board. A
similar policy applies in Scotland. On release,
life sentence prisoners remain on licence for
the rest of their lives and are subject to recall
should their behaviour suggest that they
might again be a danger to the public.
In Northern Ireland the Secretary of State
reviews life sentence cases on the
recommendation of an internal review body.
Repatriation
Sentenced prisoners who are nationals of
countries which have ratified the Council of
Europe Convention on the Transfer of
Sentenced Persons or similar international
arrangements may apply to be returned to
their own country to serve the rest of their
sentence there.
Independent Oversight of the Prison System
Every prison establishment has a Board of
Visitors—a Visiting Committee in Scotland—
drawn from the local community, which acts
as a watchdog for the Secretary of State.
These bodies oversee prison administration
and the treatment of prisoners. In order to
see that prisoners are being treated fairly,
members may go to any part of the prison
and interview any inmate at any time. Except
105
BRITAIN 1993: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
in Scotland, these bodies also adjudicate on
prisoners who have committed the more
serious offences against prison discipline.
The White Paper recommended that
Boards of Visitors should relinquish their
adjudicatory role, allowing them to
strengthen their role as watch-dogs.
The independent Prisons Inspectorates
report to the respective Secretaries of State
on the treatment of prisoners and prison
conditions. Each establishment is visited
about every two years.
Prison Industries, Education and Physical
Education
Prison industries aim to give inmates work
experience which will assist them when
released and secures a return which will
reduce the cost of the prison system. The
main industries are clothing and textile
manufacture, engineering, woodwork,
laundering, farming and horticulture. In
England and Wales most production caters
for internal needs and for other public
services, whereas in Scotland a greater
proportion is sold to the private sector.
A few prisoners are employed outside
prison, some in community service projects.
Inmates are paid at pocket money rates; in
some prisons incentive payment schemes
provide an opportunity for higher earnings.
Education is financed by the prison service
and staffed by local education authorities. Full¬
time education of 15 hours a week is
compulsory for young offenders below school
leaving age. For older offenders it is
voluntary. Some prisoners study for public
examinations, including those of the Open
University.
The Prison Service in England and Wales
is placing increasing emphasis on the
development and implementation of National
Vocational Qualifications (see p 164) for
inmates. Similar moves are underway in
Scotland.
All new prisons have purpose-built
education units, and schemes to build new
education accommodation or to refurbish or
extend existing facilities are also underway or
planned at many other establishments.
Physical education is voluntary for adult
offenders but compulsory for young
offenders. Practically all prisons have physical
education facilities, some of which are purpose
built. Opportunities are given for inmates to
obtain proficiency awards issued by governing
bodies of sport. Inmates also compete against
teams in the local community.
Medical and Psychiatric Care
The Health Care Service for Prisoners in
England and Wales is responsible for the
physical and mental health of all those in
custody. It was launched in April 1992
following a scrutiny of the prison medical
service which proposed greater emphasis on
health promotion. The Service stresses the
prevention of illness, as well as diagnosis and
treatment; it is looking at physical and mental
health, treatment and cure, training and
education, and prison conditions.
A review of services for mentally
disordered offenders is being undertaken
jointly by the Department of Health and the
Home Office; this has already resulted in the
provision of another 400 medium-secure
psychiatric beds. A Health Advisory
Committee provides independent medical
advice on prisoners to government ministers,
the Prison Service Director General and the
Director of Health Care.
Privileges and Discipline
Prisoners may write and receive letters and
be visited by relatives and friends, and those
in some establishments may make telephone
calls. Privileges include a personal radio,
books, periodicals and newspapers, and the
opportunity to make purchases from the
canteen with money earned in prison.
Depending on facilities, they may also dine
together and watch television.
Breaches of discipline are dealt with by
the prison governor or, except in Scotland,
by the board of visitors. The Government is
proposing that prison governors should in
future conduct all disciplinary cases within
their current powers and that there should be
an appeal system to an independent body
against decisions arising from the disciplinary
and complaints procedures.
106
JUSTICE AND THE LAW
Welfare
Prison officers deal with welfare matters and
are supported in this by probation staff (in
Scotland, social workers), who use their own
professional skills to help individual
prisoners understand more about the nature
of their offending behaviour.
Religion and Spiritual Care
Anglican, Church of Scotland, Roman
Catholic and Methodist chaplains provide
opportunities for worship and spiritual
counselling. They are supported by visiting
ministers of other denominations and faiths.
In a multi-faith and multicultural society
particular attention is given to the needs of
those of non-Christian faiths and ethnic
minorities.
Preparation for Release
The Prison Service has a duty to prepare
prisoners for release. Sentence planning is
being extended progressively to all prisoners
serving substantial sentences, in conjunction
with extended arrangements for aftercare
(see below). Many medium- and long-term
prisoners in the later parts of their sentences
may be granted home leave for short
periods, in order to give the prisoner the
opportunity to re-establish links with family
and friends, and, wrhere leave is taken near
the end of the sentence, to contact
prospective employers and make firm plans
for release.
The Pre-Release Employment Scheme
allows selected long-term prisoners to spend
their last six months before release in
certain hostels attached to prisons, to help
them re-adapt to society. Hostellers work in
the outside community and return to the
hostel each evening. Frequent weekend leave
allows hostellers to renew ties with their
families.
In Northern Ireland prisoners serving
fixed sentences may have short periods of
leave near the end of their sentences and at
Christmas. Life-sentence prisoners are given
a nine-month pre-release programme which
includes employment outside the prison.
Aftercare
Professional social work support is given to
offenders following their release. Most young
offenders under the age of 22, adult offenders
released early and those released on licence
from a life sentence receive a period of
compulsory supervision from the probation
service.
Young Offenders
England and Wales
In England and Wales criminal proceedings
cannot be brought against children below the
age of 10 years. Arrangements for dealing
with young offenders above that age in
England and Wales have been amended by
the Criminal Justice Act 1991.
From October 1992, 17-year-old offenders
fall within the jurisdiction of youth courts
(previously juvenile courts). Treated as a
coherent group by the Act, 16- and 17-year-
olds may be given probation orders, curfew
orders and community service orders up to
the maximum for older offenders, or
supervision orders or other community
sentences (see below) as are available for
younger offenders.
Under a supervision order (which may
remain in force for not more than three
years) a child or young person normally lives
at home under the supervision of a social
worker or a probation officer. The order can
be used to provide for a programme of
constructive and remedial activities by means
of a short residential course or, more usually,
attendance at a day or evening centre.
Anyone under 21 years of age who is
found guilty of an offence for which an adult
may be imprisoned can be ordered to attend
at an attendance centre for a number of
hours. An attendance centre order may also
be made where the offender has not
complied with another order (for example
default in paying a fine or breach of a
probation order).
The maximum total number of hours of
attendance is 36 (or 24 if the offender is aged
under 16) and the minimum is 12 hours. The
order is served by attending the centre on
107
BRITAIN 1993: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
several different occasions, the longest period
of attendance in any one day being three
hours. The aim of the order is to encourage
offenders, while in a disciplined environment,
to make more constructive use of their leisure
time.
The criteria for imposing a custodial
sentence on a young offender are that:
• only a custodial sentence will adequately
protect the public from serious harm
from the offender; or
• the offence is so serious that a non¬
custodial sentence cannot be justified.
Young people aged between 15 and 17
may be sent to a young offender institution.
In the case of a very serious crime, detention
in a place approved by the Home Secretary
may be ordered, and must be ordered in the
case of murder.
The custodial sentence for those aged
between 18 and 20 years is also detention in a
young offender institution. Alternatives
include fines and compensation, attendance
centre orders (for up to 36 hours) and
community service orders (for between 40
and 240 hours).
The 1991 Act strengthens the courts’ duty
and powers to involve the parents of young
offenders when their cases are heard. If the
offender is under 16:
• the parents must attend the hearing
unless there are exceptional
circumstances;
• the court has to consider whether the
parents should be bound over to exercise
proper control of the child; and
• the court has to take account of the
parents’ means when assessing the level
of fine to be imposed on the offender.
In the case of 16- and 17-year-old
offenders, the court’s duty to involve parents
is replaced by a power. Where local
authorities have assumed parental
responsibility the duty to attend court and
pay any fines also applies.
The new legislation makes provision for
the courts to remand juveniles, who need to
be held in secure conditions while awaiting
trial or sentence, to local authority secure
accommodation instead of adult prisons.
Scotland
Children under 16 who have committed an
offence or are considered to be in need of
care and protection may be brought before a
children’s panel which consists of three lay
people. This children’s hearing determines in
an informal setting whether compulsory
measures of care are required and, if so, the
form they should take. An official ‘reporter’
decides whether a child should come before a
hearing. If the grounds for referral are not
accepted by the child or parent, the case goes
to the sheriff for proof. If he finds the
grounds established, the sheriff remits the
case to the reporter to arrange a hearing. The
sheriff also decides appeals against any
decision of a children’s hearing.
Custody is available to the courts for
young people aged between 16 and 21; as in
England and Wales, they serve their
sentences in an institution for young
offenders. Remission of part of the sentence
for good behaviour, release on parole and
supervision on release are available.
Northern Ireland
Those aged between 10 and 16 who are
charged with a criminal offence will normally
be brought before a juvenile court. If found
guilty of an offence punishable in the case of
an adult by imprisonment, the court may
order the child or young person to be placed
in care, under supervision or on probation.
The offender may also be required to attend
a day attendance centre, be sent to a training
school or committed to custody in a remand
home. Non-custodial options are the same as
in England and Wales.
Offenders aged between 16 and 21 who
receive custodial sentences of less than three
years serve them in a young offenders’ centre.
Civil Justice
The Civil Law
The civil law of England, Wales and
Northern Ireland covers business related to
the family, property, contracts and torts
108
JUSTICE AND THE LAW
(non-contractual wrongful acts suffered by
one person at the hands of another). It also
includes constitutional, administrative,
industrial, maritime and ecclesiastical law.
Scottish civil law has its own, broadly similar,
branches.
CIVIL COURTS
England and Wales
The limited civil jurisdiction of magistrates’
courts extends to matrimonial proceedings for
maintenance orders, adoption orders,
guardianship orders and family protection
orders. Family proceedings courts, which are
part of the magistrates’ courts, consider
childcare cases. The courts also have
jurisdiction regarding public health and the
recovery of local taxes.
The jurisdiction of the 270 county courts
covers:
• actions founded upon contract and tort;
• trust and mortgage cases;
• action for the recovery of land;
• cases involving disputes between
landlords and tenants;
• complaints about race and sex
discrimination;
• admiralty cases (maritime questions and
offences) and patent cases; and
• divorce cases.
Specialised work is concentrated in certain
designated courts. In some types of cases, for
example admiralty cases, a county court is
restricted to an upper financial limit. There
are special arbitration facilities and simplified
procedures for small claims not exceeding
£1,000.
The High Court, which is divided into
three divisions, deals with the more
complicated civil cases. Its jurisdiction covers
mainly civil and some criminal cases; it also
deals with appeals from tribunals and from
magistrates’ courts in both civil and criminal
matters. The Family Division is concerned
with jurisdiction affecting the family,
including that relating to wardship, adoption
and guardianship. The Chancery Division
deals with the interpretation of wills and the
administration of estates. The Queen’s Bench
Division deals with contract and tort cases.
Maritime law and commercial law are the
responsibility of admiralty and commercial
courts of the Queen’s Bench Division.
In the event of overlapping jurisdiction
between the High Court and the county
courts, cases of exceptional importance,
complexity or financial substance are reserved
for trial in the High Court.
Appeals
Appeals in matrimonial, adoption and
guardianship proceedings heard by magis¬
trates’ courts go to the Family Division of
the High Court. Since October 1991 appeals
on child care cases have also been dealt with
by the High Court. Appeals from the High
Court and county courts are heard in the
Court of Appeal (Civil Division), and may go
on to the House of Lords, the final national
court of appeal in civil and criminal cases.
The judges in the House of Lords usually
sit as a group of five. Lay peers do not
attend the hearings of appeals, which
normally take place in a committee room, but
peers who hold or have held high judicial
office may also sit. The president of the
House in its judicial capacity is the Lord
Chancellor.
Scotland
The civil courts in Scotland are the Court of
Session and the sheriff court, which have the
same jurisdiction over most civil litigation.
The Court of Session, however, does not
consider cases with a value of less than
£1,500; these are dealt with by the sheriff
court. Appeals from the sheriff may be made
to the sheriff principal or directly to the
Court of Session in ordinary actions.
In summary actions (generally cases where
the value of the claim is between £750 and
£1,500) the case may be appealed to the
sheriff principal on a point of law and to the
Court of Session thereafter only if the sheriff
principal certifies the case as suitable for such
an appeal. In small claims (cases where the
value of the claim does not exceed £750)
109
BRITAIN 1993: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
there may be an appeal to the sheriff
principal on a point of law.
The Court of Session sits in Edinburgh,
and in general has jurisdiction to deal with all
kinds of action. It is divided into the Outer
House, a court of first instance; and the
Inner House, mainly an appeal court. Appeals
to the Inner House may be made from the
Outer House and from the sheriff court.
From the Inner House an appeal may go to
the House of Lords.
The Scottish Land Court deals exclusively
with matters concerning agriculture. Its
chairman has the status and tenure of a judge
of the Court of Session and its other
members are lay specialists.
Northern Ireland
Civil cases up to a limited and specified
monetary value are dealt with in county
courts, although magistrates’ courts also deal
with certain limited classes of civil case. The
superior civil law court is the High Court of
Justice, from which an appeal may be made
to the Court of Appeal. The House of Lords
is the final civil appeal court.
Civil Proceedings
England and Wales
In England and Wales civil proceedings are
started by the aggrieved person. Actions in
the High Court are usually begun by a writ
served on the defendant by the plaintiff,
stating the nature of the claim. Before the
case is set down for trial in the High Court,
documents (pleadings) setting out the scope
of the dispute are filed with the court; the
pleadings are also served on the parties.
County court proceedings are initiated by a
summons usually served on the defendant by
the court. Child care cases are initiated by an
application.
The High Court and the county courts
have power in most cases to order pre-trial
exchange of witness statements. Courts may
impose penalties in costs on parties who
unreasonably refuse to admit facts or disclose
documents before trial.
Civil proceedings, as a private matter, can
usually be abandoned or ended by settlement
between the parties at any time. Actions
brought to court are usually tried without a
jury, except in libel, false imprisonment or
malicious prosecution cases or where fraud is
alleged, when either party may apply for trial
by jury. The jury decides questions of fact
and determines damages to be paid to the
injured party; majority verdicts may be
accepted. The Court of Appeal is able to
increase or reduce damages awarded by a jury
if it considers them inadequate or excessive.
A decree of divorce must be pronounced
in open court, but a procedure for most un¬
defended cases dispenses with the need to give
evidence in court and permits written evidence
to be considered by the district judge.
In civil cases heard by a magistrates’ court,
the court issues a summons to the defendant
setting out details of the complaint and the
date on which it will be heard. Parties and
witnesses give their evidence at the court
hearing. Domestic proceedings are normally
heard by not more than three lay justices,
including, where practicable, a woman.
Members of the public are not allowed to be
present. The court may order provision for
custody, access and supervision of children,
as well as maintenance payments lor spouses
and children.
The law has been changed recently to
speed up civil proceedings in magistrates'
courts by allowing written statements, expert
opinions and hearsay evidence to be accepted
in court without the presence of the witness
unless the evidence is disputed and the
disputing party requests the presence of the
witness.
Most judgments are for sums of money
and may be enforced, in cases of non¬
payment, by seizure of the debtor’s goods or
by a court order requiring an employer to
make periodic payments to the court by
deduction from the debtor’s wages. Other
court remedies may include an injunction
restraining someone from performing an
unlawful act. Refusal to obey a court order
may result in imprisonment for contempt.
Normally the court orders the costs of
an action to be paid by the party losing it,
but, in the case of family law maintenance
proceedings, a magistrates’ court can order
110
JUSTICE AND THE LAW
either party to pay the whole or part of the
other’s costs.
Scotland
In Scotland proceedings in the Court of
Session or actions in the sheriff court are
initiated by serving the defender with a
summons (an initial writ in the sheriff court).
A defender who intends to contest the action
must inform the court; if he or she fails to do
so, the court normally grants a decree in
absence in favour of the pursuer. Where a
case is contested, both parties must prepare
written pleadings. Time is allowed for either
party to adjust their pleadings in the light of
what the other has said. At the end of this
period a court hearing will normally be
arranged.
In summary cases (involving sums between
£750 and £1,500) in the sheriff court a
statement of claim is incorporated in the
summons. The procedure is designed to
enable most actions to be carried through
without the parties involved having to
appear in court. Normally they (or their
representatives) need appear only when an
action is defended.
Northern Ireland
There are a number of differences between
proceedings in Northern Ireland and those in
England and Wales, for example, procedures
regarding divorce or pre-trial disclosure.
Restrictive Practices Court
The Restrictive Practices Court is a
specialised United Kingdom court dealing
with monopolies and restrictive trade
practices. It comprises five judges and up to
ten other people with expertise in industry,
commerce or public life.
Tribunals
Tribunals exercise judicial functions separate
from the courts and tend to be more
accessible, less formal and less expensive.
They are normally set up under statutory
powers which also govern their constitution,
functions and procedure. Tribunals often
consist of lay people, but they are generally
chaired by someone legally qualified.
Some tribunals decide disputes between
private citizens. Industrial tribunals, for
example, have a major role in employment
disputes. Others, such as those concerned
with social security, resolve claims by private
citizens against public authorities. A further
group (including tax tribunals) decide
disputed claims by public authorities against
private citizens, while others decide cases
concerning immigration into Britain.
Tribunals usually consist of an uneven
number of people so that a majority decision
can be reached.
In the case of some tribunals a two-tier
system operates, with an initial right of
appeal to a lower tribunal and a further right
of appeal, usually on a point of law, to a
higher one and thence to the Court of
Appeal. Appeals from single tier tribunals can
be made on a point of law only to the High
Court in England and Wales, to the Court of
Session in Scotland, and to the Court of
Appeal in Northern Ireland. There are a few
exceptions including, for example,
immigration appeals, where there is no right
of appeal directly from the Immigration
Appeals Tribunal to the courts.
The independent Council on Tribunals
exercises general supervision over many
tribunals, advising on draft legislation and
rules of procedure, monitoring their activities
and reporting on particular matters. A
Scottish Committee of the Council exercises
the same function in Scotland.
Administration of the Law
GOVERNMENT RESPONSIBILITIES
Administration of justice rests with the Lord
Chancellor, the Home Secretary, the
Attorney General and the Secretaries of State
for Scotland and Northern Ireland. The
highest judicial appointments are made by the
Queen on the advice of the Prime Minister.
The judiciary is independent, its
adjudications not being subject to ministerial
direction or control.
Ill
BRITAIN 1993: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
England and Wales
The Lord Chancellor is the head of the
judiciary. He is concerned with court
procedure and is responsible for the
administration of all courts other than
coroners’ courts, and for a number of
administrative tribunals. He recommends all
other judicial appointments to the Crown and
appoints magistrates. He has general
responsibility for the legal aid and advice
schemes and for the administration of civil
law reform.
The Home Secretary is concerned with
the criminal law, the police service, prisons,
and the probation and after-care service. He
appoints a Board of Visitors to each prison
establishment (see p 105), and is advised by
the Parole Board on the release of prisoners
on licence. The Home Secretary is also
responsible for advising the Queen on the
exercise of the royal prerogative of mercy to
pardon a person convicted of a crime or to
remit all or part of a penalty imposed by a
court.
The Attorney General and the Solicitor
General are the Government’s principal
advisers on English law, and they represent
the Crown in appropriate domestic and
international cases. They are senior barristers,
elected members of the House of Commons
and hold ministerial posts. The Attorney
General is also Attorney General for
Northern Ireland. As well as exercising
various civil law functions, the Attorney
General has final responsibility for enforcing
the criminal law. The Solicitor General is, in
effect, the deputy of the Attorney General.
As head of the Crown Prosecution Service,
the Director of Public Prosecutions is subject
to superintendence by the Attorney General,
as are the Director of the Serious Fraud
Office and the Director of Public
Prosecutions for Northern Ireland.
Scotland
The Secretary of State for Scotland
recommends the appointment of all judges
other than the most senior ones, appoints the
staff of the High Court of Justiciary and the
Court of Session, and is responsible for the
composition, staffing and organisation of the
sheriff courts. District courts are staffed and
administered by the district and islands local
authorities.
The Secretary of State is also responsible
for criminal law, crime prevention, the police,
the penal system and legal aid; he is advised
on parole matters by the Parole Board for
Scotland.
The Lord Advocate and the Solicitor
General for Scotland are the chief legal
advisers to the Government and the main
representatives of the Crown for the purposes
of litigation in Scotland. Both are government
ministers. The Lord Advocate is closely
concerned with legal policy and
administration, and is responsible for the
Scottish parliamentary counsel. He must act
independently when prosecuting crime.
Northern Ireland
The administration of all courts is the
responsibility of the Lord Chancellor, while
the Northern Ireland Office, under the
Secretary of State, deals with the criminal
law, the police and the penal system. The
Lord Chancellor has general responsibility for
legal aid, advice and assistance.
THE PERSONNEL OF THE LAW
The courts of the United Kingdom are the
Queen’s Courts, since the Crown is the
historic source of all judicial power. The
Queen, acting on the advice of ministers, is
responsible for all appointments to the
judiciary, except district judges in the county
courts, who are appointed by the Lord
Chancellor.
Judges
Judges are normally appointed from
practising barristers, advocates (in Scotland),
or solicitors (see below).
Lay magistrates in England and Wales
need no legal qualifications but are trained to
give them sufficient knowledge of the law,
including the rules of evidence, and of the
nature and purpose of sentencing.
The Scottish district court justices of the
112
JUSTICE AND THE LAW
peace need no legal qualifications, but they
too must take part in training.
In Northern Ireland members of a lay
panel who serve in juvenile courts undertake
training courses; resident magistrates are
drawn from practising solicitors or barristers.
The Legal Profession
The legal profession is divided into two
branches: barristers (advocates in Scotland)
and solicitors. Barristers are known
collectively as the ‘Bar’, and collectively and
individually as ‘counsel’. Solicitors undertake
legal business for individual and corporate
clients, while barristers advise on legal
problems submitted through solicitors and
present cases in the higher courts. Both
can present cases in the lower courts.
Although people are free to conduct their
own cases, most people prefer to be legally
represented in the more serious cases.
Recent legislation is designed to stimulate
the development of good quality legal services
for clients in Great Britain by lifting
restrictions on who can provide these
services. Solicitors are applying for the right
to appear in the higher courts. Building
societies, banks and other financial
organisations can offer conveyancing services
under a scheme providing important new
safeguards to clients. People in England and
Wales wanting to take legal action will be
able, like those in Scotland, to negotiate a
form of ‘no win, no fee’ agreement, in
personal injury cases, with their legal
advisers.
The system of complaints against legal
practitioners has been strengthened by the
creation of a Legal Services Ombudsman able
to investigate how the professional bodies
handle these complaints. Similar proposals
regarding legal services in Northern Ireland
are being considered.
LEGAL AID
A person in need of legal advice or legal
representation in court may qualify for help
with the costs out of public funds, either free
or with a contribution according to means
under the various legal aid schemes.
Green Form Scheme
People whose income and savings are within
certain limits are entitled to help from a
solicitor on legal matters (with the exception
of conveyancing and, in some cases, the
making of a will). Such help includes advice
on the relevant law, writing letters on the
client’s behalf, and seeking the opinion of a
barrister or advocate. In England, Wales and
Northern Ireland it may be extended to cover
representation in civil proceedings in the
magistrates’ court and Mental Health Review
Tribunal hearings.
In England and Wales the scheme
provides for initial work to be done up to a
limit of three hours’ worth of work for
matrimonial cases where a petition is drafted
and two hours’ worth for other work. There
are cost limits in Northern Ireland.
Legal Aid in Civil Proceedings
Legal aid, which covers representation before
the court, may be available for most civil
proceedings to those who satisfy the financial
eligibility conditions. An applicant for legal
aid must also show not only that he or she
has reasonable grounds for taking or
defending proceedings—or being a party to
proceedings—but also that it is reasonable
that he or she should receive legal aid. If
legal aid is granted, the case is conducted in
the normal way; in England and Wales all
payments to lawyers are made through the
Legal Aid Fund administered by the Legal
Aid Board.
In certain limited circumstances the
successful unassisted opponent of a legally
aided party may recover his or her costs in
the case from the Legal Aid Fund. Where
the assisted person recovers or preserves
money or property in the proceedings, the
Legal Aid Fund will usually have a first
charge on that money or property to
recover money spent on the assisted
person’s behalf.
Legal Aid in Criminal Proceedings
In criminal proceedings in England, Wales
and Northern Ireland a legal aid certificate
113
BRITAIN 1993: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
may be granted by the court if it appears to
be in the interests of justice and if a
defendant is considered to require assistance
in meeting his or her costs. A certificate
must be granted (subject to means) when a
person is committed for trial on a murder
charge or where the prosecutor appeals or
applies for leave to appeal from the Court of
Appeal to the House of Lords. No person
who is unrepresented can be given a
custodial sentence for the first time unless
given the opportunity to apply for
legal aid.
The Legal Aid Board in England and
Wales makes arrangements for duty solicitors
to be present at magistrates’ courts to provide
initial advice and representation to
unrepresented defendants. Solicitors are
available, on a 24-hour basis, to give advice
and assistance to suspects at police stations.
The services of a solicitor at a police station
and the duty solicitor at court are free.
In Northern Ireland a voluntary duty
solicitor scheme has been introduced at the
principal magistrates’ court in Belfast. Legal
aid for criminal cases is free.
Scotland
In Scotland, legal aid in criminal proceedings
is available to all persons in custody on their
first appearance in the sheriff courts and the
district courts without enquiry into the
person’s means. Thereafter (or if the person
has been cited to attend the court and is not
in custody) a person seeking legal aid must
apply to the Scottish Legal Aid Board. The
Board assesses all applications in summary
criminal cases and must be satisfied that the
costs of the case cannot be met by the
applicant without undue hardship, and that it
is in the interests of justice that legal aid is
awarded.
In solemn proceedings the Court
determines whether legal aid is to be available
and must be satisfied only that the accused
cannot meet the costs of the defence without
undue financial hardship. Where legal aid is
granted to the accused in criminal
proceedings, he or she is not required to pay
any contribution towards expenses (in
contrast to the legally aided litigant in civil
proceedings).
Law Centres
In a number of urban areas law centres
provide free legal advice and representation.
Financed from various sources, often
including local government authorities, they
usually employ full-time salaried lawyers and
many have community workers. Much of
their time is devoted to housing,
employment, social security and immigration
problems.
Free advice is also available in Citizens
Advice Bureaux, consumer and housing
advice centres and in specialist advice centres
run by various voluntary organisations.
LAW REFORM
In England and Wales the Law Commission
is responsible for reviewing the law and
making recommendations for its
simplification and modernisation. The Lord
Chancellor also occasionally refers specific
topics to the Law Reform Committee,
nominating as members experts in the
particular field of law involved. In criminal
law matters the Home Secretary acts similarly
with the Criminal Law Revision Committee.
Any changes in the law are a matter lor
legislation.
Law reform in Scotland is the
responsibility of the Scottish Law
Commission, which reports to the Lord
Advocate. In Northern Ireland the Law
Reform Advisory Committee, which reports
to the Secretary of State, reviews certain
aspects of the civil law and makes
recommendations for reform.

6 Social Welfare
The British social welfare system comprises
the National Health Service (NHS), the
personal social services and social security.
The NHS provides a full range of medical
services which are available to all residents,
regardless of their income. Local authority
personal social services and voluntary
organisations provide help and advice to the
most vulnerable members of the community.
These include elderly, physically disabled and
mentally ill people, those with learning
disabilities (mental handicap) and children in
need of care. The social security system is
designed to secure a basic standard of living
for people in financial need by providing
income during periods of inability to earn
(including periods of unemployment), help
for families and assistance with costs arising
from disablement.
Central government is directly responsible
for the NHS, administered by a range of local
health authorities and boards throughout
Britain acting as its agents, and for the social
security system. Personal social services are
administered by local authorities but central
government is responsible for establishing
national policies, issuing guidance and
overseeing standards. Joint finance and
planning between health and local authorities
aim to prevent overlapping of services and to
encourage the development of community
services.
Planned spending on social welfare in
1992-93 is: health over £34,000 million, and
social security benefits (the Government’s
largest expenditure programme) over £68,000
million, while the standard spending
assessment for personal social services is over
£5,000 million.
Spending on the health service has
increased substantially in real terms since
1980, and is planned to grow further over the
next two years. More patients are being
treated than ever before. Spending on social
security is rising because of increased
numbers of beneficiaries, especially
retirement pensioners, and the long-term sick
and disabled. The value of retirement and
most other long-term benefits has also
increased in real terms since 1980. Spending
on the personal social services is determined
by local authorities. Central government has
restricted the total expenditure of individual
local authorities, but spending has risen
substantially in real terms since the late
1970s, reflecting the priority given to this
sector.
In England the NHS health programme
consists of:
• Hospital and Community Health Services
(HCHS), providing all hospital care and
a range of community health services;
• Family Health Services (FHS), providing
general medical, dental and
pharmaceutical services and some
ophthalmic services, and covering the
cost of most medicines prescribed by
general practitioners (GPs);
• Central Health and Miscellaneous
Services (CHMS), providing services
most effectively administered centrally,
such as welfare food and support to the
voluntary sector; and
• the administrative costs of the
Department of Health.
MAJOR POLICY DEVELOPMENTS
Major Reforms in Management
The NHS and Community Care Act 1990
introduced wide-ranging reform in
management and patient care in the health
and social care services.
The NHS reforms came into effect in

April 1991. Their aim is to give patients,
wherever they live in Britain, better health
care and greater choice of service.
1. Health authorities have been given a new
role as purchasers of health care on behalf of
their local residents, responsible for assessing
local health care needs and ensuring the
availability of a full range of services to meet
identified health needs. They ensure that
those needs are met within existing resources.
2. Each health authority is funded to buy
health care for its local residents through
arranging contracts with hospitals and other
health service units in either the public or
private sector. For the first time hospitals are
directly funded for the number of patients
they treat, making it easier for GPs to refer
patients outside their area if treatment
elsewhere is faster and better. However,
powers exist for allocating resources where
the urgent need for treatment does not allow
NHS contracts to be arranged in advance.
3. The contracts agreed between health
authorities and hospitals set out the quality,
quantity and cost of the services to be
delivered during the year. The contracts
secured by each health authority are based on
wide consultation with all local GPs.
4. Hospitals may apply to become self-
governing NHS trusts (see p 122),
independent of local health authority control
but remaining within the NHS, accountable
to the relevant health department, treating
NHS patients, and funded largely through
general taxation, through contracts with
health authorities.
5. GPs from larger medical practices may
apply to join the general practitioner
fundholding scheme (see p 121), under which
they receive an annual budget directly from
the health authority, enabling them to buy
certain hospital services for their patients.
The reforms in community care provision,
which take effect between April 1991 and
April 1993, establish a new financial and
managerial framework which aims to secure
the delivery of good quality services in line
with national objectives. They are intended to
enable vulnerable groups in the community to
live as independently as possible in their own
homes for as long as they are able and wish
116
SOCIAL WELFARE
to do so, and to give them a greater say in
how they live and how the services they need
should be provided. (For fuller details see
p 135.)
Broadly similar changes have been
introduced under separate legislation in
Northern Ireland, where health and personal
social services are provided on an integrated
basis by health and social services boards.
The Patient’s Charter
The Patient’s Charter, published in 1991, is
part of the health departments’ contribution
to the Citizen’s Charter White Paper, a
government initiative designed to raise
standards of service and to make providers of
all the public services fully accountable to the
users of those services (see p 50). The
Patient’s Charter shares the objectives of the
NHS reforms: to improve standards of health
care and sensitivity to patients in the NHS. It
sets out for the first time the rights of
patients and the standards of care they can
expect to receive from the NHS. The
Government believes that patients should
know what they can expect from the NHS
and that the staff who provide services should
understand what is expected of them. The
responsibility for implementing the Patient’s
Charter rests with health authorities.
As well as restating the existing rights that
patients have under the NHS, the Patient’s
Charter sets out three new rights introduced
in April 1992. These are that patients must:
• be given detailed information on local
health services, including quality
standards and maximum waiting times;
• be guaranteed admission for treatment no
later than two years from the date of
being placed on a waiting list; and
• have any complaint about NHS services
investigated, and receive a full reply as
soon as possible.
The Patient’s Charter also sets national
charter standards. These are not legal rights
but specific standards of service which the
NHS aims to provide. These cover respect
for the individual patient, waiting times for
ambulances, assessment in casualty
departments, appointments in out-patient
clinics, and cancellation of operations. Also
included are local charter standards of service
which health authorities aim to provide.
Separate Patient’s Charters have been
developed for Scotland, Wales and Northern
Ireland.
Developing Health Strategies
The Government emphasises the importance
of promoting health as well as treating illness.
Preventive health services such as health
education, and the responsibility that
individuals have for their own health, play a
major part in this. While great progress has
been made in eliminating infectious diseases
such as poliomyelitis and tuberculosis, there
is still scope for greater success in controlling
the major causes of early death and disability.
The White Paper The Health of the
Nation, published in July 1992, sets out a
strategy for improving health. This is the
first time a strategy has been developed for
health in England and its long-term aim is to
enable people to live longer, healthier lives. It
sets targets for improvements in the following
areas:
• coronary heart disease and stroke (the
major cause of premature death in
England);
• cancers (the second biggest cause of
premature death);
• accidents (the commonest cause of death
in those under 30);
• mental illness (a leading cause of ill-
health and, through suicides, of death);
and
• HIV/AIDS and sexual health
(HIV/AIDS is perhaps the greatest new
public health threat this century—see
p 129—and there is much scope for
reducing sexually transmitted diseases
and unwanted pregnancies).
Targets are set for reducing death rates
(for example, from coronary heart disease and
stroke in those under 65 by at least 40 per
cent by the year 2000), for reducing ill-health
(such as the incidence of invasive cervical
cancer by at least 20 per cent by 2000) and
117
BRITAIN 1993: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
for reducing risk behaviour (for example, the
percentage of smokers to no more than 20
per cent of the population by the year 2000).
While the NHS will have a central role in
working towards the targets, the strategy also
emphasises that there is a role for everyone in
improving the nation’s health. Progress
towards these targets will be monitored, and
the strategy will be reviewed periodically with
a view to adding further areas.
The White Paper also sets out the
Government’s objective of ensuring the
provision of effective family planning services
for those people who want them. The
conception rate for those under 16 years is a
matter of particular concern.
Strategies have also been developed for
Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.
National Health Service
The NHS is based upon the principle that
there should be a full range of publicly
provided services designed to help the
individual stay healthy. The services are
intended to provide effective and appropriate
treatment and care where necessary while
making the best use of available resources. All
taxpayers, employers and employees
contribute to its cost so that those members
of the community who do not require health
care help to pay for those who do. Some
forms of treatment, such as hospital care, are
provided free; others (see p 119) may be
charged for.
Growth in real spending on the health
service is being used to meet the needs of
increasing numbers of elderly people and to
take full advantage of advances in medical
technology. It is also used to provide more
appropriate types of care, often in the
community rather than in hospital, for
priority groups such as the elderly, the
mentally ill and people with learning
disabilities (mental handicap). Increased
spending has, in addition, been allocated to
combat the growing health problems arising
from alcohol and drug misuse; and to remedy
disparities in provision between the regions of
Britain.
The Government stresses the need for a
partnership between the public and private
health sectors and for improving efficiency in
order to secure the best value for money and
the maximum patient care. Measures to
achieve more effective management of
resources in the NHS have included:
• appointing at regional, district and unit
levels general managers drawn from
inside and outside the health service;
• improving the accountability of health
authorities for the planning and
management of their resources;
• increasing the proportion of total staff
who provide direct patient care, such as
doctors and nurses; and
• introducing a range of programmes to
provide services at lower cost.
Considerable savings have been made
through competitive tendering for hospital
cleaning, catering and laundry services. At
the end of 1991 the Government announced
that total annual savings from competitive
tendering amounted to £156 million.
Economies are also made in prescribing by
restricting the use of expensive branded
products in favour of cheaper but equally
effective equivalent medicines.
ADMINISTRATION
The Secretary of State for Health in England
and the Secretaries of State for Scotland,
Wales and Northern Ireland are responsible
for all aspects of the health services in their
respective countries. The Department of
Health is responsible for national strategic
planning in England. The Scottish Office
Home and Health Department, the Welsh
Office and the Department of Health and
Social Services in Northern Ireland have
similar responsibilities.
District health authorities in England and
Wales and health boards in Scotland are
responsible for securing hospital and
community health services in their areas.
England, because of its greater size and
population, also has regional authorities
responsible for regional planning, resource
allocation, major capital building work and
certain specialised hospital services best
118
SOCIAL WELFARE
administered on a regional basis. The
authorities and boards co-operate closely with
local authorities responsible for social work,
environmental health, education and other
services. Family health services authorities
(health boards in Scotland) arrange for the
provision of services by doctors, dentists,
pharmacists and opticians, as well as
administering their contracts. Community
health councils (local health councils in
Scotland) represent local opinion on the
health services provided.
In Northern Ireland health and social
services boards are responsible for all health
and personal social services in their areas.
The representation of public opinion on
these services is provided for by area health
and social services councils.
Finance
Over 80 per cent of the cost of the health
service in Great Britain is paid for through
general taxation. The rest is met from the
NHS element of National Insurance
contributions—which are paid by employed
people, their employers, and self-employed
people—and from charges towards the cost
of certain items such as drugs prescribed by
family doctors, and general dental treatment.
Health authorities may raise funds from
voluntary sources. Certain hospitals increase
their revenue by taking private patients who
pay the full cost of their accommodation and
treatment.
Almost 80 per cent of medical
prescription items are supplied free.
Prescription charges do not apply to the
following:
• children under 16 years (or students
under 19 and still in full-time education);
• expectant mothers and women who have
had a baby in the last year;
• women aged 60 and over and men aged
65 and over;
• patients suffering from certain medical
conditions;
• war and armed forces disablement
pensioners (for prescriptions which relate
to the disability for which they receive a
war pension);
• people who are receiving income support
or family credit (see p 146); and people
or families with low incomes.
There are proportional charges for all
types of general dental treatment, including
dental examination. However, women who
were pregnant when the dentist accepted
them for treatment or who have had a baby
in the last year, anyone under the age of 18
(or 19 if in full-time education), people
receiving income support or family credit,
and families on low incomes do not have to
pay. Sight tests are free to children, those on
low incomes and certain other priority
groups. Some disadvantaged groups receive
help with the purchase, repair and
replacement of spectacles.
Hospital medical staffs are salaried and
may be employed full time or part time.
Family practitioners (doctors, dentists,
opticians and pharmacists) are self-employed
and have contracts with the NHS. GPs are
paid by a system of fees and allowances
designed to reflect responsibilities, workload
and practice expenses. Dentists providing
treatment in their own surgeries are paid by a
combination of capitation fees for treating
children, continuing care payments for adults
registered with the practice, and a prescribed
scale of fees for individual treatments.
Pharmacists dispensing from their own
premises are refunded the cost of the items
supplied, together with professional fees.
Ophthalmic medical practitioners and
ophthalmic opticians taking part in the
general ophthalmic service receive approved
fees for each sight test carried out.
Staffing
The NHS is one of the largest employers in
the world, with a workforce of nearly
1 million people. During the last ten years
there has been a rise in the numbers of
‘direct care staff and a corresponding fall in
the numbers of support staff. The fall in the
numbers of directly employed ancillary staff
and of maintenance and works staff reflect
the results of competitive tendering (see
p 50). Staff costs account for two-thirds of
total NHS expenditure and 70 per cent of
current expenditure on hospitals and
119
BRITAIN 1993: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
community health services. In England
between 1981 and 1990:
• the number of hospital medical
consultants increased from 12,400 to
15,200;
• the number of junior hospital doctors
increased from 20,800 to 23,500;
• the number of hospital dental staff rose
to 2,100;
• the number of nursing and midwifery
staff, who make up 50 per cent of the
workforce, increased by 2 6 per cent
(including agency staff); and
• the number of scientific, professional and
technical staff rose by 20 per cent.
Health Service Commissioners
There are three posts of Health Service
Commissioner (one each for England,
Scotland and Wales) for dealing with
complaints from members of the public about
the health service. The three posts are held
by the same person, who is also the
Parliamentary Commissioner for
Administration (Ombudsman), who reports
annually to Parliament. The Health Service
Commissioner can investigate complaints
that a health authority, NHS trust or
family health services authority has not
carried out its statutory duties, has provided
an inadequate service or, through
maladministration, has caused injustice or
hardship.
Complaints about clinical judgment, GPs,
personnel matters and the use of a health
authority’s discretionary powers lie beyond
the Health Service Commissioner’s
jurisdiction, and separate procedures exist for
these. In Northern Ireland the Commissioner
for Complaints has a similar role.
FAMILY HEALTH SERVICES
The family health services are those given to
patients by doctors, dentists, opticians and
pharmacists of their own choice. GPs provide
the first diagnosis in the case of illness and
either prescribe a suitable course of treatment
or refer a patient to the more specialised
services and hospital consultants.
About four-fifths of GPs in Britain work
in partnerships or group practices, often as
members of primary health-care teams. The
teams also include health visitors and district
nurses, and sometimes midwives, social
workers and other professional staff employed
by the health authorities. About a quarter of
GPs in Great Britain and about half in
Northern Ireland work in modern and well-
equipped health centres, where medical and
nursing services are provided. Health centres
may also have facilities for health education,
family planning, speech therapy, chiropody,
assessment of hearing, physiotherapy and
remedial exercises. Dental, pharmaceutical
and ophthalmic services, hospital out-patient
and supporting social work services may also
be provided.
There have been substantial increases in
primary health care staff in recent years. For
example, in England and Wales between 1980
and 1991, the number of GPs increased by 18
per cent (to 29,700), and average patient list
size fell by 13 per cent (to 1,900), while the
number of family dentists increased by 26 per
cent (to 16,400). The number of GP practice
nurses has increased more than tenfold—from
900 in 1978 to 9,950 in 1991.
Special funds have been earmarked by the
Government for improving the quality of
primary health care in inner city areas.
Efforts have also been made to improve
health services for black and ethnic minority
groups. These include new health projects in
Britain’s Chinese communities, and increased
central funding for health information
material to be produced in many minority
languages.
The Government has welcomed a recent
report which recommends ways in which the
role of community pharmacists could be
developed to increase their contribution to
health care.
Eye Services
Entitlement to free NHS sight tests is
restricted to people on low incomes, children
and those with particular medical needs.
Spectacles are supplied by registered
ophthalmic and dispensing opticians but
unregistered retailers may also sell spectacles
120
SOCIAL WELFARE
to most adults. Children, people on low
incomes and those requiring certain complex
lenses receive a voucher to put towards the
cost of their spectacles.
Recent Developments
GP Fundholders
Under the NHS and Community Care Act
1990 GP practices with 9,000 patients or over
may apply for fundholding status. (From
April 1993 this figure will fall to 7,000
patients.) This is a voluntary scheme which
gives larger medical practices the opportunity
to manage sums of NHS money for the
benefit of their patients. It aims to improve
services for patients and enable GPs to
explore more innovative methods of providing
health care. GP fundholders are responsible
for part of their own NHS budgets, enabling
them to buy certain non-urgent hospital
services. Prescription charges and part of the
cost of running the practice are also covered.
Fundholders may negotiate for services
directly with hospitals from both public and
private sectors in any district or regional
health authority in Britain. By April 1992
over 3,000 GPs in about 600 practices in
England had become fundholders, covering
nearly 6-7 million people, or 14 per cent of
the population. A further 2,500 GPs in some
600 practices are preparing to join the scheme
in April 1993. From April 1993 the scheme
will be expanded to enable GP fundholders to
buy district nursing and health visiting
services from NHS community units.
Contracts
A new performance-related contract for GPs
came into effect in 1990, the first major
reform of the family doctor service for over
20 years. It is designed to raise standards of
care, extend the range of services available to
patients and improve patient choice. The
changes are intended to make it easier for
patients to see their GP at times convenient
to them and easier for patients to change
doctors; and to encourage doctors to practise
more preventive medicine.
A new contract for dentists was introduced
in 1990 aimed at improving care and
providing more information to patients about
general dental services. As a result NHS
dental care now includes preventive care as
well as restorative treatment. All adult
patients are now offered ‘continuing care’,
and dentists are encouraged to practise more
preventive dentistry for children. There are
also incentives for dentists to undertake
further training.
Medical Audit
Medical audit, which is the systematic,
critical analysis by doctors at all levels in the
health service of the quality of the medical
care they give their patients, including the
procedures used for diagnosis and treatment,
the use of resources and the resulting
outcome, has been introduced in all health
authorities. In 1991-92 the Government
allocated £46 million to continue to develop
medical audit in the hospital and community
health services.
Health Visitors, District Nurses and
Midwives
Health visitors are responsible for the
preventive care and health education of
families, particularly those with young
children. They work closely with GPs,
district nurses and other professions. District
nurses give skilled nursing care to people at
home or elsewhere outside hospital; they also
play an important role in health promotion
and education. Although almost all babies are
born in hospital, some antenatal care and
most postnatal care is given in the
community by midwives and GPs, who also
care for women having their babies at home.
Midwives are responsible for educating and
supporting women and their families during
pregnancy and childbirth.
HOSPITALS AND SPECIALIST
SERVICES
A full range of hospital services is provided
by district general hospitals. These include
treatment and diagnostic facilities for
in-patients, day-patients and out-patients;
121
BRITAIN 1993: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
maternity departments; infectious disease
units; psychiatric and geriatric facilities;
rehabilitation facilities; and other forms of
specialised treatment. There are also specialist
hospitals or units for children, people
suffering from mental illness, those with
learning disabilities, and elderly people, and
for the treatment of specific diseases.
Examples of these include the world-famous
Hospital for Sick Children, Great Ormond
Street, and the Brompton Heart and Chest
Hospital in London. Hospitals designated as
teaching hospitals combine treatment facilities
with training medical and other students, and
research work.
Many of the hospitals in the NHS were
built in the nineteenth century; some, such as
St Bartholomew’s and St Thomas’ in
London, trace their origins to much earlier
charitable foundations.
Much has been done to improve and
extend existing hospital buildings and many
new hospitals have been or are being opened.
Since 1979 in Great Britain over 600
health building schemes, each costing
£1 million or more, have been
completed. A further 400 schemes are
at various stages of development. This
is the largest sustained building
programme in the history of the NHS.
Recent policy in England and Wales has
been to provide a balanced hospital service
centred around a district general hospital,
complemented as necessary by smaller, locally
based hospitals and facilities.
A new development in hospital planning
in England and Wales is the nucleus hospital.
This is designed to accommodate a full range
of district general hospital facilities and is
capable of being built in self-contained phases
or as an extension to an existing hospital. By
mid-1992, 83 nucleus hospitals had been
completed. A further 56 are at various stages
of construction or planning. Those already
open have proved economical to build and
are providing high-quality and cost-effective
services to patients.
The world’s first low-energy nucleus
hospital, which is expected to use less than
half the energy of a conventional nucleus
hospital, opened on the Isle of Wight in
1991, and another is being built in
N orthumberland.
The hospital service is now treating more
patients a year than ever before. Between
1979 and 1990-91 lengths of stay for
in-patients declined and the number of
people treated as day patients more than
doubled. Newer forms of treatment and
diagnosis are being made more widely
available. These include kidney dialysis, hip
replacements, laser treatment and body
scanning.
In 1986 the Government launched a drive
to reduce hospital waiting lists and times. In
1992-93 £39 million is being invested in a
variety of projects, including mobile operating
theatres, to improve waiting times for
patients. Preliminary figures show that the
number of patients waiting between one and
two years for treatment fell by nearly 40,000
or 33 per cent while the total waiting list
dropped bv over 33,000 or 3-5 per cent in
1991-92.
Community services such as the
psychiatric nursing service, day hospitals, and
local authority day centres have expanded so
that more patients remain in the community
and others are sent home from hospital
sooner.
NHS Trusts
Under the NHS and Community Care Act
1990 hospitals and other health service units
(for example, ambulance services and
community health services) may apply to
become independent of local health authority
control and establish themselves as self-
governing NHS trusts. These are run by
boards of directors, and are free to employ
their own staff and set their own rates of pay,
carry out research and provide facilities for
medical education and other forms of
training. Self-governing NHS trusts derive
their income mainly from NHS contracts to
provide services to health authorities and GP
fundholders. The trusts may treat private
patients. All trusts must provide annual
reports, and annual accounts modelled on
commercial accountancy practices. By August
1992, 156 NHS trusts had been established.
122
SOCIAL WELFARE
Private Medical Treatment
The Government’s policy is for the NHS and
the independent sector to co-operate in
meeting the nation’s health needs. It believes
that this will benefit the NHS by adding to
the resources devoted to health care and
offering flexibility to health authorities in the
delivery of services. Some health authorities
share expensive facilities and equipment with
private hospitals, and NHS patients are
sometimes treated (at public expense) in the
private sector to reduce waiting lists.The scale
of private practice in relation to the NHS is,
however, small.
It is estimated that about three-quarters of
those receiving acute treatment in private
hospitals or NHS hospital pay-beds are
covered by health insurance schemes, which
make provision for private health care in
return for annual subscriptions. Over 3 million
people subscribe to such schemes, half of them
within group schemes, some arranged by
firms on behalf of employees. Subscriptions
often cover more than one person (for
example, members of a family) and the total
number of people covered by private medical
insurance in Britain is estimated at over 6
million. The Government has introduced tax
relief on private health insurance premiums
paid by people aged 60 and over to encourage
the increased use of private health facilities.
Many overseas patients come to Britain for
treatment in private hospitals and clinics, and
Harley Street in London is an internationally
recognised centre for medical consultancy.
There is a growing interest in alternative
therapies such as homoeopathy, osteopathy
and acupuncture, which are mainly practised
outside the NHS.
Organ Transplants
Over the past 25 years there have been
significant developments in transplant surgery
in Britain. The United Kingdom Transplant
Support Service Authority provides a
centralised organ matching and distribution
service. During 1991, 1,690 kidney
transplants were performed. A similar service
exists for corneas, and in 1991, 2,226 were
transplanted.
Heart transplant operations have been
conducted at Papworth Hospital in
Cambridgeshire and Harefield Hospital in
London since 1979. There are six other heart
transplant centres in England, while
Scotland’s first unit opened in Glasgow in
late 1991.
A programme of combined heart and
lung transplants is in progress and in
1991 over 280 heart and 81 heart-lung
transplants were performed. The
w orld’s first combined heart, lungs
and liver transplant operation was
carried out at Papworth in 1987.
There are six liver transplant units in
England and 419 liver transplants were
performed in 1991. Scotland’s first liver
transplant centre is due to open in Edinburgh
in November 1992. A voluntary organ donor
card system enables people to indicate their
willingness to become organ donors in the
event of their death. Commercial dealing in
organs for transplant is illegal.
Blood Transfusion
The blood transfusion service in England and
Wales collects over 2 million donations of
blood and over 133,700 donations of plasma
each year from voluntary unpaid donors; in
Scotland the figures are over 350,000 and
over 18,000 respectively. Regional transfusion
centres recruit donors and organise donor
sessions in towns and villages, factories and
offices, and within the armed forces. Donors
are normally aged between 18 and 65. The
centres are also responsible for blood
grouping and testing, maintaining blood
banks, providing a consultancy service to
hospitals, teaching in medical schools, and
instructing doctors, nurses and technicians.
The Central Blood Laboratories Authority
is responsible for the manufacture of blood
products as well as for research. There is also
increasing emphasis on the most effective use
of blood and, in particular, its separation into
components such as plasma for specific uses.
A laboratory at Elstree, Hertfordshire, was
opened in 1987 with the aim of meeting the
needs for all blood products in England and
123
BRITAIN 1993: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Wales. Facilities in Scotland are being
expanded to cope with rising demand.
Ambulance and Patient Transport
Services
NHS emergency ambulances are available
free of charge for cases of sudden illness or
collapse, and for doctors’ urgent calls. Rapid
response services, in which paramedics use
cars and motor cycles to reach emergency
cases, have been introduced in a number of
areas, particularly London and other major
cities with areas of high traffic density.
Helicopter ambulances serve many parts of
England and in Scotland an air ambulance
service is available in the islands and the
remoter parts of the mainland.
Non-emergency patient transport services
are available to NHS patients considered by
their doctor (or dentist or midwife) to be
medically unfit to travel by other means. The
principle applied is that each patient should
be able to reach hospital in a reasonable time
and in reasonable comfort, without detriment
to his or her medical condition. In many
areas the ambulance service organises
volunteer drivers to provide a hospital car
service for non-urgent patients.
Rehabilitation
Rehabilitation begins at the onset of illness or
of injury and continues throughout, with the
aim of helping people to adjust to changes in
lifestyle and to live as normally as possible.
Rehabilitation services are available for
elderly, young, disabled and mentally ill
people, and those with learning disabilities
who need such help to resume life in the
community. These services are offered in
hospitals, centres in the community and in
people’s own homes through co-ordinated
work by a range of professional workers.
Medical services may provide free artificial
limbs and eyes, hearing aids, surgical
supports, wheelchairs, and other appliances.
Following assessment, very severely
physically handicapped patients may be
provided with environmental control
equipment which enables them to operate
devices such as alarm bells, radios and
televisions, telephones, and heating
appliances. Nursing aids may be provided on
loan for use in the home.
Local authorities may provide a range of
facilities to help patients in the transition
from hospital to their own homes. These
include the provision of aids, care from home
helps, and professional help from
occupational therapists and social workers.
Voluntary organisations also provide help,
complementing the work of the statutory
agencies and widening the range of services.
Hospices
A number of hospices provide care for
terminally ill people (including children),
either directly in in-patient or day-care units
or through nursing and other assistance in
the patient’s own home. Control of symptoms
and psychological support for patients and
their families form central features of the
modern hospice movement, which started in
Britain and is now worldwide. Some hospices
are administered entirely by the NHS; the
remainder are run by independent charities,
some receiving support from public funds.
The number of voluntary hospices has more
than doubled in the past ten years; there are
now over 100 in-patient units providing over
1,900 beds, and more than 150 day units
offering some 1,500 places.
The Government is seeking to provide a
level of public funding for the hospice
movement which matches voluntary
donations. In 1992-93, ^3L7 million is being
allocated to health authorities to enable them
to offer increased support to hospices and
similar organisations, while a further £5-5
million has been allocated to enable them to
arrange for drugs to be supplied to hospices
without charge. The National Council for
Hospice and Specialist Palliative Care
Services was launched in February 1992.
Parents and Children
Special preventive services are provided
under the health service to safeguard the
health of expectant mothers and of mothers
with young children. Services include free
dental treatment, dried milk and vitamins;
124
SOCIAL WELFARE
health education; and vaccination and
immunisation of children against certain
infectious diseases (see p 131). Pregnant
women receive antenatal care from their GPs
and hospital clinics, and women in paid
employment have the right to visit the clinics
during working hours. Some 99 per cent of
women have their babies in hospital,
returning home shortly afterwards to be
attended by a midwife or health visitor and,
where necessary, their GP.
The Government attaches great
importance to improving the quality of
maternity services, and to making them more
responsive to women’s wishes on how care is
provided. The perinatal mortality rate (the
number of stillbirths and deaths in the first
week of life) has fallen in England and Wales
from 14-7 per 1,000 births in 1979 to 8 per
1,000 births in 1991—its lowest recorded
level. Similar reductions have occurred in
Scotland and Northern Ireland.
A comprehensive programme of health
surveillance is provided for pre-school
children in clinics run by the community
health authorities, and increasingly by GPs.
This enables doctors, dentists and health
visitors to oversee the physical and mental
health and development of pre-school
children. Information on preventive services
is given and welfare foods are distributed.
The school health service offers health care
and advice for schoolchildren, including
medical and dental inspection and treatment
where necessary.
Child guidance and child psychiatric
services provide help and advice for children
with psychological or emotional problems.
In recent years special efforts have been
made to improve co-operation between the
community-based child health services and
local authority social services for children.
This is particularly important in the
prevention of child abuse and for the health
and welfare of children in care.
Human Fertilisation and Embryology
The world’s first ‘test-tube baby’ was born in
Britain in 1978, as a result of the technique of
in vitro fertilisation. This opened up new
horizons for helping with problems of
infertility and for the science of embryology.
The social, ethical and legal implications were
examined by a committee of inquiry under
Baroness Warnock, which reported in 1984.
There was general consultation on the
Warnock Report and government policy was
set out in a White Paper in 1987, which was
followed by the Human Fertilisation and
Embryology Act 1990. The Act provided for:
• the establishment of the Human
Fertilisation and Embryology Authority
(HFEA) to control and license centres
providing certain infertility treatments
and centres undertaking human embryo
research and storage of gametes and
embryos;
• research to be permitted on embryos for
up to 14 days after fertilisation;
• the legal status and rights of children
born as a result of in vitro fertilisation
and techniques involving donation; and
• the clarification of the legal position on
surrogate motherhood (the practice where
one woman bears a child for another).
The HFEA maintains a code of practice
giving guidance about licensed centres and
must report annually to Parliament.
These provisions constitute one of the
most comprehensive pieces of legislation on
assisted reproduction and embryo research in
the world.
Legislation to ban commercial surrogacy
agencies, and advertising of or for surrogacy
services, was passed in 1985.
Family Planning
Free family planning advice and treatment
are available to women from family doctors
and from health authority family planning
clinics, which also make services available to
men. Family planning is one of the key areas
covered by the White Paper The Health of the
Nation (see p 117).
Abortion
The Abortion Act 1967, as amended in 1990,
allows the ending of a pregnancy of up to 24
weeks by a doctor if two doctors consider
125
BRITAIN 1993: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
that continuing the pregnancy would involve
greater risk of injury to the physical or
mental health of the woman (or to any
existing children of the family) than having
an abortion. There are three categories in
which no time limit applies: where there is a
risk of grave permanent injury to the physical
or mental health of the woman; where there
is a substantial risk of fetal handicap; or
where continuing the pregnancy would
involve a risk to the life of the pregnant
woman greater than that of the pregnancy
being terminated.
The Act does not apply in Northern
Ireland.
Drug Misuse
The misuse of dangerous drugs, such as
heroin, cocaine and amphetamines, is a
serious social and health problem, and the
Government has made the fight against such
misuse a major priority. Its strategy
comprises action to reduce the supply of
illicit drugs from abroad; to promote more
effective law enforcement by the police and
Customs services; and to maintain tight
controls on medicinal drugs that can be
misused. It also includes action to rrtaintain
effective deterrents against misuse; to develop
effective programmes to treat and rehabilitate
misusers; and to prevent people who are not
misusers from starting, by means of
educational programmes and publicity
campaigns.
Research on various aspects of drug
misuse is funded by several government
departments. The Government is advised on
a wide range of matters relating to drug
misuse and connected social problems by the
Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs.
Drug Statistics
Recent drug statistics show that between
1990 and 1991:
• the number of notified drug addicts
increased by 17 per cent (to 21,000);
• the proportion addicted to heroin fell
from 80 per cent to 70 per cent; those
reported to be dependent on methadone
increased from 30 per cent to 40 per cent
(this figure includes those receiving
methadone by prescription as part of a
course of treatment); under 10 per cent
were reported to be addicted to cocaine;
and
• the proportion of addicts injecting drugs
fell from 65 per cent to 59 per cent.
Prevention
The Government began a major national
publicity campaign in 1985 to persuade
young people not to take drugs, and to advise
parents, teachers and other professionals on
how to recognise and combat the problem.
Subsequent phases of the campaign have
warned of the dangers of heroin misuse and
of the risks of transmitting HIV, the virus
which causes AIDS (see p 129), through the
sharing of injecting equipment. In 1991-92
the focus of the campaign changed to give
greater emphasis to locally-based campaigns;
the total cost of the campaign was £4 million.
The Drug Prevention Initiative has
provided funding for the establishment of
local drug prevention teams in 20 areas in
England, Scotland and Wales. Their task is
to strengthen community resistance to drug
misuse. The total budget for the initiative is
£5-5 million in 1992-93. Separate measures
have been introduced in Scotland to
discourage drug misuse through publicity,
campaigns and action in the education service
and the community.
The Government continues to make funds
available for local education authorities in
England and Wales to appoint staff to
promote and co-ordinate preventive work in
their areas, especially for anti-drug misuse
work in schools. As part of the National
Curriculum (see p 155), children in primary
and secondary schools receive education on
the dangers of drug misuse.
Treatment and Rehabilitation
A total of £17-5 million over the three years
1988-89 to 1990-91 was spent on the
development of services for drug misusers.
Additional sums have been made available
since 1986-87 through the health authorities
126
SOCIAL WELFARE
in England for the expansion of services for
drug misusers, rising to nearly £\1'2 million
in 1992-93. A further grant of ^21 million in
1992-93 is intended to help local authorities
to develop voluntary sector services for drug
as well as alcohol misusers. Similar projects
are in progress in Wales and in Scotland,
where over £2 million is made available
annually to health boards for the support of
drug misuse services. To reduce the spread of
AIDS a number of trial schemes are in
progress, offering drug misusers counselling
and the exchange of clean for used syringes
and needles.
Treatment for drug dependence is
provided mainly on an outpatient basis. Many
hospitals provide specialist treatment for drug
misusers, mainly in psychiatric units, or have
special drug treatment units. An increasing
number of GPs also treat drug misusers, but
only certain specialist doctors are licensed to
prescribe heroin, cocaine and dipipanone
(Diconal). All doctors must notify the
authorities of any patient they consider to be
addicted to certain controlled drugs, and
guidelines on good medical practice in the
treatment of drug misuse have been issued to
all doctors in Great Britain. The Home
Secretary has statutory powers for dealing
with doctors found to have prescribed
irresponsibly.
Other Sources of Provision
A number of non-statutory agencies work
with and complement the health service
provision. Advice and rehabilitation services
including residential facilities, for example,
are provided mainly by voluntary
organisations. Support in the community is
provided by the probation service and local
social services departments.
Solvent Misuse
Action is also being taken by the Government
to curb the problem of solvent misuse (the
breathing in of vapour from glue, lighter fuel
and other substances to achieve a change in
mental state) by young people. There were
149 deaths as a result of solvent abuse in
1990. In England and Wales it is an offence
to supply such substances to children under
18 if the supplier knows or has reason to
believe they are to be used to cause
intoxication. Government policy is directed
towards preventing solvent misuse through
the education of young people, parents and
professionals and, where practicable,
restricting the sales of solvent-based liquefied
gas and aerosol products to young people. In
February 1992 the Government launched a
national publicity campaign on solvent misuse
intended to raise parental awareness of the
problem.
Smoking
Cigarette smoking is the greatest preventable
cause of illness and death in Britain. It
accounts for around 110,000 premature
deaths and 30 million lost working days each
year, and costs the NHS an estimated £500
million a year for the treatment of diseases
caused by smoking (for example, heart
disease, lung cancer and bronchitis). In
addition, smoking by pregnant women can
cause low birth weight in infants. The
Government is following an active health
education policy supported by voluntary
agreements with the tobacco industry aimed
at reducing the level of smoking.
The most recent figures show that the
number of adults who smoke is continuing to
fall, from 32 per cent in 1988 to 30 per cent
in 1990.
Health Education
The Government aims to reduce adult
smoking from 30 per cent to 20 per cent by
the year 2000. A further aim is to reduce
smoking by young people by one-third
between 1988 and 1994. A £2 million a year
campaign directed at those aged 11 to 15
started in late 1989 and is planned to last
until 1994. In late 1991 the Government
launched a £1 million campaign over two
years to alert women to the dangers of
smoking during pregnancy.
Education on the harmful effects of
smoking is included in the National
Curriculum for all pupils in publicly
maintained schools in England and Wales.
127
BRITAIN 1993: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
The Government also supports the work
of the voluntary organisation Action on
Smoking and Health (ASH), whose services
include a workplace services consultancy,
offering advice and help to employers in
formulating smoking policies. The
Government is committed to creating a
smoke-free environment, with facilities where
appropriate for those who wish to smoke, by
encouraging suitable smoking policies in
public places. In 1991 it published a code of
practice on smoking in public places. Health
authorities have been asked to promote non¬
smoking as the normal practice in health
service buildings and to give help and advice
to people who want to give up smoking. The
Independent Scientific Committee on
Smoking and Health estimated that ‘passive
smoking’, especially in the workplace and the
home, may cause several hundred deaths
through lung cancer every year.
Voluntary Agreements
Voluntary agreements between the
Government and the tobacco industry
regulate the advertising and promotion of
tobacco products, and sports sponsorship by
the industry. The agreement on tobacco
advertising provides for the use on posters of
six different health warnings about the
dangers of smoking and contains measures to
protect groups at particular risk, such as
children, young people and women in early
child-bearing years. Under the revised
agreement, which came into force in 1992,
new tougher health warnings now appear on
tobacco advertising, and shopfront advertising
is to be reduced by 50 per cent by 1996. The
voluntary agreement on sports sponsorship
covers levels of spending, restrictions on
sponsorship of events chiefly for spectators
under 18 years and controls over the siting of
advertising at televised events.
Legislative Measures
It is illegal to sell any type of tobacco
product to children. Legislation introduced in
1992 has increased the maximum fine from
£400 to £2,500. All tobacco advertising is
banned on television and cigarette
advertisements are banned on radio. In 1991
Britain voted to ban oral snuff products
throughout the European Community. This
measure is expected to be implemented later
in 1992.
Alcohol Misuse
The far-reaching effects of alcohol misuse in
terms of illness, family break-ups, inefficiency
at work, loss of earnings, accidents and crime
are widely acknowledged. The Government
considers that the reduction of such misuse
requires a range of action by central and
local government, voluntary and community
bodies, the health professions, the drinks
industry, employers and trade unions. It
believes that emphasis should be placed on
policies to prevent alcohol misuse and
continues to seek better information about
the causes of problem drinking. It also seeks
to encourage healthier lifestyles, and to
provide earlier help for the problem drinker.
Treatment and rehabilitation include
in-patient and out-patient services in general
and psychiatric hospitals and specialised
alcoholism treatment units. Primary care
teams (GPs, nurses and social workers) and
voluntary organisations providing hostels, day
centres and advisory services also play an
important role.
There is close co-operation between
statutory and voluntary organisations. The
national voluntary agency Alcohol Concern,
which is receiving a government grant of
some £612,000 for 1992-93, plays a
prominent role in the prevention of misuse,
training for professional and voluntary
workers, and improving the network of local
voluntary agencies and their collaboration
with statutory bodies. In 1990 Alcohol
Concern launched a workplace advisory
service with initial government funding of
£100,000 as part of a campaign to persuade
companies that alcohol misuse is an industrial
as well as a social problem. From 1990—91 to
1993-94 a total government contribution of
£6 million is being allocated to Alcohol
Concern for improving and extending the
network of advisory and counselling services.
An additional grant of £21 million is being
paid to local authorities during 1992-93. This
128
SOCIAL WELFARE
is to assist voluntary agencies in improving
and extending residential provision for alcohol
and drug misusers. The Scottish Council on
Alcohol undertakes similar work in Scotland.
Research and surveys on various aspects of
alcohol misuse are funded by several
government departments.
In 1987 the Government established an
interdepartmental group to develop strategy
for combating the misuse of alcohol.
Measures taken include legislative changes as
well as steps to secure better health education
and more effective action by local services
and organisations. In 1988 the law banning the
sale of alcohol to people under 18 years was
strengthened and stricter controls on alcohol
advertising were introduced. Independent
television restricts the advertising of alcohol
in programmes aimed at young people.
In 1989 the Government announced
increased funding for the Health Education
Authority’s expanded alcohol education
programme. This aims to reduce the harm
caused by the misuse of alcohol by promoting
sensible drinking as part of a healthy way of
life. It also seeks to develop a climate of
opinion which favours appropriate measures
to prevent alcohol-related harm. Alcohol
misuse co-ordinators have been appointed in
each of the 14 regional health authorities in
England with the aim of developing strategies
to counter the misuse of alcohol.
AIDS
The number of cases of AIDS reported in
Britain continues to rise: by the end of June
1992 the cumulative total of reported cases of
AIDS was 6,111, of whom 3,813 (62 per cent)
had died; the cumulative total of recognised
HIV infections was 17,770. Recent statistics
show a steady increase in the number of
AIDS cases among injecting drug users and
people infected through heterosexual
intercourse.
The Government Strategy
The Government has a comprehensive
strategy to control the spread of HIV in
Britain, and to provide diagnostic and
treatment facilities and counselling and
support services for those infected or at risk.
The five main elements are:
• to limit the spread of HIV infection
through public awareness campaigns,
community-based prevention initiatives,
and improved infection control
procedures;
• to improve understanding of the nature
of HIV infection, how it is transmitted,
and how HIV-related illness can be
prevented and treated;
• to provide appropriate diagnostic
treatment, care and support services for
those affected by HIV;
• to encourage understanding and
compassion, discourage discrimination
and safeguard confidentiality, within the
wider context of public health
requirements; and
• to foster exchange of information
between countries, and to persuade
against coercive and discriminatory
measures.
Public Education Campaigns
The first major public education campaign
on AIDS was launched in 1987, aimed at
increasing awareness and knowledge and
encouraging changes in behaviour.
Campaigns are now administered by the
Health Education Authority (see p 131),
using the mass media and supporting
educational work aimed at the general public
and specific sections of the population. A
National AIDS helpline was established in
support of the AIDS public education
campaign, operating 24 hours a day. By the
end of 1992-93 the Government will have
allocated over £73 million to this work.
National campaigns are supplemented by
local HIV prevention initiatives run by
health and local authorities and the
voluntary sector. Extra funds have been
allocated for this work, which is led by
district prevention co-ordinators. The
Government continues to spend more on
HIV/AIDS health education than on any
other single health education programme.
A priority in 1992-93 is to ensure that
health education messages reach people from
129
BRITAIN 1993: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
black and other ethnic minority groups more
effectively, and that access to services is
improved.
Funding for Services
The Government continues to make
additional funding available to health
authorities and local authorities for treatment
and advisory services, needle exchange
schemes for drug misusers (see p 127) and
training staff. In 1992-93, £181-5 million is
being provided to health authorities and
£15-3 million to local authorities towards the
costs of providing HIV-related services.
Government grants of £76 million have been
allocated to the Macfarlane Trust to help
haemophiliacs in Britain who have become
infected with HIV as a result of treatment
with infected blood products. Anonymous
and voluntary named screening tests for HIV
began in 1990. The first results of
anonymised testing carried out in sexually
transmitted disease clinics and in antenatal
clinics indicated a high incidence of HIV in
the London area. In response to this the
Government has set up an AIDS Action
Group to look at, among other things, ways
of improving prevention work and access to
services for particular groups.
Research
The Medical Research Council’s (MRC)
AIDS-directed programme was founded in
1987 to develop a vaccine against HIV and
drugs to treat people infected with the virus.
Government funding for the MRC’s work
will have amounted to £66 million by the
end of 1992-93.
A new drug, zidovudine—Retrovir
(AZT)—which prolongs survival in patients
with AIDS and may delay disease progression
in people infected with HIV, was developed
by a British pharmaceutical company. The
drug was licensed for use in HIV-infected
individuals in 1987.
Voluntary Agencies
A number of voluntary agencies receive
financial support from the Government
(almost £2 million in 1992-93). Among them,
the Terrence Higgins Trust, London
Lighthouse and the Scottish AIDS Monitor
promote knowledge about the disease and
help people with AIDS and HIV. Both
London Lighthouse and the Mildmay
Mission Hospital, in London, provide hospice
care and community support.
International Co-operation
Britain gives high priority to international
efforts to reduce the spread of HIV and
AIDS. The Government fully supports the
work of the World Health Organisation
(WHO) in co-ordinating international action,
and has committed £26 million to the
WHO’s Global Programme on AIDS, which
is helping developing countries to establish
and develop national AIDS control
programmes. Britain has also pledged £8-2
million in support of WHO-co-ordinated
national programmes in Commonwealth
African and Asian countries and in Britain’s
Caribbean Dependent Territories.
Other assistance includes a grant of nearly
£3 million over six years to the International
Planned Parenthood Federation for AIDS-
related activities; and some £3 million for
research into the demographic, behavioural,
social and economic aspects of AIDS in the
developing world. Assistance amounting to
nearly £1 million has also been provided
under a joint funding scheme to British-based
non-governmental organisations for small
AIDS-related projects in developing
countries.
Infectious Diseases
District health authorities (health boards in
Scotland) carry out programmes of
immunisation against diphtheria, measles,
mumps, rubella, poliomyelitis, tetanus,
tuberculosis and whooping cough. A new
combined vaccine against measles, mumps
and rubella introduced in 1988 replaced that
for measles for children in the second year of
life. A new vaccine, ‘Hib’, was introduced in
October 1992, offering protection against
invasive haemophilus disease, a major cause
of meningitis in children under five years.
130
SOCIAL WELFARE
Immunisation is voluntary, but parents are
encouraged to protect their children. The
proportion of children being vaccinated has
been increasing since the end of 1978. In
1990 the Government introduced special
payments to GPs who achieve targets of 70
and 90 per cent uptake of child
immunisation. The response to these targets
has been encouraging in many areas and the
Government estimates that 90 per cent of
GPs now earn bonus payments for meeting
such targets.
The Public Health Laboratory Service
provides a network of bacteriological and
virological laboratories throughout England
and Wales which conduct research and assist
in the diagnosis, prevention and control of
communicable diseases. Microbiological work
in Scotland and Northern Ireland is carried
out mainly in hospital laboratories.
Cancer Screening
Breast cancer accounts for some 13,000
deaths in England each year. To help combat
this, the Government has set up a breast
cancer screening service for all women aged
between 50 and 64. The aim of the
programme is to reduce breast cancer deaths
among women invited for screening by 25
per cent by the year 2000. All eligible
women in England and Wales should have
been invited for mammography screening by
March 1993 (and in Scotland and Northern
Ireland by 1994).
About 1,700 women die each year in
England from cancer of the cervix. The
cervical screening programme aims to reduce
such deaths by inviting women at risk to be
screened regularly. All district health
authorities in England have computerised
call and recall systems, which enable all
women aged between 20 and 64 to be invited
regularly for cervical cancer screening.
Similar arrangements apply in Wales,
Scotland and Northern Ireland. Special
payments are made to GPs who achieve
uptake targets of 50 and 80 per cent.
Health Education
In England health education is promoted by
the Health Education Authority, a part of the
NHS with the major executive responsibility
for public education in Britain about AIDS
(see p 129). In addition, in England the
Authority’s functions are to:
• advise the Government on health
education;
• plan and carry out health education
programmes in co-operation with health
authorities and other bodies; and
• sponsor research and evaluation.
It also assists in the provision of training,
and provides a national centre of information
and advice on health education. Major
campaigns carried out by the Authority
include those that focus on coronary heart
disease (represented by the Look After Your
Heart initiative), smoking and alcohol misuse.
The Government has allocated some £34
million to the Authority for health education
in England for 1992-93.
In Wales health education is undertaken
by the Welsh Health Promotion Authority.
The Health Education Board for Scotland
and the Northern Ireland Health Promotion
Agency are responsible for health education
in their areas.
Almost all health authorities have their
own health education service, which works
closely with health professionals, health
visitors, community groups, local employers
and others to determine the most suitable
local programmes. Increased resources in the
health service are being directed towards
health education and preventive measures.
Healthier Eating
There has been growing public awareness in
recent years of the importance of a healthy
diet. Following recommendations issued by
the Committee on Medical Aspects of Food
Policy (COMA), the Government has advised
people to reduce their intake of fats,
particularly saturated fats, sugar and salt,
since this could help to reduce the possibility
of cardiovascular disease.
Nutritional labelling indicating the energy,
fat, protein and carbohydrate content of food
is being encouraged on a voluntary basis.
131
BRITAIN 1993: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Some supermarket chains have already
introduced voluntary labelling schemes.
To help people reduce their fat intake,
the Government has issued guidelines on the
labelling of food to show nutrient content in
a standard format.
Current work by COMA includes a
review of the relationship between diet and
cardiovascular disease; and matters relating
to the nutrition of infants, children and the
elderly. In 1989 the Committee issued a
report on the role of dietary sugars in
human disease and on the diets of
schoolchildren. In 1991 it published a major
report containing comprehensive information
on recommended personal intakes of food
energy and nutrients.
The four health promotion departments
in Britain have all run public information
campaigns promoting healthy eating.
ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH
Environmental health officers employed by
local authorities are responsible for the
control of air pollution and noise, and food
hygiene and safety. Their duties also cover
the occupational health and safety aspects of
a variety of premises, including offices and
shops; the investigation of unfit housing;
and in some instances refuse collection and
home safety. Doctors who specialise in
community medicine and are employed by
the health authorities advise local authorities
on the medical aspects of environmental
health, infectious diseases and food
poisoning. They may also co-operate with
the authorities responsible for water supply
and sewerage. Environmental health officers
at ports and airports carry out duties
concerned with shipping, inspection of
imported foods and disease control. In
Northern Ireland district councils are
responsible for noise control; collection and
disposal of refuse; clean air; and food
composition, labelling and hygiene.
Safety of Food
It is illegal to supply food unfit for human
consumption or to apply any treatment or
process to food which makes it harmful to
health. Places where food or drink is
prepared, handled, stored or sold must
conform to certain hygiene standards.
Environmental health officers may take for
examination samples of any food on sale or
being distributed. Special regulations control
the safety of particular foods such as milk,
meat, ice-cream and shellfish. The Food
Safety Directorate was established within the
Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food
in 1989, to maintain the safety and quality of
Britain’s food supplies. The Directorate
works closely with the Department of Health,
which is responsible for the public health
aspects of food safety. A consumer panel
gives consumers a direct means of conveying
their views on food safety and consumer
protection issues to the Government.
Expert committees advise the Government
on microbiological and chemical food safety,
novel foods and processes, and veterinary
products. The independent Advisory
Committee on the Microbiological Safety of
Food, for example, assesses the risks to
human health from micro-organisms in food
and drink and recommends action where
appropriate.
The Food Safety Act 1990 emphasises
food safety and consumer protection
throughout the food chain. The Act applies
to England, Wales and Scotland, introducing
more effective powers and greatly increased
penalties for offenders. Food companies must
show that they have taken all reasonable
precautions in manufacture, transport, storage
and preparation. Special regulations govern
the temperatures at which foods such as
cooked meats should be stored. Separate, but
similar, legislation exists in Northern Ireland.
SAFETY OF MEDICINES
The health and agriculture ministers are
responsible for the licensing of medicines for
human and veterinary use. The Medicines
Commission advises the ministers on policy.
The Committees on Safety of Medicines and
on Dental and Surgical Materials and on the
Review of Medicines advise on the safety and
quality of medicinal products for human use.
Both Committees also monitor adverse
reactions to drugs. Legislation also controls
132
SOCIAL WELFARE
the advertising, labelling, packaging, distribu¬
tion, sale and supply of medicinal products.
RESEARCH
In 1991-92 the Department of Health in
England spent about ^22-3 million on health
research, in addition to expenditure by the
Medical Research Council (the main
government agency for the support of
biomedical and clinical research—see
Chapter 21). Priority areas include research
into AIDS, primary health care, community
care and child care, the NHS and personal
social services staffing, public health and the
NHS acute sector. Future priorities will take
account of the Health of the Nation White
Paper (see p 117).
For England and Wales the Director of
Research and Development at the
Department of Health advises ministers on all
aspects of health research. In Scotland the
directly funded programme is administered
by the Chief Scientist of the Scottish Office
Home and Health Department.
The strategy for the NHS research and
development programme aims to ensure that
health service care is based on high-quality
research relevant to improving the health of
the nation. The programme is managed by
the regional health authorities, which are
developing their own research plans. It is
intended that up to F5 per cent of NHS
expenditure will be used for research and
development by 1997.
The Department of Health is involved in
international research and development, and
takes part in the European Community’s
medical and public health research
programme.
THE HEALTH PROFESSIONS
Doctors and Dentists
Only people on the medical or dentists’
registers may practise as doctors or dentists in
the NHS. University medical and dental
schools are responsible for teaching; the NHS
provides hospital facilities for training. Full
registration as a doctor requires five or six
years’ training in a medical school and
hospital, with a further year’s experience in a
hospital. For a dentist, five years’ training at
a dental school is required. The regulating
body for the medical profession is the
General Medical Council and for dentists, the
General Dental Council. The main
professional associations are the British
Medical Association and the British Dental
Association.
Nurses
The minimum period of training required to
qualify for registration as a first level nurse in
general or mental health, mental handicap, or
children’s nursing is normally three years.
Midwifery training for registered general
nurses takes 18 months, and for other student
midwives three years. Health visitors are
registered general nurses who have completed
a one-year course in health visiting. District
nurses are registered general nurses who
practise within the community. They must
complete a six-month course followed by a
period of supervised practice in district
nursing.
Project 2000 is a scheme to reform the
education of nurses, designed to make
training more attractive and to give nurses a
broader based education, enabling them to
work in hospitals or the community without
extensive further training. In 1992-93 the
Government is allocating £98 million to fund
the scheme in England, where a total of 64
colleges now offer Project 2000 courses;
comparable arrangements are being made in
other parts of Britain.
The United Kingdom Central Council for
Nursing, Midwifery and Health Visiting is
responsible for regulating and registering
these professions.
Pharmacists
Pharmacists in general practice and in
hospital must be registered with the Royal
Pharmaceutical Society of Great Britain or
the Pharmaceutical Society of Northern
Ireland. A three-year degree course
approved by the Society followed by a year’s
approved training is necessary before
registration. Most medicines can be supplied
133
BRITAIN 1993: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
to customers only by, or under the
supervision of, a registered pharmacist.
Opticians
The General Optical Council regulates the
professions of ophthalmic optician and
dispensing optician. Only registered
ophthalmic opticians (or registered
ophthalmic medical practitioners) may test
sight. Training of ophthalmic opticians takes
four years, including a year of practical
experience under supervision. Dispensing
opticians take a two-year full-time course
with a year’s practical experience or follow a
part-time day-release course while employed
with an optician.
Other
State registration may also be obtained by
chiropodists, dietitians, medical laboratory
scientific officers, occupational therapists,
orthoptists, physiotherapists and
radiographers. The governing bodies are
seven boards, corresponding to the
professions, under the general supervision of
the Council for Professions Supplementary to
Medicine. Training lasts one to four years
and only those who are state registered may
be employed in the NHS and some other
public services.
Dental therapists (who have taken a two-
year training course) and dental hygienists
(with a training course of about a year) may
carry out some simple dental work under the
supervision of a registered dentist.
In 1990 a new group of NHS staff—health
care assistants—began work in hospitals and
the community. They are intended to support
the work of more highly qualified staff.
ARRANGEMENTS WITH OTHER
COUNTRIES
The member states of the European
Community have special health arrangements
under which Community nationals resident in
a member state are entitled to receive
emergency treatment, either free or at a
reduced cost, during visits to other
Community countries. There are also
arrangements to cover people who go to work
or live in other Community countries. In
addition, there are reciprocal arrangements
with some other countries under which
medical treatment is available to visitors if
required immediately. Visitors are generally
expected to pay if the purpose of their visit is
to seek medical treatment. Visitors who are
not covered by reciprocal arrangements must
pay for any medical treatment they receive.
Personal Social Services
Personal social services assist elderly people,
disabled people and their carers, children and
young people, and families. Major services
include skilled residential and day care, help
for people confined to their homes and the
various forms of social work. The statutory
services are provided by local government
social services authorities in England and
Wales, social work departments in Scotland
and health and social services boards in
Northern Ireland. Alongside these providers
are the many and varied contributions made
by independent voluntary services. Much of
the care given to elderly and disabled people
is provided by families and self-help groups.
Demand for these services is rising
because of the increasing number of elderly
people and because groups such as the
elderly, the disabled, and mentally ill people,
or those with learning disabilities, can lead
more normal lives in the community, given
suitable support and facilities. The share of
health authority resources devoted to
community care services increased from 8-4
per cent in 1978-79 to just over 13 per cent
in 1990-91.
Management Reforms
New policies on community care in England,
Wales and Scotland are being implemented in
stages under the NHS and Community Care
Act 1990. Many of the procedures which
local authorities will be implementing
correspond to similar procedures being
introduced in the NHS. Local authorities
will increasingly act as enablers and
commissioners of services on an assessment of
their populations’ needs for social care.

SOCIAL WELFARE
• Since April 1991 inspection units have
been responsible for inspecting local
authority as well as independent
residential care homes.
• Since April 1991 local authorities have
had to have procedures for dealing with
complaints about their social services.
• Since April 1992 local authorities have
been obliged to produce community care
plans after wide consultation with the
NHS and other interests.
• In April 1993 new procedures for
assessing individuals’ care needs and
commissioning services to meet them will
be introduced.
Local authorities will then become
responsible for funding and arranging social
care in the community. This will include the
provision of home helps or home care
assistants to support people in their own
homes, and making arrangements for
residential and nursing home care for those
no longer able to remain in their own homes.
Elderly People
Between 1978—79 and 1989—90 total spending
on health services for elderly people increased
by 43 per cent and net spending on social
services by 48 per cent in real terms. (About
5 per cent of those aged 65 or over live in
residential homes.)
Services for elderly people are designed to
help them live at home whenever possible.
These services may include advice and help
given by social workers, domestic help, the
provision of meals in the home, sitters-in,
night attendants and laundry services as well
as day centres, lunch clubs and recreational
facilities. Adaptations to the home can
overcome a person’s difficulties in moving
about, and a wide range of aids is available
for people with difficulties affecting their
hearing or eyesight. Alarm systems have been
developed to help elderly people obtain
assistance in an emergency. In some areas
‘good neighbour’ and visiting services are
arranged by the local authority or a voluntary
organisation.
Many local authorities provide free or
subsidised travel for elderly people within
their areas. Social services authorities also
provide residential home care for the elderly
and those in poor health, and register and
inspect homes run by voluntary organisations
or privately.
As part of their responsibility for public
housing, local authorities provide homes
designed for elderly people; some of these
developments have resident wardens. Housing
associations and private builders also build
such accommodation.
Disabled People
Britain has an estimated 6 million adults with
one or more disabilities, of whom around
400,000 (7 per cent) live in communal
establishments. Over the past ten years there
has been increasing emphasis on rehabilitation
and on the provision of day, domiciliary and
respite support services to enable disabled
people to live independently in the community
wherever possible.
Local social services authorities help with
social rehabilitation and adjustment to
disability. They are required to identify the
number of disabled people in their area and to
publicise services, which may include advice
on personal and social problems arising from
disability, as well as occupational, educational,
social and recreational facilities, either at day
centres or elsewhere. Other services provided
may include adaptations to homes (such as
ramps for wheelchairs, and ground-floor
toilets); the delivery of cooked meals; and help
in the home. In cases of special need, help
may be given with installing a telephone or a
television. Local authorities and voluntary
organisations may provide severely disabled
people with residential accommodation or
temporary facilities to allow their carers relief
from their duties. Specially designed housing
may be available for those able to look after
themselves.
Some authorities provide free or subsidised
travel for disabled people on public transport,
and they are encouraged to provide special
means of access to public buildings. Special
government regulations cover the provision of
access for disabled people in the construction
of new buildings.
The Independent Living Fund was set up
135
BRITAIN 1993: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
in 1988 to provide financial help to very
severely disabled people who need paid
domestic support to enable them to live in
their own homes. During 1991-92 nearly
15,000 people received help from the Fund.
The Fund, for which the Government is
providing £77 million in 1992—93, will run
until April 1993. After then people needing
such help will be catered for under the
mainstream arrangements for community
care.
In 1991 the Government committed
£3 million for a pilot scheme—the national
disability information project—designed to
improve information services for disabled
people and their carers.
People with Learning Disabilities
(Mental Handicap)
The Government’s policy is to encourage the
development of local services for people with
learning disabilities and their families through
co-operation between health and local
authorities and voluntary and other
organisations.
Local authority social service departments
are the main statutory agency for planning
and arranging services for people with
learning disabilities. They provide such
services as short-term care, support for
families in their own homes, residential
accommodation and various types of day care.
The main aims of the services are to ensure
that as far as possible people with learning
disabilities can lead full lives in their
communities and that no one is admitted to
hospital unless it is necessary on health
grounds.
The NHS provides alternative services
where the general health needs of people with
learning difficulties cannot be met by
ordinary NHS services, and residential care
for those with severe disabilities or whose
needs can only effectively be met by the
NHS.
Mentally 111 People
Government policy aims to ensure that
people with mental illnesses should have
access to all the services they need as locally
as possible. These services should be based
on a comprehensive network of health and
social services facilities in each district. They
should be community based and easily
accessible.
In England between 1981 and 1991:
• the number of community psychiatric
nurses more than trebled (to 3,600);
and
• places in day hospitals increased by 75
per cent (to 22,700);
Between 1979 and 1991:
• places in local authority residential homes
grew by over 25 per cent (to 4,500); and
• local authority day centre places more
than doubled to 15,100.
Arrangements made by social services
authorities for providing preventive care and
after care for mentally ill people in the
community include day centres, social centres
and residential care. Social workers help
patients and their families with problems
caused by mental illness. In some cases they
can apply for a mentally disordered person to
be compulsorily admitted to and detained in
hospital. The Mental Health Act Commission
aims to provide improved safeguards for such
patients. Similar arrangements apply in
Scotland and Northern Ireland.
Since April 1991 district health authorities
(health boards in Scotland) have been
required to plan individual health and social
care programmes for all patients leaving
hospital and for all new patients accepted by
the specialist psychiatric services. Other
measures include a review of public funding
of voluntary organisations concerned with
mental health and a new grant (£31 4 million
for 1992-93) to local authorities to encourage
them to increase the level of social care
available to mentally ill patients. A review of
mental health nursing was announced in
April 1992. A review of health and social
services for mentally disordered offenders was
completed in July 1992.
There are many voluntary organisations
concerned with mental illness and learning
disabilities, and these play an important role
in the provision of services for both of these
groups of people.
136
SOCIAL WELFARE
Help to Families
The Government believes in the central
importance of the family to the well-being of
society and considers that stable adult
relationships are needed to support and
enhance family life. Social services
authorities, through their own social workers
and others, give help to families facing special
problems. This includes services for children
at risk of injury or neglect who need care
away from their own families, and support for
family carers who look after elderly and other
family members in order to give them relief
from their duties. They also help single
parents. There are now many refuges run by
local authorities or voluntary organisations for
women, often with young children, whose
home conditions have become intolerable.
The refuges provide short-term
accommodation and support while attempts
are made to relieve the women’s problems.
Many authorities also contribute to the cost
of social work with families (such as marriage
guidance) carried out by voluntary
organisations.
The Self-help and Families Project
provides funding for nine voluntary agencies
to assist groups of families to help
themselves.
The Government launched a three-year
initiative in 1989 to increase voluntary sector
provision in England for disadvantaged
families with children under five. With funds
of £2 million, it is enabling voluntary
organisations to research and develop day care
services, particularly for single parents and
families living in temporary accommodation.
Child Care
Day care facilities for children under five are
provided by local authorities, voluntary
agencies and privately. In allocating places in
their day nurseries and other facilities, local
authorities give priority to children with
special social or health needs. Local
authorities also register childminders, private
day nurseries and playgroups in their areas
and provide support and advice services. A
total of j£l -5 million is to be made available to
voluntary organisations over a period of three
years starting in 1992, to help the
development of out-of-school services.
The authorities can offer advice and help
to families in difficulties to promote the
welfare of children. The aim is to act at an
early stage to reduce the need to put children
into care or bring them before a court.
Child Abuse
Cases of child abuse are the joint concern of
many authorities, agencies and professions.
Local review committees provide a forum for
discussion and co-ordination and draw up
policies and procedures for handling these
cases. The Government established a central
training initiative on child abuse in 1986.
This consists of a variety of projects,
including training for health visitors, school
nurses, and local authority social services
staff. Training packs have been drawn up for
those concerned with implementing the
Children Act 1989 (see below).
In England, Wales and Northern Ireland
children under the age of 14 in child abuse
cases are able to give evidence to courts
through television links, thus sparing them
from the need to give evidence in open court.
Children in Care
Local government authorities must provide
accommodation for children in need in their
area who require it because they have no
parent or guardian, have been abandoned or
whose parents are unable to provide for
them. The local authority promotes the
welfare of the children in its care. The
number of children in the care of local
authorities continues to decline. Provisional
statistics show that:
• the total number of children in care fell
from 92,300 in 1981 to 59,800 in 1991;
• the number of children in care placed
with foster parents increased from 39 per
cent in 1981 to 57 per cent in 1991; and
• between 1990 and 1991 the number of
children in residential care fell from
12,670 to under 12,000.
Under the Children Act 1989, which came
into effect in England and Wales in 1991,
137
BRITAIN 1993: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
parents of children in care retain their
parental responsibilities but act as far as
possible as partners with the authority. There
is a new requirement to prepare a child for
leaving the local authority’s responsibility and
to continue to advise him or her up to the
age of 21. Local authorities are required to
have a complaints procedure with an
independent element to cover children in
their care.
In England and Wales a child may be
brought before a family proceedings court if
he or she is neglected or ill-treated, exposed
to moral danger, beyond the control of
parents or not attending school. The court
can commit the child to the care of a local
authority under a care order. Under the
Children Act 1989 certain preconditions have
to be satisfied to justify an order. These are
that the child is suffering or is likely to suffer
significant harm because of a lack of
reasonable parental care or is beyond parental
control. However, an order is made only if
the court is also satisfied that this will
positively contribute to the child’s well-being
and be in his or her best interests. In court
proceedings the child is entitled to separate
legal representation and the right to have a
guardian to protect his or her interests.
All courts have to treat the welfare of the
child as the paramount consideration when
reaching any decision about his or her
upbringing. The family proceedings court
consists of specially trained magistrates with
power to hear care cases as well as all other
family and children’s cases.
In Scotland children in trouble or in need
may be brought before a children’s hearing,
which can impose a supervision requirement
on a child if it thinks that compulsory
measures are appropriate. Under these
requirements most children are allowed to
remain at home under the supervision of a
social worker but some may live with foster
parents or in a residential establishment while
under supervision. Supervision requirements
are reviewed at least once a year until ended
by a children’s hearing or by the Secretary of
State. A review of child care legislation in
Scotland has been conducted and its results
are under consideration.
In Northern Ireland the court may send
children in need or in trouble to a training
school, commit them to the care of a fit
person (including a health and social services
board), or make a supervision order. Children
in trouble may be required to attend an
attendance centre or may be detained in a
remand home. New child care legislation is
being prepared in Northern Ireland. Where
appropriate it will reflect the changes
introduced in England and Wales and will
make a distinction between the treatment of
children in need of care and young offenders.
Fostering and Community Homes
When appropriate, children in care are placed
with foster parents, who receive payments to
cover living costs. Alternatively, the child
may be placed in a children’s home,
voluntary home or other suitable residential
accommodation. In Scotland local authorities
are responsible for placing children in their
care in foster homes, in local authority or
voluntary homes, or in residential schools. In
Northern Ireland there are residential homes
for children in the care of the health and
social services boards; training schools and
remand homes are administered separately.
Regulations concerning residential care and
the foster placement of children in care are
made by central government.
Adoption
Local authorities are required by law to
provide an adoption service, either directly or
by arrangement with a voluntary organisation.
Agencies may offer adoptive parents an
allowance in certain circumstances if this
would help to find a family for a child.
Adoption is strictly regulated by law, and
voluntary adoption societies must be
approved by the appropriate social services
minister. The Registrars-General keep
confidential registers of adopted children.
Adopted people may be given details of their
original birth record on reaching the age of
18, and counselling is provided to help them
understand the circumstances of their
adoption. An Adoption Contact Register
enables adopted adults and their birth parents
to be given a safe and confidential way of
138
SOCIAL WELFARE
making contact if that is the wish of both
parties. A person’s details are entered only if
they wish to be contacted.
Social Workers
The effective operation of the social services
depends largely on professionally qualified
social workers. Training courses in social
work are provided by universities,
polytechnics (in Scotland, central institutions)
and colleges of higher and further education.
The Central Council for Education and
Training in Social Work is the statutory body
responsible for promoting social work
training and offers advice to people
considering entering the profession. A
programme to introduce two-year courses
leading to a new professional qualification, the
Diploma in Social Work (DipSW), is being
implemented.
Professional social workers (including those
working in the NHS) are employed mainly by
the social services departments of local
authorities. Others work in the probation
service, the education welfare service, or in
voluntary organisations.
The Government is committed to
improving social work training. In 1992-93 it
is providing £29 million through its training
support programme to assist local authorities
to train staff; approximately 140,000 staff are
expected to benefit from training, of whom
nearly half work in residential care.
Voluntary Social Services
There is a long tradition in Britain of
voluntary service to the community, and the
partnership between the voluntary and
statutory sectors is encouraged by the
Government. It has been estimated that about
half of all adults take part in some form of
voluntary work during the course of a year.
Local and health authorities plan and carry
out their duties taking account of the work of
voluntary organisations. Voluntary provision
enables these authorities to continue the trend
towards local community care rather than
institutional care for elderly and for mentally
ill people and those with learning disabilities.
Funding voluntary organisations also provides
opportunities to try out new approaches to
services which, if successful, can be included
in mainstream statutory provision.
Various government schemes assist almost
3,000 local voluntary projects to enable
unemployed volunteers to help disadvantaged
groups in the community. Voluntary
organisations also take part in several other
government schemes, including Employment
Training and Youth Training.
Co-ordination of government interests in
the voluntary sector throughout Britain is the
responsibility of the Home Office Voluntary
Services Unit.
Voluntary Organisations
Funding
Voluntary organisations receive income from
several sources, including contributions from
individuals, businesses and trusts, central and
local government grants, and earnings from
commercial activities and investments. They
also receive fees (from central and local
government) for those services which are
provided on a contractual basis. Some 500
bodies receive government grants. Tax
changes in recent budgets have helped the
voluntary sector secure more funds from
industry and individuals. The Gift Aid
scheme introduced in 1990, for example,
provides tax relief on gifts of more than £400
in any one year. By the end of 1991 charities
had received donations of more than £150
million under the scheme and had claimed
tax repayments of £50 million on them.
Employees can now make tax-free
donations to charity from their earnings. The
Payroll Giving Scheme provides tax relief on
donations of up to £50 a month (£600 a year).
Voluntary organisations benefit not only from
direct donations from the private sector but
also from gifts of goods, sponsorship,
secondments and joint promotions.
Charities
Over 170,000 voluntary organisations are
registered as charities. In England and Wales
the Charity Commission gives advice to
trustees of charities on their administration.
139
BRITAIN 1993: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
The Commission also maintains a register of
charities. Organisations may qualify for
charitable status if they are established for
purposes such as the relief of poverty, the
advancement of education or religion or the
promotion of certain other purposes of public
benefit. These include good community
relations, the prevention of racial
discrimination, the protection of health and
the promotion of equal opportunity.
Legislation was passed in 1992 to strengthen
the Charity Commissioners’ powers of
investigation and supervision and increase the
public accountability of charities.
The Charities Aid Foundation, an
independent body, is one of the main
organisations that aid the flow of funds to
charity from individuals, companies and
grant-making trusts.
Co-ordinating Bodies
The National Council for Voluntary
Organisations is the main co-ordinating body
in England, providing central links between
voluntary organisations, official bodies and
the private sector; around 600 national
voluntary organisations are members. It also
protects the interests and independence of
voluntary agencies, and provides them with
advice, information and other services.
Councils in Scotland, Wales and Northern
Ireland perform similar functions. The
National Association for Councils for
Voluntary Service is another network
providing resources, with over 200 local
councils for voluntary service throughout
England encouraging the development of local
voluntary action, mainly in urban areas. The
rural equivalent is Action with Rural
Communities in England, representing 38
rural community councils.
Types of Voluntary Organisations
There are thousands of voluntary
organisations concerned with health and social
welfare, ranging from national bodies to small
local groups. ‘Self-help’ groups have been the
fastest expanding area over the last 20 or so
years—examples include bodies which provide
playgroups for pre-school children, or help
their members to cope with a particular
disability. Groups representing ethnic
minorities and women’s interests have also
developed in recent years. Many organisations
belong to larger associations or are
represented on local or national co-ordinating
councils or committees. Some are chiefly
concerned with giving personal service, others
with influencing public opinion and
exchanging information. Some perform both
functions. They may be staffed by both
professional and voluntary workers.
Personal and Family Problems
Specialist voluntary organisations concerned
with personal and family problems include
family casework agencies such as the Family
Welfare Association, Family Service Units
and the National Society for the Prevention
of Cruelty to Children. They also include
marriage guidance centres affiliated to Relate:
National Marriage Guidance; Child Care (the
National Council of Voluntary Child Care
Organisations); the National Council for One
Parent Families; Child Poverty Action
Group, and the Claimants’ Union, which
provides advice on social security benefits;
and the Samaritans, which helps lonely,
depressed and suicidal people.
Health and Disability
Voluntary service to both sick and disabled
people is given by—among others—the
British Red Cross Society, St John
Ambulance, the Women’s Royal Voluntary
Service and the National Association of
Leagues of Hospital Friends. Societies which
help people with disabilities and difficulties
include the Royal National Institute for the
Blind, the Royal National Institute for the
Deaf, the Royal Association for Disability and
Rehabilitation, the Disabled Living
Foundation, the Disablement Income Group,
MIND (National Association for Mental
Health), MENCAP (Royal Society for
Mentally Handicapped Children and Adults),
the Spastics Society, Alcoholics Anonymous,
Age Concern, Help the Aged, and their
equivalents in Wales, Scotland and Northern
Ireland.
140
SOCIAL WELFARE
Other Organisations
National organisations whose work is religious
in inspiration include the Salvation Army, the
Church Army, Toe H, the Board of Social
Responsibility of the Church of Scotland, the
Church of England Children’s Society, the
Church of England Council for Social Aid,
the Young Men’s Christian Association, the
Young Women’s Christian Association, the
Catholic Marriage Advisory Council, the
Jewish Welfare Board and the Church’s
Urban Fund.
Community service of many kinds is given
by young people, often through organisations
such as Community Service Volunteers,
Scouts and Girl Guides, and the ‘Time for
God’ scheme run by a group of churches.
A wide range of voluntary personal
services is given by the Women’s Royal
Voluntary Service. These include bringing
‘meals on wheels’ to housebound invalids and
old people, providing residential clubs for the
elderly, help with family problems, and
assistance in hospitals and during
emergencies.
Over 1,300 Citizens Advice Bureaux
advise people on their social and legal
rights. Some areas have law centres
and housing advisory centres.
The Volunteer Centre UK provides
information and research on voluntary work.
Its Scottish counterpart is Volunteer
Development Scotland, and in Northern
Ireland the Volunteer Development
Resource Unit performs a similar function.
There are many local volunteer bureaux,
some part-time, which direct volunteers to
opportunities in both the voluntary and
statutory sectors.
Social Security
Nearly a third of government expenditure is
devoted to the social security programme,
which provides financial help for people who
are elderly, sick, disabled, unemployed,
widowed, bringing up children or on very low
incomes.
Some benefits depend on the payment of
contributions by employers, employees and
self-employed people to the National
Insurance Fund, from which benefits are
paid. The Government also contributes to the
Fund. The other social security benefits are
non-contributory and are financed from
general taxation; some of these are income-
related. Appeals about claims for benefits are
decided by independent tribunals.
Administration
Administration in Great Britain is handled by
three executive agencies of the Department of
Social Security:
• the Benefits Agency, responsible for
paying the majority of social security
benefits;
• the National Insurance Contributions
Agency, responsible for handling
National Insurance contributions; and
• the Information Technology Services
Agency, responsible for computerising
the administration of social security—
once completed there will be 20,000
terminals in over 500 locations. This will
enable service to the public to be
improved.
The housing and community charge
benefit schemes are administered mainly by
local government authorities, which recover
most of the cost from the Government. In
Northern Ireland social security benefits are
administered by the Social Security Agency.
Advice about Benefits
The demand for advice about benefits is
partly met by the Freeline Social Security
Service, which handles over 1 million calls
each year. A complementary service, the
Social Security Advice Line for Employers,
handles some 2,500 calls a week. The Ethnic
Freeline Service provides information on
social security in Urdu, Punjabi and Chinese.
CONTRIBUTIONS
Entitlement to National Insurance benefits
such as retirement pension, sickness and
invalidity benefit, unemployment benefit,
141
BRITAIN 1993: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
maternity allowance and widow’s benefit, is
dependent upon the payment of contribu¬
tions. There are four classes of contributions:
• Class 1 contributions are related to
earnings subject to an upper limit and are
paid by employees and employers. The
contribution is lower if the employer
operates a ‘contracted-out’ occupational
pension scheme (see below).
• Self-employed people pay a flat rate
Class 2 contribution and may have to pay
a Class 4 contribution, which is assessed
as a percentage of profits or gains within
certain limits; they are not eligible for
unemployment and industrial injuries
benefits.
• Voluntary Class 3 contributions are made
by people wanting to safeguard rights to
some benefits.
Employees who work after pensionable age
(60 for women and 65 for men) do not pay
contributions but the employer continues to
be liable. People earning less than a certain
amount do not pay contributions; neither do
their employers. Self-employed people with
earnings below a set amount may apply for
exemption; those over pensionable age do not
pay contributions.
BENEFITS
For most benefits there are two contribution
conditions. First, before benefit can be paid
at all, a certain number of contributions have
to be paid. Secondly, the full rate of benefit
cannot be paid unless contributions have been
made up to a specific level over a set period.
Benefits are increased annually in line with
percentage increases in retail prices. The
main benefits (payable weekly) are
summarised below. The rates given are those
effective from April 1992 until April 1993.
Retirement Pension
A state retirement pension is payable, on
making a claim, to women at the age of 60
and men at the age of 65. The Sex
Discrimination Act 1986 protects employees
of different sexes in a particular occupation
from being required to retire at different
ages. This, however, has not affected the
payment of state retirement pensions at
different ages for men and women. The
Government is committed to the
equalisation of the state pension age for men
and women and in 1991 published a
discussion document setting out some of the
issues involved.
The state pension scheme consists of a
basic weekly pension of ^54-15 for a single
person and £86-70 for a married couple,
together with an additional earnings-related
pension. Pensioners may have unlimited
earnings without affecting their pensions.
Those who have put off their retirement
during the five years after state pension age
may earn extra pension. A non-contributory
retirement pension of £32-55 a week is
payable to people over the age of 80 who
meet certain residence conditions, and who
have not qualified for a contributory
pension. People whose pensions do not give
them enough to live on may be entitled to
income support ranging from £14-70 to
£20-75 a week for a single person and
£22-35 to £29-55 a week for a couple.
Nearly 10 million people in Great Britain
received a basic state pension in 1991.
Rights to basic pensions are safeguarded
for mothers who are away from paid
employment looking after children or for
people giving up paid employment to care
for severely disabled relatives. Men and
women may receive the same basic pension,
provided they have paid full-rate National
Insurance contributions when working.
From the year 2000 the earnings-related
pension scheme will be based on a lifetime s
revalued earnings instead of on the best 20
years. It will be calculated as 20 per cent
rather than 25 per cent of earnings, to be
phased in over ten years from the year 2000.
The pensions of people retiring this century
will be unaffected.
Occupational and Personal Pensions
Employers are free to ‘contract out’ their
employees from the state scheme for the
additional earnings-related pension and to
provide their own occupational pension
instead. Their pension must be at least as

good as the state additional pension. The
State remains responsible for the basic pension.
Occupational pension schemes cover about
half the working population and have over 11
million members. The occupational pension
rights of those who change jobs before
pensionable age, who are unable or who do
not want to transfer their pension rights, are
now protected against inflation up to a
maximum of 5 per cent. Workers leaving a
scheme have the right to a fair transfer value.
The trustees or managers of pension schemes
have to provide full information about their
schemes.
As an alternative to occupational pension
schemes or the state additional earnings-
related pension, people are entitled to choose
a personal pension available from a bank,
building society, insurance company or other
financial institution. By June 1992 over
4-8 million people had taken out personal
pensions. A review of occupational pension
law is in progress.
A Pensions Ombudsman deals with
complaints about maladministration of
pension schemes and adjudicates on disputes
of fact or law. A pensions registry has been
established to help people trace lost benefits.
Mothers and Children
Most pregnant working women can receive
their statutory maternity pay directly from
their employer. Statutory maternity pay is
normally paid for a maximum of 18 weeks.
There are two rates: where a woman has been
working for the same employer for at least
two years, she is entitled to 90 per cent of
her average weekly earnings for the first six
weeks and to the lower rate of £46-30 a week
for the remaining 12 weeks; where a woman
has been employed for between 26 weeks and
two years, she is entitled to payments for up
to 18 weeks at the lower rate.
Women who are not eligible for statutory
maternity pay because, for example, they are
self-employed, have recently changed jobs or
given up their job, may qualify for a weekly
maternity allowance of £42-45, which is
payable for up to 18 weeks.
143
BRITAIN 1993: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
A payment of £100 from the social fund
(see p 146), may be available if the mother or
her partner are receiving income support,
family credit or disability working allowance.
It is also available if a woman adopts a baby.
Non-contributory child benefit of £9-65
for the eldest and £7 80 weekly for each
other child is the general social security
benefit for children. Tax-free and normally
paid to the mother, it is payable for children
up to the age of 16 and for those up to 19 if
they continue in full-time non-advanced
education. In addition, one-parent benefit of
£5-85 a week is payable to certain people
bringing up one child or more on their own,
whether as their parents or not. A non¬
contributory guardian’s allowance of £10-85 a
week for an orphaned child is payable to a
person who is entitled to child benefit for
that child. This is reduced to £9 75 if the
higher rate of child benefit is payable for the
child. In exceptional circumstances a
guardian’s allowance can be paid on the death
of only one parent.
Child Support Agency
At present fewer than one-third of lone
parents receive regular maintenance payments
for their children. As part of a more general
review of family justice matters, the
Government is to establish a Child Support
Agency which will take over from the courts
the main responsibility for obtaining main¬
tenance for children. The Agency will trace
absent parents and collect and enforce child
maintenance payments. Assessments will be
made using a formula which will take into
account the numbers and ages of the children
and the financial circumstances of all parties.
The Agency will start work in April 1993.
Widows
Widows under the age of 60, or those over 60
whose husbands were not entitled to a state
retirement pension when they died, receive a
tax-free single payment of £1,000 following
the death of their husbands, provided that
their husbands had paid a minimum number
of National Insurance contributions. Women
whose husbands have died of an industrial
injury or disease may also qualify, regardless
of whether their husbands had paid National
Insurance contributions. A widowed mother
with a young family receives a widowed
mother’s allowance of £54-15 a week with a
further £9-75 for the first child and £10-85
for each subsequent child. A widow’s basic
pension of £54-15 a week is payable to a
widow who is 55 years or over when her
husband dies or when her entitlement to
widowed mother’s allowance ends. A
percentage of the full rate is payable to
widows who are aged between 45 and 54
when their husbands die or when their
entitlement to widowed mother’s allowance
ends. Special rules apply for widows whose
husbands died before 11 April 1988. Payment
continues until the widow remarries or begins
drawing retirement pension. Widows also
benefit under the industrial injuries scheme.
A man whose wife dies when both are
over pension age inherits his wife’s pension
rights just as a widow inherits her husband’s
rights.
Sick and Disabled People
Statutory Sick Pay and Sickness Benefit
There is a large variety of benefits for people
unable to work because of sickness or
disablement. Employers are responsible for
paying statutory sick pay to employees for up
to a maximum of 28 weeks. There are two
weekly rates—£45 30 or £52-50 depending
on average weekly earnings. Employees who
are not entitled to statutory sick pay can
claim weekly state sickness benefit of £41-20
instead, as can self-employed people. Sickness
benefit is payable for up to 28 weeks.
Invalidity Pension and Allowance
A weekly invalidity pension of £54-15 with
additions of £32-55 for an adult dependant
and £9-75 for the eldest child and £10-85 for
each other child is payable when statutory
sick pay or sickness benefit ends, for the
period to count towards receiving invalidity
pension the contribution condition for
sickness benefit must be satisfied. An
invalidity allowance of up to £11-55 a week,
144
SOCIAL WELFARE
depending on the age when incapacity
began, may be paid, but this is offset by any
entitlement to an additional invalidity
pension.
Severe Disablement Allowance
A severe disablement allowance of £32-55
plus an age related addition of up to £11-55
may be payable to people under pensionable
age who are unable to work and do not
qualify for the National Insurance invalidity
pension because they have not paid sufficient
contributions. Additions for adult dependants
and for children can also be paid.
Industrial Injuries Benefits
Various benefits are payable for disablement
caused by an accident at work or a prescribed
disease. The main benefit is industrial injuries
disablement benefit; disablement benefit of up
to £88-40 a week is usually paid after a
qualifying period of 15 weeks if a person is
physically or mentally disabled as a result of
an industrial accident or a prescribed disease.
During the qualifying period statutory sick
pay or sickness benefit may be payable if the
person is incapable of work. The degree of
disablement is assessed by a medical authority
and the amount paid depends on the extent
of the disablement and how long it is
expected to last. Disablement of 14 per cent
or more attracts a weekly pension. Except for
certain progressive respiratory diseases,
disablement of less than 14 per cent does not
attract disablement benefit. In certain
circumstances disablement benefits may be
supplemented by a constant attendance
allowance. An additional allowance may be
payable in certain cases of exceptionally
severe disablement.
Other Benefits
Disability living allowance (which replaced
mobility allowance and, for people under 65,
attendance allowance) was introduced in April
1992. It is a tax-free benefit with two
components for people under the age of 65
who need help with personal care or with
mobility. The care component has three
weekly rates—£43-35, £28-95 and £11-55.
The mobility component has two rates—
£30-30 and £11-55.
An independent organisation called
Motability helps disabled drivers and
passengers wanting to use their higher rates of
disability living allowance to obtain a vehicle.
A non-contributory, tax-free attendance
allowance of £28 95 or £43-35 a week may be
payable to people severely disabled at or after
age 65 depending upon the amount of
attention they require. People with a terminal
illness receive the higher rate.
A non-contributory invalid care allowance
of £32-55 weekly may be payable to people
between 16 and pensionable age who cannot
take up a paid job because they are caring for
a person receiving either the higher or middle
rate of disability living allowance care
component or attendance allowance; an
additional carer’s premium may be paid if the
recipient is also receiving income support,
housing benefit or community charge benefit.
It is estimated that some 1-4 million adults in
Great Britain care for a disabled person for at
least 20 hours a week.
Disability working allowance, a new tax-
free benefit introduced in April 1992,
provides help for disabled people in work. It
is an income-related benefit payable to people
working 16 hours or more a week. Awards
are for fixed periods of six months. People
must be receiving disability living allowance
or have recently received a long-term
incapacity benefit or a disability premium
with an income-related benefit as a condition
for receiving the new benefit. The rate
payable depends on the person’s income and
size of family.
Unemployment Benefit
Unemployment benefit of £43-10 a week for
a single person or £69-70 for a couple is
payable for up to a year in any one period of
unemployment. Periods covered by
unemployment or sickness benefit, maternity
allowance or some training allowances which
are eight weeks or less apart, are linked to
form a single period of interruption of work.
Everyone claiming unemployment benefit has
to be available for work, but unemployed
145
BRITAIN 1993: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
people wishing to do voluntary work in the
community may do so in some cases without
losing entitlement to benefit. People seeking
unemployment benefit are expected actively
to look for work and must have good reasons
for rejecting any job that is offered.
Income Support
Income support is payable to people who are
not in work, or who work for less than 16
hours a week, and whose financial resources
are below certain set levels. It consists of a
personal allowance ranging from £25-55
weekly for a single person or lone parent aged
under 18 to £66-60 for a couple, at least one
of whom is aged over 18. Additional sums are
available to families, single parents,
pensioners, long-term sick and disabled
people, and those caring for them who qualify
for the invalid care allowance.
Housing Benefit
The housing benefit scheme assists people
who need help to pay their rent, using
general assessment rules and benefit levels
similar to those for the income support
scheme. People whose net income is below
certain specified levels receive housing
benefit equivalent to 100 per cent of their
rent.
Both income support and housing benefit
schemes set a limit to the amount of capital a
person may have and still remain entitled, and
any income is taken into account after income
tax and National Insurance contributions.
Community Charge Benefit
The community charge benefit is a rebate
scheme which offers help with the cost of the
community charge (see p 57) to those
claiming income support and others with low
incomes. Subject to rules similar to those
governing the provision of income support
and housing benefit (see above), people can
receive rebates of up to 80 per cent of their
community charge. From April 1993 council
tax benefit will replace community charge
benefit, the maximum rebate being 100 per
cent.
Family Credit
Family credit is payable to employed and
self-employed working families with children
on modest incomes. It is payable to couples
or lone parents. At least one parent must
work for a minimum of 16 hours a week. The
amount payable depends on a family’s net
income (excluding child benefit) and the
number and ages of the children in the
family. A maximum award, consisting of an
adult rate of £41 weekly, plus a rate for each
child varying with age, is payable if the
family’s net income does not exceed £66 60 a
week. The award is reduced by 70 pence for
each pound by which net income exceeds this
amount. Family credit is not payable if a
family’s capital or savings exceed £8,000.
Social Fund
Discretionary payments, in the form of loans
or grants, may be available to people on low
incomes for expenses which are difficult to
meet from their regular income. There are
three types:
• budgeting loans to help meet important
occasional expenses;
• crisis loans for help in an emergency or a
disaster; and
• community care grants to help people re¬
establish themselves or remain in the
community and to ease exceptional
pressure on families.
In 1992-93 the Government is providing
£211 million for loans and £91 million for
community care grants. The total
discretionary budget of £302 million is
almost £75 million higher than in 1991-92.
Payments are also made from the social
fund to help with the costs of maternity or
funerals or with heating during very cold
weather. These payments are regulated and
are not subject to the same budgetary
considerations as other social fund payments.
War Pensions and Related Services
Pensions are payable for disablement or death
as a result of service in the armed forces or
for certain injuries received in the merchant
146
SOCIAL WELFARE
navy or civil defence during war-time, or to
civilians injured by enemy action. The
amount paid depends on the degree of
disablement and rank held in service: the
maximum disablement pension for a private
soldier is £89 a week.
There are a number of extra allowances.
The main ones are for unemployability,
restricted mobility, the need for constant
attendance, the provision of extra comforts,
and as maintenance for a lowered standard of
occupation. An age allowance of between
£6-25 and £19-30 is payable weekly to war
pensioners aged 65 or over whose disablement
is assessed at 40 per cent or more. Pensions
are also paid to war widows and other
dependants. (The standard rate of pension for
a private’s widow is £70 35 a week.)
The Department of Social Security
maintains a welfare service for war pensioners,
war widows and other dependants. It works
closely with ex-Service organisations and
other voluntary bodies which give financial
aid and personal support to those disabled or
bereaved as a result of war.
Taxation
Some social security benefits are regarded as
taxable income. Various income tax reliefs
and exemptions are allowed on account of age
or a need to support dependants. The
following benefits are not taxable: income
support (except when paid to the unemployed
and to people involved in industrial disputes),
family credit, attendance allowance, severe
disablement allowance, industrial injuries
disablement benefit, reduced earnings
allowance, and war pensions. The two new
benefits, disability living allowance and
disability working allowance, are both tax-free.
Other Benefits
Other benefits for which unemployed people
and those on low incomes may be eligible
include exemption from health service
charges (see p 119), grants towards the cost
of spectacles, free school meals and free legal
aid. Reduced charges are often made to
unemployed people, for example, for adult
education and exhibitions, and pensioners
usually enjoy reduced transport fares.
Arrangements with Other Countries
As part of the European Community’s efforts
to promote the free movement of labour,
regulations provide for equality of treatment
and the protection of benefit rights for
employed and self-employed people who
move between member states. The
regulations also cover retirement pensioners
and other beneficiaries who have been
employed, or self-employed, as well as
dependants. Benefits covered include child
benefit and those for sickness and maternity,
unemployment, retirement, invalidity,
accidents at work and occupational diseases.
Britain also has reciprocal social security
agreements with a number of other countries.
Their scope and the benefits they cover vary,
but the majority cover most National
Insurance benefits and family benefits.
147
7 Education
British education aims to develop fully the
abilities of individuals, both young and old,
for their own benefit and that of society as a
whole. Compulsory schooling takes place
between the ages of 4 or 5 and 16. Some
provision is made for children under school
age, and many pupils remain at school
beyond the minimum leaving age. Post-school
education, mainly at universities and
institutions of further and higher education,
is organised flexibly to provide a wide range
of opportunities for academic and vocational
education and continuing study throughout
life.
Major Reforms
During the last few years the education
service has undergone the most far-reaching
reforms since 1945. The aims of the
Government’s policies are to:
• raise standards at all levels of ability;
• increase parental choice of schools and
improve the partnership between parents
and schools;
• make further and higher educationl
more widely accessible and more
responsive to the needs of the economy;
and
• achieve the best possible return from the
resources invested in the education
service.
Schools
In schools, the Government is seeking to:
• improve school management;
i Higher education is generally defined as higher courses in any
institution—broadly, those of a standard higher than General
Certificate of Education (GCE) Advanced (A) level or its
equivalent—and further education as all other post-school
courses.
• secure a broader and more balanced
curriculum for all pupils so that they can
develop the qualities and skills required
for adult life and work in a technological
age;
• ensure that examinations support
curriculum objectives;
• implement schemes for the local
management of schools; and
• improve the quality of teaching through
better teacher training and appraisal.
Further proposals on education reform in
England and Wales were set out in a White
Paper, published in July 1992. The main
proposals are:
• the introduction of measures to make it
easier for schools to become grant-
maintained (see p 152);
• the establishment of a funding agency for
grant-maintained schools;
• more specialisation by schools in their
particular subject strengths;
• measures to improve bad schools;
• the setting up of a new body to improve
standards in schools; and
• the creation of a new independent
tribunal to hear parents’ appeals against
local education authority decisions
regarding their children who have special
educational needs.
Fuller details are given in the relevant
sections.
Schools are also encouraged to be more
responsive to the needs of a multi-ethnic
society. Measures are being taken to widen
the choice of schools available and to ensure
that schools respond effectively to the
demands of parents and the broader
community. School governors have to be
properly trained.
148
EDUCATION
Post-school Education
The Government’s principal aims for further
education and training (see p 164) are to:
• ensure that participation becomes the
norm for all 16- and 17-year-olds who
can benefit from it;
• improve vocational qualifications in order
to increase the proportion of young
people and adults acquiring higher levels
of skills and expertise; and
• secure the more efficient and effective
use of resources.
The Government’s main objectives for
higher education (see p 150) are to:
• secure enough places for suitably
qualified students;
• ensure that the system maintains high
quality and becomes increasingly relevant
to students’ needs for their benefit and
for that of the economy and society as a
whole; and
• ensure that suitable arrangements are
made for student support.
In order to spread the benefits of higher
education more widely, the Government
encourages educational institutions to recruit
more students from ethnic minority and
other under-represented groups.
Legislation making major reforms in the
funding and organisation of further and
higher education has been passed by
Parliament. Details are given in the relevant
sections below (see p 150 and p 161).
Administration
The Secretary of State for Education has
overall responsibility for education in
England, and for university education in
Great Britain. The Secretaries of State for
Wales and for Scotland are responsible for
non-university education in their countries,
and are consulted about education in
universities. The Secretary of State for
Northern Ireland is responsible for both
university and non-university education in
the province. From April 1993 each Secretary
of State will be responsible for all higher
education in his country.
The government departments responsible
for education are the Department for
Education in England, the Welsh Office
Education Department, the Scottish Office
Education Department, and the Department
of Education for Northern Ireland. They
formulate education policies and allocate
some government funds to the local
government authorities responsible for
providing schools and other facilities. The
departments are also responsible for the
supply and training of teachers.
Most publicly financed school education
and that provided by local further education
colleges is the responsibility of local
government education authorities. From April
1993, further education colleges will be
removed from local authority control (see
p 161). In Northern Ireland the education
service is administered locally by five
education and library boards.
Local education authorities employ
teachers and other staff, provide and maintain
buildings, supply equipment and materials
and, in England and Wales, award grants to
students progressing to further and higher
education.
Universities are self-governing institutions,
receiving most of their income indirectly
from central government grants.
Finance
Estimated spending on education in Britain
in 1991-92 was £29,300 million. About 70
per cent was incurred by local education
authorities, which make their own expenditure
decisions according to local needs. Parts of
the education service are funded by central
government. The largest item of Department
for Education spending is devoted to higher
education. The Departments of Employment
and of Trade and Industry also fund
educational programmes; the former, for
example, finances the Technical and
Vocational Education Initiative (see p 157)
and Compacts (see p 167).
Part of the Government’s general revenue
support—granted by the Department of the
Environment to local government authorities
in England and by the Welsh Office in
Wales—is allocated by the authorities to their
149
BRITAIN 1993: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
education service. The Government also
assists authorities’ expenditure on educational
activities of national priority. In 1992—93, for
instance, the Government is contributing
some £228 million towards a total of £377
million to be spent on projects, including the
National Curriculum, local management of
schools and colleges, teacher recruitment,
support for information technology in schools
and health education in schools. The rest of
education authorities’ expenditure is met by
local taxation. In Scotland, education is
financed on a similar basis.
In Northern Ireland the costs of the
education and library boards are met in full
by the Department of Education.
The Government funds directly the
current and capital costs of grant-maintained
schools which have opted to leave local
education authority control (see p 152) and of
city technology colleges (see p 153) in
England and Wales and comparable
institutions in Scotland and Northern Ireland.
Higher Education
Higher education is largely financed by grants
to individual institutions and tuition fees paid
for students through the awards system. The
Government has shifted the balance of public
funding for full-time undergraduate higher
education from the institutional grant to
tuition fees paid for students. This is
intended to create a more direct link between
an institution’s income and the number of its
students and to encourage institutions to
increase their efficiency by making full use of
capacity.
Grants for universities in Great Britain are
currently distributed by the Universities
Funding Council (UFC), a statutory body.
Certain individual establishments, such as the
Open University, are financed directly by the
Department for Education. In Northern
Ireland, grant is paid directly to the
universities by the Department of Education
following advice from the UFC. The private
University of Buckingham receives no public
grant.
The Polytechnics and Colleges Funding
Council is currently responsible for allocating
public funds for higher courses in most
colleges of higher education in England.
Similar institutions in Wales are financed by
the Welsh Office. Higher courses in Wales
continue to be financed by local authorities.
In Scotland all courses offered by the central
institutions and colleges of education are
funded by central government; advanced
courses provided by local authority further
education colleges are financed by the local
authorities.
Universities and other higher education
institutions undertake training, research, or
consultancy for commercial firms. The
Government is encouraging them to secure a
larger flow of funds from these sources.
Many educational establishments have
endowments or receive grants from
foundations and benefactors.
Under legislation passed by Parliament in
1992, these financing arrangements will be
changed. In England, Scotland and Wales,
there will be separate funding councils
responsible for allocating public funds on a
fair basis to all higher education institutions.
The Universities Funding Council and the
Polytechnics and Colleges Funding Council
will, therefore, be abolished in 1993 and
replaced by the three new councils.
The Government reimburses in full the
amount spent by local authorities on
mandatory student grants and fees (see p 162).
SCHOOLS
Parents are required by law to see that their
children receive efficient full-time education,
at school or elsewhere, between the ages of 5
and 16 in Great Britain and 4 and 16 in
Northern Ireland. Some 9 million children
attend Britain’s 34,800 state and private
schools.
About 93 per cent of pupils receive free
education financed from public funds, while
the others attend independent schools
financed from fees paid by parents.
Boys and girls are taught together in most
primary schools. More than 80 per cent of
pupils in maintained secondary schools in
England and Wales and over 60 per cent in
Northern Ireland attend mixed schools. In
Scotland nearly all secondary schools are
mixed. Most independent schools for younger
150
EDUCATION
children are co-educational; the majority
providing secondary education are single-sex,
although the number of mixed schools is
growing.
Rights of Parents
Parents have a statutory right to express a
preference for a particular school for their
children, and have an effective channel of
appeal at local level. Schools are obliged to
publish their admissions criteria and basic
information about themselves and their public
examination results. In order to increase
parental choice, secondary schools are
required to admit pupils up to the limit of
their physical capacity if there is sufficient
demand on behalf of children eligible for
admission. This policy is also being applied
to primary schools.
Legislation passed by Parliament in 1992
is designed to enable parents in England and
Wales to make more informed choices about
their children’s education.
From the autumn of 1992 parents
choosing among local secondary
schools will:
• find freely available comparative
tables showing the latest public
examination results school by
school; and
• find in each school’s prospectus
improved information on public
examination results and truancy
rates.
From 1993, regulations in England and
Wales will require by law the inclusion in
comparative tables of all local secondary
schools, including independent ones; the
scope of the tables will be extended to cover
truancy rates, National Curriculum
assessment results and the destinations of
school leavers. The legislation also provides
for information to be given to parents on the
findings of school inspection reports
(see p 159).
Regulations in England and Wales require
all maintained schools to send to parents a
written annual report on their child’s
progress. The report must contain:
• details about the child’s progress in
subjects studied;
• details of the results of National
Curriculum assessments and of public
examinations taken by the child;
• comparative information about the results
of other pupils of the same age in the
school; and
• information about the arrangements for
discussing the report with teachers at the
school.
Management
England and Wales
Schools supported from public funds are of
three main kinds:
• county schools are owned and maintained
by local education authorities wholly out
of public funds;
• voluntary schools, mostly established by
religious denominations, are also wholly
maintained from public funds but the
governors of some types of voluntary
school contribute to capital costs; and
• grant-maintained schools, which have
chosen to opt out of local education
authority control after an affirmative
ballot by parents. These ballots take place
under the provisions of legislation passed
in 1988.
Each publicly maintained school has a
governing body which includes governors
appointed by the local education authority
and a balance of teacher and parent
representatives. Governors work with the
head of the school in areas such as allocation
of the school budget, interviewing/
appointment of staff and other matters.
The role of governing bodies has been
further enlarged since 1990. Local education
authorities will be delegating responsibility
for the management of school budgets to all
secondary schools and primary schools by
April 1994. In April 1991, 38 per cent of
schools in England had delegated budgets and
this rose to over 70 per cent in April 1992.
Under the system of delegation, the local
education authority allocates funds—largely
on the basis of pupil numbers—to the school,
151
BRITAIN 1993: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
which then takes responsibility for spending
decisions. Local education authorities will
also be required from April 1994 to extend
local management to special schools;
authorities will be required to fund special
schools according to a formula and will be
permitted to provide for special schools to
receive delegated management powers.
Grant-maintained Schools
Grant-maintained schools are self-governing
and are financed by central government. The
Government hopes that over time all state
schools will become grant-maintained. In the
July 1992 White Paper the Government is
proposing that a new statutory body, the
Funding Agency for Schools, should be set
up to calculate and pay grant to grant-
maintained schools and be responsible for
financial monitoring. The Agency will act
under regulations and guidelines set down by
the Secretary of State.
The Government is also proposing that
small primary schools in rural areas should
take advantage of the grant-maintained
option. Under this, a cluster of small schools
could become grant-maintained and be
managed by a single governing body which
would distribute funds to the individual
schools. Each school would ballot parents on
grant-maintained status.
Local education authorities will continue
to be responsible for maintained schools
which do not become grant-maintained.
Under the Government’s proposals the
Funding Agency would be responsible for
securing sufficient school places when 75 per
cent of secondary or primary pupils are
educated in grant-maintained schools in a
local authority area. This function would be
shared between the Agency and the authority
where more than 10 per cent of the pupils
were educated in grant-maintained schools.
Scotland
In Scotland most of the schools supported
from public funds are provided by education
authorities and are known as public schools.
Education authorities are required to establish
school boards to play a significant part in the
administration and management of schools.
The boards consist of elected parent and staff
members as well as co-opted members,
thereby encouraging greater parental
involvement and closer links between home,
school and local community. Parents of
children at public schools can opt for local
self-management following approval by a
ballot; such schools receive funding directly
from central government instead of the local
education authority.
Northern Ireland
The main categories of school supported by
public funds are:
• controlled schools, provided by the
education and library boards and
managed through boards of governors;
• maintained schools, managed by boards
of governors with overall general
management from the Council for
Catholic Maintained Schools;
• voluntary grammar schools, which may
be under Roman Catholic management or
non-denominational boards of governors;
and
• grant-maintained integrated schools,
taking Protestant and Roman Catholic
pupils.
All grant-aided schools include elected
parents and teachers on their boards of
governors.
Although all schools must be open to
pupils of all religions, most Roman Catholic
pupils attend Catholic maintained schools or
Catholic voluntary grammar schools and most
Protestant children are enrolled at controlled
schools or non-denominational voluntary
grammar schools.
The Council for Catholic Maintained
Schools has responsibility for all maintained
schools under Roman Catholic management
which are under the auspices of the diocesan
authorities and of religious orders. The
Council’s main objective is to promote high
standards of education in the schools for
which it is responsible. Its membership
consists of trustee representatives appointed
by the Northern Irish bishops, of people
appointed by the Department of Education in
152
EDUCATION
consultation with the bishops, and of parents
and teachers.
The Government has a statutory duty, set
out in 1989 legislation, to encourage
integrated education as a way of breaking
down sectarian barriers. There are 16
integrated schools with 2,800 pupils.
New integrated schools receive immediate
government funding. Existing controlled,
maintained and voluntary grammar schools
can also apply to become integrated following
a majority vote by parents. There are two
categories of integrated schools. Grant-
maintained integrated status can be applied
for by new and independent schools as well
as those already receiving public funds. If
this is approved, the school is funded directly
by the Department of Education and run by
a board of governors. Controlled integrated
status can be sought by voluntary and
controlled schools; education and library
boards can also apply to set up such schools.
The boards provide funding for and
supervise controlled integrated schools.
Secondary school governors have delegated
responsibility for managing school budgets
and staff numbers. Primary and nursery
school governors have delegated responsibility
for managing non-staff costs only, although
from April 1992 full delegation is being
extended gradually into primary schools.
Nursery and Primary Schools
Although there is no statutory requirement to
educate under-fives, successive governments
have enabled nursery education to expand.
One-half of three- and four-year-olds receive
education in nursery schools or classes or in
infants’ classes in primary schools. In
addition, many children attend pre-school
playgroups, most of which are organised by
parents and incorporated in the Pre-School
Playgroups Association.
Compulsory education begins at five in
Great Britain and four in Northern Ireland,
when children go to infant schools or
departments; at seven many go on to junior
schools or departments. The usual age for
transfer from primary to secondary schools is
11 in England, Wales and Northern Ireland,
but some local authorities in England have
established first schools for pupils aged 5 to
8, 9 or 10, and middle schools for age-ranges
between 8 and 14. In Scotland primary
schools take children from 5 to 12.
Secondary Schools
Around nine-tenths of the maintained
secondary school population in Great Britain
attend comprehensive schools. These take
pupils without reference to ability or aptitude
and provide a wide range of secondary
education for all or most of the children in a
district. English and Welsh schools can be
organised in a number of ways. They include:
• those that take the full secondary school
age-range from 11 to 18;
• middle schools, whose pupils move on to
senior comprehensive schools at 12, 13 or
14, leaving at 16 or 18; and
• schools with an age-range of 11 or 12 to
16, combined with a sixth-form or a
tertiary college for pupils over 16.
Sixth-form colleges are schools which may
provide non-academic in addition to academic
courses. Tertiary colleges offer a range of
full-time and part-time vocational courses for
students over 16, as well as academic courses.
From April 1993 sixth form and tertiary
colleges will be funded by national further
education funding councils.
Most other children attend grammar or
secondary modern schools, to which they are
allocated after selection procedures at the age
of 11.
Nearly 300 secondary schools have left
local authority control and become grant-
maintained (see p 152).
There are 13 city technology colleges in
England and Wales. While fulfilling their
National Curriculum requirements of breadth
and balance, the colleges emphasise science,
technology and business understanding. They
are independent of local education authorities
and have been established as partnerships
between the Government and private
sponsors. The Government is also
establishing a number of secondary schools
specialising in technology, and encouraging
schools wishing to specialise in science, music
or modern languages.
153
BRITAIN 1993: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Scottish secondary education is almost
completely non-selective; the majority of
schools are six-year comprehensives. The
Government, in partnership with private
sponsors, is seeking to set up technology
academies in Scotland with a role similar to
that of the city technology colleges.
In Northern Ireland secondary education
is organised largely along selective lines,
based on a system of testing. However, there
are some secondary schools run on a non-
selective basis.
Failing Schools
The Government has announced proposals
designed to deal with poor schools in
England and Wales. If school inspectors
identified a school that was failing to give its
pupils an acceptable standard of education,
the local education authority would be able to
appoint new governors and withdraw
delegated management from the school. If
these measures failed to work, the Secretary
of State would be able to bring in an
Education Association to put the school
under new management until its performance
had reached a satisfactory level. The new
management would be financed from central
government. After further advice from
the schools inspectorate (see p 159), the
Secretary of State would decide whether to
end the Association’s period of care for the
school. The school would be considered for
grant-maintained status.
Independent Schools
Fee-paying independent schools must register
with the appropriate education department
and are open to inspection. They can be
required to remedy serious shortcomings in
their accommodation or instruction, and to
exclude anyone regarded as unsuitable to
teach in or own a school. About 8 per cent of
schoolchildren attend independent schools.
There are 2,475 independent schools
educating 608,000 pupils of all ages. They
charge fees varying from around £300 a term
for day pupils at nursery age to £3,500 a
term for senior boarding pupils. Many offer
bursaries to help pupils from less well-off
families. Such pupils may also be helped by
local education authorities—particularly if the
authorities’ own schools cannot meet the
needs of individual children—or by the
Government’s Assisted Places Scheme, under
which assistance is given according to
parental income. Over 37,000 places are
offered in England, Wales and Scotland
under the scheme. The Government also
gives income-related help with fees to pupils
at certain specialist music and ballet schools.
Independent schools range from small
kindergartens to large day and boarding
schools and from new and in some cases
experimental schools to ancient foundations.
The 600 boys’, girls’ and mixed preparatory
schools prepare children for entry to senior
schools. The normal age-range for these
preparatory schools is from 7-plus to 11, 12
or 13, but many of the schools now have
pre-preparatory departments for younger
children. A number of independent schools
have been established by religious and ethnic
minorities.
Independent schools for older pupils—
from 11, 12 or 13 to 18 or 19—include about
550 which are often referred to as public
schools. These are schools belonging to the
Headmasters’ Conference, the Governing
Bodies Association, the Society of
Headmasters and Headmistresses of
Independent Schools, the Girls’ Schools
Association and the Governing Bodies of
Girls’ Schools Association. They should not
be confused with the state-supported public
schools in Scotland.
Special Educational Needs
Special educational needs comprise learning
difficulties of all kinds, including mental and
physical disabilities which hinder or prevent
learning. In the case of children whose
learning difficulties are severe or complex,
local education authorities are required to:
• identify, assess and secure provision for
their needs; and
• give parents the right to be involved in
decisions about their child’s special
education.
If the education authority believes that it
154
EDUCATION
should determine the special education
provision for the child, it must draw up a
formal statement of the child’s special
educational needs and the action it intends to
take to meet them. Parents have a right of
appeal if they disagree with the special
educational provision set out in the statement.
Wherever possible, children with special
educational needs are educated in ordinary
schools, provided that the parents’ wishes
have been taken into account, and that this is
compatible with meeting the needs of the
child, with the provision of efficient
education for the other children in the
school, and with the efficient use of
resources.
Because of concern about the way these
arrangements are working the Government is
proposing to:
• set statutory time limits within which the
education authority must carry out
procedures for making assessments and
statements;
• require the education authority to comply
with parents’ choice of school unless this
would be inappropriate for the child or
involve an inefficient use of resources;
and
• establish an independent tribunal to hear
appeals against education authority
decisions. The tribunal’s decisions would
be binding on all parties to the case and
it would replace the present local appeal
committees and appeals to the Secretary
of State.
The Government is also proposing to
change the law to ensure that a state school
named in a statement of special educational
needs should be required to admit the child.
The education authority would have to
consult the governors before naming the
school. It is intended that parents will be
given the right to ballot on grant-maintained
status for special schools.
In Scotland the choice of school is a
matter for agreement between education
authorities and parents.
There are 1,900 special schools (both day
and boarding), including those run by
voluntary organisations and those established
in hospitals. They cater for about 125,000
pupils with special educational needs who
cannot be educated at ordinary schools.
Developments in information technology
(see p 159) are increasingly leading to better
quality education for these children.
Teachers
Teachers in publicly maintained schools are
appointed by local education authorities or
school governing bodies. Over 500,000
teachers are employed in maintained and
independent schools, and the average pupil-
teacher ratio for all schools is about 17 to 1.
Teachers in maintained schools must hold
qualifications approved by the appropriate
education department (see p 165).
Formal teacher appraisal is being
introduced in English and Welsh schools. By
1995 all teachers will have completed the first
year of their appraisal cycle.
The Curriculum
England and Wales
The Government favours widening
educational opportunities as much as possible
through a broad and balanced curriculum
designed to meet the individual needs of
pupils and relevant to the modern world.
In 1989 primary and secondary schools
began the gradual introduction of the
National Curriculum in England and Wales.
The National Curriculum consists of the core
subjects of English, mathematics and science,
as well as the other foundation subjects of
history, geography, technology, music, art,
physical education and, for secondary level
pupils, a modern foreign language.
National Curriculum subjects are being
introduced progressively; by 1996-97 the
entire National Curriculum will be taught to
all pupils.
In Wales the Welsh language constitutes a
core subject in Welsh-speaking schools and a
foundation subject elsewhere under the
National Curriculum. The National
Curriculum requirements for Welsh were
introduced in 1990. Some 80 per cent of
primary schools either use Welsh as a
teaching medium or teach it as a second
155
BRITAIN 1993: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
language, while nearly 90 per cent of
secondary schools teach Welsh as a first or
second language.
There are statutory attainment targets
specifying the knowledge, skills and
understanding expected of children at the
ages of 7, 11, 14 and 16. The first national
statutory assessment of seven-year-olds was
undertaken in 1991. Those for 14-year-olds
will first take place in 1993 and those for
11-year-olds in 1994. Assessments at the age
of 16 will be by means of the GCSE exam
(see p 157). Regulations have been introduced
covering the manner and form in which
assessments of individual pupils are to be
made available to parents and others
(see p 159).
Scotland
The content and management of the
curriculum are the responsibility of education
authorities and head teachers, though
guidance is provided by the Secretary of
State for Scotland and the Scottish
Consultative Council on the Curriculum. The
Council has recommended that secondary
level pupils should follow a broad and
balanced curriculum consisting of English,
mathematics, science, a modern European
language, social studies, technological
activities, art, music or drama, religious and
moral education, and physical education. A
major programme of curricular review and
development is in progress for the 5-to-14
age-range. The Government is in the process
of issuing new guidelines on all aspects of the
curriculum and assessment. Standardised
tests in English and mathematics are being
introduced for primary school pupils at stages
4 and 7, normally at ages 8 and 12. The
Government also wants to promote the
teaching of foreign languages in primary
schools and pilot studies are in progress. It
also intends that all pupils should study a
foreign language during their compulsory
secondary education.
A committee has been established to
review courses and assessment arrangements
in the final two years of secondary schooling.
Provision is made for teaching in Gaelic in
Gaelic-speaking areas.
Northern Ireland
A common curriculum is being introduced in
all Northern Ireland grant-aided schools. It is
based on six broad areas of study: English,
mathematics, science and technology, the
environment and society, creative and
expressive studies, and, for secondary schools,
language studies. Religious education is
obligatory at all stages. The curriculum will
be fully implemented by September 1993.
Attainment targets, programmes of study
and methods of assessment—at ages 8, 11, 14
and 16—are specified for all compulsory
subjects. The first assessments at the ages of
11 and 14 will take place in 1994 and at the
ages of 8 and 16 in 1995. In addition, the
school curriculum includes six compulsory
cross-curricular themes: education for mutual
understanding, cultural heritage, health
education, information technology, and, in
secondary schools, economic awareness and
careers education. Pupils are learning from a
common history curriculum in the
environment and society area of study.
Religious Education and Collective
Worship in Schools
In England and Wales maintained schools
must provide religious education and a daily
act of collective worship. Since the 1988 Act,
many local authorities have reviewed their
agreed syllabuses for religious education to
take account of the fact that religious
traditions in Great Britain are in the main
Christian. Syllabuses, however, also cover the
teachings of the other main religions
represented in the country.
The Government is proposing that those
authorities which have not reviewed their
syllabuses should be required to do so in a
specified period. Each local education
authority area has a standing council which
advises the authority on the development of
religious education.
In all voluntary schools there is the
opportunity for denominational religious
education.
Parents have the right to withdraw their
children from religious education classes and
from collective worship.
156
EDUCATION
Scottish education authorities are required
to see that schools practise religious
observance and give pupils religious
instruction; parents may withdraw their
children if they wish. Certain schools provide
for Roman Catholic children but in all
schools there are safeguards for the individual
conscience.
In Northern Ireland, too, schools are
obliged to offer religious education and
collective worship, although parents have the
right to withdraw their children from both.
In controlled schools clergy have a right of
access which may be used for denominational
instruction. In voluntary schools collective
worship and religious education are
controlled by the management authorities. It
is intended that religious education will have
an agreed core syllabus which grant-aided
schools can expand according to their own
needs and wishes.
Ethnic Minority Children
Most school-aged children from ethnic
minorities were born in Britain and tend to
share the interests and aspirations of children
in the population at large. Nevertheless, a
substantial number still have particular needs
arising from cultural differences, including
those of language, religion and custom.
The education authorities have done much
to meet these needs. English language
teaching continues to receive priority, with a
growing awareness of the value of bilingual
support in the early primary years. Schools
may teach the main ethnic minority
community languages at secondary level as
part of the National Curriculum. Emphasis
has been placed on the need for schools to
take account of the ethnic and cultural
backgrounds of pupils and curricula should
reflect ethnic and cultural diversity. Measures
have been taken to improve the achievement
of ethnic minority pupils, and to prepare all
children, not just those of ethnic minority
origin, for living in a multi-ethnic society.
Curriculum Development
In England curriculum development is
promoted by the National Curriculum
Council and in Wales by the Curriculum
Council for Wales. The Curriculum
Councils keep the curriculum for maintained
schools under review, advise the
Government on content, carry out
programmes of research and development
and publish information relating to the
curriculum. The Government proposes to
set up a new School Curriculum and
Assessment Authority in England to ensure
quality in the curriculum and the associated
assessment arrangements. This will replace
the National Curriculum Council and the
School Examinations and Assessment
Council (see p 158). Similar action is being
taken in Wales.
In Scotland curriculum development is
undertaken by the Scottish Consultative
Council on the Curriculum and in Northern
Ireland by the Northern Ireland Curriculum
Council.
Technical and Vocational Education
Initiative
The Technical and Vocational Education
Initiative (TVEI) applies in England,
Scotland and Wales. It is financed and
administered by the Department of
Employment, the Scottish Office Industry
Department and the Welsh Office, working
in close co-operation with local education
authorities. It is intended that the education
of 14- to 18-year-olds should equip them for
working life by ensuring that the school
curriculum relates to the working
environment, and by improving skills and
qualifications, particularly in science,
technology and modern languages. Over
1 million students are benefiting from TVEI
in England.
Examinations and Qualifications
England, Wales and Northern Ireland
The main examinations taken by secondary
school pupils in England, Wales and
Northern Ireland around the age of 16 are
those leading to the General Certificate of
Secondary Education (GCSE). GCSE
examinations are usually taken after five
157
BRITAIN 1993: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
years of secondary education and can lead on
to more advanced education and training.
The GCSE will be the principal means for
assessing attainment at stage 4 (pupils aged
16) of the National Curriculum. The
structure of the exam is being adapted in
accordance with National Curriculum
requirements.
The General Certificate of Education
(GCE) Advanced (A) level is normally taken
after a further two years of study. New
examinations—Advanced Supplementary (AS)
levels—were held for the first time in 1989
and enable sixth-form pupils to study a wider
range of subjects than was possible before.
Students specialising in the arts and
humanities, for example, can continue to
study mathematics and technological subjects
at the new level. Requiring the same
standard of work but with only half the
content of A levels, an AS level occupies half
the teaching and study time of an A level. A
levels or a mixture of A and AS levels are the
main standard for entrance to higher
education and to many forms of professional
training.
Discussions have taken place with the
main vocational examining and validating
bodies regarding their possible contribution to
courses and qualifications for 14- to 16-year-
olds. It is expected that courses will be
available from September 1993 which will
extend the study of National Curriculum
subjects, particularly technology, into
vocational and practical areas for those pupils
whose aptitudes lie in this direction.
The Certificate of Pre-Vocational
Education is for those at school or college
wishing to continue in full-time education for
a year after the age of 16 and to receive a
broadly based preparation for work or
vocational and other courses. The Certificate
is being developed by the City and Guilds of
London Institute. An improved version will
be called the City and Guilds Diploma of
Vocational Education. Business and
Technology Education Council (BTEC)
qualifications can also serve as a preparation
for work or a stepping-stone into higher
education. Schools are now allowed to offer
BTEC First Diploma courses to 16- to
19-year-olds.
Scotland
Scottish pupils take the Scottish Certificate of
Education (SCE) at Standard grade at the
end of their fourth year of secondary
education (equivalent to the fifth year in
England and Wales). Pupils in the fifth and
sixth years sit the SCE Higher grade; passes
at this grade are the basis for entry to higher
education or professional training. However,
entry is becoming more flexible as wider
access to under-represented groups with non¬
standard qualifications is encouraged. The
Certificate of Sixth Year Studies (CSYS) is
for pupils who have completed their Higher
grade main studies and who wish to continue
studies in particular subjects. Standard grade
courses and examinations cater for the whole
ability range. Higher and CSYS examinations
are being revised to ensure compatibility with
the Standard grade.
The National Certificate is for students
over 16 who have successfully completed a
programme of vocational courses based on
short study units.
Examinations and Assessment Councils
All GCSE and other qualifications offered to
pupils of compulsory school age in
maintained schools in England and Wales
must be approved by the Government.
Associated syllabuses and assessment
procedures must comply with national
guidelines and be approved by the School
Examinations and Assessment Council. The
aim is to secure a reasonably wide choice of
qualifications and syllabuses which promote a
broad and balanced curriculum and support
the National Curriculum.
The Council keeps under review all
aspects of examinations and assessment in
England and Wales. It liaises with the
National Curriculum Council for England
and the Curriculum Council for Wales on
work connected with the National
Curriculum in schools. The Council will be
replaced by a new body under recent
government proposals.
The Council’s Evaluation and Monitoring
Unit evaluates the assessment arrangements
for the National Curriculum.
158
EDUCATION
The equivalent body in Scotland is the
Scottish Examination Board, which liaises
with the Scottish Consultative Council on the
Curriculum. The Scottish Assessment of
Achievement research programme has
surveyed attainments of pupils in English and
mathematics at the ages of 8, 12 and 14.
The Northern Ireland Schools
Examinations and Assessment Council is
responsible for keeping all aspects of
examinations and assessment under review. It
liaises with the Northern Ireland Curriculum
Council.
Progress Reports
Parents in England and Wales receive a
yearly progress report on their child’s general
progress, National Curriculum achievements
and results in public examinations. The
National Record of Achievement, launched in
February 1991, is designed to present a
simple record of achievement in education
and training throughout working life.
In Scotland the report card system is
being reformed to give parents a clearer view
of their children’s progress. In Northern
Ireland all pupils will be issued with a record
of achievement on leaving primary and
secondary education.
Educational Standards
Various schools inspectorates report to the
Government on educational standards.
In September 1992 new offices
independent of government were established
in England and Wales, headed by Her
Majesty’s Chief Inspector of Schools in
England and Her Majesty’s Chief Inspector
of Schools in Wales. The office in England is
the Office for Standards in Education. In
addition to advising the Government on
quality, standards and efficiency in school
education, the Chief Inspectors are
responsible for regulating a new system of
school inspections. Every school will have to
be inspected regularly by independent
inspectors to agreed national standards which
will be monitored by the offices. It is planned
to examine 6,000 schools a year over a four-
year period and this work will continue in
four-yearly cycles. Parents will be sent a
readable summary of the full inspection
report, which will be published. Governors
will have to prepare action plans to follow it
up and then report back to parents on their
progress. The inspection cycle begins in
September 1993 for secondary schools and
September 1994 for primary and other
schools.
Schools inspections in Northern Ireland
are carried out by the Education and
Training Inspectorate, which is part of the
Department of Education.
Information Technology
The National Curriculum places a strong
emphasis on the use of information
technology (IT). In 1987 the Government
announced a major new strategy to encourage
use of educational technology across the
curriculum so that pupils become familiar
with the new technologies and use them to
enhance learning. Between 1988 and 1992 the
average number of microcomputers in
English primary schools rose from 2-5 to 7
and in English secondary schools from 23 to
60; over two-thirds of teachers have
undertaken awareness training in the use of
IT. In Wales, the average number of pupils
per microcomputer in primary schools went
down from 68 to 34 between 1988 and 1991;
in secondary schools over the same period the
average number decreased from 30 to 14.
From 1991 to 1994 grants are available to
increase the numbers of microcomputers in
schools and for teacher training. In both
years grants may be used to provide IT
support for children with communication
difficulties. In 1992-93 and 1993-94 grants
are available to help secondary schools buy
CD-ROM (compact disc read only memory)
drives and discs.
In each of the three years 1991-92 to
1993-94 there are grant-supported spending
programmes of around £30 million to provide
continuing support for IT in schools.
The Government is also making a grant of
around £5 million a year to support the
National Council for Educational Technology
(NCET). The NCET was set up by the
Government in 1988 to support, encourage,
159
BRITAIN 1993: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
develop and apply the use of learning systems
and new technologies, including
microcomputers, electronic systems and other
aspects of IT, to education and training. The
corresponding body in Scotland is the
Scottish Council for Educational Technology.
Other government funding includes:
• £750,000 for the development of 19 new
National Curriculum software packages;
• £410,000 to install information relating to
the National Curriculum on NERIS
(National Educational Resources
Information Service—an electronic
database, see below);
• £13 million for the development of five
mathematics interactive video discs; and
• finance for software to give blind and
partially sighted students full access to
CD-ROM materials.
In Wales the Welsh Office has financed
the provision of satellite receiving equipment
for secondary schools throughout the country.
In Northern Ireland, information
technology is one of the six compulsory
educational themes forming part of the
curriculum for all pupils of statutory school
age in grant-aided schools. The objectives of
the IT theme are:
• knowledge, understanding and skills in
IT;
• application of IT;
• enhancing the quality of learning, living
and working through IT; and
• evaluating the impact of IT.
Educational Aids
Teachers and pupils use a range of aids to
assist the processes of teaching and learning.
The government-funded National Educational
Resources Information Service enables
schools to find out about teaching aids. Most
schools have audio-visual equipment such as
slide projectors and overhead projectors, and
educational broadcasting is of major
importance. The BBC and the independent
broadcasting companies transmit radio and
television programmes designed for schools.
Teachers’ notes, pupils’ pamphlets and
computer software accompany many
broadcast series. All primary and secondary
schools use microcomputers (see p 159).
Careers Education and Guidance
Careers education is used to raise awareness
of further and higher education and careers
opportunities and helps young people to
prepare for working life. The work of the
Careers Service at local level is supported by
information material produced by the
Government’s Careers and Occupational
Information Centre. A computer-assisted
careers guidance system has been developed
with funding from the Government for
students in higher education.
The Government has encouraged local
education authorities to enter into partnership
with Training and Enterprise Councils and
Local Enterprise Companies (see p 168) to
oversee the operation of the Careers Service
locally.
In Northern Ireland, careers education is
one of the six compulsory education themes
forming part of the school curriculum.
Health and Welfare of Schoolchildren
Physical education, including organised
games, is part of the curriculum of all
maintained schools, and playing fields must
be available for pupils over the age of eight.
Most secondary schools have a gymnasium.
Government health departments are
responsible for the medical inspection of
schoolchildren and for advice on, and
treatment of, medical and dental problems
associated with children of school age. The
Government believes that the education
service has a role to play in preventing and
dealing with juvenile drug misuse and in
helping to prevent the spread of AIDS.
Government funds have supported the
appointment in most local education
authorities of drugs and health education co¬
ordinators for schools, colleges and the youth
service.
Local education authorities are largely free
to decide what milk, meals or other
refreshment to offer at their schools, and the
charges to make. Provision has to be made
160
EDUCATION
free of charge, however, for pupils from
families receiving certain social security
benefits. Under certain conditions the
authorities must supply free school transport,
and they have discretionary powers to help
with the cost of travel to school. In Northern
Ireland school meals must be provided for
primary, special and grant-aided nursery
school pupils.
Corporal punishment is prohibited by law
in maintained schools in Britain.
POST-SCHOOL EDUCATION
Legislation passed in 1992 is designed to
transform post-compulsory education and
training in England, Wales and Scotland. The
reforms are ending the distinction between
universities, polytechnics and other higher
education establishments. New higher
education funding councils in England,
Scotland and Wales will be responsible for
allocating public funds for teaching and
general research. New links will be created to
continue the present close relationship with
Northern Ireland’s existing unitary structure.
Degree awarding powers are being extended to
all major institutions and there will be new
quality assurance arrangements. Polytechnics
have taken advantage of the right to call
themselves universities.
Further education and sixth-form colleges
will become autonomous institutions outside
local education authority control, financed
through new and separate further education
funding councils for England and Wales from
April 1993. By the mid-1990s, every 16- and
17-year-old leaving full-time education in
Great Britain will be encouraged to undertake
vocational education or training by the offer of
a training credit, enabling them to buy training
from the establishment of their choice. Every
16- and 17-year-old in Great Britain is
guaranteed a place in full-time education or
training.
Post-school education takes place at
universities, the Scottish central institutions
and colleges of education, further and higher
education colleges, adult education centres,
colleges of technology, colleges of art and
design, and agricultural and horticultural
colleges. There are also many independent
specialist establishments, such as secretarial
and correspondence colleges, and colleges for
teaching English as a foreign language.
Voluntary and public bodies offer cultural
and general education, sometimes with
assistance from local education authorities
and central government. Education and
training schemes can be run by public or
private organisations.
Credit accumulation and transfer schemes
are in use in many English and Welsh post¬
school establishments. In Scotland a credit
accumulation scheme covers courses in all
further and higher education. Opportunities
for further and higher education and training
are publicised by national information
services, such as the Educational Counselling
and Credit Transfer Information Service,
funded by the Department for Education.
The Further Education Unit, with
funding from the Department for Education
and the Welsh Office, is an advisory and
development body for further education. The
Scottish Further Education Unit performs a
parallel role.
Students
The proportion of young people entering
higher education rose from 1 in 8 in 1980 to
1 in 5 by 1990 and is expected to reach 1 in
3 by the year 2000. One of the Government’s
main aims is to change the balance of
provision in favour of scientific, technological
and directly vocational courses.
Around F5 million students in Britain are
taking full-time post-school education
courses, including sandwich courses where
substantial periods of full-time study
alternate with periods of supervised
experience on a relevant job. There are also
4 million part-time enrolments, half of whom
are in adult education (see p 168).
Student Grants and Loans
Over 90 per cent of full-time students in
England and Wales on first degree and other
comparable higher education courses are
eligible for mandatory awards. They cover
tuition fees and maintenance, with parents
contributing to maintenance costs according
161
BRITAIN 1993: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
to income. They are awarded by local
education authorities in England and Wales
for courses leading to a first degree or a
comparable qualification. Grants for other
courses are given at the discretion of a local
education authority. Similar schemes are
administered by the Scottish Office
Education Department and the Northern
Ireland education and library boards. Grants
for post-graduate study are offered by the
government education departments, the
British Academy and by the research councils
(see Chapter 21). Some scholarships are
available from endowments and also from
particular industries or companies.
Most students in full-time higher
education up to first degree level can get a
top-up maintenance loan of up to £830 in
1992-93 and indexed to inflation. The
scheme is designed to share the cost of
student maintenance more equitably between
students, parents and the taxpayer.
Higher Education
Higher education is provided in the form of
degree and other courses of a standard higher
than the General Certificate of Education
Advanced level or its equivalent. The
Government considers that access to higher
education courses should be available to all
those who can benefit from them and have
the necessary intellectual competence,
motivation and maturity.
Although GCE A levels and their
equivalents in Scotland have traditionally
been the standard for entry to higher
education courses, other qualifications and
courses are now considered equally
appropriate. These are AS levels, BTEC and
other vocational qualifications (see p 165) and
access/foundation courses (see p 163). The
Scottish Wider Access Programme (SWAP) is
designed to promote wider participation in
higher education, especially by more mature
students and those without the normal entry
requirements. Successful completion of a
SWAP course guarantees a higher education
place.
In order to maintain British expertise in
technology, recent government schemes have
sought to expand higher education and
research in electronics, engineering and
computer science by making available extra
student places, and additional staff and
research fellowships. A Graduate Enterprise
Programme offers 450 places on management
training courses for recently qualified
graduates.
Universities
There are 79 universities, including the Open
University. They are governed by royal
charters or by Act of Parliament and enjoy
complete academic freedom. They appoint
their own staff, decide which students to
admit, provide their own courses and award
their own degrees. The universities of Oxford
and Cambridge date from the twelfth and
thirteenth centuries, and the Scottish
universities of St Andrews, Glasgow,
Aberdeen and Edinburgh from the fourteenth
and fifteenth centuries. All the other
universities in Britain were founded in the
nineteenth and twentieth centuries. The
1960s saw considerable expansion in the
number of universities and students. The
number of universities increased considerably
in 1992 when polytechnics and some other
higher education establishments were given
the freedom to obtain university status and
chose to exercise it.
Admission to universities is by selection.
Of the 353,000 full-time home and overseas
university students in 1990-91, excluding
those at the University of Buckingham,
64,000 were postgraduate. There are just
under 30,000 full-time university teachers
paid wholly from university funds. The ratio
of staff to full-time students is about 1 to 11.
Except at the Open University, first degree
courses are mainly full time and usually last
three years. However, there are some four-
year courses, and medical and veterinary
courses normally require five years.
Degree titles vary according to the practice
of each university. In England, Wales and
Northern Ireland the most common titles for
a first degree are Bachelor of Arts (BA) or
Bachelor of Science (BSc) and for a second
degree Master of Arts (MA), Master of
Science (MSc), and Doctor of Philosophy
(PhD). In the older Scottish universities
162
EDUCATION
Master is used for a first degree in arts
subjects. Uniformity of standards between
universities is promoted by employing
external examiners for all university
examinations.
Research is an important feature of
university work; most staff combine research
with their teaching duties and about half of
postgraduate students are engaged on
research projects. The Government has been
seeking greater accountability and selectivity
in research. It is encouraging universities to
co-operate closely with industry on research
projects.
Since 1967 a major contribution to post¬
school education in England and Wales has
been made by the polytechnics, most of
which were established after 1967 and have
now become universities with the freedom to
award their own degrees from 1993. They
offer courses in a wide range of subjects,
including those leading to first and higher
degrees and graduate-equivalent
qualifications. They also run courses leading
to the examinations of the chief professional
bodies, and to qualifications such as those of
the Business and Technology Education
Council.
Access and foundation courses provide a
preparation and an appropriate test before
enrolment on a course of higher education for
prospective students who possess non-standard
entry qualifications. Many are from the
ethnic minority communities. The growth of
access courses has been very rapid in recent
years; about 600 are now available nationwide.
Polytechnics traditionally had close links
with commerce and industry, and many
students have jobs and attend on a part-time
basis. Similar provision is made in Scotland
in the 13 central institutions (which include
polytechnics) and 50 further education
colleges, and in Northern Ireland by the
University of Ulster.
In England and Wales institutes and
colleges of higher education, formed by the
integration of teacher training with the rest of
higher education, account for a significant
proportion of higher education students.
Some further education colleges run higher
education courses, often of a specialised
nature.
Large numbers of students on higher
education courses in Great Britain in
polytechnics and other higher education
institutions have taken courses leading to the
award of degrees and other academic
qualifications by the Council for National
Academic Awards (CNAA). The CNAA will
be abolished in 1993, as higher education
institutions will award their own degrees.
Open University
The Open University is a non-residential
university offering degree and other courses
for adult students of all ages in Britain and
other parts of Europe. It uses a combination
of specially produced printed texts,
correspondence tuition, television and radio
broadcasts, audio and video cassettes, and
residential schools. There is also a network of
study centres for contact with part-time
tutors and counsellors, and with fellow
students. No formal academic qualifications
are required to register for most courses, but
the standards of the University’s degrees are
the same as those of other universities. Its
first degree is the BA (Open), a general
degree awarded on a system of credits for
each course completed. In 1991 there were
79,500 registered undergraduates, and in all
some 115,000 first degrees have been awarded
since the University’s inception.
The University has a programme of higher
degrees, Bachelor of Philosophy (BPhil),
MPhil and PhD, available through research,
and MA, MSc and Master of Business
Administration (MBA) through taught
courses. About 7,500 students were registered
on higher degree courses in 1992.
The University also has programmes for
professionals in education and the health and
social welfare services, and for up-dating
managers, scientists and technologists. Some
of these are presented as multi-media courses
taught in a similar way to courses in the
undergraduate programme, and others are in
the form of self-contained study packs. In
1992, about 39,000 students were following
courses in these areas and 80,000 study packs
were sold.
The University has advised many other
countries on setting up similar institutions. It
163
BRITAIN 1993: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
has made a substantial contribution to the
new Commonwealth of Learning project,
which brings together distance-teaching
establishments and students throughout the
Commonwealth.
Further Education
Further education comprises all provision
outside schools to people aged over 16 of a
standard up to and including GCE A level
or equivalent. Courses are run by over 500
colleges of further education, many of which
also offer higher education courses. Most of
these colleges are currently controlled by
local education authorities; from April 1993,
they will be controlled by autonomous
further education corporations with
substantial representation from business.
Funds will be allocated by further education
funding councils. In Scotland the new
modular courses at the non-advanced level
(see p 165) can be taken in schools, further
education colleges or as part of government
training schemes. In Northern Ireland
further education refers to full-time and
part-time education for people over 16.
Much further education is work-related
and vocational, although most colleges also
provide non-vocational courses, including
GCSE and GCE A level courses. The
system is flexible and enables the student to
acquire whatever qualifications his or her
capabilities and time allow.
Many students on further education
courses attend part time, either by day
release or block release from employment or
during the evenings. The further education
system has strong ties with commerce and
industry, and co-operation with business is
encouraged by the Government and its
agencies. Employers are normally involved
in designing courses.
Further education colleges supply much
of the education element in training
programmes like Youth Training and
Employment Training, both sponsored by
the Department of Employment (see
Chapter 18). All young people on Youth
Training will be offered training and
vocational education leading to qualifications
at or equivalent to a minimum of level 2 in
the framework established by the National
Council for Vocational Qualifications and the
Scottish Vocational Education Council.
Vocational Qualifications
The National Council for Vocational
Qualifications (NCVQ) was set up in 1986 to
reform and rationalise the vocational
qualifications system in England, Wales and
Northern Ireland. It is establishing a new
framework of National Vocational
Qualifications (NVQs) based on defined levels
of achievement to which qualifications in all
sectors can be assigned or accredited.
The following five levels of NVQs
have been established:
Level 1: Competence in the
performance of a range of work
activities, most of which may be
routine.
Level 2: Competence in a significant
range of work activities, some of
which are complex or non-routine, and
require some responsibility.
Level 3: Competence in a broad range
of w ork activities, most of which are
complex and non-routine.
Level 4: Competence in a significant
range of complex technical or
professional work activities performed
in a wide variety of contexts with a
substantial degree of personal
responsibility.
Level 5: Competence involving the
application of a significant range of
fundamental principles and complex
techniques in a wide variety of
contexts; very substantial personal
autonomy and often significant
responsibility for the work of others
and for the allocation of substantial
resources are strongly featured.
The first four levels have started operating
and coverage will be virtually complete by
164
EDUCATION
the end of 1994. The Government wants 50
per cent of the employed workforce to have
attained NVQJevel 3 or equivalent by the
year 2000.
The Council is also working on the
development of broadly based qualifications
for inclusion within the NVQ framework
which will prepare young people for a range
of related occupations and provide
progression to higher education.
The competence-based system is being
extended in Scotland through a new system
of Scottish Vocational Qualifications (SVQs)
along the lines of NVQs. SVQs are
accredited by the Scottish Vocational
Education Council. NVQs and SVQs have
equal recognition throughout Britain.
Under recent legislation, more general
job-related qualifications will be devised for
those seeking a broad preparation for
employment. The Government will promote
equality of status for academic and vocational
qualifications by developing new Ordinary
and Advanced Diplomas. Students gaining an
appropriate number of GCSE passes,
equivalent vocational qualifications or a
combination of these will receive the
Ordinary Diploma. The Advanced Diploma
will be awarded to those passing GCE A
level and AS level examinations, students
gaining vocational qualifications at the same
level and those with passes in a mixture of
the two.
Other Examining Bodies
The Business and Technology Education
Council (BTEC) plans and administers a
unified national system of courses at all levels
for students in industry, commerce and
public administration in England, Wales and
Northern Ireland.
The Scottish Vocational Education
Council (SCOTVEC) is the principal
examining and awarding body in the field of
further education in Scotland. A flexible
system of vocational courses for 16- to 18-
year-olds, based on short units of study, has
been introduced in schools and colleges in
disciplines like business and administration,
engineering and industrial production. These
courses are also intended to meet the needs
of many adults entering training or returning
to education. The courses lead to the award
of the non-advanced National Certificate.
Similar courses are also available at advanced
levels.
Qualifications in a range of occupational
areas are offered by the City and Guilds of
London Institute, and qualifications in
commercial and office practice are awarded
by the Royal Society of Arts.
Teacher Training
Almost all entrants to teaching in maintained
and special schools in England and Wales
complete a recognised course of initial teacher
training. Such courses are offered by
university departments of education as well as
other higher education establishments. Non¬
graduates usually qualify by taking a four-
year Bachelor of Education (BEd) honours
degree. There are also specially designed two-
year BEd courses—mostly in subjects where
there is a shortage of teachers at the
secondary level—for suitably qualified people.
Graduates normally take a one-year
Postgraduate Certificate of Education
(PGCE) course. Two-year PGCE courses are
available in the secondary shortage subjects
for those whose first degree in an associated
subject included at least one year’s study of
the subject they intend to teach.
Reforms
Under new government reforms in England
and Wales, schools will play a much larger
part in initial teacher training as full partners
of higher education institutions. Under new
criteria which will come into force in the
period between September 1992 and
September 1994, the amount of time spent by
students in schools during teacher training is
being increased so that at least two-thirds of
training will take place in the classroom.
Graduates on a 36-week one-year course, for
instance, will train in schools for at least 24
weeks instead of 15.
The Government expects that partner
schools and institutions will exercise a joint
responsibility for planning and managing
courses and for the selection, training and
165
BRITAIN 1993: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
assessment of students. Schools will train
students to teach their specialist subjects,
assess pupils and manage classes; they will
also supervise students and assess their
competence. Higher education institutions
will be responsible for ensuring that courses
meet requirements for academic validation,
presenting courses for accreditation and
awarding qualifications to successful
students.
Accreditation
Under recent reforms institutions rather than
courses will be accredited. An institution will
have to submit a five-year development plan
to the Council for the Accreditation of
Teacher Education (CATE). An inspection
by the schools inspectorates in England and
Wales will then take place, followed by a
response from the institution. CATE will
consider the inspectorate’s report and the
response and then make a recommendation
to the Secretary of State, who will take the
final decision on accreditation.
Other Training
Articled teacher courses, offering school-
based training for graduates, were introduced
in 1990. Trainees, who receive a bursary,
take on a progressively greater teaching load,
and formal training is provided both in initial
teacher-training institutions and in school by
college tutors and school teachers.
In 1989 the Government introduced a
licensed teacher scheme in England and
Wales for people without formal teacher¬
training qualifications but with relevant
qualifications and experience. Participants
generally have to complete a period of two
years of in-service training as a licensed
teacher before achieving qualified teacher
status. The Government has also made it
easier for teachers trained abroad to take up
posts in English and Welsh schools. Trained
teachers from other European Community
countries are automatically granted qualified
teacher status, while non-Community
teachers undergo a training and evaluation
period of between three months and two
years.
Scotland
In Scotland all teachers in education
authority schools must be registered with the
General Teaching Council for Scotland. It is
government policy that all entrants to the
teaching profession in Scotland should be
graduates. New primary teachers qualify
either through a four-year BEd course or a
one-year postgraduate course of teacher
training at a college of education. In
addition, the University of Stirling offers
courses which combine academic and
professional training for intending primary
and secondary teachers. Teachers of
academic subjects at secondary schools must
hold a degree containing two passes in the
subjects which they wish to teach.
Secondary teachers must undertake a one-
year postgraduate training course. For music
and technology, four-year BEd courses are
also available, and for physical education all
teachers take BEd courses.
All courses in Scotland have been revised
following recommendations of working
parties on teacher training. All new pre¬
service and major in-service courses
provided by colleges of education must be
approved by the Scottish Office Education
Department and a validating body.
Education authorities are to be asked to
implement national guidelines for the
introduction of systematic schemes of staff
development and appraisal. The
Government has taken reserve powers
requiring authorities to operate schemes
prescribed by it in the event of a breakdown
of voluntary agreements.
Northern Ireland
Teacher training in Northern Ireland is
provided by the two universities and two
colleges of education. The principal courses
are BEd Honours (four years), BA Honours
(Education) and the one-year Postgraduate
Certificate of Education. Education and
library boards have the statutory duty to
ensure that teachers are equipped with the
necessary skills to implement education
reforms and the Northern Ireland
Curriculum.
166
EDUCATION
Education-Business Links
The Government considers that co-operation
between the education system and business is
essential to help people of all ages acquire the
skills necessary to maintain Britain’s position
as a leading industrial and trading nation.
Much is being done under the
Government’s Technical and Vocational
Education Initiative (TVEI—see p 157), to
which £900 million has been allotted from
1987 to 1997, and through Education-
Business Partnerships (see below). As a
result of these and other initiatives, matters
relating to industry and commerce are being
embedded in the curricula of schools,
colleges and universities, and in
examinations. The relevance of classroom
activities to working life was central to the
thinking behind the introduction of the
General Certificate of Secondary Education
and the National Curriculum. In Scotland
this led to the introduction of Standard
Grade and revised Higher examinations
(see p 158) and other developments.
Businessmen and women are involved in
curriculum development and enterprise
activities for schoolchildren. In addition,
they are represented in greater numbers on
the governing bodies of schools and other
institutions.
A shift in provision is occurring in post¬
school education from the arts and social
sciences towards science, engineering,
technology and directly vocational courses.
Business and post-school education
institutions are being encouraged to
collaborate more closely for their mutual
benefit. The latter may give enterprise
training to students under the Government’s
Enterprise in Higher Education scheme to
help students acquire the expertise required
by industry.
Secondary School Education
Government policy is to ensure that every
year 10 per cent of teachers should be given
the opportunity to gain some business
experience; and that every trainee teacher
should have an appreciation of the needs of
employers. Some 30,000 teachers spent time
working in industry during 1991-92 under a
scheme administered by the Confederation
of British Industry.
The Government also wants all pupils to
have at least two weeks’ work experience
before leaving school. More than 71 per
cent of schoolchildren aged 15-16
undertook work experience placements in
1989. In addition, increasing numbers are
undertaking vocational work experience and
work shadowing placements between the
ages of 16 and 18. City technology colleges,
sponsored by industry and commerce,
provide a broadly based secondary education
for girls and boys of all abilities (see p 153).
Compacts
Under the Compacts scheme launched by
the Government in 1988, there are local
agreements between employers, local
education authorities and training providers.
Young people, supported by their school or
college, work to reach agreed targets, and
employers undertake to provide a job with
training or training leading to a job for
those attaining the targets. Some 700
schools are participating in Compact
schemes and 140,000 young people are
involved. The Government is making
available more than £28 million over four
years from 1990 to support Compacts,
which are being extended nationwide.
Education-Business Partnerships
The Government’s local Education-
Business Partnerships are formal bodies of
senior representatives from education,
business and the wider community.
Members work together to co-ordinate
school and college education-business links
and develop activities in their local areas.
Government funds for partnerships (£5
million in the period between 1991 and
1993) are distributed through Training and
Enterprise Councils (see p 168).
Post-school Education
A network of 82 employer-led Training and
Enterprise Councils (TECs) in England and
167
BRITAIN 1993: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Wales is intended to make training and
enterprise activities more relevant to the
needs of employers and individuals locally.
In Scotland, 22 Local Enterprise Companies
(LECs) have a similar role. The Training
and Employment Agency is responsible for
training and employment programmes and
activities in Northern Ireland.
Some TECs and LECs, working in close
co-operation with local education authorities
and other education interests, have been
running pilot schemes of Training Credits,
which offer an entitlement to train to
approved standards for young people
leaving full-time education.
Over 40 science parks have been set up
by higher education institutions in
conjunction with industrial scientists and
technologists to promote the development
and commercial application of advanced
technology. In addition, a network of
regional technology centres links colleges
and universities with local firms. Some are
operating on a fully commercial basis.
The Government’s LINK scheme
(see Chapter 21) aims to encourage firms to
work jointly with higher education
institutions on government-funded research
relevant to industrial needs.
Further Education for Adults
Adult education is provided by further
education colleges, adult colleges and
centres, and by voluntary bodies such as
the Workers’ Educational Association. From
April 1993, the duty to provide it will be
shared by the new further education funding
councils and by local education authorities.
In addition to cultural and craft pursuits,
students follow courses leading to academic
and vocational qualifications, and courses
which provide access to higher education.
Adults’ special educational needs for
literacy and numeracy are also met, and
there is provision for those seeking
proficiency in English as a second language.
ALBSU
The Adult Literacy and Basic Skills Unit
(ALBSU) is concerned with adult literacy,
numeracy and related basic skills in England
and Wales. It provides consultancy and
advisory services, organises staff training and
produces materials for teachers and students.
Government funding is £3-2 million in
1992-93. Another programme is Basic Skills
at Work, with government funding of
£3 million; it is targeted at unemployed
people and those in work who cannot
progress without better basic skills.
Open College
Open learning opportunities have been
extended with the formation in 1987 of the
Open College, an independent company set
up with government support. The College
brings together broadcasters, educationists
and sponsors, and provides vocational
education and training courses below degree
level. Up to £12 million is being allocated by
the Government for the College’s commercial
activities as well as £6 million for
broadcasting. Programmes are broadcast by
Channel 4. The Open College of the Arts, also
launched in 1987, offers an art foundation
course to those wishing to study at home.
National Institute of Adult Continuing
Education
The National Institute of Adult Continuing
Education is a centre of information, research,
development work and publication. It:
• advises and co-ordinates policy and
practice; and
• acts as a channel of communication for
the organisations it represents.
Scottish Community Education Council
The Scottish Community Education Council
advises the Government and promotes all
community education matters, including adult
literacy and basic education, and the youth
service in Scotland.
EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH
Educational research is supported financially
by central and local government, the
168
EDUCATION
Economic and Social Research Council
(see Chapter 21), philanthropic
organisations, higher education institutions,
teachers’ associations and certain
independent bodies.
The major research institution outside
the universities is the autonomous National
Foundation for Educational Research in
England and Wales. The Scottish Council
for Research in Education and the Northern
Ireland Council for Educational Research
have similar functions.
EDUCATIONAL LINKS OVERSEAS
Large numbers of people come to Britain
from overseas to study, and British people
work and train overseas. The British aid
programme encourages links between
educational institutions in Britain and
developing countries.
In schools, colleges and universities in
Britain there has been an expansion of
interest in European studies and languages,
with exchanges of teachers, schoolchildren
and students taking place. The exchange of
students is promoted by a European
Community scheme (ERASMUS) under
which grants are provided to enable
Community students to study in other
member states. Some 19,000 students from
Britain have benefited from the scheme.
The Community’s LINGUA programme
seeks to encourage the teaching and learning
of foreign languages throughout the
Community. It gives grants towards joint
educational projects and exchanges for
young people undergoing professional,
vocational and technical education; it also
covers measures to develop language training
materials for business.
The European Community Action
Programme for Education and Training for
Technology (COMETT) aims to foster
co-operation between higher education
establishments and commercial organisations
in technological training.
Community member states have created
nine European schools, including one at
Culham, Oxfordshire, to provide a
multinational education for the children of
staff employed in Community institutions.
Overseas Students in Britain
People come to Britain from all over the
world to study. British universities and
other further and higher education
establishments have built up their reputation
overseas by offering tuition of the highest
standards, maintaining low student-to-staff
ratios, and offering relevant courses and
qualifications.
In the academic year 1990-91 there were
about 87,000 overseas students at universities
and other public sector establishments of
further and higher education. In addition,
many thousands of people from abroad were
training for nursing, law, banking and
accountancy, and service and other
industries. About 40 per cent of all overseas
students were from the Commonwealth and
Britain’s dependent territories. There were
about 26,000 from the other European
Community member states.
About a third of students enrolled for
full-time postgraduate study or research in
Britain in 1990-91 came from overseas.
Several British colleges of further education
have entered into arrangements with British
universities to provide bridging courses for
overseas students before they enter
university.
Most overseas students pay their own
fees and expenses or hold awards from their
own governments. Those following courses
of higher or further education pay fees
which cover the full cost of their courses.
Nationals of other member countries of the
European Community generally pay the
lower level of fees that applies to British
students; if their courses are designated for
mandatory awards, they may be eligible
for fees-only awards from local education
authorities.
Government Scholarship Schemes
The Government makes considerable
provision for students and trainees from
overseas under its overseas aid programme
and other award and scholarship schemes. In
1990-91 nearly 25,000 overseas students
were supported, including some studying
overseas, at a cost of more than £140 million.
169
BRITAIN 1993: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Under the Overseas Development
Administration Shared Scholarship Scheme,
190 awards were offered in 1991-92,
primarily at postgraduate level, for students
from the developing countries of the
Commonwealth, with costs being shared
between the British Government and the
educational institutions.
The Foreign & Commonwealth Office
Scholarships and Awards Scheme
(FCOSAS), which operates in some 140
countries, is designed to bring to Britain
present and future leaders, decision-makers
and formers of opinion. A notable feature of
the FCOSAS is the increasing number of
awards jointly financed by the Foreign &
Commonwealth Office in partnership with
the private sector and academic institutions.
The Department of Trade and Industry also
finances a trade-related scholarship scheme
in partnership with British industry.
Outside the aid programme, the Overseas
Research Students Awards Scheme, funded
by the Department for Education, provides
assistance for overseas research students of
high ability to attend British universities.
Other Schemes
Many public and private scholarships and
fellowships are available to students from
overseas and to British students who want
to study overseas. Among the best known,
and open to men and women in all walks of
life, are the British Council Scholarships,
the Commonwealth Scholarship and
Fellowship Plan, the Fulbright Scholarship
Scheme, the Marshall Scholarships, the
Rhodes Scholarships, the Churchill
Scholarships and the Confederation of
British Industry Scholarships. Most British
universities and colleges offer scholarships
for which graduates of any nationality are
eligible.
English as a Foreign Language
The continuing increase in interest in
English as a foreign language is reflected in
the growth of public sector English language
courses and in the number of private
language schools in Britain. Over 240
private schools are recognised by the British
Council. The Council has English-language
teaching centres in other countries and also
runs a programme for teaching English
related to specific jobs and skills. Other
British language schools enable people to
learn English in their own countries, while
in Britain university language and linguistics
departments are an important resource. The
Government’s aid programme supports the
teaching of English in many developing
countries. Publications and other material
relating to English language teaching have
increased in number and are now a large
component in many publishers’ lists,
constituting a major export.
BBC English, the English teaching arm
of the BBC’s World Service, offers a
worldwide facility for the individual learner
at home on radio and, with the advent of
the new World Service Television operation,
increasingly on television.
Educational Exchanges
British Council
The British Council promotes cultural and
educational relations with other countries. It
plays an important part in the management
of the aid programme to education. Its main
functions are to:
• recruit teachers for work overseas;
• organise short overseas visits by British
experts;
• encourage cultural exchange visits; and
• foster academic interchange between
British higher education institutions and
those in other countries.
Co-operation between higher education
in Britain and developing countries is
promoted with funding from the Overseas
Development Administration. It is brought
about through recruiting staff for overseas

EDUCATION
Central Bureau for Educational Visits and
Exchanges
The national Central Bureau for Educational
Visits and Exchanges, funded by the
Government, provides information and
advice on all forms of educational visits and
exchanges. In addition, it:
• administers and develops a wide range of
curriculum-related exchange schemes;
• links educational establishments and local
education authorities with their
counterparts in other countries; and
• organises meetings, workshops and
conferences on professional international
experience.
The Bureau administers teacher
exchanges in Europe and the United States,
short courses for language teachers, and
international study visits. Opportunities for
young people include school and class links
and English language summer camps. For
the post-16 age group, there are work
placements and English language assistants’
posts, as well as other exchange programmes.
Association of Commonwealth Universities
The Association of Commonwealth
Universities promotes contact and
co-operation between nearly 400 member
universities in 31 Commonwealth countries
or regions. It assists student and staff
mobility by administering award schemes,
including, for Britain, the Commonwealth
Scholarship and Fellowship Plan and the
Overseas Development Administration
Shared Scholarship Scheme, and by
operating an academic appointments service.
It publishes information about
Commonwealth universities, courses and
scholarships, and organises meetings in
different parts of the world.
Other Organisations
The Commonwealth Education Liaison
Committee supplements normal direct
dealings on education between
Commonwealth countries. The United
Kingdom Council for Overseas Student
Affairs is an independent body serving
overseas students, and those concerned with
student affairs.
The Youth Exchange Centre, managed by
the British Council, gives advice,
information, training and grants to British
youth groups involved in international
exchanges. The Centre is the national
agency for the European Community-
sponsored exchange scheme, Youth for
Europe.
The Youth Service
The purpose of the youth service is to help
young people develop their potential as
individuals in the transition from childhood
to adult life. It is voluntary and is managed
by local authorities and independent
organisations.
The National Youth Agency, which is
funded by the Government, supports the
service and promotes partnership between
the two sectors. The Agency’s functions
include curriculum development, youth
worker training, support for managers of
organisations within the youth service and
support for international work. It is also
responsible for collecting and publishing
information on youth service matters.
The Welsh Office provides grant aid to
national youth service bodies with
headquarters in Wales and has established a
Wales Youth Agency which is similar to the
Agency in England.
In Scotland the youth service forms a
part of adult education, which is integrated
within community education. The Scottish
Community Education Council has the role
of promoting community education. The
Youth Council for Northern Ireland, with
executive and advisory powers, was set up in
1990.
Voluntary Youth Organisations
National voluntary youth organisations
undertake the major share of youth activities
through local groups, which raise most of
their day-to-day expenses by their own
efforts. Many receive financial and other
171
BRITAIN 1993: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
help from local education authorities, which
also make available facilities in many areas.
The voluntary organisations vary greatly in
character and include the uniformed
organisations like the Scouts and Girl Guides.
Other organisations are church-based. Some
also represent Jews and Muslims. Sport and
the arts are catered for. Many local
authorities and voluntary youth organisations
have responded to new needs in society by
making provision, for example, for the young
unemployed, young people from the ethnic
minorities, young people in inner cities or
rural areas and those in trouble or especially
vulnerable. Other areas of concern are
homelessness and provision for handicapped
young people.
Many authorities have youth committees
on which official and voluntary bodies are
represented, and employ youth officers to co¬
ordinate youth work and to arrange in-service
training. There are also youth councils, which
are representative bodies of young people
from local youth organisations.
Youth Workers
In England and Wales a two-year training
course at certain universities and higher
education colleges leads to the status of
qualified youth and community worker;
several undergraduate part-time and
postgraduate courses are also available. In
Scotland one- , two- and three-year courses
are provided at colleges of education and in
Northern Ireland courses are run by the
University of Ulster.
An estimated 6,000 full-time youth
workers are supported by some 535,000 part-
time workers, both qualified and unqualified,
many of them unpaid. Short courses and
conferences are held on youth and community
work. There are also in-service courses for
serving youth workers and officers. Initial and
in-service courses are professionally validated
by the National Youth Agency. Youth
counselling is supported by the National
Association of Young People’s Counselling
and Advisory Services.
Other Organisations Concerned with
Young People
Finance is provided by many grant-giving
foundations and trusts for activities involving
young people. King George’s Jubilee Trust
supports work involving young people aged 8
to 25. The Queen’s Silver Jubilee Trust
supports young people up to the age of 25
involved in voluntary community service
work. In addition, The Prince’s Trust assists
disadvantaged young people aged 14 to 25.
The Duke of Edinburgh’s Award Scheme
enables young people from Britain and other
Commonwealth countries to take part, with
voluntary help from adults, in challenging
activities such as community service,
expeditions, the development of personal
interests and social and practical skills, and
physical recreation.
Voluntary Service by Young People
Thousands of young people voluntarily
undertake community service designed to
help those in need, including elderly and
disabled people. Organisations providing
opportunities for community service, such as
Community Service Volunteers, International
Voluntary Service and the British Trust for
Conservation Volunteers, receive grants from
the Government. Many schools also organise
community service work as part of the
curriculum, and voluntary work in the
community is sponsored by a number of
churches.
Young Volunteers in the Community
recruits young people aged 16 to 24 to work
on a variety of community projects for 12 to
18 weeks. It is operated jointly by The
Prince’s Trust and the Commission on
Citizenship.

8 Planning, Urban
Regeneration and
Housing
Britain seeks to reconcile the conflicting
demands for land from business, housing,
transport, farming and leisure, and to protect
the environment by means of a
comprehensive statutory system of land-use
planning and development control. A
comprehensive programme to revitalise the
inner cities and other urban areas, such as
peripheral housing estates, includes a number
of initiatives designed to encourage
enterprise, employment and educational
opportunities, and to improve the quality of
housing and the urban environment.
Planning
The system of land-use planning in Great
Britain involves local authorities acting under
the supervision of the Secretaries of State for
the Environment, Wales and Scotland.1 The
Department of the Environment brings
together the major responsibilities in England
for land-use planning, housing and
construction, countryside policy and
environmental protection. The Welsh Office
and the Scottish Office have broadly
equivalent responsibilities.
These departments provide national and
regional guidance on planning matters, while
strategic planning at the county level is the
responsibility of the county councils. District
councils are responsible for local plans and
development control. In the metropolitan
areas and London, the borough and district
councils are preparing new unitary
1 For further details see Planning (Aspects of Britain: HMSO,
1992).
development plans for each administrative
area. In Scotland the planning context is set
by the Scottish Office and planning functions
are undertaken by regional and district
councils, whose responsibilities are divided on
a basis broadly similar to that in England and
Wales. In the more rural regions and the
islands, the regional and islands councils
respectively have responsibility for planning.
In Northern Ireland the Department of the
Environment for Northern Ireland is
responsible for planning matters through six
divisional planning offices, which work
closely with the district councils.
Most development requires ‘planning
permission’; applications are dealt with in the
light of development plans (which set out
land use strategies for each area on such
matters as housing and industry) and other
material planning considerations. However,
many minor developments do not need
specific planning permission. Government
policy is to remove unnecessary planning
controls as part of its policy to promote
enterprise. The Government’s aim is for the
maximum use to be made of urban land for
new development, having regard to the need
to retain green spaces within the urban
environment and the need to ensure that the
cumulative effects of development do not
harm the character of established residential
areas.
Development Plans
The present development plan system in
England and Wales involves structure, local
and unitary development plans:
173
BRITAIN 1993: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
• structure plans, prepared by county
planning authorities, set out broad
policies for the development and other
use of land;
• local plans provide detailed guidance for
development expected to start within
about ten years and are normally
prepared by district councils in general
conformity with the approved structure
plan; and
• unitary development plans set out both
strategic and detailed land use and
development policies for metropolitan
districts or boroughs.
Plans are kept under review and may be
altered from time to time. Planning
authorities must take account of any strategic
or regional guidance issued by the Secretary
of State when formulating the plans.
In Scotland structure plans are prepared
by regional or islands authorities, and local
plans by those districts with planning
responsibilities, and by general planning and
islands authorities. Under Northern Ireland’s
single-tier system, plans are prepared by the
Department of the Environment for Northern
Ireland.
The Planning and Compensation Act 1991
has reformed the planning system in the non¬
metropolitan areas of England and Wales by
introducing mandatory district-wide local
plans and streamlining procedures for their
adoption. Under the new system, the
strategic role of the counties remains, but
their planning policies are not subject to the
formal approval of the Secretary of State.
They are, however, required to ensure that
their statements are consistent with any
regional guidance from the Secretary of State.
Public Participation
Members of the public are given an
opportunity to express their views on the
planning of their area during the early stages
of plan preparation. Local planning
authorities must ensure publicity for the
proposed content of their plans;
representations may be made to the
authorities. There are also provisions for
objecting to draft plans, and for hearing and
resolving such objections.
There is a long-standing requirement for
certain planning applications to be publicised
locally—for example where proposals for
development differ greatly from the
intentions of a development plan or those
affecting conservation areas. In Scotland a
neighbour notification system requires the
applicant to notify the owners and occupiers
of land and buildings adjoining the site of a
proposed development at the same time as
the application is submitted to the local
planning authority.
During 1992, the Government will
introduce a requirement that all
planning applications in England and
Wales receive publicity. The exact
form of publicity required varies
between types of development; it
includes site notices, newspaper
advertising and neighbour notification.
The applicant has a right of appeal to the
Secretary of State if the local authority
refuses planning permission, grants it with
conditions attached or fails to decide an
application within eight weeks. Such appeals
are decided either on the basis of written
submissions or, generally in the case of
important applications, after a public inquiry.
Similar provision is made in Northern
Ireland for public participation in the
planning process and for the hearing ot
representations at public inquiries. For
planning applications which do not give rise
to public inquiries the applicant has a right of
appeal to the independent Planning Appeals
Commission.
Major Schemes
For projects which are likely to have
significant effects upon the environment, a
planning application must be accompanied by
an environmental statement. This should
describe the likely significant environmental
effects and propose measures to avoid, reduce
or remedy any significant adverse effects
identified. Planning permission cannot be
given without first taking into consideration
the environmental statement for the project
and representations received in response to its
174
PLANNING, URBAN REGENERATION AND HOUSING
publication. The public must be given the
opportunity to comment on the statement,
and copies will be sent to relevant public
bodies, such as the Countryside Commission
and English Nature, so that they can make
representations to the local planning
authority.
The Secretaries of State can direct that a
planning application be referred to them for
decision. This power to ‘call in’ is generally
exercised only for proposals which raise
planning issues of national or regional
importance. The applicant and the local
planning authority have the right to be heard
by a person appointed by the Secretary of
State for that purpose and a public inquiry
will normally be held. In Northern Ireland,
major planning applications are dealt with
under the Planning (NI) Order 1991, which
allows for a public inquiry in certain
circumstances.
New Towns
The 32 new towns designated since 1946—21
in England, two in Wales, five in Scotland
and four in Northern Ireland—have now
largely achieved their aims of dispersal of
industry and population from congested cities
and the stimulation of regional economies.
The new towns have a total population of
over 2 million; several have become important
regional centres.
Architectural Standards
High standards in new building are welcomed
by the Government, although it encourages
local planning authorities not to impose their
architectural tastes on developers. The
Department of the Environment, in
collaboration with the independent Royal
Institute of British Architects (RIBA) and the
National House-Building Council, sponsors
the biennial Housing Design Awards Scheme
for England and Northern Ireland, with
categories for renovation as well as new
building. Scotland and Wales have similar
award schemes. Royal Fine Art Commissions
for England and Wales and for Scotland
advise government departments, planning
authorities and other public bodies on
questions of public amenity or artistic
importance.
The RIBA, the principal professional body
for architects, together with the Architects
Registration Council of the United Kingdom,
exercises control over standards in
architectural education and encourages high
architectural standards in the profession. The
Royal Incorporation of Architects in Scotland
is allied to it, as is the Royal Society of
Ulster Architects. The Government is
reviewing the arrangements for the
registration of architects.
Urban Regeneration
Despite much progress in urban regeneration,
areas of deprivation still exist. These
relatively small areas can have a blighting
effect on a city’s image. The Government is
therefore continuing to tackle urban
deprivation.
The ‘Action for Cities’ initiative, launched
in 1988, brought together a comprehensive
package for revival in England, involving
government departments in a co-ordinated
effort. Urban problems in Scotland, Wales
and Northern Ireland are being tackled by
Partnerships, the Programme for the Valleys
and Belfast Action Teams respectively, as
well as by many other government
programmes. The Government spends some
£4,000 million a year in the inner cities,
spread across this range of programmes.
Task Forces
A total of 16 inner city Task Forces have
been set up in England to bring together and
focus the efforts of government departments,
local government, the private sector and the
local community to regenerate inner cities.
Task Forces consist of small teams of civil
servants and secondees from local authorities
and the private and voluntary sector, based in
the most deprived parts of their tightly-
defined inner city areas (see map, pp 178-9).
They aim to help local people by increasing
their chances of gaining employment and by
building up local businesses. They also
support schemes which improve the
environment or reduce crime where these are
175
BRITAIN 1993: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
linked directly to the creation of jobs. Since
their inception they have committed some
£100 million to about 4,000 projects. They
are not permanent; an important part of their
work is to build up local organisations to
which they can hand over as they withdraw.
The Government has announced that four
new Task Forces will be set up in 1993, two
of them linked to a City Challenge scheme
(see below).
City Action Teams
Eight City Action Teams (CATs) co-ordinate
government efforts in inner city areas and
encourage partnerships between business,
local and central government, the voluntary
sector and local people. They bring together
senior officials of three government
departments—Employment, Environment,
and Trade and Industry—to ensure that the
main programmes for which each is
responsible are working together effectively.
CATs are a primary point of contact with
local authorities on City Challenge.
Each CAT has a small budget to assist
co-ordination of government action in the
inner city. CAT grants are available to local
authorities, businesses, local community
groups and voluntary organisations working in
or moving to an inner city area. Total CAT
spending of £8 3 million in 1991-92 funded
380 projects, bringing in some £13-1 million
of private and other public sector investment.
It helped to create or safeguard 2,300 jobs,
provide or enhance 2,700 training places and
support 1,000 small or medium-sized
businesses.
Urban Programme
The Urban Programme is a special allocation
to selected local authorities in England in
addition to their normal resources. It is
concentrated on target areas (see map,
pp 178-9) where the problems are greatest
and the levels of deprivation most severe,
so as to achieve a greater impact with
available funds. The local authorities
concerned receive 75 per cent grant from
central government to cover spending on
approved projects. The programme supports
some 9,000 projects at any one time and is
directed at economic, environmental and
social problems.
In 1991-92 the Urban Programme was
estimated to have supported some 1,100 new
firms, helped to create or preserve 34,000
jobs and supported 68,000 training places. It
improved 8,000 buildings and about 2,400
hectares (5,900 acres) of unsightly land. It
also supported environmental improvement
schemes for 90,000 dwellings. The
Government has allocated £269 million for
spending on the Urban Programme in
England alone in 1992-93.
City Challenge
The Government’s City Challenge initiative
was launched in May 1991. Under this
programme, local authorities are invited to
submit imaginative and innovative plans for
regenerating key neighbourhoods by tackling
the problems of physical decay, lack of
opportunity and poor quality of life. The best
of these proposals receive a commitment of
government funding for up to five years. The
local authority provides the leadership in
developing and implementing the plan, but it
draws on the talent and expertise of local
communities, the private sector, academic
institutions, statutory agencies and the
voluntary sector.
Programmes involving 11 authorities
commenced in April 1992. The Government
has set aside £82-5 million a year over a five-
year period to assist these areas. There will
be additional spending by the local authorities
themselves, the private sector and other
bodies. The second round competition for
projects commencing in 1993-94 was open to
all 57 Urban Programme authorities in
England, from which 20 authorities with the
most imaginative and achievable proposals
were selected to receive £37 5 million each
over five years.
City Grant
City Grant is available to encourage private
sector developments in inner cities in
England. It is paid direct to the private sector
for projects which contribute to the
176
PLANNING, URBAN REGENERATION AND HOUSING
regeneration of Urban Programme areas. By
April 1992, 267 schemes had been approved,
with ^238 million of public money bringing
in £ 1,040 million of private investment.
Under these schemes, some 36,000 jobs and
7,600 homes were being provided and 500
hectares (1,230 acres) were being reclaimed.
Urban Development Corporations
Twelve urban development corporations
(UDCs) have been set up by the Government
in order to reverse large-scale urban decline.
London Docklands and Merseyside were
established in 1981. By the end of March
1992 the London Docklands Development
Corporation had received over £1^47 million
in government grant and secured private
investment commitments of over £9,000
million. It has reclaimed over 600 hectares
(1,500 acres) of derelict land for housing,
commercial and recreational use. Over 17,000
homes have been completed and, up to
March 1991, 41,000 jobs had been attracted
to the area. The Merseyside Development
Corporation has reclaimed 312 hectares (700
acres) of derelict land, and 284,000 sq m
(3 1 million sq ft) of commercial or industrial
floorspace have been built or refurbished in
its area.
Ten further UDCs have been set up:
Birmingham Heartlands, Black Country
(West Midlands), Bristol, Leeds, Central
Manchester, Sheffield, Trafford Park (Greater
Manchester), Teesside, and Tyne and Wear
in England; and Cardiff Bay in Wales. UDCs
cover about 16,000 hectares (about 40,000
acres), and public expenditure on the
programme will be £481 million in 1992-93.
Enterprise and Simplified Planning
Zones
Since 1981 the Government has set up 27
‘enterprise zones’ (see map, pp 178-9). Each
zone runs for a period of ten years from
designation; the earlier zones have therefore
reached the end of their lives. Benefits in the
zones include:
• exemption from the uniform business rate
(the local property tax payable by non¬
domestic property owners);
• 100 per cent allowances for corporation
and income tax purposes for capital
expenditure on industrial and commercial
buildings;
• a much simplified planning system; and
• a reduction in government requests for
statistical information.
The Government does not propose to
extend the scheme generally, although in
exceptional circumstances a new zone might
be created as the best way of tackling a
particular local problem; for example, the
Government has announced that it intends to
create a new enterprise zone in Scotland in
an area affected by the closure of a steel
works.
The declaration of ‘simplified planning
zones’ by local planning authorities became
possible from 1987; they are intended to
stimulate regeneration by removing the
uncertainty from the planning system. They
use a simplified planning framework similar
to that used in enterprise zones, under which
advance planning permission is given for
specified types of development within a zone.
A simplified planning zone scheme lasts for
ten years.
Land Reclamation and Use
The Government is committed to the
establishment of a new Urban Regeneration
Agency to co-ordinate efforts to bring derelict
land back into effective use and provide new
opportunities for local people. Its role would
be to promote the reclamation of derelict land
throughout England and develop it in
partnership with the private, public and
voluntary sectors.
In England government grants are
available to local authorities and to other
public bodies, to the private sector and to
nationalised industries for the reclamation of
such land in order to bring it into beneficial
use or to improve its appearance. Since 1979
some 16,500 hectares (40,700 acres) of
derelict land in England have been
reclaimed with the help of Derelict Land
Grant. The 1992-93 programme of
£106 million should allow an additional
1,500 hectares (some 3,700 acres) to be

reclaimed. The total amount of derelict land
in England fell by 11 per cent between 1982
and 1988.
New government plans to prevent
land becoming derelict were
announced in February 1992. The two
main proposals are the wider use of
conditions in planning permissions
requiring restoration for certain
industrial uses and additional powers
for local authorities to reclaim
derelict land and seek a financial
contribution towards the cost from
the owner.
In Scotland responsibility for derelict land
reclamation rests with the enterprise bodies
Scottish Enterprise, Highlands and Islands
Enterprise and the Local Enterprise
Companies. They may acquire and reclaim
land either by agreement or compulsorily;
increasingly they seek to work with the
private sector to bring land back into use. In
Wales the Welsh Development Agency may
acquire and reclaim land or make grants to
local authorities for that purpose. Land use is
also encouraged by the Land Authority for
Wales, a statutory body with powers to make
land available for development in
circumstances where the private sector would
find this difficult or impossible. In Northern
Ireland grants may be paid to landowners
who restore or improve derelict sites.
Registers of Unused and Under-used
Land
Since 1989 local authorities, nationalised
industries and other public bodies in England
have been responsible for compiling registers
of any unused or under-used land they hold.
These owners’ registers have largely replaced
a register compiled by the Secretary of State
for the Environment. The Secretary of
State’s register is, however, being retained for
the time being because his power to direct
public bodies to dispose of land applies only
to land entered on his register. By the end of
May 1992, directions had been issued in
respect of 83 sites. Under the ‘Public Request
to Order Disposal’ scheme the public is
encouraged to request such directions.
Registers are also published for certain areas
of Wales.
Education, Training and Employment
The first of a network of City Technology
Colleges was opened near Birmingham in
1988; 13 are currently in operation, with
another two to open in future years. Intended
to raise educational standards, the colleges are
established jointly by the Government and
industry.
A number of schools/industry ‘Compacts’
have been introduced since August 1988 in
nearly all English Urban Programme areas.
Groups of employers work with schools to
guarantee a job with training for all school-
leavers aged 16 to 18 who meet agreed targets
for motivation and achievement. By May
1992 there were 62 Compacts operational,
with some 140,000 young people, 10,000
employers and training organisations and
about 700 schools involved. The success of
the Compacts initiative has stimulated the
development of wider Education-Business
Partnerships throughout England and Wales.
These Partnerships are formal bodies
bringing together employers, schools and
colleges, local education authorities and
community representatives to help young
people reach their highest potential.
Training programmes, such as Youth
Training for young people and Employment
Training, aimed particularly at adults
unemployed for more than six months and
those with special needs, are helping many
people in the inner cities. In mid-1992, one-
third of young people participating in Youth
Training were from inner cities. Nearly half
of all unemployed people who have joined
Employment Training in England since
September 1988 are inner city residents.
There are some 110 Employment Service
‘outreach’ staff based in or visiting inner city
areas, helping unemployed people look for
jobs and encouraging them to participate in
employment and training programmes. In
mid-1992, there were about 500 inner city
Jobclubs, many catering for people with
literacy and numeracy or language difficulties.
In addition, Employment Service regional
180
PLANNING, URBAN REGENERATION AND HOUSING
directors have funds for innovative projects to
help unemployed people in inner cities and
other deprived areas back into work or
training. These projects often involve
partnerships with other organisations or
employers. Many of the independent
Training and Enterprise Councils (see p 168)
are working in Task Force areas, City
Challenge areas or other pockets of
deprivation to create training opportunities
tailored to the needs of people living there.
Other Measures
Higher than average crime rates, and the fear
of crime, are particular problems in the inner
cities. Safer Cities schemes bring together all
sections of the local community to tackle
crime-related problems. A total of 20 Safer
Cities schemes are under way, supporting
2,400 local crime prevention initiatives with
the help of grants worth £14-5 million. The
Government is committed to doubling the
number of Safer Cities schemes to cover 40
urban areas.
The starting point for a scheme is the
preparation of a detailed local crime profile,
which a Home Office project team can then
use to draw up an action plan. Examples of
help include improving street lighting and
fitting good quality locks to houses on estates
with a high burglary rate.
Under the new Urban Crime Fund
scheme, an additional £11 million has
been made available in 1992-93
through the Urban Programme to
three police authorities—Merseyside,
Northumbria and West Yorkshire—to
help tackle crime and provide a better
environment in the inner cities.
The Government encourages tourism as a
force for the improvement of inner city areas.
Several major projects which create a cultural
and artistic focus for inner city regeneration
have been undertaken. Examples include the
development of the Museum of Science and
Technology in the Castlefields area of
Manchester and the International Convention
Centre in Birmingham. The English Tourist
Board and regional tourist boards encourage
promotional activities in inner city areas
through local area initiatives which bring
together the tourist boards, local authorities,
the private sector and other agencies.
The Government’s priorities for inner city
housing are to secure a wide range of good
quality housing available for rent or purchase,
and to improve conditions and opportunities
for residents, particularly on local authority
estates (see p 187).
Research
Research is commissioned by the
Government to inform the development of
policies assisting inner city regeneration and
the return of derelict land to productive use.
Spending on the inner city and derelict land
research programmes is expected to be
£860,000 in 1992-93.
Wales
Spending on the Urban Programme in Wales
is expected to be some £31 million in
1992-93. All local authorities are eligible to
apply. Some of the spending will for the first
time be targeted at wards rather than at
whole districts, so that small pockets of
deprivation in otherwise prosperous areas can
benefit. About half the total will be targeted
at the ten most deprived districts in Wales.
The Government aims to remove much of
the remaining major industrial dereliction in
Wales by the end of the 1990s.
The Programme for the Valleys, launched
in 1988, is the most extensive programme
of economic and urban regeneration
undertaken in Wales, and covers an area of
some 2,200 sq km (860 sq miles) in the south
Wales valleys (see map, p 179). It involves
increased levels of factory building, land
clearance and Urban Programme support, as
well as action to:
• stimulate private enterprise;
• improve health care and educational
services;
• support private housing improvements;
and
• strengthen tourism, the arts and
voluntary organisations.
181
BRITAIN 1993: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Some £19 million of Urban Programme
support will benefit the Valleys in 1992-93.
The Cardiff Bay Development Corporation
was set up in 1987 to bring forward
redevelopment in an area of south Cardiff,
once its commercial centre. By the end of
March 1992 the Corporation had received
£127 million in government grant.
Government support for the Corporation in
1992-93 will be £35 million. The
Corporation’s regeneration strategy includes
proposals for the construction of a barrage
across Cardiff harbour mouth, which would
create a large freshwater lake and 12 km (7
miles) of waterside frontage. It is expected
that about 30,000 new jobs will be created
and that over £1,500 million of private
investment will be attracted.
Scotland
In 1988 the Government set out in the White
Paper New Life for Urban Scotland its strategy
for improving the quality of life for people
living on peripheral estates in Scotland.
Building on the experience gained from inner
city regeneration schemes such as the
Glasgow Eastern Area Renewal, the main aim
of the strategy was to encourage residents to
take more responsibility for the improvement
of their own communities.
The focus of this effort was the
establishment of four Partnerships led by the
Scottish Office and involving other bodies
and groups, including the former Scottish
Development Agency and the Training
Agency (now both part of Scottish
Enterprise—see pH), Scottish Homes, the
local authorities, the private sector and the
local communities. These four Partnerships
have been set up in areas of Dundee,
Edinburgh, Glasgow and Paisley. Their
objectives include plans to:
• improve the type and tenure mix of
housing available to local people;
• improve employment prospects by
providing increased avenues for training
and further education; and
• tackle social and environmental problems
on the estates.
Other peripheral estates continue to receive
substantial support through such sources as
the Urban Programme and Scottish
Enterprise, as do inner city areas in Scotland.
The Government is committed to seeking
ways to improve the Partnerships and to
strengthening the Urban Programme in
Scotland by emphasising those projects which
form part of a concerted effort to assist a
deprived area.
The Urban Programme in Scotland has
grown from £44 million in 1988—89 to over
£81 million in 1992-93. In addition to any
new projects approved, these resources
already support about 1,200 existing projects.
The Safer Cities programme in Scotland
comprises projects in Edinburgh, Glasgow
and Dundee. Another is being established in
Aberdeen. Central funding for the
programme in 1992-93 extends to £900,000.
The Local Enterprise Companies
(see p 168), contracted to Scottish Enterprise,
have substantial budgets and a flexible range
of powers and functions to improve the
environment and encourage business and
employment in their areas. In particular,
Scottish Enterprise operates a Local
Enterprise Grants for Urban Projects scheme,
which aims to encourage private sector
investment for projects in deprived areas.
The areas of need in which the scheme
operates include the four Partnership areas,
as well as other areas showing similar
characteristics of deprivation. The Local
Enterprise Companies can support projects in
their areas up to a limit of £250,000. Greater
amounts can be spent with the approval of
Scottish Enterprise or the Scottish Office.
The Compact scheme (see p 167) has been
introduced in Scotland, with ten Compacts in
operation and four under consideration. Some
9,000 young people and more than 1,000
employers and training organisations are
involved with the operational Compacts. The
Training and Enterprise Grants scheme is
designed to increase access to employment
opportunities for young and long-term
unemployed people.
Northern Ireland
A comprehensive development programme
aims to revitalise the commercial areas of
182
PLANNING, URBAN REGENERATION AND HOUSING
Belfast. In 1992-93 regeneration programmes
had a combined allocation of over
£32 million. Nine Action Teams have been
established to tackle the problems of
particularly deprived areas of the city. The
‘Making Belfast Work’ initiative, launched in
1988, is designed to reinforce the efforts to
alleviate the economic, educational, social and
environmental problems in the most
disadvantaged areas of Belfast. In addition to
extensive funding already allocated to
mainstream departmental programmes,
Making Belfast Work has provided a further
£124 million for the period 1988-89 to
1993-94. The Laganside Corporation was
established in 1989 to regenerate Belfast’s
riverside area. Its government grant in
1992-93 is £6 2 million.
Housing
The pattern of housing tenure has changed
considerably in recent years, with a
substantial increase in owner-occupation and
a decline in private renting.
The promotion of home ownership and
more choice in the rented sector are central to
government housing policy. New house
construction is undertaken by both public and
private sectors, but the majority of dwellings
are now built by the private sector for sale to
owner-occupiers. Housing associations are
becoming the main providers of new housing
in the subsidised rented sector. Local
authorities are being encouraged to see their
housing role as more of an enabling one,
working with housing associations and the
private sector to increase the supply of low-
cost housing for rent without necessarily
providing it themselves. This allows them to
concentrate their resources on improving the
management of their own stock. In order to
stimulate the private rented sector, which has
declined to less than 8 per cent of the total
stock, rents on new private sector lettings in
Great Britain have been deregulated.
Administration
The Secretary of State for the Environment
in England and the Secretaries of State for
Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland are
responsible for formulating housing policy
and supervising the housing programme.
Although the policies are broadly similar
throughout Britain, provisions in Northern
Ireland and Scotland differ somewhat from
those in England and Wales.
The construction or structural alteration of
housing is subject to building regulations laid
down by the Government. In addition, most
new houses are covered by warranty
arrangements provided either by the National
House-Building Council or the Housing
Standards Company Ltd. Both organisations
set standards and enforce them by inspection,
and provide cover against major structural
defects for not less than ten years.
Home Ownership
Over the last 40 years the proportion of
people owning their own homes has risen
from 29 per cent to 67 per cent, and the
number of owner-occupied dwellings in
Great Britain amounted to over 15-3 million
at the end of 1991, compared with some
41 million in 1950. Most public sector
tenants have the right to buy the homes they
occupy. Local authorities have been asked to
encourage low-cost home ownership in a
variety of ways. Scottish Homes has a scheme
to encourage private developers to build for
owner-occupation or market rents in areas
they would not normally consider. In
1992-93 the funding available will be about
£26 million. In Northern Ireland shared
ownership has been developed by the
Northern Ireland Co-ownership Housing
Association.
Mortgage Loans
Most people buy their homes with a
mortgage loan, with the property as security.
Building societies are the largest source of
such loans, although banks and other
financial institutions also take a significant
share of the mortgage market, while some
companies also make loans for house
purchase available to their own employees.
The amount that lenders are prepared to
advance to a would-be house purchaser is
183
BRITAIN 1993: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
generally calculated as a multiple of his or
her annual income, typically up to two-and-a-
half times earnings, and the term of the loan
is commonly 25 years. The two main forms
of mortgage are ‘repayment’ and ‘endowment’
mortgages. In the former, the borrower
repays principal and interest on the sum
outstanding. In the latter, he or she pays only
interest to the lender but also puts money
into an endowment policy, which on maturity
provides a lump sum to repay the principal.
Owner-occupiers get basic rate tax relief on
interest payments on mortgages of up to
£30,000 on their main home.
A package of measures to protect
homeowners from unnecessary
repossession owing to arrears was
announced by the Government in
December 1991. These include
provision for benefits covering
mortgage interest to be paid directly
to lenders, and agreement with the
mortgage lenders on the introduction
of schemes to help borrowers in
difficulty remain in their homes.
The Government is committed to
extending the existing rights of leasehold
enfranchisement in England and Wales. It
plans to give residential leaseholders in blocks
of flats the collective right to acquire the
freehold of their block at market prices.
Leaseholders who live in blocks that do not
qualify would have new rights to buy an
extended lease. Leasehold is not a common
form of residential tenure in Scotland.
Public Sector Housing
Most of the public housing in Great Britain
is provided by 460 local housing authorities.
These are:
• the district councils in England and
Wales, apart from in London;
• the London borough councils and the
Common Council of the City of London;
and
• in Scotland, the district and islands
councils.
Public housing is also provided by the new
town authorities, Scottish Homes (which has
a stock of some 66,000 houses) and the
Development Board for Rural Wales,
although the latter aims to transfer all its
1,200 houses to other social landlords by
March 1993. The Northern Ireland Housing
Executive is responsible for the provision and
management of public housing in Northern
Ireland. Public housing authorities in Great
Britain own some 51 million houses and
flats; the Northern Ireland Housing
Executive owns over 162,000 homes. A
number of local authorities have transferred
all their housing stock to housing
associations, and others are considering doing
so. The Government is committed to the
introduction of compulsory competitive
tendering into local authority housing
management, obliging councils to ensure that
their housing is run by managers who
demonstrate the ability to deliver the best
services to tenants.
Local authorities meet the capital costs of
new house construction and of modernisation
of their existing stock by:
• raising loans on the open market;
• borrowing from the Public Works Loan
Board (an independent statutory body set
up to make loans to local authorities);
• using part of the proceeds from the sale of
local authority houses and other assets; or
• drawing on their revenue accounts.
Councils must maintain housing revenue
accounts on a ‘ring-fenced’ basis to keep
them separate from other council funds. The
Government provides local authorities in
England and Wales with Housing Revenue
Account Subsidy, worth more than £3,700
million in 1992-93. In Scotland, housing
support grant of £47 million is available for
1992-93.
Privately Rented Housing
There has been a steady decline in the
number of rented dwellings available from
private landlords, from over 50 per cent of
the housing stock in 1950 to 7 per cent in
Great Britain in 1990.
The Government’s policy is to increase
the availability of privately rented
184
PLANNING, URBAN REGENERATION AND HOUSING
accommodation by removing disincentives to
letting. To accomplish this, from January
1989, new private sector lettings were
deregulated, and two new forms of tenancy
were introduced:
• the assured tenancy, which gives the
tenant long-term security in return for a
freely negotiated market rent; and
• the assured shorthold tenancy (short
assured tenancy in Scotland), which is for
a fixed term, again at a free market rent.
Existing lettings are unaffected; they
continue on the old basis. At the same time,
the law concerning harassment of tenants was
strengthened. Tenants and most other
residential occupiers may not be evicted
without a court order. The Government has
introduced a ‘Rent a Room’ scheme to
encourage homeowners to rent a room to
lodgers without having to pay tax on the rent
they receive; provisions in the Finance Act
1992 allow rents of up to about £62 a week to
be tax-free.
In Northern Ireland only certain pre-1956
properties subject to rent restriction come
under statutory control. Rent levels are linked
to those of the Northern Ireland Housing
Executive, and both landlords and tenants
may apply to a rent assessment committee for
rent determination in cases where the current
rent is considered to be inappropriate. Rent
increases are permitted only for properties
which meet a prescribed standard. The only
assured tenancies in Northern Ireland are
those on properties made available under a
business expansion scheme; shorthold
tenancies are available.
Housing Associations
Housing associations, which are non-profit-
making, are now the main providers of
additional low-cost housing for rent and for
sale to those on low incomes and in the
greatest housing need. The housing
association sector is expanding rapidly;
associations own, manage and maintain over
600,000 homes and some 55,000 hostel bed-
spaces in England alone, providing homes for
well over 1 million people; over 27,000 new
homes for rent or shared ownership were
completed in 1991-92. Many associations
specialise in providing accommodation to
meet the special needs of the elderly, the
disabled and the mentally disordered.
People in housing need with insufficient
income to obtain a mortgage for outright
purchase may be able to participate in a
scheme in which a housing association
develops or acquires the home and sells a
share in it to them, allowing them to rent the
remainder and to purchase it later if they
wish. Housing associations can also purchase
older properties to improve for sale.
In Great Britain housing schemes carried
out by associations qualify for Housing
Association Grant if the association
concerned is one of about 2,800 registered
with the Housing Corporation (in England),
Scottish Homes or Housing for Wales. These
three organisations are statutory bodies which
supervise and pay grant to housing
associations in their respective parts of Great
Britain. Broadly similar assistance is available
to associations in Northern Ireland. Scottish
Homes has a wide range of general functions
and powers, including giving financial
assistance to housing associations.
The Government plans to increase the
resources distributed to housing associations
through the Housing Corporation’s capital
programme from £1,062 million in 1990-91
to £2,052 million in 1994—95. The
Government also aims to increase the amount
of private finance being used by housing
associations, allowing more homes to be built
with the available public resources than
would otherwise be the case. In 1992-93
Scottish Homes’ total programme
expenditure is expected to be about £323
million, of which well over half will go to
housing associations. Housing for Wales is
managing a programme of £174 million in
1992-93, with a target of providing 3,500
new homes in Wales. On current plans,
government provision to the housing
association movement in Wales will be over
£500 million between 1991—92 and 1994—95.
Northern Ireland’s registered housing
associations started 1,100 units of
accommodation in 1991-92, and now have a
stock of 12,000 units for rent. They have a
1992-93 budget of £43 million, with a target
185
BRITAIN 1993: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
to start 1,000 new units of rented
accommodation. Government plans provide
for total funding of some £178 million over
the period 1991-92 to 1994-95.
In England and Wales the rights of
housing association tenants are protected
under the Tenants’ Guarantee, which is
issued by the Housing Corporation. It covers
matters such as tenancy terms, principles for
determining rent levels and the allocation of
tenancies. Under this guarantee, tenants
receive contractual rights in addition to their
basic statutory rights, and associations are
required to set and maintain rents at levels
affordable by those in low-paid employment.
In Scotland, similar non-statutory guidance,
in the form of a model tenancy agreement,
has been implemented as proposed jointly by
Scottish Homes and the Scottish Federation
of Housing Associations.
Sheltered Housing
Sheltered housing, which comprises
accommodation with an alarm system and the
services of a resident warden, may be
provided for elderly people who need
support. Increasing emphasis is being placed
on schemes to help elderly people to continue
to live in their own homes, such as home
improvement services and adaptations to
existing housing to meet the needs of
disabled people.
Rural Housing
Changes in mobility have put pressure on
rural housing in many areas. Where there is a
need for low-cost housing in rural areas,
therefore, the Government has announced
that sites which would not normally be
released for housing development can
exceptionally be released, provided
arrangements are made to reserve the housing
for local needs. Similar arrangements were
introduced in Wales in 1991. Housing for
Wales has a major role to play, alongside
local authorities, in rural housing provision in
Wales. In Scotland, considerable progress is
being made through the range of initiatives
launched in 1990 as part of the Scottish
Homes Rural Strategy.
Homelessness
Under the homelessness legislation, local
authorities have a duty to secure permanent
accommodation for households which they
accept as unintentionally homeless and in
priority need. The latter category includes
pregnant women, people with dependent
children, and those who are vulnerable
because of old age, mental or physical
handicap or other special reasons.
By April 1992, the Government’s
programme of measures to tackle the problem
of people sleeping rough in London had
provided about 600 places in hostels and
about 1,200 in move-on accommodation, with
an additional 250 hostel places by mid-1992
and a further 1,300 permanent places by the
end of 1993. A further £20 million is being
made available in the period to 1994—95
specifically to help mentally-ill people
sleeping rough.
Tenants’ Rights
Legislation gives public sector tenants in
England and Wales statutory rights, including
security of tenure. Under the Tenants’
Choice provisions, public sector tenants have
the right to change their landlord where they
are not satisfied with the service provided by
their local authority. With a few exceptions,
secure tenants with at least two years’ public
sector standing are entitled to buy their house
or flat at a discount which depends on the
length of occupation (the ‘right to buy’).
Similar provisions are made for Scotland and
Northern Ireland. Some L8 million council,
housing association and new town homes
were sold in Great Britain between April
1979 and the end of 1991. In April 1991
Scottish Homes’ Rents to Mortgages scheme,
under which tenants can become homeowners
for an initial payment which can be financed
by a mortgage with payments similar to their
rent, was extended to local authority tenants.
Similar experimental schemes are at present
available to new town tenants of Basildon and
Milton Keynes, and in Wales to tenants of
the Development Board for Rural Wales. The
Welsh scheme, called flexi-ownership, was
introduced in 1989. The Government is now
186
PLANNING, URBAN REGENERATION AND HOUSING
committed to the introduction of a nationwide
rents-to-mortgages scheme under which
council tenants could buy a part-share in
their home and increase their share by further
voluntary payments, although they need not
pay off the remainder until resale.
The Government funds a national mobility
agency, HOMES, to promote and assist
tenants’ moves within and between the local
authority and housing association sectors.
The Government launched a new Tenant’s
Charter in England in January 1992 as part of
its Citizen’s Charter initiative. This included
proposals for an improved right to repair and
a simplified form of court procedure to deal
with certain housing cases. The Government
is also committed to the introduction of a
right to improve, under which council tenants
would receive compensation for certain home
improvements which they undertake. A new
Tenant’s Charter for Scotland was launched
in December 1991.
Government support is focused on tenants
rather than on property through the housing
benefit system. Depending on their personal
circumstances, occupiers may qualify for
housing benefit to help them pay their rent
(see p 146).
Improving Older Houses
In urban areas of Britain slum clearance and
redevelopment used to be major features of
housing policy, but there has been a trend in
recent years towards the retention of existing
communities, accompanied by the
modernisation and conversion of sub-standard
homes. Housing conditions have improved
considerably, but problems remain in some
areas where there are concentrations of
dwellings lacking basic amenities or requiring
substantial repairs; and there are still some
pockets of unfit housing for which demolition
is the best solution. The emphasis now is on
area renewal, with an integrated approach to
renewal and renovation.
In Scotland, Scottish Homes has been
given a major role in tackling housing-related
urban dereliction and providing rural
housing opportunities, in co-operation with
local communities, the private sector, local
authorities and other statutory agencies. Some
groups of tenants are joining together to form
community-based housing associations and
tenant ownership co-operatives.
Estate Action Programme
The Estate Action programme provides local
authorities in England with additional
resources to regenerate their run-down
housing estates. Funds are provided to enable
authorities to carry out an agreed package of
measures on an estate, including physical
refurbishment and improved management.
Since the Estate Action programme began in
1986, more than £1,000 million has been
allocated to or earmarked for about 1,000
schemes.
In 1992-93 funds have been increased to
£364 million to enable the programme to
tackle the larger, more run-down estates. The
Government is looking in particular for
schemes in which local authorities can show:
• a strategic approach to promoting
comprehensive regeneration;
• an effective partnership with tenants and
the private sector; and
• that the investment in housing would
complement and support training,
enterprise and other urban policies.
The Government is committed to
introducing a pilot homesteading scheme
under which local authorities would be
encouraged to offer those in housing need the
chance to restore suitable council properties
in exchange for a reduced rent or the
opportunity to buy at a reduced price.
In Wales, local authorities are able to bid
for Estate Partnership funding to tackle the
problems of selected estates; some £6 million
has been set aside for 1992-93. This
programme parallels Estate Action in England
but is designed to address the different
problems typical of Welsh council estates.
Housing Action Trusts
Housing Action Trusts (HATs) can be
established in England to focus resources on
some of the most run-down areas of
predominantly local authority housing. The
Government can designate a HAT for a
187
BRITAIN 1993: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
particular area or estate, subject to a tenants’
vote. If the majority of tenants who vote
support the proposal, the HAT would be
established by parliamentary order. It would
take over responsibility for the housing in its
designated area to renovate it, improve the
environment, provide community facilities
and stimulate local enterprise. On completion
of its work, the Trust would be wound up
and its property transferred to other owners
and managers, such as housing associations or
tenants’ co-operatives, or back to the local
authority. Tenants would be consulted on
their future landlords. Tenants as well as
local authorities may apply for the
establishment of a HAT.
Two HATs have been established, in
Hull (Humberside) and in Waltham Forest
(north-east London). Tenants in Liverpool
(Merseyside) have voted to support a third
HAT.
Home Improvement Grants
Nearly L2 million home improvement grants,
worth almost £3,750 million, were paid in
respect of privately owned dwellings in
England alone between 1983 and 1991. A
new house renovation grant system was
introduced in England and Wales in 1990.
Under this system, local authorities give
mandatory renovation grants to enable unfit
dwellings to be brought up to a revised
fitness standard, with discretionary grants
available for a wider range of works. Grants
of up to 100 per cent may be available,
subject to a test of the applicant’s resources.
Grants are also available in certain
circumstances for the provision of facilities
for the disabled and for the repair of houses
in multiple occupation and of the common
parts of blocks of flats. Minor works
assistance is also available to help people in
receipt of income-related benefits, particularly
the elderly, with small-scale works.
In Scotland, local authorities give grants
for improvement and repair. Scottish Homes
also has the power to provide grants to
complement the role of local authorities in
private house renewal.
In Northern Ireland, grants are provided
on a similar basis to that in England and
Wales through the House Renovation Grants
scheme, administered by the Northern
Ireland Housing Executive. In isolated rural
areas, a grant to replace dwellings which
cannot be restored is also available through
this scheme.
Housing Renewal Areas
Housing renewal areas in England and Wales
are intended to provide a sharper focus to
area action, covering both renovation and
selective redevelopment and taking account of
a range of issues wider than just housing.
Authorities are free to declare renewal areas
without the specific consent of the Secretaries
of State for the Environment and for Wales,
provided they fulfil certain criteria.
Authorities have additional powers to acquire
land in renewal areas and to carry out
improvement works for which additional
government support is available.
In Scotland housing action area powers are
available for the improvement of areas in
which at least half the houses fail to meet a
statutory tolerable standard. Since 1975,
1,844 housing action areas have been
declared. Outside such areas in Scotland local
authorities have powers to apply
improvement orders to houses below the
statutory tolerable standard or lacking certain
basic amenities. Local authorities may also
give grants towards improving the
environment of mainly residential areas.
Northern Ireland has a large number of
houses which are either unfit or in serious
disrepair. Since 1977, 53 housing action areas
have been declared, involving a continuous
programme of rehabilitation and associated
environmental improvement schemes.

Environmental
Protection
For more than a century Britain has been
developing policies to protect the
environment against pollution from industry
and other sources. Laws were introduced at
an early stage to control air and water
pollution, and to conserve wildlife, the
landscape, historic monuments and buildings.
They have been revised regularly to meet
changing circumstances. Recently, with
increasing scientific understanding of global
pollution problems, the Government has been
considering how its own policies and actions
can be further guided by the principle of
‘sustainable development’, about which a
major United Nations conference was held in
June 1992.
Britain supports international co-operation
on matters of environmental protection.
Increasingly, much of Britain’s legislation on
pollution control is being developed in
collaboration with other member states of the
European Community and organisations
such as the Organisation for Economic
Co-operation and Development and the
United Nations and its agencies. Britain is
taking a leading position in the development
of a European eco-labelling scheme. The
most recent major piece of environmental
legislation is the Environmental Protection
Act 1990, which introduced more
comprehensive standards of pollution control
and new arrangements to promote
conservation.
The Department of the Environment is
responsible for countryside policy and
environmental protection in England; the
Department of National Heritage has
responsibility for the listing of buildings and
for scheduled ancient monuments. The
Welsh Office, the Scottish Office
Environment Department and the
Department of the Environment for Northern
Ireland have broadly equivalent
responsibilities. In addition, the local
authorities and a wide range of voluntary
organisations are actively involved in
environmental conservation and protection.
An Advisory Committee on Business and the
Environment is charged with assisting the
Government on environmental issues relevant
to business.
Britain participated fully in the
United Nations Conference on
Environment and Development
(UNCED), popularly known as the
‘Earth Summit’, held in Rio de Janeiro
in June 1992. Among the agreements
reached was a framework convention
on climate change (see p 202), a
convention on biodiversity, ‘Agenda 21’
(an action framework for the twenty-
first century), a declaration setting out
clear principles for sustainable
development, and a declaration for the
management of forests. Britain also
launched a Darwin Initiative for the
Survival of Species; an initiative to
ensure that developing countries could
share the benefits of technology
through partnership with British
companies; and a global forum of
non-governmental organisations, to be
convened in June 1993, to examine and
clarify their role in the practical
implementation of Agenda 21.
This Common Inheritance
The environment White Paper This Common
Inheritance, published in September 1990,
was the first comprehensive statement by the
Government of its policy on issues affecting
the environment. It summarised more than
350 proposals for tackling such diverse issues
as global warming, pollution control, the
189
BRITAIN 1993: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
regulation of land use and planning, the rural
economy, the countryside and wildlife. There
were also pledges of action on heritage, air
quality and pollution, noise, water, hazardous
substances, waste and recycling, and separate
sections on specific initiatives in Scotland,
Wales and Northern Ireland. In September
1991 a first anniversary progress report was
published, which reviewed progress and set
out commitments to more than 400 further
actions to protect the environment, and
a further update was published in
October 1992.
The Government has established an
Environmental Grant Fund to help voluntary
groups in England take forward initiatives in
the White Paper. It focuses on encouraging
more groups to participate in environmental
work and on improving the ability of local
environmental groups to take effective action.
Its funding for 1992-93 was increased to
£1 million. It is due to be replaced in
1993-94 by an Environmental Action Fund,
worth almost £4 million, which will also
replace two other schemes.
Conservation
Historic Buildings, Ancient Monuments
and Conservation Areas
Lists of buildings of special architectural or
historical interest are compiled by the
Government. Some 440,000 buildings are
listed in England, some 38,000 in Scotland,
14,000 in Wales and 8,000 in Northern
Ireland. It is against the law to demolish,
extend or alter the character of any ‘listed’
building without special consent from the
local planning authority or the appropriate
Secretary of State. The local planning
authority can issue temporary ‘building
preservation notices’ to protect buildings not
yet listed that are in danger while
consideration is given to full listing. In
Northern Ireland, the Department of the
Environment for Northern Ireland is directly
responsible for the listing of buildings.
Ancient monuments are similarly
protected through a system of scheduling.
There are approximately 13,000 scheduled
ancient monuments in England, over 5,500 in
Scotland, 2,600 in Wales and 1,000 in
Northern Ireland. English Heritage (the full
name of which is the Historic Buildings and
Monuments Commission for England) has
embarked upon a programme to evaluate all
known archaeological remains in England.
This is expected to result in a significant
increase in the number of scheduled
monuments.
An English Heritage survey published
in January 1992 showed that most of
England’s listed buildings were in
reasonable condition and that the vast
majority were not at risk.
Many of the royal palaces and parks are
open to the public; their maintenance is the
responsibility of the Secretaries of State for
National Heritage and for Scotland. English
Heritage is charged with protecting and
conserving England’s architectural and
archaeological heritage. It manages some 400
ancient monuments on behalf of the Secretary
of State for National Heritage, advises him on
all applications for consent to alter scheduled
monuments, and gives grants for the repair of
ancient monuments, historic buildings and
buildings in conservation areas in England.
Most of its monuments are open to the public.
Government support to English Heritage is
almost £102 million in 1992-93. Planning
guidance on archaeological matters was issued
by the Government in November 1990.
In Scotland and Wales similar functions are
performed by Historic Scotland, which cares
for 330 monuments, and by Cadw: Welsh
Historic Monuments, which manages 127,
with advice from an Ancient Monuments
Board and a Historic Buildings Council for
each country. Historic Scotland and Cadw are
executive agencies within the Scottish Office
and Welsh Office respectively. The
Department of the Environment for Northern
Ireland has 173 historic monuments in its care,
and is advised by a Historic Buildings Council
and a Historic Monuments Council.
The National Heritage Memorial Fund
helps towards the cost of acquiring, main¬
taining or preserving land, buildings, works
of art and other items of outstanding interest
190
ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION
which are also of importance to the national
heritage. In 1991-92 the Fund assisted in the
preservation of 88 heritage items.
Local planning authorities have designated
almost 8,000 ‘conservation areas’ of special
architectural or historic interest in England;
there are over 350 in Wales, over 550 in
Scotland and 29 in Northern Ireland. These
areas receive special protection through the
planning system. Grants and loans are
available from the appropriate historic
buildings and monuments body for works
which make a significant contribution towards
the preservation or improvement of a
conservation area.
The Voluntary Sector
The Government supports the work of the
voluntary sector in the protection of Britain’s
heritage. In England, the Department of
National Heritage has offered to make grants
totalling £450,000 to 23 such organisations in
1992-93.
Among the voluntary organisations which
campaign for the preservation and
appreciation of buildings are:
• the Society for the Protection of Ancient
Buildings;
• the Ancient Monuments Society;
• the Georgian Group;
• the Architectural Heritage Society of
Scotland;
• the Ulster Architectural Heritage Society;
• the Victorian Society; and
• the Council for British Archaeology.
The National Trust (for Places of Historic
Interest or Natural Beauty), a charity with
over 2 million members, owns and protects
319 properties open to the public, in addition
to over 230,000 hectares (568,000 acres) of
land in England, Wales and Northern
Ireland. Scotland has its own National Trust.
The Civic Trust makes awards for
development and restoration work which
enhances its surroundings. It undertakes
urban regeneration projects and acts as an
‘umbrella’ organisation for nearly 1,000 local
amenity societies. There are associate trusts
in Scotland, Wales and north-east England.
Tree Preservation and Planting
Tree preservation orders enable local
authorities to protect trees and woodlands in
the interests of amenity. Once a tree is
protected, it is in general an offence to fell,
damage or destroy it, and the courts can
impose substantial fines for breaches. Where
protected trees are felled in contravention of
an order or are removed because they are
dying, dead or dangerous, a replacement tree
must be planted. Local authorities have
powers to enforce this requirement. The
Government is currently undertaking a review
of tree preservation policies and legislation.
Tree planting is encouraged through
grants. Major initiatives include a project to
create a new national forest in the Midlands
and 12 community forests near large towns
and cities. These are aimed at enhancing the
environment and providing new opportunities
for leisure and recreation.
Hedgerows
In July 1992 the Government launched a
hedgerow incentive scheme. This will provide
grants for managing hedgerows in
environmentally sensitive ways. It also
proposes to introduce a hedgerow notification
scheme, which would require prior
notification of the proposed removal of
hedgerows to local authorities, and would
empower them to protect such hedgerows by
registering them. This would require
legislation, which will be introduced when
parliamentary time permits.
Green Belts
‘Green Belts’ are areas intended to be left
open and free from inappropriate
development. Their purposes are to:
• restrict the sprawl of large built-up areas;
• safeguard the surrounding countryside;
• prevent neighbouring towns merging;
• preserve the special character of historic
towns; and
• assist in urban regeneration.
They also have a recreational role. Green
191
BRITAIN 1993: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Belts have been established around major
cities including London, Edinburgh,
Glasgow, Merseyside, Greater Manchester
and the West Midlands, as well as several
smaller towns. Some 1-5 million hectares
(3-8 million acres) are designated as Green
Belt in England and 200,000 hectares
(500,000 acres) in Scotland. The Government
attaches great importance to the protection of
Green Belts and expects local planning
authorities to do likewise when considering
planning applications.
The Coast
Local planning authorities along the coastline
are responsible for planning land use at the
coast; they also attempt to safeguard and
enhance the coast’s natural attractions and
preserve areas of scientific interest. The
protection of the coastline against erosion is
administered centrally by the Ministry of
Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, the Welsh
Office and the Scottish Office. Certain
stretches of undeveloped coast of particular
scenic beauty in England and Wales are
treated as heritage coast; jointly with local
authorities, the government countryside
bodies (see below) have defined 44 coasts,
protecting 1,508 km (937 miles). The
Government also intends to extend the
marine consultation area scheme to cover 16
areas in England and Wales; statutory bodies
taking decisions that affect these areas will be
asked to consult the appropriate nature
conservation body. There are already 29 such
areas in Scotland.
A £4 million boost for basic research
into coastal erosion was announced in
January 1992 by the Science and
Engineering Research Council. This
work will underpin the more applied
research carried out by the National
Rivers Authority (see p 199) and the
Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and
Food.
The National Trust, through its
Enterprise Neptune campaign, raises funds to
acquire stretches of coastline of great natural
beauty and recreational value. More than
£17 million has been raised so far and the
Trust now protects 853 km (530 miles) of
coastline in England, Wales and Northern
Ireland. The National Trust for Scotland also
owns large parts of the Scottish coastline and
protects others through conservation
agreements.
Countryside and Nature Conservation
Bodies
Until April 1991, the main government body
responsible for nature conservation was the
Nature Conservancy Council (NCC). The
Countryside Commission and the
Countryside Commission for Scotland (CCS)
were responsible for countryside policy, the
former in England and Wales and the latter
in Scotland. New arrangements came into
force in 1991:
• the NCC was replaced by separate bodies
for England (English Nature), Scotland
(the Nature Conservancy Council for
Scotland—NCCS) and Wales (the
Countryside Council for Wales—CCW);
• the CCW also took over the Countryside
Commission’s responsibilities in Wales,
leaving the Commission responsible for
countryside policy in England only; and
• a statutory Joint Nature Conservation
Committee (JNCC—see p 194) was also
set up.
A further change took effect in April 1992.
The two Scottish bodies—the CCS and the
NCCS—merged to form a single body,
Scottish Natural Heritage (SNH).
Countryside Bodies
Three government bodies are therefore now
responsible for conserving and enhancing the
natural beauty and amenity of the countryside
and encouraging the provision of facilities for
open-air recreation:
• the Countryside Commission, acting in
England;
• the Countryside Council for Wales; and
• Scottish Natural Heritage.
Activities aided by these bodies include the
provision by local authorities (sometimes in

association with other bodies) and private
individuals of country parks and picnic sites,
often within easy reach of towns; the
provision or improvement of recreational
paths and the encouragement of amenity tree¬
planting schemes. The Countryside
Commission recognises over 210 country
parks and over 230 picnic sites in England. A
further 24 country parks and about 40 picnic
sites in Wales are recognised by the CCW. In
Scotland there are 36 country parks, and
many local authority and private sector
schemes for a variety of countryside facilities
have been approved for grant aid by SNH.
The countryside bodies undertake research
projects and experimental schemes, often
working in consultation with local authorities
and groups such as the nature conservation
bodies (see p 194) and the Sports Councils.
They give financial assistance to public,
193
BRITAIN 1993: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
private and voluntary organisations, and
individuals carrying out countryside
conservation, recreation and amenity projects.
Total funding in 1992-93 is over £38 million
for the Countryside Commission, £17 million
for the CCW and nearly £35 million for SNH.
Nature Conservation
English Nature, the CCW and SNH are
responsible for nature conservation in their
areas. This includes:
• establishing and managing nature
reserves;
• advising the Government;
• identifying and notifying Sites of Special
Scientific Interest (SSSIs);
• providing general information and advice;
• giving grants; and
• supporting and conducting research.
English Nature’s total funding for 1992-93 is
over £36 million.
The Joint Nature Conservation Committee
was also established in April 1991 as an
extension of the three nature conservation
bodies in England, Wales and Scotland, with
representatives from Northern Ireland. It
provides a collective view on international
matters and matters affecting Britain as a
whole. The JNCC also undertakes research
and sets standards for surveys and
monitoring.
There are 245 national nature reserves
covering some 168,000 hectares (415,000
acres). The first statutory marine nature
reserve, the island of Lundy, off the Devon
coast, was designated in 1986. A second
marine nature reserve at Skomer, off the
coast of Dyfed, in Wales, was declared in
1990, and more are proposed. Some 5,650
SSSIs have been notified in Great Britain for
their plant, animal or geological or
physiographical features. Local authorities
have declared about 280 local nature reserves
in England alone.
County nature conservation trusts and the
Royal Society for the Protection of Birds play
an important part in protecting wildlife,
having established between them some 1,800
reserves. The county trusts are affiliated to a
parent organisation, the Royal Society for
Nature Conservation. The Royal Society for
the Protection of Birds is the largest voluntary
wildlife conservation body in Europe.
In Northern Ireland, both nature and
countryside conservation is the responsibility
of the Department of the Environment for
Northern Ireland through its Environment
Service. In 1992-93 total funding for the
Environment Service is some £19 million,
including £2 million for pollution control
measures. The Council for Nature
Conservation and the Countryside advises the
Department of the Environment for Northern
Ireland on nature conservation matters,
including the establishment and management
of land and marine nature reserves and the
declaration of Areas of Special Scientific
Interest. Some 44 national nature reserves
have been established and 36 Areas of Special
Scientific Interest declared.
Wildlife in Great Britain is protected
principally by the Wildlife and Countryside
Act 1981. This has:
• extended the list of protected species;
• restricted the introduction into the
countryside of animals not normally
found in the wild in Britain; and
• afforded greater protection for SSSIs and
introduced provision for marine nature
reserves.
There is also provision for reviews of the list
of protected species to be conducted by the
three official nature conservation agencies,
acting jointly through the JNCC, every five
years and submitted to the Secretary of State
for the Environment. In Northern Ireland
separate legislation on species and habitat
protection is in line with the rest of Britain.
Species recovery programmes to increase
populations of threatened species of plants
and animals are being developed by English
Nature and its equivalents.
Britain plays a full part in international
action to conserve wildlife. Conservation
measures promoted by the Government have
included a ban (in conjunction with other
European Community countries) on the
import of whale products and harp and
hooded seal pup skins, and stricter controls
for the protection of wild birds. Britain
194
ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION
continues to support the Convention on
International Trade in Endangered Species of
Wild Fauna and Flora. Some 54 wetland sites
have been designated for protection under the
Ramsar Convention and 55 sites declared as
Special Protection Areas under the European
Community birds directive.
National Parks, Areas of Outstanding
Natural Beauty and National Scenic
Areas
The Countryside Commission and the CCW
can designate National Parks and areas of
outstanding natural beauty (AONBs), subject
to confirmation by the Secretaries of State for
the Environment and for Wales respectively,
and define heritage coasts in conjunction with
local authorities. They can also make
proposals for the creation of long-distance
footpaths and bridleways.
In January 1992 the Government
announced proposals to establish
independent National Park authorities
for all National Parks and to ensure
local representation on them. It was
also confirmed that steps would be
taken to designate the New' Forest in
Hampshire as an area of national
significance.
Ten National Parks cover 9,600 sq km
(3,720 sq miles) of England and 4,100 sq km
(1,570 sq miles) of Wales, in all some 9 per
cent of total land area. Their aim is first to
provide protection for the outstanding
countryside they contain and secondly to
provide opportunities for access and outdoor
recreation. They are ‘national’ in the sense
that they are of value to the nation as a
whole. However, most of the land remains in
private hands. Special National Park
authorities have been set up, one for each
park. Among other things, they:
• act as the development control authority
for their areas;
• negotiate public access and land
management agreements and encourage
farmers to manage their land in the
traditional way;
• plant trees and look after footpaths;
and
• set up information centres and employ
rangers.
The Norfolk and Suffolk Broads have their
own independent authority and enjoy
protection equivalent to that of a National
Park.
A total of 39 AONBs have been
designated, covering around 19,570 sq km
(7,630 sq miles) in England and 844 sq km
(326 sq miles) in Wales. They comprise
parts of the countryside which lack
extensive areas of open country suitable for
recreation and hence National Park status,
but which nevertheless have an important
landscape quality. Local authorities are
encouraged to give special attention to
AONBs in their planning and countryside
conservation work.
In Scotland there are four regional parks
and 40 National Scenic Areas, covering
more than 1 million hectares (2 5 million
acres), where certain kinds of development
are subject to consultation with SNH and,
in the event of a disagreement, with the
Secretary of State for Scotland. Working
parties have been established to make
recommendations for the management of the
Cairngorms and for Loch Lomond and the
Trossachs, two areas of outstanding natural
importance in Scotland. In the wider
countryside, SNH provides grants for a
range of countryside projects.
In Northern Ireland the Council for
Nature Conservation and the Countryside
advises the Department of the Environment
for Northern Ireland on the preservation of
amenities and the designation of areas of
outstanding natural beauty. Nine such areas
have been designated, covering 285,000
hectares (705,000 acres), and seven areas are
being managed as country parks and one as
a regional park.
There are 11 forest parks in Great
Britain, covering some 244,000 hectares
(603,000 acres) and administered by the
Forestry Commission. There are nine in
Northern Ireland, where they are
administered by the Forest Service of the
Department of Agriculture.
195
BRITAIN 1993: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Many voluntary organisations are
concerned to preserve the amenities of the
countryside, including the Council for the
Protection of Rural England, the Campaign
for the Protection of Rural Wales, the
Association for the Protection of Rural
Scotland and the Ulster Society for the
Preservation of the Countryside.
Public Rights of Way and Open Country
County and metropolitan district councils in
England and Wales are responsible for
keeping public rights of way signposted and
free from obstruction. Public paths are
usually maintained by these highway
authorities, which also supervise landowners’
duties to repair stiles and gates. In Scotland,
planning authorities are responsible for
asserting and protecting rights of way. Local
authorities in Great Britain can create paths,
close paths no longer needed for public use
and divert paths to meet the needs of either
the public or landowners. Farmers in
England and Wales are required by law
rapidly to restore public paths damaged by
agricultural operations. In England and Wales
there are some 225,000 km (140,000 miles) of
rights of way. There are ten approved
national trails open in England and Wales,
covering over 2,900 km (1,800 miles), and
three approved long-distance routes in
Scotland, covering some 580 km (360 miles).
The Countryside Commission intends to help
authorities bring all rights of way in England
into good order by the end of the century,
and a Parish Path Partnership scheme has
been introduced, which is designed to
stimulate local maintenance and
improvement. The CCW intends to establish
a network of public rights of way by 1995.
There is no automatic right of public
access to open country, although many
landowners allow it more or less freely. Local
planning authorities can secure access by
means of agreements with landowners. If
agreements cannot be reached, authorities
may acquire land or make orders for public
access. Similar powers cover Scotland and
Northern Ireland; in Northern Ireland the
primary responsibility lies with district
councils. In Scotland there is a tradition of
freedom to roam, based on tolerance between
landowners and those seeking reasonable
recreational access to the hills.
Common land totals an estimated 600,000
hectares (L5 million acres) in England and
Wales, but a legal right of public access exists
to only one-fifth of this area. Common land
is usually privately owned, but people other
than the owner may have various rights over
it, for example, as pasture land. Commons
are protected by law and cannot be built on
or enclosed without the consent of the
Secretaries of State for the Environment or
Wales; this consent is normally only given for
minor public works. There is no common
land in Scotland or Northern Ireland.
Environmental Improvement Schemes
The Government assists local voluntary
organisations to promote projects such as
creating parks, footpaths and other areas of
greenery in cities; conserving the industrial
heritage and the natural environment; and
recycling waste. The Department of the
Environment makes grants through the Urban
Programme (see p 176) and the Special
Grants Programme to support projects with
either direct or indirect environmental gains.
Spending from the former on such projects
was estimated at over £52 million in 1991-92,
and from the latter at £4 7 million. The
Special Grants Programme funding for
countryside and environmental protection is
being replaced by the Environmental Action
Fund from 1993-94.
The Welsh Office is making £500,000
available to voluntary organisations under its
Environment Wales initiative. The Scottish
Office Environment Department is making
£323,000 available in 1992-93 to
environmental organisations under its Special
Grants (Environmental) Programme. A
further £408,000 is being made available to
UK 2000 Scotland, a partnership between
central and local government, voluntary
bodies and the private sector, which carries
out practical environmental improvements.
Scottish Enterprise and Highlands and
Islands Enterprise (see pH) are responsible
for environmental improvement and land
reclamation in Scotland.
196
ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION
The Government’s programme of
Environmentally Sensitive Areas (see p 308)
is a voluntary scheme run by the Ministry of
Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, under
which, in return for payments, farmers agree
to follow environmentally sensitive practices
that protect and enhance the countryside.
The Groundwork Foundation, a partnership
of public bodies, the private sector, voluntary
organisations and individuals, aims to tackle
environmental problems arising from
dereliction and vandalism and to increase
public awareness of the opportunities to
change and improve local environments.
Government funding for England in 1992-93
for the Groundwork Foundation is
j£5-3 million; a target has been set of
establishing 50 trusts in England and Wales
by 1994.
World Heritage Sites
Britain is fully represented in the World
Heritage List, which was established under
the World Heritage Convention to identify
and secure lasting protection for those parts
of the world heritage of outstanding universal
value. So far 13 sites in Britain have been
listed. These are:
• Canterbury Cathedral, with St
Augustine’s Abbey and St Martin’s
Church, in Kent;
• Durham Cathedral and Castle;
• Studley Royal Gardens and Fountains
Abbey, in North Yorkshire;
• Ironbridge Gorge, with the world’s first
iron bridge and other early industrial
sites, in Shropshire;
• the prehistoric stone circles at
Stonehenge and Avebury, in Wiltshire;
• Blenheim Palace, in Oxfordshire;
• the city of Bath, in Avon;
• Hadrian’s Wall;
• the Tower of London;
• the Palace of Westminster, Westminster
Abbey and St Margaret’s, Westminster,
also in London;
• the islands of St Kilda, in Scotland;
• the castles and town walls of King
Edward I, in north Wales; and
• the Giant’s Causeway and Causeway
Coast, in Northern Ireland.
Government support for these sites can be
considerable. For example, in February 1991
a £4 million endowment for the Ironbridge
Heritage Foundation was announced to
ensure the future of these remains from the
earliest days of the Industrial Revolution.
Britain contributes about £600,000
annually towards the work of the Council of
Europe’s heritage committee.
Control of Pollution
The Environmental Protection Act 1990,
which applies to Great Britain, has
strengthened the existing system of protection
against pollution. Legislation sets out a wide
range of powers and duties for central and
local government, including controls over
waste, air pollution, litter, noise, and
emissions to water.
Administration
Executive responsibility for pollution control
is divided between local authorities and
central government agencies. Central
government makes policy, exercises general
budgetary control, promotes legislation and
advises pollution control authorities on policy
implementation. The Secretary of State for
the Environment has general responsibility
for co-ordinating the work of the
Government on environmental protection. In
Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland the
respective Secretaries of State are responsible
for pollution control co-ordination within
their countries. Local authorities also have
important duties and powers. They are
responsible for matters such as:
• collection and disposal of domestic
wastes;
• keeping the streets clean from litter;
• control of air pollution from domestic
and from many industrial premises; and
• noise and general nuisance abatement.
197
BRITAIN 1993: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
The National Rivers Authority (NRA) is
responsible for the control of water pollution
in England and Wales; it is expected to spend
£123 million on grant-aided services in
1992-93. In Scotland, the river purification
authorities have statutory responsibility for
water pollution control; the seven mainland
authorities forecast expenditure of £11-8
million in 1992-93. In Northern Ireland,
water quality is monitored by the
Environmental Service of the Department of
the Environment for Northern Ireland. In
England and Wales Her Majesty’s
Inspectorate of Pollution (HMIP) has an
important role in the control of emissions to
land, air and water from certain industrial
processes through the mechanism of
‘integrated pollution control’ (see below). The
Government is committed to bringing
together the functions of HMIP and the
NRA into a single Environment Agency.
An independent standing Royal
Commission on Environmental Pollution
advises the Government on national and
international matters concerning the pollution
of the environment, on the adequacy of
research and on the future possibilities of
danger to the environment. So far it has
produced 16 reports.
Integrated Pollution Control
Under the Environmental Protection Act
1990, a system of ‘integrated pollution
control’ (IPC) is being phased in to control
certain categories of industrial pollution. The
most harmful processes are specified for IPC,
and require authorisation from HMIP. Less
harmful air pollution is controlled under a
system of local authority air pollution control.
In granting authorisation for releases under
IPC, the Inspectorate requires the use of the
best available techniques not entailing
excessive cost to prevent or minimise
polluting emissions and to ensure that any
releases are made harmless.
Her Majesty’s Industrial Pollution
Inspectorate is the Scottish equivalent of
HMIP, and administers IPC jointly with the
river purification authorities. In Northern
Ireland broadly similar controls are exercised
by the Environment Service, and proposals
are being formulated for the introduction of a
system of IPC.
The Government is pressing for the
introduction of IPC on the British model
within the European Community.
A government report published in
January 1992 shows that the level of
dioxins in British food is so low that
they can only be detected by the most
sophisticated techniques capable of
measuring accurately to ten parts in
one thousand million million.
The Land
Certain local authorities are designated as
waste regulation authorities, responsible for
regulating the disposal of controlled wastes.
They are required to draw up and revise
periodically a waste disposal plan. Legislation
has also established a licensing system for
waste disposal sites, treatment plants and
storage facilities receiving controlled wastes.
It provides for a more intensive control
system for certain especially difficult wastes.
HMIP and the Hazardous Waste Inspectorate
for Scotland may advise local authorities on
how to improve their control of waste
management and on how to work towards
environmentally acceptable standards for
dealing with hazardous wastes. In Northern
Ireland, similar advice is offered to district
councils by the Environment Service.
Part II of the Environmental Protection
Act, which is being phased into force from
April 1992 onwards, strengthens existing
curbs on waste disposal. Responsibility for
proper handling of waste has been imposed
on everyone who has control of it from
production to final disposal or reclamation.
Authorities will be able to refuse licences if
the applicant is not a fit and proper person.
Operators will be responsible for their sites
until all risks of gases or pollution are
eliminated. In England and Wales local
authorities’ waste disposal operations are to
be transferred to ‘arm’s length’ companies or
private contractors so as to separate them
from the authorities’ other jobs of setting
policies and standards, and enforcement.
198
ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION
Waste regulation authorities will become both
more locally accountable and more closely
supervised by HMIP. Subject to further
legislation, the Government intends that its
proposed Environment Agency would take
over local authority waste regulation
functions.
In Scotland, the responsibility for
collection, disposal and regulation of refuse
remains with the district and islands councils,
whose waste management function is
examined by the Hazardous Waste
Inspectorate. In Northern Ireland,
responsibility for the collection, disposal and
regulation of waste rests with the district
councils.
Litter
It is a criminal offence to leave litter in any
public place in the open air or to dump
rubbish except in designated places. The
maximum penalty for this, previously set at
£400, was increased under the Environmental
Protection Act to £1,000. The Act also
introduced new powers for the issue of litter
abatement orders and new duties on local
authorities to keep their public land as free of
litter and refuse (including dog faeces) as
practicable. Similar powers are expected to
come into force in Northern Ireland during
1993. To help counteract the problem of
litter, financial support is given to the Tidy
Britain Group (£2-8 million in 1992-93),
which provides a comprehensive litter
abatement programme in collaboration with
local authorities. The Group secures
sponsorship from industry to undertake litter
abatement promotions and programmes such
as its Neighbourhood Litter Watch scheme.
The Group’s activities were extended to
Northern Ireland with the establishment in
1990 of Tidy Northern Ireland.
Recycling and Materials Reclamation
The Government encourages the reclamation
and recycling of waste materials wherever this
is practicable; its target is for half of all
recyclable household waste to be reused by
2000. Under the Environmental Protection
Act 1990, local authorities have to make plans
for the recycling of waste. The Government
has supported pilot ‘Recycling City’
initiatives in Sheffield, Cardiff, Dundee and
the county of Devon, which have tested a
variety of collection and sorting methods.
Trial collections of recyclable waste are being
supported and monitored in these and other
locations. Members of the public can deposit
used glass containers for recycling in bottle
banks—there are over 7,000 such sites in
Britain, and it is anticipated that there will be
10,000 by 1995. There are also similar ‘can
banks’ and ‘paper banks’ and, in some cases,
plastics or textiles banks to collect these
materials for recycling. In addition, voluntary
organisations arrange collections of waste
material. Discussions with industry aimed at
improving markets for collected recyclable
waste have led to voluntary targets, such as a
40 per cent recycled content of newspapers
by 2000, and grant aid for research and new
plant.
Water
In general, it is against the law to allow any
polluting matter to enter water in Britain
except in accordance with a legal
authorisation. In England and Wales the
NRA is responsible for protecting water
quality. Its principal method of controlling
water pollution is through the regulation of
all effluent discharges into inland and
coastal waters (except those subject to IPC,
which are controlled by HMIP). Discharge
consents issued by the NRA specify what
may be discharged and set limits on the
volume and content of effluent, in order to
achieve appropriate water quality standards.
The NRA maintains public registers
containing information about discharge
consents and water quality. Similar
arrangements apply in Scotland, where
control is exercised by river purification
authorities. The Environment Service is
responsible for controlling water pollution in
Northern Ireland.
Over the past 30 years, notable progress
has been made in cleaning up the previously
heavily polluted major estuaries of the east
coast of England and Scotland—the Thames,
Humber, Tees, Tyne and Forth—which now
199
BRITAIN 1993: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
support varied populations of fish and other
wildlife. A 25-year scheme supported by the
Government and the European Community
aims to reduce river pollution and improve
water quality throughout the Mersey river
basin and estuary. Other major schemes in
progress include programmes to improve
water quality in the Clyde in Scotland and
the Lagan in Northern Ireland.
More than 95 per cent of the population
in Britain lives in properties connected to a
sewer, and sewage treatment works serve over
80 per cent of the population. In England
and Wales the water industry is planning to
spend some £14,000 million (at 1989 prices)
up to the year 2000 on improving sewage
treatment and disposal. Progressively higher
treatment standards for industrial waste
effluents and new measures to combat
pollution from agriculture are expected to
bring further improvements in water quality.
In Scotland, sewage treatment and disposal
come within the water and sewerage
programme, which will total more than £600
million in the three years to 1993-94.
The Government is committed to meeting
the requirements of a number of European
Community directives for the protection and
improvement of water quality, for example,
on the quality of surface water for abstraction
for drinking water supply, the quality needed
to support freshwater fisheries, the quality of
water for bathing areas (see p 201) and the
treatment of urban waste water.
Marine Environment
Britain is a leading participant in the series of
North Sea Conferences. This international
forum of the countries bordering the North
Sea provides the prime focus for the
development of Britain’s policies on the
marine environment. Measures agreed are
being applied by Britain to all its coastal
waters, not just the North Sea.
Good progress is being made in reducing
the amount of toxic substances released into
the sea. The Government’s target is a
reduction of the order of 50 per cent by
1995, and of 70 per cent in the most
dangerous substances such as cadmium,
mercury, dioxins and lead. Substantial
reductions have already been achieved. For
example, the discharge of lead into the North
Sea fell by 89 per cent between 1985 and
1990, the discharge of cadmium fell by 61
per cent and mercury discharges fell by 51
per cent.
Reduced inputs of heavy metals are
reflected in the results of tests on fish
caught in British waters. In 1979, the
average concentration of mercury in
cod caught in Liverpool Bay was 0 26
milligrammes per kilogramme; by
1989 this had fallen to 015 mg/kg.
Prevention of marine pollution from ships
is based largely on international conventions
drawn up under the auspices of the
International Maritime Organization, a
United Nations agency with its headquarters
in London. These requirements are
implemented for British ships by domestic
legislation. British legislation requires ships to
be fitted with specific pollution control
equipment. It makes it an offence for ships of
any nationality to discharge oil, oily mixtures
or ships’ garbage into British territorial
waters. It is also an offence for British-
registered ships to make similar discharges
into the sea anywhere in the world, except in
accordance with the regulations. Enforcement
of these regulations is undertaken by the
Department of Transport.
Offshore oil operators must ensure that oil
does not escape into the sea and are required
to have contingency plans for dealing with oil
spilled accidentally. Discharges containing oil
are controlled under the Prevention of Oil
Pollution Act 1971. It has been agreed by the
North Sea Conference to progressively
eliminate pollution caused by discharges of
oil-contaminated drilling cuttings from
offshore platforms.
The Department of Transport’s Marine
Pollution Control Unit is responsible for
dealing with pollution at sea when oil or
other dangerous substances from a shipping
casualty threaten major coastal pollution. It
maintains a national contingency plan and
dispersant spraying, cargo transfer,
mechanical recovery and beach-cleaning
resources. It also has two remote sensing
200
ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION
aircraft capable of detecting possible illegal
discharges and of quantifying oil pollution.
In 1991 the Unit received 220 reports of
pollution, of which 38 were detected by its
aircraft. None of these was major and only
23 required further action by the Unit.
Discharges of oil in drill cuttings
from Britain’s oil industry fell from
18,500 tonnes in 1988 to 12,320 tonnes
in 1990.
A licence has to be obtained for the
permanent deposit of any substance or article
into the sea and tidal waters below the high
water mark. Disposal at sea is presently
permitted where no harm to the marine
environment can be shown and where there
are no practicable alternatives on land.
Nevertheless, as a precautionary measure, a
timetable for ending the disposal of
industrial waste at sea was announced by the
Government in 1990. The Government’s
intention is that no industrial waste should
be dumped at sea beyond early 1993, and the
number of licences for this has been cut
from 24 in 1987 to just two. Waste has not
been licensed for incineration at sea since
1990.
Bathing Waters
The Government has announced investment
of around £2,160 million by the water
industry to provide increased sewage
treatment, while a £1,400 million programme
is intended to improve the quality of
Britain’s bathing waters. In March 1990, the
Government announced that the sea
dumping of sewage sludge would be
terminated completely by the end of 1998. In
the 1991 tests of bathing water quality, it
was found that 76 per cent of identified
bathing waters (343 out of 453) in Britain
met the mandatory coliform bacteria
standards of the European Community
Bathing Water directive, compared with 66
per cent of beaches in 1988. The
Government expects all but a handful of
bathing waters to meet the directive’s
standards by 1995 and to achieve full
compliance soon thereafter.
Air Pollution
Responsibility for clean air rests primarily
with local authorities. Under the Clean Air
Acts 1956 and 1968 they may declare ‘smoke
control areas’ within which the emission of
smoke from chimneys is an offence. About
two-thirds of the premises in conurbations
are covered by smoke control orders—over
6,000 are in force. Emissions from most
industrial processes are also subject to control
by local authorities. Those processes with the
greatest potential for harmful emissions are,
however, controlled under the Environmental
Protection Act 1990, in England and Wales
by HMIP; they are becoming subject to IPC.
Processes with a significant but lesser
potential for air pollution require approval
from local authorities. Under the Clean Air
Acts, emissions of dark smoke from any trade
or industrial premises or from the chimney of
any building are also prohibited, and new
furnaces must be capable as far as is
practicable of smokeless operation. The 1990
Act also gave local authorities in England and
Wales streamlined powers to deal with
statutory nuisances, including smoke, dust
and smells.
Considerable progress has been made
towards the achievement of cleaner air and a
better environment in the last 30 years or so.
Total emissions of smoke in the air have
fallen by over 85 per cent since 1960. The
domestic smoke control programme has been
particularly important in achieving this result.
London no longer has the dense smoke-laden
‘smogs’ of the 1950s and in central London
winter sunshine has increased by about 70
per cent since 1958. Similar improvements
have been achieved in other cities.
Air pollution data from the Department of
the Environment’s monitoring network are
released to the national press and television
each day as Air Quality Bulletins. These give
the concentrations of three main pollutants—
ozone, nitrogen dioxide and sulphur
dioxide—and grade air quality on a scale
between ‘very poor’ and ‘very good’. The
data are also available to members of the
public on a special telephone number, in
several newspapers and on videotext systems.
A comprehensive government review of
201
BRITAIN 1993: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
urban air quality was announced in January
1992. It will have three independent
committees of experts to advise on different
aspects of the problem, and will set
guidelines and targets for air quality in
Britain. The automatic air quality monitoring
network is also being upgraded at a cost of
£10 million.
Climate Change
The greenhouse effect is a natural
phenomenon which keeps the earth at a
temperature which can sustain life. But
increasing man-made emissions of
‘greenhouse gases’, such as carbon dioxide,
methane and nitrous oxide, are leading to
greater concentrations of these gases in the
atmosphere. In 1988 the United Nations
Environment Programme and the World
Meteorological Organisation established the
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change
to consider climate change and possible
responses to it. Britain chairs the working
group which assesses the scientific evidence
on climate change. It has concluded that
man-made emissions would lead to additional
warming of the earth, and that, without any
change in emissions, global average
temperature would increase by 0-3°C a
decade, which would be faster than at any
time over the past 10,000 years. Such
changes could have major effects on the
world.
In December 1990 the United Nations set
up an Intergovernmental Negotiating
Committee to draw up a framework
convention on climate change. Britain played
a leading role in the negotiations towards the
convention, which was opened for signature
at the UNCED meeting in Rio de Janeiro in
June 1992. This commits all signatories to
devising and reporting on the measures that
they propose to take to combat climate
change. Britain sees the outcome of the
negotiations as a significant first step in the
global response to climate change; the review
process incorporated into the convention is
one of its most important aspects. Britain was
one of over 150 countries that signed the
convention at the UNCED meeting.
Britain has also announced that it is
prepared to return carbon dioxide emissions
to 1990 levels by 2000, provided other
countries take similar action. To meet this
target, energy efficiency measures are the first
priority; further steps are likely in the longer
term. Current measures to combat the
problem include:
• an increased budget for the Energy
Efficiency Office (see Chapter 15);
• a major three-year publicity campaign on
the greenhouse effect and energy use in
the home;
• tighter building regulations to promote
the energy efficiency of new houses;
• a government pledge to achieve a 15 per
cent improvement in the energy
efficiency of its buildings over a five-year
period; and
• a review of the potential of renewable
energy sources.
Britain is also making a major research
effort into global warming. The Hadley
Centre for Climate Prediction and Research
was opened in 1990 to build on the climate
modelling programme of the Meteorological
Office, at a cost of about £6 million a year to
the Department of the Environment. The
Department’s total expenditure on research
related to climate change will be over
£14 million in 1992-93.
Ozone Layer
The Government is committed to the earliest
possible phasing out of all ozone-depleting
substances. Britain was one of the first 25
signatories to the Montreal Protocol, which
deals with the protection of the ozone layer.
It hosted the second meeting of the parties in
June 1990, which substantially strengthened
the protocol. Under the revised protocol, the
supply of chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), halons
and carbon tetrachloride is to be phased out
by 2000 and 1,1,1 trichloroethane by 2005.
There is provision for exemptions for any
essential uses of halons. European
Community legislation requires CFCs to be
phased out by mid-1997, with exemptions for
any essential uses until the end of 1999.
However, recent scientific evidence shows
202
ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION
a need for further measures. The Montreal
Protocol is to be reviewed in November
1992, and Britain is co-chairing the
negotiations leading up to the review. The
European Community is proposing that
CFCs, halons, carbon tetrachloride and 1,1,1
trichloroethane should be phased out by the
end of 1995. It is also proposing that
there should be tight controls on
hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs—
transitional substances with less ozone-
depleting capacity than CFCs, which are
needed in a number of areas if industry is to
move away from CFCs quickly).
Emissions of Sulphur Dioxide and Oxides of
Nitrogen
Sulphur dioxide and oxides of nitrogen are
the main gases that lead to acid rain. The
principal sources are combustion plants that
burn fossil fuels, such as coal-fired power
stations, and, for oxides of nitrogen, road
transport. National sulphur dioxide emissions
have fallen by about 40 per cent since 1970
and the Government has initiated a
substantial programme to ensure that this fall
continues. For example, under the European
Community directive on the control of
emissions from large combustion plants, the
Government has published a national plan
setting out phased reductions in emissions
from existing plants of oxides of nitrogen to
1998 and of sulphur dioxide to 2003.
Table 9.1: Target Percentage Reductions
of Emissions from 1980 Baselines
By 1993 1998 2003
Sulphur dioxide 21 45 63
Oxides of nitrogen 21 35 -
Source: Department of the Environment.
The damaging effect of acid depositions
from combustion processes on freshwaters
and soils has been demonstrated by scientific
research. The Government is spending about
£10 million a year on an extensive research
programme into the causes and effects of acid
rain, and the likely results of possible
abatement technologies. Lower emissions of
sulphur dioxide over the past 20 years have
led to the first signs of a decrease in
acidification in some lochs in south-west
Scotland.
Vehicle Emissions
There are about 24 million vehicles on
Britain’s roads, contributing substantially to
Britain’s total emissions of carbon dioxide,
carbon monoxide, hydrocarbons and oxides of
nitrogen. Since 1970 a series of increasingly
stringent regulations on cars and light vans
has been implemented by the Government to
bring carbon monoxide emissions from each
new car down by 50 per cent and hydro¬
carbon and nitrogen oxide emissions by over
30 per cent. The European Community has
agreed strict new standards for these vehicles,
which will reduce all emissions from new cars
by a further 75 per cent and require almost
all new petrol-engined cars to be fitted with
fully-controlled catalytic converters and run
on unleaded petrol. Further limits are being
considered. The Community is committed to
looking into possible controls on carbon
dioxide emissions from cars. Britain has also
pressed the Community to introduce very
strict emission standards for heavy goods
vehicles and buses by the mid-1990s, and a
common position was agreed in March 1991.
This will introduce stricter limits for gaseous
emissions and, for the first time, limits on
particulate emissions. The Government has
introduced checks on exhaust emissions into
the annual test of vehicle roadworthiness,
measuring carbon monoxide and
hydrocarbons. These limits are also subject to
enforcement at roadside spot-checks.
The amount of lead in the air in
Britain has halved since the permitted
lead content in petrol was reduced in
1986 from 0 4 to 0T5 grammes a litre.
Britain took a leading role in negotiating a
European Community directive which
required unleaded petrol to be available
throughout the Community by October 1989.
Almost all petrol stations in Britain now sell
unleaded petrol, and new cars must be able
to run on it. A substantial tax differential has
been created in favour of unleaded fuel, and
203
BRITAIN 1993: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
demand for it has risen rapidly. By April
1992 unleaded petrol accounted for 45 per
cent of petrol sales in Britain.
Internationally developed standards have
also been introduced to control the emission
from civil aircraft of smoke, vented fuel and
unburned hydrocarbons. Current indications
are that aircraft contribute only a small
amount to overall pollution, although the
Government is funding further research and
taking a leading role in European studies on
this issue.
Noise
Local authorities have a duty to inspect their
areas for noise nuisance and to investigate
complaints about it. They must serve a noise
abatement notice on people deemed to be
creating a noise nuisance. They can also
designate ‘noise abatement zones’ within
which registered levels of noise from certain
premises may not be increased without their
permission. There are also specific provisions
in law to:
• control noise from construction and
demolition sites;
• control the use of loudspeakers in the
streets; and
• enable individuals to take independent
action through the courts against noise
amounting to a nuisance.
Tougher measures against noise were
proposed in the environment White Paper.
Most of its commitments were endorsed by
an independent working party set up by the
Government to review noise control, which
reported in October 1990. Government
spending on environmental noise research is
expected to be about £800,000 in 1992—93.
Transport is a major source of noise, and
control measures are aimed at reducing it at
source, through requirements limiting the
noise that aircraft and motor vehicles may
make, and at protecting people from its
effects. Regulations set out the permissible
noise levels for various classes of new vehicle.
Government research also looks at ways of
reducing noise, and has demonstrated the
feasibility of tougher noise limits for heavy
goods vehicles.
Compensation may be payable for loss in
property values caused by physical factors,
including noise from new or improved public
works such as roads, railways and airports.
Regulations also enable highway authorities to
carry out or make grants for insulation of
homes that would be subject to specified
levels of increased noise caused by new or
improved roads. Noise insulation may be
provided where construction work for new
roads may seriously affect nearby homes.
Britain has played a leading role in
negotiations aimed at the gradual phasing out
of older, noisier subsonic jet aircraft. Flying
non-noise certificated aircraft has been
banned in Britain, and since 1990 British
operators have no longer been allowed to add
to their fleets further ‘Chapter 2’ aircraft
(noisier planes, as classified by international
agreement). A complete ban on the operation
of Chapter 2 aircraft will begin to be
implemented in April 1995, and it is intended
to phase out all these types by April 2002.
Various operational restrictions have been
introduced to reduce noise disturbance
further at Heathrow, Gatwick and Stansted,
where the Secretary of State for Transport
has assumed responsibility for noise
abatement. These measures include:
• restrictions on the type and number of
aircraft operating at night;
• the routeing of departing aircraft on
noise-preferential routes; and
• quieter take-off and landing procedures.
The population affected by aircraft noise at
Heathrow fell from nearly L5 million in 1978
to less than 550,000 in 1988, even though the
number of air transport movements increased
by about a quarter. This was largely because
of the phasing out of older, noisier aircraft.
The Government is also reviewing
arrangements for noise mitigation at smaller
airfields.
Radioactivity
Man-made radiation represents only a small
fraction of that to which the population is
exposed; most is naturally occurring.
Nevertheless, that fraction is subject to
stringent control. Users of radioactive
204
ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION
materials must be registered by HMIP in
England and Wales, and equivalents in
Scotland and Northern Ireland, and
authorisation is also required for the
accumulation and disposal of radioactive
waste. The Health and Safety Executive,
through its Nuclear Installations Inspectorate,
is the authority responsible for the granting
of nuclear site licences for major nuclear
installations. No installation may be
constructed or operated without a licence
granted by the Executive.
The National Radiological Protection
Board (NRPB) provides an authoritative
point of reference on radiological protection.
Following the accident at the Chernobyl
nuclear power station in the then Soviet
Union in 1986, the Government has set up a
national radiation monitoring network and
overseas nuclear accident response system
(RIMNET). An interim version has been
operating since 1988. This is being replaced
during 1992 by a larger system with 92
monitoring stations across Britain.
In 1987 the Government announced
measures to deal with the problem of
naturally occurring radon gas in houses,
including a free survey by the NRPB for
householders living in radon-affected areas.
In 1990 the Government halved the level at
which it is recommended that householders
take action to reduce radon in their homes.
The NRPB has designated Cornwall and
Devon as a ‘Radon Affected Area’ (an area
where more than 1 per cent of the houses
exceed the action level).
Radioactive Waste Disposal
Radioactive wastes vary widely in nature and
level of activity, and the methods of disposal
reflect this. Some wastes can be disposed of
safely in the same way as other industrial and
household wastes. UK Nirex Ltd is
responsible for developing a deep disposal
facility for solid low-level and intermediate-
level radioactive waste. In July 1991 it
announced that its site investigations were
being concentrated on an area adjacent to the
British Nuclear Fuels site at Sellafield
(Cumbria). The Department of the
Environment is sponsoring research, in
collaboration with other countries, into
disposal of high-level or heat-generating
waste. This waste will first be stored in
vitrified form for at least 50 years to allow
the heat and radioactivity to decay. The
Department of the Environment’s 1992-93
budget for research into environmental
radioactivity and radioactive waste is
million.
Genetically Modified Organisms
The Environmental Protection Act 1990
introduced stronger controls over genetically
modified organisms (GMOs). Anyone who
intends to carry out activities with GMOs
first has to do an environmental risk
assessment and, in some cases, first notify the
Government or obtain its consent. The
Government has powers to prevent activities
with GMOs where this would involve a
significant risk of damage to the environment,
and inspectors have the power to destroy or
render harmless organisms which are likely to
cause damage to the environment. A unified
system of administrative control for GMOs is
being developed in parallel with these
provisions, involving the Department of the
Environment, the Health and Safety
Executive and other interested departments.
Environmental Research
Research into environmental protection is
generally co-ordinated by the Department of
the Environment. The Government stated in
This Common Inheritance that such work is
essential to its environmental policies. It has
been estimated that total government
spending on environmental research and
development in 1991-92 was
^300-^400 million, including work in areas
such as renewable energy. Government
spending on investigations into climate
change was £250 million. The Department of
the Environment expects to spend about
£87 million in 1992-93 on research into
subjects including:
• climate change;
• atmospheric pollution and its monitoring;
• toxic chemicals and GMOs;
205
BRITAIN 1993: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
• waste disposal; and
• water quality and health.
Other departments have substantial
programmes, notably the Ministry of
Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, the Scottish
Office Agriculture and Fisheries Department
and other official bodies such as the NRA
and the Meteorological Office.
One of the initiatives launched under the
White Paper was the Environmental
Technology Innovation Scheme, which
combines existing schemes to promote
innovation and competitiveness in the
environmental technology industry.
Research Councils
Basic and strategic research is carried out by
the five government-funded research councils
(see pp 380-5). All have a role in
environmental protection research, but
particularly important is the Natural
Environment Research Council (NERC),
which has a science budget allocation of
£130 million in 1992-93, plus expected
receipts of about £43 million from
commissioned research and other income.
The NERC undertakes and supports
research in the environmental sciences and
funds postgraduate training. Its programmes
encompass the marine, earth, terrestrial,
freshwater, polar and atmospheric sciences.
The NERC stresses international
collaborative work on global environmental
issues. For example, it is helping to develop
global atmospheric climate models and
strengthening atmospheric research in the
Arctic. A major new research programme,
the Terrestrial Initiative in Global
Environmental Research, has been started,
so that the impact of climate change on
Britain and elsewhere can be foreseen. The
NERC also co-ordinates the development
and operation of the Environmental Change
Network.

10 Religion
Although Britain has been predominantly
Christian since Saxon times, following the
Reformation in the sixteenth century many
different Christian denominations have
existed. Today most of the world’s other
religions are also represented in Britain,
including large Hindu, Jewish, Muslim and
Sikh communities.1
Religious Freedom
Everyone in Britain has the right to religious
freedom—in teaching, worship and
observance—without interference from the
community or the State. Religious
organisations and groups may own property,
run schools, and promote their beliefs in
speech and writing. There is no religious bar
to the holding of public office.
Britain has a long tradition of religious
tolerance. Freedom of conscience in religious
matters was achieved gradually from the
seventeenth century onwards. The laws
discriminating against minority religious
groups were gradually administered less
harshly and then finally repealed. Heresy
ceased to be a legal offence with the passage
of the Ecclesiastical Jurisdiction Act 1677,
and the Toleration Act 1688 granted freedom
of worship to Protestant minority groups. In
1828 the repeal of the Test and Corporation
Acts gave nonconformists full political rights,
making it possible for them to be appointed
to public office. Roman Catholics gained
political rights under the Roman Catholic
Relief Act 1829, and the Jewish Relief Act
1858 enabled Jews to become Members of
Parliament. In addition, the religious tests
imposed on prospective students and
academic staff of the universities of Oxford,
Cambridge and Durham were successively
abolished by Acts of 1854, 1856 and 1871.
1 For further details see Religion (Aspects of Britain:
HMSO, 1992).
Similar restrictions on the staff of Scottish
universities were formally removed in 1932.
The past 30 years have seen the
acceptance of a wide variety of religious
beliefs and traditions of large numbers of
immigrants of different nationalities.
Arrangements are made at places of work to
allow the members of non-Christian religions
to follow their religious observances.
Relations with the State
There are two established churches in
Britain, that is, churches legally recognised
as official churches of the State: in England
the (Anglican) Church of England, and in
Scotland the (Presbyterian) Church of
Scotland. Ministers of the established
churches, as well as clergy belonging to other
religious groups, work in services run by the
State, such as the armed forces, national
hospitals and prisons, and are paid a salary
for such services by the State. Voluntary
schools provided by religious denominations
may be wholly or partly maintained from
public funds. Religious education in publicly
maintained schools is required by law
throughout Britain, as is a daily act of
collective worship (see p 156). Religious
broadcasting is subject to some legislative
controls (see Chapter 24).
The Government contributes towards
the upkeep of some 270 redundant
Church of England churches for which
no alternative use can be found but
which are of architectural or historic
importance. The contribution for the
period 1989 to 1994 will be about £8 7
million.
The State makes no direct contribution to
church expenses, although since 1977 limited
state aid has been given for the repair of
historic churches; in 1990-91 English
207
BRITAIN 1993: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Heritage grants to churches totalled £8-2
million. In 1991 the Government announced
that £11'5 million of new money would be
made available to assist with the cost of
repairs to cathedrals and comparable
buildings over the following three years.
Such funding is not restricted to Church of
England buildings.
Involvement in Social Issues
Religious involvement in broader social
issues was highlighted in the Church of
England report Faith in the City: A Call for
Action by Church and Nation, published in
1985. This made recommendations for
improving conditions in the inner cities and
other socially deprived areas, and led to the
establishment in 1988 of the Church of
England’s Church Urban Fund, which aims
to raise money for the Church’s work in
inner city and other priority areas. By July
1992 it had raised over £22 million and
given grants to over 500 inner city projects.
Two further reports, Living Faith in the City
and Faith in the Countryside, were published
in 1990.
Statistics on Religious Affiliation
There is no standard information about the
number of members of religious groups since
questions are not normally asked about
religious beliefs in censuses or for other
official purposes, except in Northern Ireland.
Each group adopts its own way of counting
its members, and membership figures are
therefore approximate.
There has been a fall in recent years in
both the number of full-time ministers and
the number of adults recorded as members
of most of the larger Christian churches. At
the same time there has been significant
growth in a range of independent churches,
and in new religious movements.
The Church of England
The Church of England, founded by St
Augustine in ad 597, became the established
church of the land in the Reformation in the
sixteenth century. Its form of worship was
set out in the Book of Common Prayer,
dating from 1549. The Church of England’s
relationship with the State is one of mutual
obligation—the Church’s privileges are
balanced by certain duties it must fulfil. The
Sovereign must always be a member of the
Church, and promise to uphold it. Church of
England archbishops, bishops and deans are
appointed by the Sovereign on the advice of
the Prime Minister, and all clergy swear
their allegiance to the Crown. The Church
can regulate its own worship. The two
archbishops (of Canterbury and York), the
bishops of London, Durham and Winchester,
and 21 other senior bishops sit in the House
of Lords. Clergy of the Church, together
with those of the Church of Scotland, the
Church of Ireland and the Roman Catholic
Church, may not sit in the House of
Commons.
The Church has two provinces:
Canterbury, comprising 30 dioceses,
including the Diocese of Europe; and York,
which has 14 dioceses.
The dioceses are divided into about
13,000 parishes. There are, altogether, about
10,500 ordained stipendiary Church of
England priests, and about 600 stipendiary
women deacons. In 1989 it was estimated
that, in the two provinces (excluding the
Diocese of Europe), some 233,000 people
were baptised into the Church; of these,
186,000 were under one year old,
representing nearly 29 per cent of live births.
In the same year there were 61,656
confirmations. Attendances at services on a
normal Sunday are around L2 million. In
1989, 118,956 marriages were solemnised in
the Church of England and the Church in
Wales. These accounted for 66-1 per cent of
all marriages with religious ceremonies, and
34-3 per cent of all marriages in England and
Wales. Many people who rarely, if ever,
attend services still regard themselves as
belonging to the Church of England.
The central governing body is the General
Synod, which comprises separate houses of
bishops, clergy and lay members. Lay people
are also concerned with church government
in the parishes. The Synod is the centre of
an administrative system dealing with such
matters as missionary work, inter-church
208
RELIGION
relations, social questions, and recruitment
and training for the ministry. It also covers
other church work in Britain and overseas,
the care of church buildings, church schools
(which are maintained from public funds),
colleges of education, and centres for training
women in pastoral work.
The Church’s investment income is
managed mainly by the Church
Commissioners. Most of the remainder of
the Church’s income is provided by local
voluntary donations.
At present, only men may join the
priesthood, but in 1987 the General Synod
voted to proceed with legislation to enable
women to become priests; final decisions on
the matter are likely to be taken in late 1992
or 1993. The Deacons (Ordination of
Women) Measure 1986 has made it possible
for women to become deacons.
The Anglican Communion
The Anglican Communion comprises 28
autonomous provinces in Britain and abroad,
and three regional councils overseas with a
total membership of about 70 million. In the
British Isles there are four provinces: the
Church of England (established), the Church
in Wales, the Scottish Episcopal Church in
Scotland, and the Church of Ireland.
Every ten years the Lambeth Conference
meets for consultation between all Anglican
bishops. The last Conference was held in
Canterbury in 1988. Presided over by the
Archbishop of Canterbury, the Conference
has no executive authority, but enjoys
considerable influence. The Anglican
Consultative Council, an assembly of lay
people and clergy as well as of bishops,
meets every two or three years and is
intended to allow consultations within the
Anglican Communion.
The Church of Scotland
The Church of Scotland has a presbyterian
form of government, that is, government by
ministers and elders, all of whom are
ordained to office. It became the national
church following the Scottish Reformation
and legislation of the Scottish Parliament,
consolidated in the Treaty of Union 1707
and the Church of Scotland Act 1921, the
latter confirming its complete freedom in all
spiritual matters. It appoints its own office
bearers and its affairs are not subject to any
civil authority.
The adult communicant membership of
the Church of Scotland is about 790,000;
there are about 1,250 ministers. Both men
and women may join the ministry and about
1,500 churches are governed locally by Kirk
Sessions, consisting of ministers and elders.
Above the Kirk Session is the Presbytery,
then the Synod, and finally the General
Assembly, consisting of elected ministers and
elders. This meets annually under the
presidency of an elected moderator, who
serves for one year. The Sovereign is
normally represented at the General
Assembly by the Lord High Commissioner.
There are also a number of independent
Scottish Presbyterian churches, largely
descended from groups which broke away
from the Church of Scotland.
The Free Churches
The term ‘Free Churches’ is often used to
describe some of the Protestant churches in
Britain which, unlike the Church of England
and the Church of Scotland, are not
established churches. In the course of history
they have developed their own traditions. All
the major Free Churches allow both men
and women to become ministers.
The Methodist Church, the largest of the
Free Churches, with over 430,000 adult full
members and a community of more than L3
million, originated in the eighteenth century
following the evangelical revival under John
Wesley (1703-91). The present church is
based on a 1932 union of most of the
separate Methodist Churches. It has 3,514
ministers and 7,207 places of worship.
The Baptists are mainly organised in
groups of churches, most of which belong to
the Baptist Union of Great Britain (formed
in 1812), with about 160,000 members, 2,000
ministers and 2,150 places of worship. There
are also separate Baptist Unions for Scotland,
Wales and Ireland, and other independent
Baptist Churches.
209
BRITAIN 1993: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
The United Reformed Church, with some
121,000 members, 1,016 ministers and 1,792
places of worship, was formed in 1972, when
the Congregational Church in England and
Wales (the oldest Protestant minority in
Britain) and the Presbyterian Church of
England merged. This was the first union of
two different churches in Britain since the
Reformation in the sixteenth century. In 1981
there was a further merger with the Reformed
Association of the Churches of Christ.
The Salvation Army was founded in
Britain in 1865 by William Booth
(1829-1912). Within Britain there are 55,000
members, nearly 1,800 active full-time
officers and almost 1,000 centres of worship.
The Salvation Army is well known for
the work of its 130 social service
centres, which range from hostels for
the homeless to homes for those in
need, and for its prison chaplaincy
service, which covers 96 prisons.
Among the other Free Churches are the
Presbyterian Church in Ireland, the
Presbyterian (or Calvinistic Methodist)
Church of Wales, the Union of Welsh
Independents and the Afro-Westindian
United Council of Churches.
The Roman Catholic Church
The formal structure of the Roman Catholic
Church in England and Wales, which ceased
to exist after the Reformation in the
sixteenth century, was restored in 1850. The
Scottish Church’s formal structure went out
of existence in the early seventeenth century
and was restored in 1878. However,
throughout this period Catholicism never
disappeared entirely. There are now seven
Roman Catholic provinces in Great Britain,
each under an archbishop, and 29 dioceses,
each under a bishop (22 in England and
Wales and seven in Scotland, independently
responsible to the Pope). There are about
2,800 parishes and 6,200 priests (only men
may become priests). Northern Ireland has
six dioceses, some with territory partly in the
Irish Republic. About one British citizen in
ten claims to be a Roman Catholic.
In 1982 Pope John Paul II paid a pastoral
visit to Britain, the first by a reigning pope.
The Pope is represented diplomatically in
Britain by an Apostolic Pro-Nuncio.
The Roman Catholic Church attaches
great importance to the education of its
children and requires its members to try to
bring up their children in the Catholic faith.
Almost 5 per cent of the teachers in Britain’s
2,500 Catholic schools are members of
religious orders. These orders also undertake
other social work; about 250 Roman Catholic
religious orders, congregations and societies
are represented in Britain. Most Catholic
schools are maintained out of public funds.
Other Christian Churches
Other Protestant Churches include the
Unitarians, Free Christians and the
Pentecostalists. The two main Pentecostalist
organisations operating in Britain are the
Assemblies of God and the Elim Pentecostal
Church, many of whose members are of
West Indian origin.
The Religious Society of Friends
(Quakers), with about 18,000 adult members
in Britain and 450 places of worship, was
founded in the middle of the seventeenth
century under the leadership of George Fox
(1624—91). Silent worship is central to its life
as a religious organisation.
The Christian Brethren are a Protestant
body organised in their present form by J.N.
Darby (1800-82). There are two branches,
the Open Brethren (with an estimated 43,500
members) and the Closed or Exclusive
Brethren (with an estimated 7,600 members).
A recent development in Christian
worship has been the ‘house church
movement’ (or ‘new churches’), which began
in the early 1970s and now has an estimated
membership of almost 110,000. Services were
originally held in private houses but now
groups use a variety of hired buildings.
These non-denominational congregations
may come together as ‘streams’, of which
some of the better known are New Frontiers,
Pioneer and Ichthus.
Many Christian communities of foreign
origin, including the Orthodox, Lutheran
and Reformed Churches of various European
210
RELIGION
countries, and the Armenian Church, have
established their own centres of worship,
particularly in London.
There are also several other religious
organisations in Britain which were founded
in the United States in the last century.
These include the Jehovah’s Witnesses, the
Church of Jesus Christ of the Latter-Day
Saints (the Mormon Church), the Christian
Scientists and the Spiritualists.
The Jewish Community
Jews first settled in England at the time of
the Norman Conquest in the latter half of
the eleventh century. The present
community in Britain dates from 1656,
having been founded by those of Spanish
and Portuguese origin, known as Sephardim.
Later more settlers came from Germany and
Eastern Europe; they are known as
Ashkenazim. The present community,
numbering about 300,000, is the second
largest in Europe.
The community is divided into two main
groups. Some 77 per cent of the majority
Ashkenazi Jews are Orthodox and most
acknowledge the authority of the Chief
Rabbi. The Sephardi Orthodox element
follow their own spiritual head, the Haham.
The recently established Masorti movement,
the Reform movement, founded in 1840, and
the Liberal and Progressive movement,
established in 1901, account for most of the
remaining 23 per cent.
Jewish congregations in Britain number
about 350. About one in three Jewish
children attend Jewish schools, some of
which are supported by public funds. Several
agencies care for elderly and handicapped
people.
The officially recognised representative
body is the Board of Deputies of British Jews.
The Muslim Community
The most recent estimates suggest that
Britain’s Muslim population is around
1 million. The largest number originate from
Pakistan and Bangladesh, while sizeable
groups have come from India, Cyprus, the
Arab world, Malaysia and parts of Africa. A
growing community of British-born
Muslims, mainly the children of immigrant
parents, includes an increasing number of
converts to Islam.
There are some 600 mosques and
numerous Muslim prayer centres throughout
Britain. Mosques are not only places of
worship; they also offer instruction in the
Muslim way of life and facilities for
educational and welfare activities.
The first mosque in Britain was
established at Woking, Surrey, in 1890.
Mosques now range from converted
houses in many towns to the Central Mosque
in London and its associated Islamic Cultural
Centre, one of the most important Muslim
institutions in the Western world. The
Central Mosque has the largest congregation
in Britain, and during festivals it may
number over 5,000. There are also important
mosques and cultural centres in Liverpool,
Manchester, Leicester, Bradford, Edinburgh
and Glasgow.
Many of the mosques belong to various
Muslim organisations, and both the Sunni
and the Shia traditions within Islam are
represented among the Muslim community
in Britain. Members of some of the major
Sufi traditions have also developed branches
in British cities.
The Sikh Community
A large British Sikh community, comprising
over 300,000, originates mainly from India.
The largest groups of Sikhs are in Greater
London, Manchester, Birmingham,
Nottingham and Wolverhampton. Sikh
temples or gurdwaras cater for the religious,
educational, social welfare, and cultural needs
of their community. The oldest gurdwara in
London was established in 1908 and the
largest is in Southall, Middlesex. There are
over 170 gurdwaras in Britain.
The Hindu Community
The Hindu community in Britain comprises
around 300,000 members and also originates
largely from India. The largest groups of
211
BRITAIN 1993: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Hindus are to be found in Leicester,
different areas of London, Birmingham and
Bradford. The first Hindu temple or mandir
was opened in London in 1962 and there are
now over 150 mandirs in Britain.
Buddhism
The Buddhist community in Britain consists
largely of adherents of British or Western
origin. There are about 150 Buddhist groups
in Britain and some 50 centres, with at least
20 monasteries and a number of temples. All
the main schools of Buddhism are
represented. The Buddhist Society promotes
the principles of Buddhism; it does not
belong to any particular school of Buddhism.
Other Religious Communities
Other religious communities include about
30,000 Jains, whose religion is of ancient
Indian origin. The Zoroastrian religion, or
Mazdaism, originated in ancient Iran. It is
mainly represented in Britain by the Parsi
community, who are by origin from the
South Asian sub-continent. The Baha’i
movement, which originated in nineteenth
century Iran, regards all the major religions
as divine in origin; there are an estimated
5,000 Baha’is in Britain.
New Religious Movements
A large number of new religious movements
or cults, mainly established since the second
world war (1939^15) and often with overseas
origins, are active in Britain. Examples
include the Church of Scientology, the
Transcendental Meditation movement and
the Unification Church (popularly known as
the ‘Moonies’). In response to public
concern about the activities of some of these
cults the Government has since 1987
provided funding for the Information
Network Focus on Religious Movements
(INFORM), which is also supported by the
main churches. The aims of INFORM are to
conduct research into new religious
movements and to provide objective
information about them. It can also refer
people to counselling services.
Co-operation between Religions
A number of organisations exist which seek
to develop relations between different
religions in Britain. They include the Inter-
Faith Network for the United Kingdom,
which links a wide range of organisations
with an interest in inter-faith relations
including representative bodies from the
Baha’i, Buddhist, Christian, Hindu, Jain,
Jewish, Muslim and Sikh faith communities.
Other organisations include the Council of
Christians and Jews, which works for better
understanding among members of the two
religions and deals with problems in the
social field. Religious leaders belonging to
different faiths have also officiated jointly at
a number of important public occasions.
Christians, Muslims, Sikhs, Hindus, Jews
and Buddhists, for example, have taken part
together in the annual religious observance to
mark Commonwealth Day, which has been
attended by the Queen.
Co-operation among the Churches
The Council of Churches for Britain and
Ireland was established in 1990, replacing the
former British Council of Churches and
taking over its role as the main overall body
for the Christian churches in Britain. The
Council co-ordinates the work of its 30
member churches who are also grouped in
separate ecumenical bodies for England,
Scotland, Wales, and Ireland.
The Free Church Federal Council
includes most of the Free Churches of
England and Wales. It promotes co-operation
among the Free Churches and is a channel
for communication with government. Inter¬
church discussions about the search for unity
now take place through international as well
as national bodies. The Roman Catholic,
Orthodox and Lutheran Churches are
represented on some of these, as are the
Anglican and some of the Free Churches.
The Anglican Church, the Church of
Scotland and the main Free Churches are
also members of the World Council of
Churches. This organisation links some 300
churches in over 100 countries around the
world.

11 National Economy
From 1981 to 1989 the British economy
experienced eight years of sustained growth
at an annual average rate of over 3 per cent.
In 1990, with the onset of recession in Britain
and other major industrialised nations,
growth slowed to around 1 per cent, and in
1991 output fell by nearly 2 5 per cent. The
annual rate of retail price inflation in
September 1992 was 3-6 per cent. By the end
of 1991 average underlying earnings growth
was lower than at any time since 1967. There
has been a rise in unemployment since early
1990. With lower inflation and interest rates
and an increase in exports as the world
economy recovers, the Government expects
to see a resumption of economic growth,
although the timing is uncertain.
Around two-fifths of United States and
Japanese direct investment in the
European Community (EC) comes to
Britain.
Britain’s share of world trade in
manufactures is estimated to have risen
between 1989 and 1991 after stabilising in the
1980s. The current account of the balance of
payments has been in deficit since 1987,
following seven successive years of surplus.
With the exploitation of oil and natural
gas from the Continental Shelf under the
North Sea, Britain is self-sufficient in
energy in net terms and expects to remain
so for some years.
ECONOMIC BACKGROUND
The economy is primarily based on private
enterprise, and government policy is aimed
at encouraging and expanding the private
sector, which accounts for about three-
quarters of total output in the whole
economy and over two-thirds of total
employment.
Values for some of the main economic
indicators in selected years since 1981 are
shown in Table 11.1.
Inflation
During the 1950s and the first half of the
1960s the inflation rate in Britain rarely rose
above 5 per cent. However, in 1971 the
underlying rate reached double figures,
climbing to 27 per cent in 1975.
Contributory factors included oil price rises
in 1973, and increases in the money supply
and public spending. Inflation fell in the

BRITAIN 1993: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
early 1980s and stayed low for a number of
years. However, it picked up towards the end
of the decade and the annual rate rose to
10 9 per cent in September and October
1990. It then fell again, to 3-6 per cent in
September 1992. In the year to June 1992
earnings grew at an underlying rate of some
6 per cent—down from about 10 per cent in
the year to mid-1990 and the lowest level for
25 years.
Output
After the oil price rises of 1973-74,
manufacturing output dropped sharply. It
later increased from this trough but, in the
wake of another oil price rise and stagnation
in the world economy, it fell back again in
the late 1970s and early 1980s. This was
followed by a period of steady growth until
1990, since when there has been a decline.
However, it rose again slightly in the first
half of 1992.
Largely as a result of exploitation of
North Sea oil and gas, energy output in 1986
was about twice the level of ten years earlier.
Oil output has now passed its peak of the
mid-1980s and has since fallen back by about
28 per cent.
By 1985 output of the production
industries as a whole (manufacturing, energy
and water) had risen above its earlier peak of
1979. It experienced sustained growth between
1983 and 1989, but declined in 1990 and 1991.
Only 1 per cent of Britain’s workforce
is engaged in agriculture, a lower
proportion than in any other major
industrialised country. However,
Britain manages to produce over half
of its own food.
Recent decades have generally seen the
fastest growth in the services sector. Services
account for over two-thirds of gross domestic
product—GDP—(and of employment),
compared with about half of GDP in 1950.
Manufacturing contributes less than a
quarter of GDP, compared with over a third
in 1950.

Investment
From 1983 until 1989 fixed investment
increased by about 7 per cent a year on
average, with particularly rapid growth of
nearly 9 per cent a year occurring between
1986 and 1989. This was followed by a
decline in 1990 and 1991. Over the decade
1980-90 the private sector’s share of fixed
investment grew from 72 to 84 per cent, due
in part to privatisation. Over the same period
there was a rise in the share of investment
undertaken by the services sector and a fall in
that carried out by manufacturing. An
improvement in the quality of investment
contributed to the rise in the late 1980s in
the net real rate of return on capital
employed in non-North Sea industrial and
commercial companies. However, in 1990
there was a fall which continued in 1991,
when net profitability amounted to
6 per cent.

Britain’s workforce in employment increased
by 3-3 million in the seven years to June

subsequently declined and in June 1992

BRITAIN 1993: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
June 1991 and June 1992 it dropped by
153,000 to just under 3 million. The number
of women seeking work has risen
substantially.
As in other industrialised countries, there
is concern about unemployment. Even when
the workforce was expanding, unemployment
did not decline as quickly as employment
rose. Seasonally adjusted unemployment fell
by 15 million between July 1986 and April
1990, when the level was 1-6 million, but it
climbed to 2 7 million by June 1992—equal to
9 6 per cent of the workforce.
With a predicted fall in the number of
young people, the population of working age
will grow more slowly during the 1990s than
in recent years. The population increase in
Great Britain between 1988 and 2001 is
projected at 0-7 million, compared with a rise
of 2 4 million in the previous 13 years.
Accordingly, there will be a need for
increased flexibility among those in work and
for employers to tap new sources of
recruitment. The Government has put in
place a new training framework, with a
greater role for employers, so that training
better reflects local needs.
Growth in manufacturing productivity in
Britain in the 1980s was faster than in all
other leading industrialised countries.
Between 1980 and 1990 manufacturing
productivity in Britain grew by an average of
4-7 per cent a year. Productivity in the
economy as a whole increased only slowly in
1990 and 1991.
Overseas Trade
Britain has a relatively open economy, in
which international trade is a vital part of
economic performance. In 1991 exports of
goods and services accounted for about a
quarter of GDP; this proportion has increased
in recent decades, from around one-fifth in
the early 1960s. Similar rises have occurred in
most other developed countries, reflecting the
growing importance of international trade in
an increasingly interdependent world
economy.
Britain is a major exporter of aerospace
products, electrical equipment, chemicals, oil
and many types of machinery. It is also one
of the world’s largest importers of
agricultural products, raw materials and semi¬
manufactures. Exports of manufactures have
risen faster than imports in each of the last
three years. At present, Britain has a deficit
on visible trade.
Substantial net earnings on invisible
transactions kept the current account in
surplus in most years up to 1986, but it has
been in deficit since then. The contribution
made by invisibles to the current account
partly reflects Britain’s position as a major
financial centre. The surplus on invisibles has
fallen since the mid-1980s but rose in 1991
due to Gulf war receipts and lower net
contributions to the EC. Britain’s invisibles
account has been affected by the abolition of
exchange controls in 1979 and the growth in
world markets for insurance, banking,
tourism, consultancy and other services. In
1991 exports of services were valued at
around one-third of exports of goods.
Membership of the EC has had a major
impact on Britain’s pattern of trade,
increasing the proportion with other member
countries. Between 1972 and 1991 the share
of Britain’s exports of goods going to other
members of the Community rose from 33 to
57 per cent. Imports followed a similar trend,
growing from 34 to 52 per cent. Trade with
Japan and with the newly industrialised
countries, including Singapore, Korea,
Taiwan and Malaysia, has risen significantly.
The substantial cumulative surplus on
current account in the first half of the 1980s
contributed to a corresponding increase in
Britain’s net external assets. These are
estimated to have risen from £18,000 million
at the end of 1980 to £99,000 million at the
end of 1986. They have since fallen, to
£65,000 million at the end of 1989 and to
near zero at the end of 1990, as a result of
falls in securities prices and exchange rate
changes during 1990. There was a recovery
by the end of 1991, when they reached
£16,000 million. At the end of 1991 the book
value of British direct investment holdings
overseas was £130,000 million, reflecting the
growth of British-owned multinational
companies. The estimated value of British
portfolio investment holdings overseas was
£239,000 million.
216
NATIONAL ECONOMY
Inward Investment
Direct and portfolio investment in Britain
from overseas has also grown as overseas
companies have become established in Britain,
especially in recent years in preparation for
the onset of the single European market by
the end of 1992. Britain is recognised as an
attractive location for inward direct
investment. This reflects its membership of
the EC and proximity to other European
markets, its stable labour relations and
comparatively low personal and corporate
taxation. Overseas-owned firms are offered
the same incentives as British-owned ones.
At the end of 1990 total United States
investment in Britain was valued at
US$66,000 million, representing over two-
fifths of US investment in the EC. Britain
has for many years been the leading
destination for US manufacturing investment
in Europe. It also has about two-fifths of
Japanese direct investment in the EC.
Energy
The development of North Sea oil and gas
production has had a significant effect on the
economy; in 1991 Britain was the world’s
ninth largest oil producer and the extraction
of oil and gas accounted for some E5 per
cent of GDP. The benefits to the balance of
payments began to appear in the second half
of the 1970s and in 1980 Britain had its first
surplus on oil trade. In 1974 oil accounted for
some 4 per cent of Britain’s visible exports
and 19 per cent of visible imports. In 1991
the proportions were 7 and 5 per cent
respectively (the export proportion having
been as high as 21 per cent in the mid-
1980s). The oil surplus reached its peak in
1985, at £8,100 million. With the reduction
in oil prices the surplus has fallen and
amounted to some £1,200 million in 1991.
Exports, mainly to other EC countries, are
equivalent to well over half of domestic oil
production. They are partly offset in balance-
of-payments terms by imports of other grades
of crude oil from the Middle East and
elsewhere.
North Sea oil helped to alleviate the fall in
real national income which Britain, along with
other industrialised countries, suffered
following the oil price rises of the 1970s. In
the early 1980s it helped to ease the task of
controlling public sector borrowing, one
component of the Government’s counter¬
inflation strategy.
ECONOMIC STRATEGY
The Government believes that the only firm
basis for lasting economic growth and secure
employment is sustainable low inflation. For
the next few years it has set itself the
objective of keeping underlying inflation—the
change in retail prices excluding mortgage
interest payments—between 1 and 4 per cent.
The Government’s economic policy is set
in the context of a medium-term financial
strategy, which is reviewed each year. Within
this strategy, firm monetary and fiscal
policies are designed to defeat inflation.
Short-term interest rates remain the essential
instrument of monetary policy. Fiscal policy
is set over a medium-term horizon to support
tight monetary policies.
Macroeconomic policy is directed towards
bringing down and keeping down the rate of
inflation, while microeconomic policies seek
to improve the working of markets and
encourage enterprise, efficiency and
flexibility. Microeconomic policies aim to
improve the supply-side performance of the
economy through measures such as
deregulation and tax reforms (see below).
Monetary policy
The central aim of monetary policy, which
the Government sees as lying at the heart of
macroeconomic policy, is the creation of
conditions that will exert steady downward
pressure on the rate of inflation. The main
instrument of monetary policy is the use of
market operations to raise or lower interest
rates as appropriate to monetary conditions.
Following Britain’s suspension in
September 1992 of its membership of the
exchange rate mechanism (ERM) of the
European Monetary System, the Government
reaffirmed that holding down inflation
remained the cornerstone of its economic
policy.
217
BRITAIN 1993: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Britain intends to resume membership of
the ERM once:
• the turbulence in the foreign exchange
markets is ended;
• further analysis has been undertaken of
developments in capital markets and in
the European and world monetary
system; and
• British and German monetary policies
have been brought more into line and the
wide differential in German and United
States interest rates narrowed.
In assessing the overall stance of monetary
conditions, the Government pays attention to
a range of indicators. Narrow money, as
measured by MO,1 has proved a reliable
indicator. A target range of 0 to 4 per cent
has been set for MO growth in 1992-93.
Fiscal Policy
The role of a tight monetary policy in
reducing inflation is supported by a firm
fiscal policy. In order to enable industry to
take advantage of the opportunities presented
by the lower exchange rate which followed
Britain’s withdrawal from the ERM, the
Government considers it essential to maintain
tight control over public spending and
borrowing. This will help ensure that the
public sector matches private industry’s
efforts to contain wage costs and maintain
improved competitiveness.
Fiscal policy is set according to the
medium-term objective of a balanced budget.
This is consistent with cyclical variations in
government spending and revenues—
‘automatic stabilisers’. The public sector
therefore tends to run a surplus when the
level of economic activity is high and a deficit
when it is low. For 1992-93 the Government
has decided on an increased level of
borrowing, confident that the underlying
position is sound and that the budget will
move back towards balance as the economy
recovers. The Government does not attempt
to ‘fine-tune’ the level of demand through
1 MO is notes and cash in circulation with the public and banks’
holdings of cash and their operational balances at the Bank of
England.
changes in fiscal policy; it believes that the
associated time lags generally mean that such
changes will be destabilising. Frequent
changes in taxation or spending policy may
also produce an adverse supply-side response.
Within the overall policy of a balanced
budget over the medium term, the
Government aims to reduce taxes so as to
leave people with more of their own money.
The basic rate of income tax has been cut
from 33 to 25 per cent, and in the 1992
Budget the Government introduced a new
lower rate of income tax of 20 per cent on
the first ^2,000 of taxable income. The
Government’s objective for public spending is
that over time it will take a declining share of
national income, while value for money is
constantly improved. This has seen the ratio
of general government expenditure, excluding
privatisation proceeds, to GDP fall from 47-5
per cent in 1982-83 to 42 per cent in
1991-92. The forecast level of the Public
Sector Borrowing Requirement, £28,000
million or 4-5 per cent of GDP for the year
to March 1993, can be largely attributed to
the impact of the recession.
Supply-Side Policies
While macroeconomic policy is directed
towards reducing inflation, the Government
has sought to improve the supply response,
and thus the efficiency, of the economy
through microeconomic policies. Action has
been taken to expose more of the economy to
market forces. Direct controls—for example,
on pay, prices, foreign exchange, dividend
payments and commercial credit—have been
abolished and competition in domestic
markets strengthened. Steps have been taken
to reduce regulatory burdens on business.
Labour market reforms have been introduced,
measures implemented to encourage saving
and share ownership, and a substantial
amount of activity has been transferred from
the public to the private sector by
privatisation and contracting work out. In
addition, efforts have been made to improve
value for money in the public sector by, for
example, transferring many of the executive
functions of government to new executive
agencies.
218
NATIONAL ECONOMY
Labour
The Government has sought to improve
work incentives by reducing personal income
tax rates, raising tax thresholds and reforming
the benefits system. It has also, through the
tax system, encouraged the extension of share
ownership among employees. A scheme of
income tax relief has been introduced to
encourage the spread of profit-related pay.
The Government has taken steps to achieve a
better-balanced legal framework for industrial
relations and has expanded training
opportunities. Obstacles to the mobility of
labour have been reduced. For example, the
rights of those leaving occupational pension
schemes early have been improved and new
arrangements for personal pensions
introduced; both of these changes will reduce
the pension disadvantage of changing jobs.
Reforms in the housing market have been
introduced to make it easier for people to
move house. Policies have been set in train
to reduce the number of administrative
obstacles facing small firms and the self-
employed.
Markets and Investment
Competition among financial institutions is
being encouraged within a new statutory
framework of investor protection. The
Government has also taken steps to reduce
the distorting effects of the tax system on
investment and savings decisions by, among
other things, reforming corporation tax (the
burden of which has been eased) and the
system of capital allowances. Planning
restrictions on industrial investment have
been lessened.
Government support to industry has
become more selective. Where there is
evidence of market failure, particular efforts
have been made to improve the flow of
investment funds to small firms, assist
innovation in industry and attract industry to
the inner cities.
Economic Management
HM Treasury has prime responsibility for
the formulation and conduct of economic
policy, which it carries out in conjunction
with the Bank of England (the central bank)
and the Departments of Trade and Industry,
Employment, the Environment, Transport,
and the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries
and Food.
A number of other bodies deal with
specific aspects of economic policy and the
regulation of certain sectors of the economy.
These include bodies such as the Office of
Fair Trading and the Monopolies and
Mergers Commission.
On major matters of public policy such as
the broad economic strategy, and on the
economic problems it faces, the Government
makes known its policies and keeps in touch
with developments throughout the economy
by means of informal and continuous links
with the chief industrial, financial and other
interests. Final responsibility for the broad
lines of economic policy rests with the
Cabinet.
NATIONAL INCOME AND
EXPENDITURE
The value of all goods and services produced
in the economy is measured by GDP. This
may be expressed either in terms of market
prices (the prices people pay for the goods
and services they buy) or at factor cost (the
cost of the goods and services before adding
taxes and subtracting subsidies). It can also
be expressed in current prices or in constant
prices (that is, removing the effects of
inflation in order to measure the underlying
growth in the economy). In 1991 GDP at
current factor cost totalled £497,000 million.
In 1991 the index of GDP at constant
factor cost was 113-8 (1985 = 100), compared
with 89-3 in 1981, an increase of some
27 per cent.
Table 11.5 gives figures for GDP, at both
current market prices and current factor cost.
It also shows the components of two other
main aggregates, gross national product and
national income.
Table 11.6 shows the categories of total
final expenditure in 1991. Consumers’
expenditure accounted for one-half of total
final expenditure, and exports of goods and
services for nearly one-fifth.

Personal Incomes and Expenditure
Personal disposable income consists of
personal incomes after deductions—mainly
taxation and social security contributions.
This rose fairly steadily from £177,700
million in 1981 to £407,600 million in 1991.
Personal disposable income in 1991 was 0-2
per cent lower in real terms than in 1990.
Consumers’ expenditure amounted to 70-9
per cent of pre-tax personal income in 1991,
compared with 71-6 per cent in 1990.
Table 11.7 shows the changing pattern of
consumers’ expenditure. Housing, food,
alcoholic drink, clothing and footwear, and
fuel and power together accounted for 42 per
cent of the total. The changes in the pattern
between 1981 and 1991 in Britain were
paralleled in other industrialised countries,
with declining proportions being spent on
food, tobacco, clothing and footwear, and fuel
and power. Over the longer term, as incomes
rise, people tend to spend increasing
proportions on services. Spending on leisure
pursuits and tourism, health and financial
services have all shown significant growth in
recent years. Consumers’ expenditure fell by
2 per cent in real terms between 1990 and
1991, following a long upward trend.
Saving as a percentage of personal
disposable income rose to 13 3 per cent in
1980; by 1988 it had fallen back to 5-6 per
cent. This reduction probably reflected a
number of factors, including lower inflation,
higher property prices and the deregulation
of the personal finance market, which made

borrowing easier. However, the savings ratio
increased in 1989, 1990 and 1991, reaching
9-8 per cent in the latter year.
Sources of Income
The proportion of total personal pre-tax
income accounted for by income from
employment was 64 per cent in 1991;
average gross weekly earnings in April 1991
in Great Britain were ;£319 for full-time
male workers and £222 for full-time female
workers. The three other main sources of
personal income were self-employment
(11 per cent), rent, dividends and interest
(11 per cent), and social security benefits and
other current grants from government
(14 per cent).
Current Government Expenditure
Final consumption by central government and
local authorities amounted to £121,900
million in 1991; it rose by 15 per cent in real
terms over the period 1981 to 1991. The
main cause of this was the growth over the
period in spending on the social services,
health, and law and order.
In addition to their expenditure on goods
and services, public authorities transfer large
sums to other sectors, mainly the personal
sector, by way of National Insurance and other
social security benefits, grants, and interest
and subsidies. Central government also makes
grants to local authorities to finance an
increasing proportion of their current
expenditure (about three-quarters in 1991).

12 Industry and Commerce
Introduction
The most important industrial developments
in the last 15 years have been the growth of
the offshore oil and gas industries and the
rapid development of electronic and
microelectronic technologies and their wide
application in industry and commerce. There
has been a steady increase in the share of
output and employment accounted for by
private sector enterprises as privatisation has
progressed. The proportion of jobs in the
service industries continues to rise.
In some sectors a small number of large
companies and their subsidiaries are
responsible for a substantial proportion of
total production, notably in the vehicle,
aerospace and transport equipment industries.
Private enterprises generate about three-
quarters of total domestic income. They
account for the greater part of activity in the
agricultural, manufacturing, construction,
distributive, financial and miscellaneous
service sectors. The private sector
contributed 76 per cent of total domestic final
expenditure in 1991, general government 23
per cent and public corporations 1 per cent.
About 250 British industrial companies in
the latest reporting period each had an annual
turnover of more than £500 million. The
annual turnover of the biggest, British
Petroleum (BP), makes it the eleventh largest
industrial grouping in the world and the
second largest in Europe. Five British firms
are among the top 25 European Community
(EC) companies.
Industrial Financing
Over half of companies’ funds for investment
and other purposes are internally generated.
Banks are the chief external source of finance,
but companies have increasingly turned to
equity finance. The main forms of short-term
finance available in the private sector are
bank overdrafts, trade credit and factoring
(making cash available to a company in
exchange for debts owing to it).
Types of medium- and long-term finance
include bank loans, mortgaging of property
and the issue of shares and other securities to
the public through the London Stock
Exchange. The leasing of equipment may also
be regarded as a form of finance. Other

222
INDUSTRY AND COMMERCE
sources of finance for industry include the
Government, the European Community and
specialist financial institutions.
Equity finance, known as venture capital,
is a major source of funding for the start-up,
expansion or purchase of a company. Finance
is provided by major institutions and
managed by ‘captive’ managers (from wholly
owned subsidiaries of large financial
institutions) or independent fund managers.
Since 1985, members of the British Venture
Capital Association have invested over ^7,000
million and currently command an
investment pool of some £2,000 million.
There has also been a rise in the number
of ‘buy-outs’, in which the staff or
management of a company raise the finance
to purchase it, and ‘buy-ins’, whereby the
staff or management of one firm purchase
another. Since 1982 there have been over
4,000 buy-outs and buy-ins, with a total value
of £26,061 million. The amount invested in
management buy-outs and buy-ins in 1991
was £2,809 million.
Taxation
Rates of corporate taxation have been
progressively reduced. In the case of business
plant and machinery, an annual allowance is
available against profits for tax purposes of 25
per cent (on a reducing balance basis),
beginning in the year in which expenditure
occurs. For investment in industrial building,
there is an allowance of 4 per cent a year.
Special arrangements exist for short-life,
often high-technology, assets. There are 100
per cent allowances for capital expenditure on
scientific research, and, in designated
enterprise zones, for expenditure on
construction.
Industrial Associations
The Confederation of British Industry (CBI)
represents about 250,000 companies from all
sectors, together employing around half of
Britain’s workforce. It exists to create a
climate of opinion in which business can
operate efficiently and profitably. It
campaigns to lessen the burdens on business,
tackle handicaps on competition, and help
improve the performance of companies. The
largest employers’ organisation in the
country, it offers members a forum, a lobby
and a range of advisory services. The CBI
also conducts surveys which provide a useful
barometer of activity in manufacturing,
distribution, financial services, the regions,
innovation, and pay and productivity.
The British Chambers of Commerce
(BCC) represent business views and interests
to the Government at national and local
levels. They promote local economic
development, for example, through
regeneration projects, tourism, inward
investment promotion in certain areas of
Britain and business services, including
overseas trade missions, exhibitions and
training conferences. The BCC represents
over 90,000 businesses in over 100 chambers
of commerce throughout Britain.
Trade associations consist of companies
producing or selling a particular product or
group of products. They exist to supply
common services, regulate trading practices
and represent their members to government
departments.
Employers’ organisations are usually
concerned with the negotiation of wages and
conditions of work in a particular industry,
although sometimes one institution may
combine this function with that of a trade
association.
Government and Industry
The Government believes that economic
decisions are best taken by those competing
in the market place, and that government
should encourage enterprise and create the
right climate for markets to work better.
The Department of Trade and Industry
(DTI) is the department mainly responsible
for the Government’s relations with industry
and commerce. Specific responsibilities
include technology and innovation, overseas
trade and export promotion, competition
policy and consumer affairs, regional
industrial development, small firms,
company legislation and patents. Through
the Invest in Britain Bureau, it gives advice
and assistance to foreign companies on
locating in Britain. The Scottish, Welsh and
223
BRITAIN 1993: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Northern Ireland Offices are responsible for
industrial policies in their areas.
In July 1992, the Government announced
its intention to reorganise the DTI so that it
relates more closely to individual sectors of
business. In 1991 the DTI specified its
objectives for industrial policy as:
• working for trade liberalisation worldwide
and the completion of the single
European market (see p 226);
• promoting British exports;
• stimulating innovation in industry;
• improving the flow of information to
business;
• encouraging competition;
• aiming for a light but effective framework
of market regulation;
• fostering a positive attitude towards
wealth creation;
• reducing burdens on business;
• taking into account the concerns of
business and consumers in the
development of government policies; and
• responding to regional needs.
Privatisation
The Government believes that the best way
to improve the performance of public sector
companies and nationalised industries is to
expose them to market forces, through
privatisation and the promotion of
competition. Privatisation has also provided
an opportunity for the Government to widen
and deepen share ownership by encouraging
both employees and the general public to take
a direct stake in industry. In major flotations,
employees in privatised companies are
normally given a preferential right to buy
shares in the new privatised companies.
Since 1979 the Government has
privatised 46 major businesses, with
forecast net proceeds to the end of
1992-93 of some £50,000 million.
Recent privatisations include British
Technology Group and the electricity
generating industry in Northern Ireland. The
sale of part of the Government’s residual
shareholding in BT took place at the end of
1991. Legislation is to be introduced for the
privatisation of British Coal and to enable the
private sector to operate rail services.
Nationalised Industries
The remaining major nationalised industries
are British Coal, British Rail, the Post Office
and London Transport. Their managing
boards are appointed by ministers who have
the power to give general directions but are
not involved in day-to-day management. The
managing boards and staffs of the
nationalised industries are not civil servants.
The Government considers that
nationalised industries should act as
commercial enterprises and has set policies
with which they are expected to conform.
These involve:
• clear government objectives for the
industries;
• regular corporate plans and performance
reviews;
• agreed principles relating to investment
appraisal and pricing;
• financial targets and performance aims;
• external financing limits; and
• systematic monitoring.
The industries are expected to achieve a
required rate of return on new investment,
currently 8 per cent in real terms before tax.
The financial targets established by the
Government are usually supported by a series
of performance aims, covering costs and,
where appropriate, standards of service.
External financing limits, which control the
amount of finance (grants and borrowing)
that a nationalised industry can raise in any
financial year, are an important operating
control. They are set in the light of the
industry’s financial targets and its
expected performance and investment
requirements.
The Citizen’s Charter, introduced in 1991,
is intended to raise quality, secure better
value and extend accountability in public
services, including nationalised industries.
External scrutiny of nationalised industry
efficiency is conducted by the Monopolies
224
INDUSTRY AND COMMERCE
and Mergers Commission (see p 231). Where
appropriate, investigations may also be
undertaken by management consultants.
House of Commons Select Committees, such
as the Treasury and Civil Service Committee
and the Committee of Public Accounts, also
scrutinise the industries’ performance.
Deregulation
The Government is attempting to reduce
administrative and legislative burdens
imposed on business, particularly small
businesses, where the burden of compliance
is most demanding.
Under the Deregulation Initiative, the
Government works to reduce burdens on
business by:
• achieving better regulation, cutting
unnecessary regulation and minimising
the cost of compliance with essential
regulation;
• ensuring that the views of business, and
potential costs of compliance, are taken
into account in framing new regulations
and in negotiating EC proposals;
• improving official awareness of the needs
of business through training and better
consultation and communication; and
• improving the quality of service to
business generally, whether provided by
central or local government.
Existing regulation, such as that affecting
the workplace, wages and employment
conditions, is kept under constant review by
the DTPs Deregulation Unit. In addition,
each regulatory department has its own
deregulation unit, focusing on regulatory and
administrative requirements in the areas for
which it is responsible.
Enterprise Initiative
The Enterprise Initiative brings together a
wide range of the services that the DTI
provides for industry and commerce. The
consultancy scheme encourages small and
medium-sized businesses to use outside
consultancy services as a regular part of their
management strategy. It offers consultancy
support in design, marketing, manufacturing
and service systems, quality, business
planning, and financial and management
information systems.
In Scotland and Wales the initiative is
operated by Enterprise Services Scotland (a
subsidiary of Scottish Enterprise—see p 227)
and the Welsh Development Agency

(see p 229). Assistance is available to most
manufacturing and service businesses with
fewer than 500 employees. In the Assisted
Areas (see p 227) and Urban Programme
Areas, two-thirds of the costs of a project
are met; elsewhere the rate is 50 per cent.
Some £60 million is being provided in
1992-93 to support the consultancy scheme.
Small Firms
Small businesses make a major contribution
to the economy by employing 35 per cent of
the private sector workforce and producing
17 per cent of British turnover. Some
460,000 new businesses were started in 1991,
slightly less than the 500,000 in 1989 and
1990, but higher than the average for the
1980s. Industries with the fastest growth
rates between 1979 and 1990 were in the
services sector, particularly finance,
property and professional services.
The Government runs schemes giving
either direct assistance or advice and
guidance on a range of business problems
affecting small firms. In addition to DTI
schemes such as consultancy help under the
Enterprise Initiative, the Government’s
Small Firms Service, operating throughout
Britain, provides information, advice,
counselling and training services to
prospective and established small
businesses.
The Support for Products Under
Research scheme (SPUR—see p 386) helps
smaller firms to be more innovative by
awarding grants towards the cost of new
product and process development projects.
The Small Firms Merit Awards for Research
and Technology (SMART—see p 386) are
made annually to highly innovative and
potentially commercial projects being
developed by individuals and firms with
fewer than 50 employees. A three-year
extension to SMART will receive around
£40 million of government funding.
Other government help to small firms
includes:
• guaranteed repayment of 70 per cent of
medium-term loans made by financial
institutions (rising to 85 per cent of
loans in inner city Task Force areas);
• a programme to encourage the growth
of informal investment for small firms
from a wider range of sources. The
Government is to support co-operation
between Training and Enterprise
Councils (TECs—see p 168) and other
organisations to bring together investors
and small firms; and
• the Enterprise Allowance Scheme,
enabling unemployed people to claim an
allowance while establishing a new
business.
Government Management Initiatives
The DTI is working with other government
departments and with industry to improve
management education, and to spread
awareness about best management practices.
As part of the Enterprise Initiative (see
p 225), the DTPs consultancy scheme
encourages small and medium-sized
businesses to improve management skills and
competitiveness by making effective use of
outside expertise in business planning,
design, quality, financial and management
information systems, manufacturing and
services systems, and marketing.
Another programme, ‘Managing into the
90s’, offers advice to managers in small and
medium-sized businesses on design, quality,
production and purchasing, and materials
management. Having been extended for a
three-year period until 1995, the programme
will focus on management practices in the
manufacturing sector.
Single European Market
The programme for the completion of the
single European market, which concerns
the free movement of goods, services, people
and capital, is derived from a White Paper
published by the European Commission in
1985. It comprises over 280 different
directives and other measures aimed at the
removal of the remaining obstacles and
distortions in trade between member states by
the end of 1992. The Government believes
that the single European market will benefit
the economy of each member state, and that
226
INDUSTRY AND COMMERCE
the elimination of trade barriers should lead
to a reduction in business costs as well as
increasing competition, stimulating efficiency
and encouraging the creation of jobs and
wealth.
Regional Industrial Development
Regional industrial policy is designed to
encourage enterprise and economic growth in
all areas of Britain. In some areas, however,
where additional help is needed, it is
provided under the DTFs Enterprise
Initiative. Help is focused on the Assisted
Areas (Development Areas and Intermediate
Areas), which cover around 35 per cent of
Britain’s working population (see map).
The principal instruments are:
• regional selective assistance, available
throughout the Assisted Areas, for
investment projects undertaken by firms
meeting certain criteria; and
• Regional Enterprise Grants, which are
available to support investment and
innovation in small firms. Investment
grants are available to firms with fewer
than 25 employees in all Development
and some Intermediate areas. Innovation
grants are made to firms employing fewer
than 50 employees in all Development,
Intermediate, Task Force and City
Challenge areas (see pp 175-6), as well as
some other areas covered by EC schemes;
they are also available in certain Scottish
urban areas.
England
The English Industrial Estates Corporation
makes available industrial and commercial
premises in certain parts of the Assisted Areas
in England where private sector provision is
insufficient.
The Rural Development Commission is
responsible for advising the Government on
issues affecting rural England and for
promoting its economic and social
development. The Commission’s resources
are concentrated in areas of greatest need,
known as Rural Development Areas. It
provides:
• small factories and workshops built and
managed by English Estates;
• a grant scheme for the conversion of
redundant buildings to industrial or
commercial premises;
• technical, management and financial
advice, as well as training facilities and
loans to small businesses;
• support for local enterprise agencies,
which in turn offer help to small firms;
• support for voluntary bodies in rural
areas to encourage community activity
and self-help; and
• finance for small-scale rural housing and
transport schemes.
Scotland
Scottish Enterprise and Highlands and
Islands Enterprise provide support to
industry and commerce, in lowland and
highland Scotland respectively, operating
mainly through a network of private-sector-
led Local Enterprise Companies (LECs). The
LECs encourage investment in the
development of skills throughout the
workforce and invest directly in training,
particularly for school-leavers and the long¬
term unemployed. In addition, they offer a
range of advisory and training services to
businesses, including schemes to enhance the
expertise of managers.
Scottish Enterprise and Highlands and
Islands Enterprise seek to ensure that
economic development in Scotland is not
artificially constrained by inadequate
provision of sites and factories, and that there
is sufficient investment funding for
businesses in the private sector. Where
necessary they contribute financially to such
provision. They also remove obstacles to
economic development through the treatment
of derelict land and by contributing to
tackling deficiencies in the physical
environment and infrastructure of towns and
cities. In addition, the Scottish Office
Industry Department provides support to
exporters and small firms through the SPUR
and SMART programmes and Regional
Enterprise Grants (see above).

INDUSTRY AND COMMERCE
Wales
The Welsh Development Agency (WDA)
promotes industrial efficiency and
international competitiveness and aims to
improve the environment in Wales. Through
Welsh Development International, it seeks to
attract high-quality investment into Wales
and encourages those concerned within Wales
to be receptive to such investments. The
WDA provides a range of support services,
particularly for small and medium-sized
enterprises. The Business Services
programme helps companies plan strategically
for long-term competitiveness, growth, and
improved profitability, and for meeting
customer requirements, and understanding
and implementing best practice. The
programme also includes technology
exploitation, skills development, financial
advice and help, and a comprehensive
European programme.
To ensure an adequate supply of
commercial property throughout Wales, the
WDA has its own industrial stock and
conducts a direct building programme, while
encouraging the private sector to provide the
necessary industrial development, often in
partnership with it. Development projects,
such as a major programme of land
reclamation and environmental improvement
and an urban development programme, aim
to regenerate selected towns by opening up
development opportunities for private
enterprise. The Rural Prosperity Programme
includes comprehensive action plans to
develop specific rural areas. There are also
initiatives and schemes designed to stimulate
new rural enterprise and business growth.
The Development Board for Rural Wales
supplies factories, key worker housing and
advice for small businesses. It has a general
responsibility to promote the economic and
social well-being of mid-Wales and a
particular responsibility for the new town of
Newtown, Powys.
The seven Training and Enterprise
Councils in Wales offer a wide range of
services to business and enterprise activities
in their areas, including support for business
start-up, training and other help for existing
firms, and a business information and advice
service. Partnerships are being established
with other organisations in Wales to help
bring about economic regeneration and
growth in their areas.
Northern Ireland
Industrial development policy in Northern
Ireland is the responsibility of the
Department of Economic Development and is
delivered through various agencies, including:
• the Industrial Development Board, which
deals with overseas companies considering
Northern Ireland as an investment
location, as well as the development of
local companies with more than 50
employees;
• the Local Enterprise Development Unit,
responsible for the promotion of
enterprise and the development of small
businesses;
• the Industrial Research and Technology
Unit, providing advice and assistance on
research and development, innovation and
technology transfer; and
• the Training and Employment Agency,
which helps with in-company training
and management development.
Several schemes are available to help
companies with marketing, exporting, product
development and design, improved
productivity and quality, training, and
research and development. The full range of
assistance is made available to those
companies with the greatest development
potential and prospect of long-term
competitive growth. Where appropriate, this
assistance includes capital grants, loans and
share capital investment. The Industrial
Development Board also offers stocks of land
and industrial premises for purchase or lease.
There is exemption from local taxes for
manufacturing premises.
European Community Regional Policy and Aid
The European Community seeks to reduce
disparities between regions. The principal
responsibility for helping less prosperous
areas remains with national authorities, but
229
BRITAIN 1993: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
the Community may complement schemes
through aid from a number of sources.
The European Regional Development
Fund, the largest of the European
Community’s structural funds, is intended
to help redress the principal regional
imbalances. Its budget for 1992-93 is £5,671
million, having been £4,686 million in
1991-92. Some 7 per cent of this has been
allocated to Britain.
European Community member states
subscribe to the capital of the European
Investment Bank, which aims to:
• facilitate development in less developed
regions;
• modernise or convert industries; and
• support the creation of new economic
activities.
The Bank also helps to finance projects
of common interest to several member
states. The Channel Tunnel (see Chapter
17) is one such project currently being
assisted in Britain.
The European Community makes loans
and grants to encourage rational distribution
of production and a high level of
productivity in the coal and steel industries.
Schemes eligible for aid are coal industry
projects, projects to create new activities in
coal and steel areas, construction of housing
for workers, allowances for redeployed
workers, and research, including research of
a social or medical nature.
Inward Investment
Britain is considered as an attractive location
for inward direct investment. This reflects
its membership of the European
Community and proximity to other
European markets, stable labour relations
and comparatively low corporate and
personal taxation. Overseas-owned firms are
offered the same incentives by the
Government as British-owned ones.
The Invest in Britain Bureau of the
Department of Trade and Industry gives
foreign companies advice and assistance on
locating and relocating businesses in Britain,
and on expanding existing facilities. It
operates overseas through British Embassies,
High Commissions and Consulates-General,
and within Britain through the DTFs
network of regional offices in England, which
provide local information about available
sites, wages and skills, markets and housing.
The promotion of England as a location
for inward investment projects is handled by
the English unit of the DTI. Similar advice
and assistance is available through Locate in
Scotland, operated jointly by the Scottish
Office Industry Department and Scottish
Enterprise; Welsh Development International,
the investment arm of the Welsh
Development Agency; and the Industrial
Development Board in Northern Ireland.
The promotion of inward investment is a key
element in the Government’s regional policy
(see p 227).
Innovation
Innovation—the successful exploitation of
new ideas—is vital in maintaining an
economy based on competitive wealth
creation. Through its Innovation Unit, the
DTI seeks to influence the thinking of
business, education, the media and
Government, as well as the general public, by:
• improving commercial exploitation of
Britain’s science and technology base;
• improving management of innovation in
business by spreading best practice;
• improving communications between
investors and business regarding
innovation;
• increasing appreciation of the importance
of innovation within education at all
levels;
• informing the public of the importance of
innovation in wealth creation; and
• ensuring consistency and co-operation in
the delivery of innovation schemes and
services provided by the DTI and other
government departments.
These activities are carried out by various
organisations. The DTFs function is to act as
a catalyst for, and add value to, the work
wherever it occurs. The Department spends
over £100 million a year in support of

LEISURE
A growing awareness of the
importance of regular
exercise for good health has
contributed to an increased
level of participation in
sport. More than 13,000
people took part in a
sponsored ‘Aerobathon’ in
April 1992, held to raise
funds for a charity, the Royal
Marsden Cancer Appeal.
Centre Parcs, a holiday
centre in Sherwood Forest,
Nottinghamshire, won the
First ever award for ‘Green
Tourism’ in the English
Tourist Board’s 1990
England for Excellence
awards. It offers a wide range
of sport and leisure facilities
in a forest setting, including
this covered Subtropical
Swimming Paradise.
FESTIVALS AND EXHIBITIONS

INDUSTRY AND COMMERCE
collaborative industrial research and
technology transfer in firms of all sizes and
across most industrial technologies, which
often involves firms, higher education
institutions and research organisations
working together.
The Teaching Company Scheme, under
which graduates undertake key projects in
smaller firms under the joint direction of
academic and company staff, is one example
of technology transfer. Over 1,000 projects
have been successfully completed. A new
programme will support the placement of
more senior academic staff into firms for six-
month periods, where they will work directly
on projects that may benefit from their
research experience.
Regulation of Markets
While preferring to let markets operate as
freely as possible, the Government recognises
that intervention may sometimes be needed
to ensure that markets are open and fair. The
Government therefore seeks to control
restrictive or anti-competitive practices.
Within the public sector it has taken a
number of steps to increase competition,
notably through privatisation (see p 224).
The DTFs Deregulation Unit seeks to reduce
regulations which inhibit competition,
innovation or consumer choice (see p 225).
The Government scrutinises and regulates
monopolies, mergers, anti-competitive
practices, restrictive trade practices, and
resale price maintenance. It has taken
measures to increase competition in
professional services by tackling restrictive
practices. For instance, the opticians’
monopoly on the dispensing of spectacles and
the solicitors’ monopoly on conveyancing
have been ended. Certain professional groups
(for example, accountants, solicitors,
veterinary surgeons, stockbrokers, doctors,
dentists and surveyors) have eased the
restrictions on advertising by their members,
and rules on fee scales have been made more
liberal in a number of areas. Building
societies are now allowed to offer a greater
range of services. Legislation has also
provided for greater competition in the
provision of legal services.
Monopolies
The Director General of Fair Trading and
the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry
can refer monopolies for investigation by the
Monopolies and Mergers Commission, an
independent body. Its members are drawn
from a variety of backgrounds and include
lawyers, economists, industrialists and trade
unionists. The governing legislation defines a
monopoly situation as one in which at least a
quarter of a particular kind of product or
service is supplied by a single person or a
group of connected companies or by two or
more people acting in a way which prevents,
restricts, or distorts competition. The market
definition of a monopoly can relate to all of
Britain or part of it.
If the Commission finds that a monopoly
situation operates against the public interest,
the Secretary of State for Trade and
Industry has powers to take action to
remedy this. Alternatively the Director
General may be asked to negotiate
undertakings to remedy the adverse effects
identified by the Commission. In 1991 the
Commission reported on six monopoly
situations, two of which were found to
operate against the public interest. Two
further investigations were still in progress at
the end of the year.
The Secretary of State has powers to refer
to the Commission any questions concerning
the efficiency and costs of the service
provided by, or the possible abuse of a
monopoly situation by, certain bodies in the
public sector.
Mergers
The Government believes that the market is,
in most cases, the best judge of the
advantages and disadvantages of mergers.
The great majority of mergers which do not
pose a threat to competition are, therefore,
allowed to take place. However, under the
Fair Trading Act 1973, the Secretary of State
for Trade and Industry can refer mergers for
investigation by the Monopolies and Mergers
Commission if they could lead to a significant
reduction in competition or otherwise raise
matters of public concern.
231
BRITAIN 1993: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
A merger is defined as occurring when
two or more enterprises are brought under
common ownership or control. A merger
qualifies for investigation by the Commission
where:
• an existing market share of 25 per cent
or more is increased; or
• the total value of gross assets to be taken
over exceeds £30 million.
After considering advice from the
Director General of Fair Trading, the
Secretary of State may refer a merger or
proposed merger to the Commission. The
primary criterion of the Government’s
referral policy is the possible effects on
competition. If the Commission finds that a
merger or proposed merger may be
expected to operate against the public
interest, the Secretary of State can prohibit
it. Alternatively, the Director General may be
asked to obtain suitable undertakings from
the companies involved to remedy the
adverse effects identified. If the merger has
already taken place, the Secretary of State
can take similar action to reverse it. There
are special provisions for newspaper and
water company mergers.
During 1991, three acquisitions valued
at more than £1,000 million were
completed. The number of mergers
qualifying for investigation in 1991 was
185, compared wdth 269 in 1990.
The Companies Act 1989 made changes to
improve merger control procedure. This
provided for:
• a voluntary procedure for pre-notification
of proposed mergers which, for the
majority of cases, permits prompt
clearance;
• the acceptance of statutory undertakings
by the parties concerned in order to
obviate the need for a full investigation
by the Monopolies and Mergers
Commission in certain cases;
and
• the temporary prohibition on reciprocal
share dealing by the parties to a merger
referred to the Commission.
Anti-competitive Practices
The Director General of Fair Trading can,
with limited exceptions, investigate any
business practice which appears anti¬
competitive. If the Director General
concludes that a practice is anti-competitive,
an undertaking may be sought from the
business responsible for the practice; if a
suitable undertaking is not given, the matter
may be referred to the Monopolies and
Mergers Commission to establish whether it
it is an anti-competitive practice and if it
operates against the public interest. In the
case of an adverse finding by the
Commission, the Secretary of State has
powers to take remedial action.
Restrictive Trade Practices
Certain kinds of commercial agreements
containing restrictions on, for example,
matters such as prices or conditions of sale
have to be notified to the Director General of
Fair Trading for registration. Failure to
register an agreement within the required
period means that the restrictions are void
and unenforceable and the parties may be
liable to legal proceedings.
Once an agreement has been registered,
the Director General is under a general duty
to refer it to the Restrictive Practices Court.
In practice, however, the great majority of
agreements never reach the Court because the
parties elect to give up the restrictions rather
than go to court. Alternatively, the Secretary
of State accepts the Director General’s advice
that the restrictions are not significant
enough to warrant referral to the Court.
If an agreement goes to the Court, the
Court must declare the restrictions contrary
to the public interest unless the parties can
satisfy it that the agreement is in the public
interest, using set criteria (‘gateways’).
Restrictions declared contrary to the public
interest by the Court are void, and the Court
has the power to order the parties not to
implement them.
Resale Price Maintenance
With two exceptions, it is unlawful for
232
INDUSTRY AND COMMERCE
suppliers to notify dealers of a minimum
resale price for their goods or to make it a
condition of supply that their goods must not
be sold below a specified price. Similarly, it
is also unlawful for suppliers to seek to
impose minimum resale prices by withholding
supplies of goods or discriminating in other
ways. The Director General of Fair Trading,
or anyone affected, can take proceedings
against such actions in the civil courts.
Financial Services
Legislation exists to offer greater protection
to investors. The Securities and Investments
Board (see p 258) is empowered to set out
general principles governing the conduct of
investment business.
Under the Financial Services Act 1986,
the Director General of Fair Trading is able
to consider the effects on competition of the
rules and practices of the various regulatory
bodies operating under the Act. Where a
significant or potentially significant effect has
been identified, a report is made to the
Secretary of State for Trade and Industry. If
the Secretary of State agrees with this view
and does not consider that the provisions are
necessary for the protection of investors, he
or she may refuse or revoke recognition of
the organisation or require it to make
alterations to its provisions.
European Community
European Community rules provide for free
and fair competition in trade between member
states. In most areas of economic activity the
enforcement of these rules is primarily the
responsibility of the European Commission,
which has powers to investigate and terminate
alleged infringements and to impose fines.
The Treaty of Rome prohibits agreements
or concerted practices which affect trade
between member states and which prevent,
restrict or distort competition within the
common market. Agreements meeting specified
criteria may be exempted from this prohibition
either individually or by category of agree¬
ment. The latter include certain agreements
in exclusive distribution and exclusive
purchasing, franchising, co-operative research
and development, specialisation and patent
licensing. Air services within the Community
were liberalised further in 1992.
The Treaty does not allow any abuse of a
dominant position within the Community or
a substantial part of it if this affects trade
between member states. Large mergers with a
Community dimension, which are assessed by
reference to turnover, normally come under
the exclusive jurisdiction of the European
Commission. The Commission can ban them
if it considers that they create or strengthen a
dominant position which would significantly
impede effective competition within the
Community.
Consumer Protection
The Government believes that consumers’
interests are best served by open and
competitive markets offering the widest range
of choice in goods and services. There are,
however, laws to ensure that consumers are
adequately protected.
Legislation covers the sale of goods, the
supply of goods and services, and the way
that goods and services are described. The
marking and accuracy of quantities are
regulated by weights and measures legislation.
The Food Safety Act 1990 contains measures
to improve food safety and to protect
consumers; these include tougher penalties
and better enforcement powers. Another law
provides for the control of medical products,
and certain other substances and articles,
through a system of licences and certificates.
Under European Community legislation, it is
a criminal offence to supply unsafe consumer
products. A range of public safety
information for consumers has been made
available by the DTI.
The Director General of Fair Trading can
make recommendations to the Government
for legislation to put a stop to trading
practices that unfairly affect consumers’
interests. He or she can also take action
against persistent offenders against existing
law. Under the Fair Trading Act 1973, the
Director General has a duty to encourage
trade associations to prepare and circulate to
their members codes of practice aimed at
raising trading standards.
233
BRITAIN 1993: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
The Director General is responsible for
the operation of legislation regulating
consumer credit and hire business and estate
agency work. He or she also has
responsibilities under legislation for
controlling misleading advertisements.
The European Community’s consumer
programme covers a number of important
activities, such as health and safety,
protection of the consumer’s economic
interests, promotion of consumer education
and strengthening the representation of
consumers. The views of British consumer
organisations on Community matters are
represented by the Consumers in the
European Community Group (UK). British
consumer bodies are also represented on the
European consumer ‘watchdog’ body, the
Bureau Europeen des Unions de
Consommateurs (BEUC).
Consumer Advice and Information
Advice and information on consumer matters
are given by Citizens Advice Bureaux,
trading standards or consumer protection
departments of local authorities, and, in some
areas, by specialist consumer advice centres.
The independent, non-statutory National
Consumer Council (and the associated
councils for Scotland and Wales), which
receives government finance, presents the
consumer’s view to government, industry and
others. The General Consumer Council for
Northern Ireland has wide-ranging duties in
consumer protection and consumer affairs in
general.
Consumer bodies for the rail and other
nationalised industries and privatised
industries investigate questions of concern to
the consumer. Some trade associations in
industry and commerce have established
codes of practice. In addition, several private
organisations work to further consumer
interests. The largest is the Consumers’
Association, funded by the subscriptions of
its members.
Education and Training
A well educated and well trained workforce is
considered essential for economic growth,
particularly at a time of intense international
competition and rapid technological advance.
The Government takes measures to see that
education and training are broadly based and
that people of all ages can acquire relevant
knowledge and skills. It has introduced
legislation to improve education and training
for young people by, among other things,
reducing barriers between academic and
vocational studies.
Industrial and commercial matters are
being allotted a more prominent place in
school and post-school curricula. The
introduction of the National Curriculum in
England and Wales, with parallel
developments in Scotland and Northern
Ireland, is helping to achieve this in schools,
and the Technical and Vocational Education
Initiative plays a similar role in both schools
and colleges. Businessmen and women
contribute to curriculum development and
cross-curricular economic and industrial
understanding for schoolchildren, and have
been enabled to take a larger part in the
management of educational establishments.
The Government has set up a network of
82 business-led Training and Enterprise
Councils (TECs) in England and Wales and
22 Local Enterprise Companies (LECs) in
Scotland (see p 168). TECs are independent
companies run by boards of directors, the
majority of whom are drawn from private
sector business. They manage a range of
training, education and
enterprise programmes on behalf of the
Government.
Schoolchildren and teachers are given the
opportunity to gain business experience by,
for instance, spending time in firms. Colleges
and universities co-operate with industry in
joint ventures such as science parks and
regional technology centres and in the
provision of enterprise training for higher
education students.
Management Development and Industrial
Training
Management education is on offer at many
universities and colleges of higher and further
education. Some regional management centres
have been established in England and Wales
234
INDUSTRY AND COMMERCE
by associations of these colleges, and there
are several similar organisations in Scotland.
Universities run full-time postgraduate
programmes at business schools such as
those of London, Manchester, Durham,
Warwick and Strathclyde universities.
Training courses for managers are offered
by several independent colleges, including
the Management College (Henley-on-
Thames), Ashridge College (Berkhamsted)
and Cranfield School of Management
(Bedford). Open and distance learning
opportunities are becoming more widely
available. The Open University, which
provides degree courses using distance
learning techniques, notably television
broadcasts, has its own Business School
offering part-time courses leading to a
diploma in management and to a Master’s
degree in Business Administration.
The British Institute of Management
encourages excellence in management. Other
professional bodies are concerned with
standards and training in specialised
branches of management. The employer-led
Management Charter Initiative (MCI) is the
operating arm of the National Forum for
Management Education and Development
and the leading industrial body for
management standards. Over 1,400
employers, representing a quarter of the total
workforce, are members of MCI, which has
50 local networks working with local
employers.
Engineering Council
Established under Royal Charter in 1981,
the Engineering Council promotes the
science and practice of engineering and
advances education in engineering. The
Council maintains a register of 290,000
chartered engineers, incorporated engineers
and engineering technicians. In co-operation
with various professional institutions and
other organisations concerned with training
in engineering, it has set standards for
education, training and experience, and
accredited courses by which people qualify
for registration. The Council is advised by
some 250 industrial affiliates on industrial
requirements for engineers and technicians.
Design
The Design Council promotes effective
design in industry and commerce. It works
with manufacturing industry to underline the
importance of design and supports training
and education in design at all levels.
As the DTPs main agent for design
promotion, the Design Council has
responsibility for linking design to innovation
and technology so as to ensure that British
products compete effectively in world
markets. It is also responsible for the design
element of the Enterprise Initiative
consultancy scheme, and for the design
element of the ‘Managing into the 90s’
programme. Its activities include:
• offering advice on design matters and
problems;
• organising conferences and seminars;
• providing help for design education;
and
• producing publications and videos.
The Design Council, in operating the
DTPs consultancy initiative on design, offers
firms employing up to 500 people five to 15
days of subsidised consultancy. The Council
runs the British Design Awards in four
categories: consumer and contract goods;
transport industry products; computer
software; and industrial products.
Quality and Standards
The Government is urging industry and
commerce to consider quality at all stages of
design, production, marketing and delivery to
customers.
Through its support for consultancy
projects, the Government helps small and
medium-sized firms to learn about and apply
quality management techniques based on a
national standard meeting international
requirements. In order to increase customer
confidence, companies are encouraged to
obtain assessment and registration to this
standard. The competence and performance
of organisations undertaking such
certification are officially approved by the
National Accreditation Council for
235
BRITAIN 1993: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Certification Bodies. Companies certified by
accredited bodies are permitted to use the
national ‘crown and tick’ accreditation mark.
The British Standards Institution (BSI),
incorporated by Royal Charter, is the British
member of the European and international
standards organisations. It works with
industry and government to produce
standards of the required quality, relevant to
the needs of the market, internationally
respected, and suitable for public purchasing
and regulatory purposes.
Government support for BSI is directed
particularly towards European and
international standards work. Common
standards are contributing to the aim of
creating the single internal market in the
European Community. Over one-third of the
11,000 British Standards are now identical
with European or international standards; of
all standards published in 1991-92, over a half
are identical. The Kitemark is BSPs
registered certification trade mark. Resource,
a joint venture between BSI and the
Government, has been launched to promote
collaboration with overseas countries in
standards, quality assurance, metrology and
testing.
Measurement Standards
The Department of Trade and Industry is
responsible for policy relating to the National
Measurement System. Through its
contractors, including the National Physical
Laboratory (NPL), it provides most of the
physical measurement standards and
associated calibration facilities necessary so
that measurements in Britain are made on a
common basis and to the required accuracy.
Links with other national standards
laboratories are maintained to ensure
international compatibility in standards and
measurement, which is essential for overseas
trade and technological co-operation. The
National Measurement Accreditation Service
(NAMAS) is the national accreditation
service for calibration and testing laboratories.
NAMAS-accredited laboratories offer
calibration of scientific instruments and
supply official certificates in, primarily, the
physical, chemical and engineering fields.
The DTI, through contractors such as the
Laboratory of the Government Chemist,
provides standards associated with chemical
and analytical measurement. These standards
and approved methods also form the basis for
NAMAS accreditation of laboratories
carrying out analytical measurement.
International agreement is based on the
provision of appropriate standards and the
utilisation of approved methods of analysis.
As an executive agency of the DTI, the
National Weights and Measures Laboratory
administers legislation concerned with
standards and measuring equipment for use
in trade. New European Community
directives on measuring instruments, which
are to replace national legislation, will ensure
free circulation of approved equipment within
the Community.
Awards to Industry and Commerce
The Queen’s Awards for Export and
Technological Achievement recognise
outstanding performance in their respective
fields. Awarded annually, they last for five
years and are granted by the Queen on the
advice of the Prime Minister, who is assisted
by an Advisory Committee consisting of
senior representatives from industry,
commerce, the trade unions and government
departments. Any self-contained ‘industrial
unit’ in Britain is eligible to apply, regardless
of size, provided it meets the scheme’s
criteria. A new award for environmental
achievement is to be launched in 1993.
Other awards include the Export Award
for Smaller Businesses (for firms employing
fewer than 200 people) and the MacRobert
Award, the major award for engineering in
Britain made by the Fellowship of
Engineering for successful technological
innovation.
Company Law
All British companies are registered with the
Registrar of Companies in Cardiff, Edinburgh
or Belfast, depending on whether a company’s
registered office is in England or Wales,
Scotland or Northern Ireland. Legislation
deals with capital structure, the rights and
236
INDUSTRY AND COMMERCE
duties of directors and members, and the
preparation and filing of accounts. Most
corporate businesses are ‘limited liability’
companies. The liability of members of a
limited company is restricted to contributing
an amount related to their shareholding. In
the case of unincorporated businesses, such
as sole proprietorships or partnerships,
individuals are personally liable for any
business debts, except where a member of a
partnership is a limited liability company.
Companies may be either public or
private. A company must satisfy three
conditions before it can become a public
limited company (pic). It must:
• be limited by shares and have a share
capital;
• state in its memorandum of association
that it is to be a public limited company;
and
• meet specified minimum capital
requirements.
All other British companies are private
companies and are generally prohibited from
offering their shares to the public.
Companies with a place of business in
Britain, but which are incorporated overseas,
are also required to register.
Laws relating to companies are designed
to meet the need for proper regulation of
business, secure open markets and create
greater safeguards for those wishing to invest
in companies or do business with them.
They implement European Community
directives dealing with company laws, and
company and group accounts and their
auditing. Additionally, they permit the
implementation of policy changes designed to
reduce unnecessary regulation of business,
strengthen rules on the disclosure of interest
in shares, and increase powers to investigate
companies.
Insider dealing in shares is a criminal
offence. Inspectors may be appointed to
investigate possible insider dealing.
Throughout Britain, there is a licensing
procedure to ensure the professional
competence, integrity and independence of
people acting as trustees of bankrupt
individuals, or as liquidators, receivers or
administrators of insolvent companies.
The Serious Fraud Office investigates and
prosecutes cases of fraud in England, Wales
and Northern Ireland.
Industrial and Intellectual Property
Legislation secures the rights of the
originators of inventions, new industrial
designs and trade marks. These matters are
administered by the Patent Office, which
includes the Design Registry and the Trade
Marks Registry. The Patent Office is an
executive agency of the DTI. Protection is
also available under the European Patent
Convention and the Patent Co-operation
Treaty. Benefits may be claimed in other
countries by virtue of the International
Convention for the Protection of Industrial
Property.
The Government supports innovation by
protecting the ownership of ideas through
patents, registered designs, trade marks and
copyright. Recent measures include:
• a sharp increase in penalties for making
and trading in pirate sound and film
recordings (including video);
• extension of copyright protection to
owners of computer software;
• widening of the law on trade marks to
embrace services;
• introduction of powers for customs
authorities to prevent the entry of
counterfeit goods;
• introduction of a new form of protection
for designs; and
• new laws to protect performers.
Changes have been proposed to modernise
and simplify existing trade marks law, and to
make trade mark registration and protection
easier.

13 Manufacturing and
Construction Industry
Introduction
Manufacturing accounted for 21 per cent of
gross domestic product (GDP) in 1991 and
for about the same percentage of
employment. Over 80 per cent of visible
exports consisted of manufactured or semi¬
manufactured goods. Almost all
manufacturing is carried out by private
businesses.
In 1991 manufacturing output was 12 per
cent higher than in 1985 (see Table 13.2).
However, the recent recession has led to
contraction in some areas of the sector.
Although there was a decline in
manufacturing output of 5 per cent in 1991,
output in some industries, such as chemicals
and synthetic fibres, continued to rise (see
Table 13.2). Manufacturing employment in
Great Britain fell from 5 8 million in 1982 to
4-7 million in 1991. Total fixed capital
expenditure in manufacturing at current
prices was £12,678 million in 1991,
comprising £10,170 million in plant and
machinery, £1,956 million in new building
work and £552 million in vehicles
(investment by sector is shown in Table 13.3).
The ten largest manufacturing concerns,
by £ million of turnover, are Unilever
(22,258), BAT Industries (15,027), Imperial
Chemical Industries (12,906), British
Aerospace (10,540), Grand Metropolitan
(9,395), Hanson Trust (7,153), Ford Motor
Company (6,732) General Electric Company
(GEC) (5,253), British Steel (5,113) and
SmithKline Beecham (4,764).
The construction industry contributed
7 per cent of GDP and employed just over
900,000 people in 1991. It accounted for over
4 per cent of total employment. Total fixed
capital spending at current prices was
£965 million in 1990.

MANUFACTURING AND CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY
Advanced Technology
High-technology manufacturing industries in
Britain, such as the electrical, electronic and
instrument engineering, chemicals and
aerospace industries, have some of the highest
levels of research and development (R & D)
spending in relation to their gross output
(see p 378). Most of the electrical and
electronic industries—office machinery,
electronic data-processing equipment, basic
electrical equipment, telecommunications
equipment, electrical instruments and
control systems, radio and electronic capital
goods, and components—are included.
Instrument engineering covers precision
equipment for measuring and checking, plus
medical, optical, photographic and filming
equipment.
High-technology chemicals include
specialised organics, plastics materials,
synthetic resins, synthetic rubbers and
pharmaceuticals. Aerospace production as a
whole is defined as high-technology. All these
industries have levels of output, productivity
and exports above the average for
manufacturing industries.
Computer-aided design and manufacturing
processes are commonplace in large areas of
the manufacturing sector. About 137,000
computers were in use for manufacturing
applications in the engineering sector in 1991
and firms reported that expenditure on
computer hardware, software and services was
expected to reach £955 million during 1992.
Many British concerns are making use of
advanced lightweight materials, such as
carbon fibre composites in the aerospace
industry, new types of plastics in the
automotive and engineering sectors and high-
fibre, cholesterol-free protein in food
production. Advanced robots function in
conditions too hazardous for human
operators, such as certain areas of mining,
nuclear engineering and firefighting. The
widespread adoption of Advanced
Manufacturing Technology (AMT) has
enabled the motor vehicle industry to become
more efficient.
The Government provides financial
assistance to companies and research
organisations seeking to develop and improve
technologies needed by industry. It has, for
example, made resources available to

Sectors of Manufacturing
Relative sizes of the various branches of
manufacturing are shown in Tables 13.1 and
13.2. Table 13.3 also indicates employment
and investment levels in each sector. A more
detailed description of the main branches is
given below.
Mineral and Metal Products
Iron and Steel Products
Britain is the world’s tenth largest steel-
producing nation. British producers delivered
15 million tonnes of finished steel in 1991, of
which 53 per cent was sold on the home
market and the remainder exported. The
steel industry has operated a balance-of-
payments surplus since 1983. The major
areas of steel production are in Wales, and
northern and eastern England, with
substantial re-rolling and further processing
in the Midlands.
British Steel is the fourth largest steel
company in the Western world, producing
about four-fifths of Britain’s crude steel. The
company’s output is based on strip products,
plate, heavy sections, tubes and stainless
items. Its products are used principally in the
packaging, construction, automotive,
engineering, transport, metal goods and
energy industries.
Forty other steel-producing firms,
represented by the British Independent Steel
Producers’ Association, manufacture
engineering and other special steels, wire rod,
wire and wire products, reinforcements for
use in the construction industry, and other
more specialised goods. They are responsible
for about 35 per cent by value of finished
steel deliveries. Exports have increased since
the early 1980s, particularly to the rest of the
European Community. Total steel exports
were 7-7 million tonnes in 1991, 13 per cent
higher than in 1990.

Iron products
Non-ferrous metals
Non-metallic mineral products
of which: glass and glassware
ceramic and heat-resistant goods
Non-ferrous Metals
Output of non-ferrous metals and their alloys
in 1991 included primary aluminium, of
which nearly 294,000 tonnes were delivered,
and secondary aluminium, of which over
136,000 tonnes were delivered. Britain
produced over 70,000 tonnes of unwrought
copper and just under 400,000 tonnes of
copper and copper alloy semi-manufactures.
Primary metal production relies mainly on
imported ores, concentrates and partially
refined metal. Recycled metal plays an
important part in raw material supply.
Britain is a major producer of specialised
alloys for high-technology requirements in
the aerospace, electronic, petrochemical, and
nuclear and other fuel industries. Titanium
and titanium alloys are used in aircraft
production, power generation and North Sea
oil production, and nickel alloys for aero¬
engines operating in high-temperature
environments.
In recent years considerable progress has
been made in the development of
‘superplastic’ alloys, which are more ductile
and elastic than conventional alloys.
Aluminium lithium, developed by British
Alcan Aluminium, is ideal for use in aircraft,
being lighter, stronger and more rigid than
normal aluminium. Nearly half of the
industry is situated in the Midlands and
Wales.
Ceramics
The ceramics industry manufactures clay
products, such as domestic pottery,
sanitaryware and tiles, and clay pipes for the
building trade. Total sales of ceramic goods
in 1991 were £1,038 million. Domestic
pottery, which includes the manufacture of
china, earthenware and stoneware, accounted
for 22 per cent of the industry’s output in
1990. Tableware is produced in Stoke-on-
Trent, and Britain is the world’s leading
manufacturer and major exporter of fine
bone china.
Research is being conducted into
ceramics for use in housebuilding and diesel
and jet engines. Important industrial
ceramics invented in Britain include silicon
carbides developed by the United Kingdom
Atomic Energy Authority and sialons
developed at the University of Newcastle
upon Tyne.
Other Mineral Products
Glass-reinforced cement composites for the
construction industry were invented in
Britain in the early 1970s and are made under
licence in over 40 countries.
Flat glass is manufactured through the
float glass process, which was developed by
Pilkington Brothers and licensed to
glassmakers throughout the world. Pilkington
has also produced an energy-saving window
glass which reflects room heat without
impairing visibility. Export sales of flat glass
principal products amounted to £100 million
in 1991.
Britain is the world’s biggest exporter of
china clay (kaolin). In 1991 some 3 million
tonnes, valued at more than £200 million,
were sold overseas. The main company
involved is ECC International, part of the
English China Clays Group.

BRITAIN 1993: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Chemicals and Synthetic Fibres
Britain’s chemicals industry is at the forefront
of modern technology, spending the
equivalent of 6 per cent of total sales on
research and development. It is the third
largest chemicals industry in Western
Europe, and the fifth largest in the Western
world. The nation’s fourth biggest
manufacturing industry, nearly half of its
production of principal products is exported,
making it Britain’s greatest single export
earner. The industry had a trade surplus of
£2,800 million in 1991 and provided
employment for more than 300,000 people.
The most rapid growth in recent years has
been in speciality chemicals, particularly
pharmaceuticals, pesticides and cosmetics.
Imperial Chemical Industries (ICI) accounts
for a substantial part of the industry’s
production. It is the fourth largest chemicals
company in the world, has a range of 15,000
products and is one of Britain’s biggest
exporting companies.
Traditionally Britain has been a major
producer of basic industrial chemicals, such
as inorganic and basic organic chemicals,
plastics and fertilisers, which together
comprise around 38 per cent of output. Sales
of principal fertiliser products reached £585
million in 1991. Many major chemical
companies are subsidiaries of overseas
companies and others are specialist
manufacturers of pharmaceuticals, such as
Glaxo and Wellcome.
Chemicals
Sales of the principal products of organic
chemicals amounted to £3,890 million in
1991 and those of miscellaneous chemicals for
industrial use to £3,020 million; the surplus
on overseas trade in the latter sector was
over £500 million. Some British chemicals
companies have reacted to falling world
demand and have changed to producing
specialised rather than commodity organics.
The most important products sold in the
organic chemicals range are ethylene
(1-6 million tonnes produced in 1991),
benzene (721,000 tonnes) and propylene
(932,000 tonnes).
A large proportion of world R & D in
agrochemicals is conducted in Britain.
Notable British discoveries include
pyrethroid insecticides, Id’s diquat and
paraquat herbicides, systemic fungicides and
aphicides, genetically engineered microbial
pesticides and methods of encouraging
natural parasites against common pests in
horticulture.
Exports of soap and toilet preparations in
1991 were valued at almost £900 million,
compared with imports of over £500
million. Total sales amounted to more than
£4,000 million. This sector includes soap
and synthetic detergents, dominated by
Lever Brothers (part of Unilever) and by
the United States-owned Proctor and
Gamble. Boots and SmithKline Beecham
are significant producers of perfumes,
cosmetics and toilet preparations.
Much of inorganic chemicals production
consists of relatively simple bulk chemicals,
such as sulphuric acid and metallic and
non-metallic oxides, serving as basic
materials for industry. Other speciality
chemicals include industrial gases, essential
oils and flavourings, adhesives and sealants,
and explosives. Annual investment in
environmentally safe products and processes
is increasing.

MANUFACTURING AND CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY
Plastics
About one-third of semi-manufactured
plastics production is exported. Expansion in
recent years has mainly been in thermoplastic
materials, of which the most important are
polyethylene, polyvinylchloride, polystyrene
and polypropylene. Total sales of plastics
packaging products, valued at £2,200 million
in 1991, were largely accounted for by the
home market. With up to three times the
strength but only a fifth of the weight of
steel, heat-resistant engineering plastics are
used in aircraft and vehicle manufacture. ICI
has produced the world’s first biodegradable
thermoplastic, Biopol, which is used as a slow
release agent for drugs and herbicides and for
making non-polluting bottles and films. ICI’s
polyester-based digital ‘paper’ is being used
to make computer tape. Synthetic rubbers in
large-scale production include butadiene-
based neoprene for tyres, high-styrene for
shoe soles and flooring, and oil-resistant
nitrile rubbers. Output of plastics packaging
rose by 45 per cent in the late 1980s and new
types of plastics are fast replacing traditional
packaging materials like paper, tin and glass.
ICI is the world’s largest paint
manufacturer. Among specialised products
are new ranges of synthetic resins and
pigments, powder coatings, non-drip and
quick-drying paints and paints needing only
one top coat. Two recent innovations have
been solid emulsion paint and a temporary
water-based finish which can be removed
easily by chemical treatment, for vehicle
bodies and road markings. Sales of paint,
varnishes and painters’ fillings were worth
£1,730 million in 1991.
Pharmaceuticals
Britain is the world’s fourth largest exporter
of medicines. The strength of chemicals has
been based on the performance of Britain’s
pharmaceuticals industry. This sector has
some of the world’s largest multinational
research-intensive manufacturers, as well as
middle-sized and smaller specialist
companies. Total sales in 1991 were over
£6,000 million. Pharmaceuticals exports,
which include some of the world’s best¬
selling products, were valued at £2,700
million. The main markets are Western
Europe and North America, with Japan an
expanding market.
The pharmaceuticals industry’s trade
surplus of £1,280 million in 1991
was the second largest of all
manufacturing sectors, an increase
of 9 per cent on 1990. Employing
over 87,000 people directly, the
pharmaceuticals sector supports
employment for 250,000 others in
related activities.
The industry invested more than £1,000
million in R & D in 1991. This sum amounts
to more than 14 per cent of British
manufacturing industry’s R & D and
represents about 8 per cent of total world
expenditure on medicines research. Progress
in pharmaceuticals research has helped to
reduce dramatically the impact of diseases
such as polio, tuberculosis, diphtheria and
measles. The substantial investment needed
for R & D is leading to further concentration
of the industry’s resources in a smaller
number of fields.
In 1991 British firms made three of the
world’s ten best-selling medicines, including
Glaxo’s ulcer treatment Zantac and ICI’s
beta-blocker Tenormin for treating high
blood pressure. The United States subsidiary
of Britain’s Wellcome Foundation developed
Retrovir (also called Zidovudine), the first
treatment for HIV infection to gain
government approval, as well as Zovirax, the
first routine treatment for the herpes group
of viruses. Both drugs increased sales by
around 30 per cent in the latter half of 1991.
Other recent major developments pioneered
in Britain are semi-synthetic penicillins and
cephalosporins, both powerful antibiotics, and
new treatments for asthma, arthritis, migraine
and coronary heart disease. Glaxo’s Zofran,
the anti-nausea drug used to counter the
effects of cancer treatments, achieved £120
million of sales in 1991.
A growing trend is the production of
cheaper, unbranded (generic) drugs. The
biggest British company making these,
Medeva, is also the world’s fifth largest
243

vaccine maker. It develops generic drugs by
improving existing drugs or buying the
companies which make them.
medicines through a computer-aided
technique for analysing the structures of
complicated organic molecules on a visual
display unit.
Biotechnology
The biotechnology sector includes the
manufacture of products using techniques
such as genetic engineering. Britain has made
major advances in the development of drugs
such as human insulin and interferons,
genetically-engineered vaccines, and the
production of antibiotics by fermentation;
agricultural products such as infection-
resistant crops; medical diagnostic materials
like biosensors; and synthetic foodstuffs such
as the animal food Pruteen and the human
food Mycoprotein.
The major chemical companies, like ICI,
Wellcome, Glaxo and SmithKline Beecham,
undertake extensive research in biotechnology.
The specialist products of Britain’s 50 small
independent biotechnology firms comprise,
among other items, medical diagnostics and
microbial pesticides. The British company
Celltech was the first licensed by the United
States Government for the large-scale
production of monoclonal antibodies, proteins
which can seek out a particular substance in
the body. They are used to diagnose diseases,
identify different blood types and can be
employed in the treatment of a range of
conditions, including cancer.
Britain leads in the development of
molecular graphics, which contribute to the
rational design of new and improved
Fibres
The main types of synthetic fibre are still
those first developed: regenerated cellulosic
fibres such as viscose, and the major
synthetic fibres like nylon polyamide,
polyester and acrylics. Extensive research
continues to produce a wide variety of
innovative products with characteristics
designed to meet market needs; antistatic and
flame-retardant fibres are examples. More
specialist products include the aramids (with
very high thermal stability and strength),
elastanes (giving very high stretch and
recovery) and melded fabrics (produced
without the need for knitting or weaving).
Mechanical Engineering and
Metal Goods
Exports of mechanical machinery amounted
to 13 per cent of visible exports in 1991.
Output includes pressure vessels, heat
exchangers and storage tanks for chemical
and oil-refming (process) plant, steam-raising
boilers (including those of high capacity for
power stations), nuclear reactors, water and
sewage treatment plant, and fabricated
steelwork for bridges, buildings and industrial
installations.

major producers of tractors, which make up
over three-quarters of the country’s total
output of agricultural equipment. Sales of the
principal products of the tractor industry
were almost £1,000 million in 1991, of which
about £660 million was accounted for by
overseas sales. Recent technical innovations
include computer-controlled tractors, a highly
efficient pesticide sprayer and combined
mower/conditioners that significantly reduce
the drying time for grass. Much of the new
machinery is designed for use in a variety of
conditions to meet the needs of overseas
farmers. The Royal International Agricultural
Exhibition, held annually near Coventry, has
a specialised tropical machinery centre, where
demonstrations of such machinery are given.
Almost all of Britain’s machine tools are
purchased by the engineering, vehicles and
metal goods industries. Britain is the world’s
seventh largest producer of machine tools.
Total sales reached £2,400 million in 1991, of
which over a third were exports. British
technology leads in probes, sensors, co¬
ordinate measuring devices, laser melting and
the installation of flexible manufacturing
systems. Computer numerical-controlled
machines account for an increasing
proportion of output.
In 1991 most sales of textile machinery
were to export markets. British innovations
include computerised colour matching and
weave simulation, friction spinning, high¬
speed computer-controlled knitting machines
and electronic jacquard attachments for
weaving looms.
Sales of mining machinery and tunnelling
equipment are substantial. J.C. Bamford is
the world’s leading manufacturer of backhoe
loaders and telescopic handlers. Exports of
earth-moving equipment were valued at
nearly £1,200 million in 1991. Britain’s
mining equipment industry leads in the
production of coal-cutting and road-heading
(shearing) equipment, hydraulic roof
supports, conveying equipment, flameproof
transformers, switchgear, and subsurface
transport equipment and control systems.
The mechanical handling equipment industry
produces cranes and transporters, lifting
devices, escalators, conveyors, powered
industrial trucks and air bridges, as well as
electronically controlled and automatic
handling systems. Britain is also a major
producer of industrial engines, pumps, valves
and compressors, and of pneumatic and
hydraulic equipment.
Despite an overall decline in the castings
industry, some foundries have been investing
in new melting, moulding and quality control
equipment.
Electrical, Electronic and Instrument
Engineering
Sales of basic electrical equipment totalled
over £4,000 million in 1991. Sales of
electronic data-processing equipment rose
substantially between 1986 and 1991,
reaching more than £7,800 million in 1991.
Computers
This sector produces an extensive range of
systems, central processors and peripheral
equipment, from large computers for large-
scale data-processing and scientific work to
mini- and microcomputers for control and
automation systems and for home,
educational and office use. The computer
sector has been adversely affected by
worldwide recession and falling prices.
Increased competition has resulted in
changed methods of distribution, such as mail
order outlets.
Total billings by companies for computer
services reached £3,800 million in 1991. The
largest components of these billings were for
software and related services, worth £1,460
million, and for bureau services, valued at
£810 million. Amstrad is Britain’s biggest
personal computer manufacturer, whose
products are aimed at the mass market. It has
almost a third of the domestic market in
portable personal computers. Export sales of
data-processing equipment amounted to over
£5,770 million in 1991.
Several leading overseas manufacturers of
data-processing equipment—for example,
IBM, Unisys, Compaq and Seiko—have
established manufacturing plants in Britain.
Britain’s largest computer manufacturer
(producing chiefly mainframe computers) is
the Japanese-owned ICE. Other companies,
245
BRITAIN 1993: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
such as DIP and Psion, have concentrated on
developing new products for specialised
markets. These include hand-held, pocket-
sized computers, increasingly used by
company sales forces, and notebook and pen
computers. British firms make
communications software for portable and
mainframe computers. The world’s first
modem (computer telephone link) for
portable computers has been designed in
Britain. Psion is a pioneer of the ‘palmtop’
computer, which has the equivalent power of
a desktop machine.
British firms and research organisations,
with government support, have been involved
in the development and application of the
new family of ‘three-five’ semiconductor
materials, such as gallium arsenide; these are
used in a number of microwave devices and
are leading to the production of much faster-
working computers. The Trax, a novel design
of supercomputer processor with a wide
range of applications, including high-
definition television and defence systems, was
originally developed at Brunei University,
near London.
Communications Equipment
Britain’s main communications products are
switching and transmission equipment,
telephones and terminals, with BT (formerly
British Telecom) the main customer for
communications network equipment.
Mercury Communications is licensed to
compete with BT in the provision of network
services, while the market for terminals and
telephones has been fully liberalised.
Innovative work is being stimulated by the
expansion of cable television and the growth
in value added network services. There was
rapid expansion in the market for cellular
telephones in the second half of the 1980s.
Transmission equipment and cables for
telecommunications and information networks
include submarine and high-specification
data-carrying cables. Supported by a
technically advanced cable industry, BT has
led in the development of optical fibre
communications systems and has paved the
way for simpler and cheaper optical cables by
laying the first non-repeatered cable over
100 km (62 miles) long, and by developing
the first all-optical repeater. More than half
of the world’s undersea communications
cables have been made and laid by STC
Submarine Systems, which, with its United
States and French partners, completed the
laying of the first transatlantic optical fibre
cable, TAT 8, in 1988. Britain also has a
world lead in the transmission of
computerised data along telephone lines for
reproduction on television screens. Export
sales of telegraph and telephone apparatus
and equipment by British firms were valued
at £470 million in 1991.
Another sector of the industry
manufactures radio communications
equipment, radar, radio and sonar
navigational aids for ships and aircraft,
thermal imaging systems, alarms and
signalling equipment, public broadcasting
equipment and other capital goods. Radar
was invented in Britain and British firms are
still in the forefront of technical advances.
Racal Avionics’ X-band radar can distinguish
different types of aircraft flying at very low
altitude and is in use at airports in several
countries. Cable and Wireless’s submarine

work at depths of up to 1 km (3,280 ft), is
controlled entirely by a computer on its
mother ship.
Other Electronic Equipment
A range of electronic measurement and test
equipment is made in Britain, as well as
analytical instruments, process control
equipment, and numerical control and
indication equipment for use in machine
tools. British companies specialise in several
types of advanced electronic medical
equipment, such as magnetic resonance
imaging (MRI), a technique for internal
examination of large body areas without
recourse to surgery or potentially harmful
radiation. Companies such as GEC and
Oxford Instruments also produce other
advanced electronic medical equipment, like
ultrasound scanners, electromyography
systems and patient monitoring systems for
intensive and coronary care and other uses.
The indigenous electronics components
industry is supplemented by subsidiaries of
several leading overseas companies. An area of
very rapid change in which Britain is
particularly strong is the manufacture of
advanced components, such as integrated
circuits.
Electrical Engineering and Appliances
Making extensive use of the most advanced
technologies, the electrical engineering
industry manufactures products for the
electricity supply sector, including power
plant, cable transformers and switchgear, and
lighting, plugs and sockets. The domestic
electrical appliance sector is dominated by a
few large firms. The major electronic
consumer goods produced are radio and
television sets, and high-fidelity audio and
video equipment. In the audio field British
manufacturers have a reputation for
high-quality goods but are less strong in the
mass market.
The instrument engineering industry
makes measuring, photographic,
cinematographic and reprographic equipment;
watches, clocks and other timing devices; and
medical and surgical instruments. Its
precision instrument and medical branches
both make significant and growing export
sales, but the sector as a whole is contracting.
Motor Vehicles and Other Transport
Equipment (excluding Aerospace)
The recent recession has hit the motor
vehicles industry particularly hard. A total of
1-8 million new cars and commercial vehicles
were sold in 1991, a 22 per cent fall compared
with 1990. Sales of new cars were 30 per cent
below the 1989 peak of 2 3 million. Car
output is dominated by five groups,
accounting for 99 per cent of the total:
Rover, Ford (including Jaguar), Vauxhall,
Peugeot-Talbot and Nissan. The remainder is
in the hands of smaller, specialist producers
such as Rolls-Royce, whose cars are
renowned for their quality and durability.
Despite falling domestic demand, some
605,000 passenger cars valued at over £3,800
million were exported in 1991. Nissan
increased production substantially in 1991,
and with inward investment projects by
Honda and Toyota beginning in 1992-93, car
production in Britain is set to rise
considerably. These projects are introducing
new management methods into the sector.
Ranked as one of the most important
industries in Britain, the motor components
industry consists of over 2,000 companies. A
period of major change has accompanied the
arrival of the three major Japanese
manufacturers and the established motor
vehicle manufacturers are restructuring as a
result.
Demand for pedal cycles at home and
abroad continues to rise significantly. Raleigh
is the leading bicycle manufacturer.
Shipbuilding and Marine Engineering
Britain has a long tradition of shipbuilding
and remains active in the construction,
conversion and repair of merchant vessels,
warships and offshore structures. The largest
sector is the building of warships. In addition
to meeting all the needs of the Royal Navy,
the warship yards build and convert ships for
overseas governments.
British yards build some of the most

sophisticated merchant vessels in the world,
including gas and chemical carriers and
offshore support and research vessels, as well
as more traditional ships and craft for the
leisure market. The Shipbuilders and Ship
Repairers’ Association estimates that orders
taken by British merchant shipbuilders for
the construction of vessels were worth around
£650 million in 1991. The shipbuilding
industry is supplemented by ship-repairers
which modernise and convert vessels, as well
as carrying out repairs and maintenance. The
British marine equipment industry is also a
major contributor to the shipbuilding sector,
as equipment installed in a ship’s hull
accounts for some 70 per cent of its cost. It
offers a complete range of products, from
engines to sophisticated navigational systems,
much of which is exported to shipbuilders
and ship-repairers overseas.
More than two decades of oil and gas
exploitation in the North Sea have generated
a major offshore industry (see p 279).
Shipbuilders and fabricators build
fixed platforms and semi-submersible
units for drilling, production and
emergency/maintenance support, drill ships,
jack-up rigs, modules and offshore loading
systems. Several thousand manufacturing and
service industry firms supply goods and
services, including consultancy, design,
project management, and research and
development to the offshore industry.
Aerospace
Britain’s aerospace industry is the second
largest in the Western world, after the
United States. With some 250 member
companies of the Society of British Aerospace
Companies (SBAC) employing more than
170,000 people, it had a turnover in 1991 of
around £10,500 million. Exports totalled
almost £8,000 million and contributed £2,500
million in net terms to the balance of
payments. The impact of recession and
reductions in defence orders have led to
further rationalisation and consolidation of
the aerospace industry. Spending on civil
products currently equals that on defence
products, with British parts makers increasing
their proportion of business with the
commercial sector to offset reductions in
defence orders.
The industry’s activities cover designing
and constructing airframes, aero-engines,
guided weapons and space satellites, together
with a full range of flight systems,
particularly avionics and complex
components, and associated services. To
improve fuel economy, engine and airframe
manufacturers are using lighter materials such
as titanium and carbon-fibre composites,
combined with improved aerodynamic
techniques.
Airframes
As the leading British exporter of
manufactured goods, British Aerospace (BAe)
produces both civil and military aircraft, as
well as satellites, space systems, guided
weapons and components. Civil aircraft
include the 146 family of regional quiet-jet
airliners, the 64-72-8631 ATP (advanced
turboprop) airliner, the 19-29-seat Jetstream
31 and 41 commuterliners, and the 125 (the
world’s best-selling middle-sized business jet).
Collaborative development of civil and
military aircraft is increasing to save on costs
248
MANUFACTURING AND CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY
of new production programmes. BAe has a 20
per cent share of the European consortium
Airbus Industrie, which had sold over 1,760
aircraft by the end of 1991. BAe designs and
supplies the wings for all Airbus airliners.
Three types are currently in production: the
A310 and A300 medium to long-range
airliners, and the short- to medium-haul
A320, the first civil airliner to be fitted with
‘fly-by-wire’ controls. Three further
aircraft—the A321, A330 and long-range,
four-engine A340—are currently under
development. Together with other
international aerospace organisations, BAe is
studying the feasibility of developing a
successor to the Concorde supersonic airliner.
Military production of BAe includes the
Harrier, a unique vertical/short take-off and
landing (V/STOL) military combat aircraft.
Sea Harriers are supplied to the Royal Navy
and, in association with McDonnell Douglas
in the United States, BAe has developed the
improved Harrier II. BAe also produces the
Hawk fast-jet trainer and, with McDonnell
Douglas, the Goshawk carrier jet trainer. BAe
has a 33 per cent share in the development of
the next-generation European Fighter
Aircraft (EFA)—a co-operative venture
between Britain, Italy and Spain. The
Tornado combat aircraft is built by a
company set up jointly by BAe and Italian
and German companies. BAe is a major
supplier of tactical guided weapon systems.
Short Brothers of Belfast is engaged in the
production of civil and military aircraft,
advanced nacelle (engine casings) systems and
components for domestic and overseas
aerospace manufacturers. It designs and
builds the wings for the Fokker 100 jetliner
and is a partner in manufacturing the 50-seat
Canadair regional Jet airliner, the first
turbofan airliner to be developed specifically
for regional operation. It also produces the
Sherpa light transport and the Tucano, a
turboprop basic military trainer which is in
use with the Royal Air Force. Shorts is a
major supplier of guided missile systems.
In addition to its production of aerospace
equipment, Westland manufactures the Sea
King and Lynx military helicopters. In
collaboration with Agusta of Italy, it is
developing the multi-role EH101 three-
engine helicopter, which will be delivered to
the Royal Navy and the Italian Navy by the
mid-1990s. The company is also a leading
manufacturer of composite helicopter blades.
Aero-engine Manufacture
Rolls-Royce is one of the three major
manufacturers of aero-engines in the Western
world, with a turnover in 1991 of some
£3,500 million and an order book at the end
of 1991 worth £6,600 million. The company’s
civil engine group produces engines for
airliners and executive and corporate jets.
Rolls-Royce RB211-535 engines have been
selected by 75 per cent of airlines using
Boeing 757 airliners. The RB211-524G and
H engines, which power Boeing 747-400
airliners, give improved thrust and fuel
efficiency. The company’s Tay turbofan
engines are in service on the Gulfstream IV
and Fokker 100 airliners, and are available as
replacement engines for older aircraft. The
latest RB211 development is the Trent, the
world’s most powerful turbofan, due to come
into service in 1995. Providing improved fuel
efficiency and lower maintenance costs, it will
power the Airbus A330 and Boeing 777.
Rolls-Royce is a partner in the five-nation
International Aero Engine consortium which
produces the low-pollution V2500 aero¬
engine, now in service on some versions of
the Airbus A320; it will also be fitted to the
McDonnell Douglas MD90 due to enter

service in 1995. The military engine group of
Rolls-Royce produces engines for both
aircraft and helicopters. The company also
produces gas turbines for power generation
and for oil and gas pumping, gas turbines for
25 of the world’s navies, and propulsion
systems for the Royal Navy’s nuclear-
powered submarines.
Aviation Equipment
British firms have made significant
technological advances in aviation equipment.
Manufacturers provide essential systems for
engines and aircraft, including navigation and
landing systems, engine and flight controls,
electrical generation, mechanical and
hydraulic power systems, cabin furnishings,
flight-deck control and information displays,
including head-up display (HUD), of which
GEC Avionics is the world’s largest
manufacturer. Numerous other companies
supply components, sub-assemblies and spare
parts. British firms have made important
advances in developing ejection seats,
firefighting equipment and flight simulators,
as well as fly-by-wire and fly-by-light
technology, where control surfaces are moved
by means of automatic electronic signalling
and fibre optics respectively, rather than by
mechanical means. Britain’s aerospace
companies provide radar and air traffic
control equipment and ground power
supplies to airports and airlines worldwide.
Hovercraft
Britain pioneered the development of
hovercraft and is a world leader in their
technology and production. Westland
Aerospace hovercraft range from large
commercial craft to smaller, 10-passenger
craft. Slingsby Aviation build amphibious
hovercraft for passenger transport, cargo,
ambulance and rescue, and surveying.
Satellite Equipment
Over 400 companies in Britain are involved
in space activities. The British industry’s
major strength is in the manufacture of
satellites. British Aerospace Space
Communications Systems is Europe’s
leading—and the world’s third largest—
producer of communications satellites. It was
the prime contractor for all such satellites
built for the European Space Agency (ESA),
including Giotto, the scientific satellite that
intercepted Halley’s Comet, and for the
Marecs and Inmarsat-2 series of maritime
communications satellites and the Skynet and
NATO IV military communications satellites.
BAe built 18 payload pallets for the United
States Space Shuttle and supplies SPELDA,
a structure that enables the ESA’s Ariane 4
launcher to carry two spacecraft on the same
mission. It was also involved in developing
and producing the Intelsat III, IV and V
series of satellites, and is a subcontractor for
the five Intelsat VI satellites launched from
the Space Shuttle. It supplied equipment to
the ESA Ulysses satellite mission to Jupiter
and the Sun.
Marconi Space Systems has acted as
principal contractor on many
telecommunications satellite payloads, making
instruments for the ESA’s European Remote
Sensing Satellites ERS-1 and ERS-2, and for
Olympus, the world’s largest 3-axis stabilised
communications satellite. The National
Remote Sensing Centre was set up by BAe to
process and supply commercial data derived
from Earth observation satellites. A
consortium led by BAe Space Systems is to
build a new Earth Observation Data Centre
to process data from ERS-1 and other
satellites. GEC Ferranti Defence Systems
produces the inertial guidance system for the
European Ariane launcher and Pilkington
Space Technology is the world’s leading
producer of solar cell coverglasses for
satellites.
Food, Drink and Tobacco
Britain has a sizeable food processing and
drinks manufacturing industry, which has
accounted for a growing proportion of total
domestic food supply in recent decades. The
industry’s interests are represented by the
Food and Drink Federation (FDF).
Convenience foods (particularly ready-cooked
meals and frozen foods, annual sales of which
now stand at approximately £3,850 million),
250
MANUFACTURING AND CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY
yoghurts, other dairy desserts and instant
snacks have formed the fastest-growing sector
of the food market in recent years. The
market in health and slimming foods also
continues to expand.
Production of milk was 14,075 million
litres in 1991, of which 6,900 million litres
was sold as liquid milk. Nearly 60 per cent of
households in Britain receive milk through a
doorstep delivery system employing about
32,000 people. Domestic milk consumption
per head—109 litres (1-91 pints) per week in
1991—is among the highest in the world.
Consumption of skimmed and semi-skimmed
milk continues to rise as people seek to
reduce the fat content in their diet.
The main milk products are butter
(111,710 tonnes produced in 1991), cheese
(301,760 tonnes), condensed milk (197,620
tonnes) and dried whole and skimmed milk
(205,925 tonnes). The British dairy industry
accounted for 63 per cent of new butter
supplies to the domestic market in 1991 and
68 per cent of new cheese supplies. Butter
exports in 1991 came to 39,640 tonnes and
cheese exports 50,700 tonnes. The other main
exports are skimmed milk powder and whole
milk powder (70,860 and 65,270 tonnes
respectively).
About 80 per cent of bread is
manufactured in large mechanised bakeries
using the British ‘Chorleywood’ process.
Overall consumption of bread has been in
long-term decline, although there is an
increasing demand for wholemeal varieties.
Around 40 per cent of sales consist of ‘own
label’ supermarket brands. Biscuit exports
were valued at £180 million in 1991.
Of major significance among the alcoholic
drinks produced in Britain is Scotch whisky,
which is one of Britain’s top five export
earners. There are 114 distilleries in
Scotland, where the best known brands of
blended Scotch whisky are made from the
products of single malt and single grain
whisky distilleries. Some 85 per cent of
Scotch whisky produced is exported, to 190
countries. The value of whisky exports was
over £1,830 million in 1991, Europe taking
32 per cent and the United States about 15
per cent by volume.
In 1991 purchases of beer in Britain
were valued at £11,600 million, about
3 per cent of total consumers’
expenditure.
The brewing industry has five major
brewery groups whose products are sold
nationally, and 160 local brewers. British
malt, which is made almost entirely from
home-grown barley, is used by brewers
throughout the world. Demand for traditional
cask-conditioned ales, which had been falling,
has now stabilised, while lager now accounts
for just over half of all beer sales.
Several companies produce up to 20
brands of soft drinks, which are marketed on
a national scale. Purchases of soft drink
products reached £2,324 million in 1991, a
rise of 54 per cent compared with 1986.
The British tobacco industry manufactures
99 per cent of cigarettes and tobacco goods
sold in Britain. Almost all domestic output is
provided by three major manufacturers
(Imperial Tobacco, Gallaher and Carreras

Rothmans). The industry specialises in the
production of high-quality cigarettes made
from flue-cured tobacco and achieves
significant exports. Europe, the Middle East
and Africa are important markets.
Textiles and Clothing
These products make a substantial
contribution to the British economy in terms
of employment, exports and turnover.
Together with the footwear and leather
industries, they employ around 440,000
people, equal to nearly 10 per cent of
manufacturing employment. For textiles,
there is a high degree of regional
concentration. Particularly important areas are
the North West, West Yorkshire (mainly
wool), the East Midlands (knitwear), Scotland
and Northern Ireland. Most of the clothing
industry is widely scattered throughout the
country and does not represent a large
proportion of employment in any region,
although there are significant concentrations
in cities such as Manchester, Leicester, Leeds
and London. The industries’ main products
are yarn, woven and knitted fabrics, apparel,
industrial and household textiles, and carpets
based mainly on wool, cotton and synthetic
fibres.
The textile and clothing industry has
around 15,000 firms, comprising a few large
multi-process companies and two of the
world’s largest firms—Coats Viyella and
Courtaulds Textiles—as well as a large
number of small and medium-sized firms.
Increased investment in new machinery and
greater attention to design, training and
marketing have helped the industry to raise
competitiveness. Textile and clothing exports
in 1991 amounted to £4,700 million, a 2 per
cent increase compared with 1990. The
Multi-Fibre Arrangement (MFA) of the
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade
(GATT) allows a measure of restraint on
imports of textiles and clothing from low-cost
countries into the European Community.
Britain’s wool textile industry is one of the
largest in the world, with two main branches
making woollen and worsted. In the past few
years the industry’s export earnings have
been significant, wool export values totalling
£500 million in 1991. Synthetic fibre is
sometimes blended with wool. West
Yorkshire is the main producing area, but
Scotland is also famous as a specialised
producer of high-quality yarn and cloth.
Substantial quantities of raw wool are scoured
and cleaned in Britain in preparation for
spinning. British mills also process the bulk
of rare fibres such as cashmere. Sales of the
woollen and worsted industry amounted to
over £1,400 million in 1990.
Low-cost competition has cut
progressively into British markets for cotton
and allied products. Output in 1990 totalled
about £1,200 million. Production includes
yarn and fabrics of cotton, spun synthetic
fibres and cotton-synthetic mixes, with large-
scale dyeing and printing of cotton and
synthetic fibre fabric. The linen industry is
centred in Northern Ireland.

MANUFACTURING AND CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY
Over half the value of carpet and rug
output is made up of tufted carpets. Woven
carpets, mainly Axminster, account for most
of the remaining sales. There is a higher wool
content in woven types, although in these,
too, considerable use is being made of
synthetic fibres. The high quality and variety
of design make Britain one of the world’s
leading producers of woven carpets.
Industrial textiles account for an increasing
proportion of the industry’s output, covering
products such as conveyor belting and
geotextiles used in civil engineering projects.
Many of these are non-woven, made of fibres
assembled using advanced techniques.
Synthetic polypropylene yarn is used in the
manufacture of carpet backing and ropes, and
woven into fabrics for a wide range of
applications in the packaging, upholstery,
building and motor vehicle industries.
The clothing industry is labour intensive,
involving about 8,000 companies. While a
broad range of clothing is imported from the
rest of Europe and Asia, British industry
supplies almost three-fifths of domestic
demand. Exports have risen since the British
fashion designer industry became prominent
during the 1980s and traditional British
tailoring enables clothing companies such as
Burberry’s to compete overseas. The hosiery
and knitwear industry comprises about 1,600
companies, mainly in the East Midlands and
Scotland.
The footwear manufacturing industry is
made up predominantly of small companies,
increasingly under pressure from imports.
Other Manufacturing
Nearly 7,000 companies in the wooden and
upholstered furniture industry supply
domestic, contract and institutional markets.
Domestic production of wood for industrial
use has been steadily increasing and deliveries
in 1991 amounted to 5 3 million cubic
metres.
There were 106 paper and board mills
employing 30,500 people in 1991. Among the
largest British groups are Argo Wiggins
Appleton, St Regis and BPB Paper and
Packaging. Over the past decade, inward
investment has transformed the paper and
board industry. Production has been
concentrated in large-scale units to compete
more effectively within the single European
market. Between 1982 and 1990, output
increased by 50 per cent. Over half the
industry is made up of forestry product
companies from Scandinavia, North
America, Australasia and elsewhere. There
has been a significant trend towards waste-
based packaging grades in order to reduce
the industry’s reliance on imported
woodpulp supplies. Usage of recycled waste
paper is increasing and research is helping
to extend it. In 1990 the total amount of
waste paper used in British newspapers
accounted for nearly 27 per cent of the total
newsprint consumed. Waste paper provides
over half of the industry’s fibre needs.
Domestically produced wood pulp represents
only a small percentage of raw material
supplies.
Mergers have led to the formation of large
groups in newspaper, magazine and book
publishing. Printing, engraving, bookbinding
and specialist publishing activities still involve
many small firms, now often using new
technology such as desktop publishing. The
book-publishing industry is a major exporter,

selling one-third of production in overseas
markets. Security printers (of, for example,
banknotes and postage stamps) are important
exporters, the major company being De La
Rue. Total employment in the paper,
printing and publishing industries in June
1992 was 468,000. Most of the printing and
publishing industry’s employment and output
is concentrated in firms based in south-east
England.
Rubber tyres and inner tubes sold by
British manufacturers in 1991 were valued at
£1,016 million, about £550 million of which
went overseas. Other important rubber goods
are vehicle components and accessories,
conveyor belting, cables, hoses, latex foam
products, and footwear, gloves and clothing.
Tyre manufacturers include subsidiaries of
United States and other overseas companies.
The industry’s consumption of rubber
comprises natural, synthetic and recycled
rubber.
Toys, games and sports equipment are
established in export markets, while jewellery,
gold and silverware and the refining of
precious metals are industries maintaining a
strong craft tradition.
Construction
Structure
Construction work is carried out by private
contractors and by public authorities
employing their own labour. Over L5 million
people work in the construction industry,
which accounts for around 7 per cent of
national output. Most work is done by
private firms, 98 per cent of which employ
fewer than 25 people. Some of the larger
firms own quarries and workshops,
mechanised plant and standard builders’
equipment and undertake responsibility for
all stages of projects from initial design to
finished building. Efficiency and productivity
in construction have benefited from
computerised techniques such as electronic
load safety measures for cranes, distance
measuring equipment, computerised stock
ordering and job costing, and computer-aided
design.
The Government provides substantial
work for the construction industry. Much of
this is currently channelled through the
organisations which succeeded the Property
Services Agency (PSA), Property Holdings
and PSA Services. Departments are,
however, no longer required to use these
organisations, and the Government has
started to privatise them. Accordingly,
departments will be able to obtain all
property management, maintenance, design
and construction services by competitive
tender.
A vast range of products is used in the
construction process, from glass and bricks to
tiles and bathroom fittings. These materials
make up around 40 per cent of the value of
construction output. In 1991 sales of
construction materials exceeded £20,000
million, with exports amounting to £2,200
million.
Project Management and Financing
All but the smallest projects are generally
carried out under the direction of
construction managers and management
contractors. Architects tend to take charge
of smaller projects. The more complex
civil engineering projects are overseen
by consulting engineers. The latter may
advise on the feasibility of projects, draw
up plans and supervise the construction
work.
Private and public sector projects are
managed in a variety of ways. Clients usually
invite construction firms to bid for work by
competitive tender, having used the design
services of a consultant. The successful
contractor will then manage on-site work
with a number of specialist sub-contractors.
Contracts are likely to include provision of
building maintenance and ‘design-and-build’,
where a single company oversees every stage
of a project.
The financing of major projects has
changed in recent years, from clients raising
finance to pay for schemes to construction
companies offering them a complete package,
including finance. As a result building firms
are developing closer links with banks and
other financial institutions.
254
MANUFACTURING AND CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY
The monitoring of project costs is
undertaken by quantity surveyors. The
inspection and maintenance of buildings are
carried out by building surveyors. In addition,
town planning and municipal surveyors deal
with local planning issues. Independent
estates and valuation surveyors manage
privately-owned property.
Building Regulations
The Department of the Environment’s
building regulations prescribe minimum
standards of construction in England and
Wales. Administered and enforced by local
government, the regulations apply to new
building, the installation or replacement of
fittings, and alterations and extensions to
existing buildings. New regulations came into
force in June 1992. There are similar controls
in Scotland and Northern Ireland. An
alternative to local authority building control
was introduced in 1984; under this there is a
system of private certification of compliance
with building regulations. The British
Standards Institution is making Britain’s
contribution to the drafting of European
standards, which are increasingly replacing
national construction standards.
Housing
During 1991 a total of around 162,000
dwellings were started in Great Britain,
slightly fewer than in 1990. Starts in the
public sector were 4,000 and those by private
enterprise and housing associations, 157,000.
Some 177,000 dwellings were completed:
10,000 by the public sector and 167,000 by
the private sector.
Major Construction Projects
Among important construction projects in
hand or recently completed are the Channel
Tunnel, the largest single civil engineering
project ever undertaken in Europe (see
p 326); the M25 motorway widening scheme;
the Dartford Bridge; the A55 Conwy Tunnel;
the Broadgate development at Liverpool
Street station in London; the extensive
development in London’s Docklands
(including the Limehouse link road); the new
British Library; Glasgow Concert Hall;
Birmingham’s Symphony Hall; and the
British Pavilion at Expo ’92 in Seville, Spain.
The pavilion, comparable in size to
Westminster Abbey, is a vast steel and glass
structure, which is sponsored by many major
British companies.
Consultancy
In 1991 members of the Association of
Consulting Engineers were involved in new
work overseas valued at £13,600 million. The
capital value of projects underway at the end
of 1991 or completed during the year was
almost £42,000 million. The three largest
categories of work covered railways; roads,
bridges and tunnels; and water supply. The
largest markets were the Middle East, the Far
East and Africa, with a growing market in
Eastern Europe. Projects include:
• the Channel Tunnel (£5,500 million);
and
• the Hong Kong International Airport
(£2,400 million).
British consulting engineers had estimated
gross earnings in 1991 of £450 million from
overseas commissions.
Contracting
British contractors are currently undertaking,
or have recently completed, work in 112
overseas countries or territories, and have a
permanent presence in 74 of them. They
carried out a fifth of all international work
done by European construction companies in
1990, and won new orders worth some
£2,500 million. In North America they
secured more new business than any other
European country, while in Asia, British
contractors obtained more new contracting
business than any other European country
except France.
Important international contracts won by
British contractors in 1991-92 include:
• management contracts for the
EuroDisney Theme Park, near Paris
(£1,000 million) and the 1996 Olympics
in Atlanta, United States (£250 million);
255
BRITAIN 1993: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Tsing Ma Bridge in Hong Kong
(£583 million);
a hydro-electric project in Malaysia
(£400 million);
an aluminium smelter in Iran
(£350 million);
hospitals in Malaysia (£309 million);
a highlands water project in Lesotho
(£239 million);
a gas conversion project in Ankara,
Turkey (£100 million);
restoration of an oilfield in Kuwait
(£60 million); and
a technology plant in Czechoslovakia
(£50 million).
Research and Advisory Services
The Government’s research and advisory
body on construction is the Building
Research Establishment. It has four
laboratories, including a fire research station,
and is the site of a building energy
management systems centre. Major
construction and materials firms, universities,
colleges of technology and research
associations, as well as the British Board of
Agrement, carry out research and provide
advisory services.
The Building Centre provides exhibition
and information services on materials,
products, techniques and building services.
256
14 Finance and Other
Service Industries
The service industries, which include finance,
retailing, tourism and business services,
contribute about 65 per cent of gross
domestic product and 71 per cent of
employment. Overseas earnings from services
amounted to 37 per cent of the value of
exports of manufactures in 1991. The number
of employees in services in Great Britain rose
from just over 13 million in 1982 to 15-2
million by the end of 1991. Much of this was
accounted for by growth in part-time
(principally female) employment.
Employment grew more rapidly in the private
sector than in the public sector, partly
reflecting the Government’s policies of
privatisation and of restricting employment in
public sector services.
Average real disposable income per head
increased by nearly three-quarters between
1971 and 1990 and this was reflected in a
growth in consumer spending on financial,
personal and leisure services and on the
maintenance and repair of consumer durables.
Britain is a major financial centre, housing
some of the world’s leading banking,
insurance, securities, shipping, commodities,
futures, and other financial services and
markets. Demand for British travel, hotel and
catering services rose as real incomes in
Britain and other countries increased. The
spread of home ownership, particularly
during the 1980s, increased demand for legal
and estate agency services. Business services
include advertising, market research,
management consultancy, exhibition and
conference facilities, computing services and
auction houses.
A notable trend is the growth in
franchising, an operation in which a company
owning the rights to a particular form of
trading licenses them to franchisees, usually
by means of an initial payment with
continuing royalties. The main areas include
cleaning services, film processing, print
shops, hairdressing and cosmetics, fitness
centres, courier delivery, car rental, engine
tuning and servicing, and fast food retailing.
It is estimated that franchising’s share of total
retail sales is over 3 per cent, a figure which
is likely to increase.
Technology plays a significant part in the
development of services—the computing
services industry is one of the fastest-growing
sectors of the economy and information
technology is widely used in retailing and
financial services.
FINANCIAL SERVICES
Historically the financial services industry in
Britain has been located in the famous
‘Square Mile’ in the City of London. This
remains broadly the case, even though the
markets for financial and related services
have grown and diversified greatly. ‘The
City’ refers to a collection of markets and
institutions in and around the Square Mile.
This area is noted for having:
• the greatest concentration of banks in the
world—responsible for about a fifth of
total international bank lending;
• the world’s biggest insurance industry—
with about one-fifth of the international
market;
• one of the world’s largest stock
exchanges;
• the role of principal international centre
for transactions in a large number of
commodities; and
257
BRITAIN 1993: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
• a full range of ancillary and support
services—legal, accountancy and
management consultancy—which
contribute to London’s strength as a
financial centre.
Banking, finance, insurance, business
services and leasing accounted for 18
per cent of Britain’s total output in
1991, a share which has risen sharply
over the past decade.
Banking, finance and insurance accounted
for 12 per cent of all employment at the end
of 1991. The net identified overseas receipts
of British financial institutions in 1991 were
£16,900 million.
Development of Financial Services
The growth in international movements of
capital in the 1960s and 1970s mainly took
the form of increased bank lending and
foreign exchange trading. London became the
international centre of this activity,
particularly in the eurocurrency markets (see
p 268), and the number of overseas banks
represented in London is larger than in any
other financial centre. During the 1980s, with
increasing international competition in
financial services and developments in
technology, London’s securities markets grew
rapidly. Edinburgh also developed as a centre
for fund management.
Some traditional distinctions between
financial institutions have been eroded, so
that single firms supply a broader range of
services, both in domestic and international
markets. Landmarks in the deregulation of
Britain’s financial services in recent years
include:
• the abolition of exchange controls in
1979;
• the ending in 1980 of the supplementary
special deposits scheme, which was
designed to curb bank lending;
• the abolition in 1981 of the Reserve Asset
Ratio requirement, under which banks
had to hold 12 5 per cent of their
deposits as liquid assets;
• the abolition of hire purchase restrictions
in 1982;
• the Building Societies Act 1986 (see
p 262); and
• ‘Big Bang’, also in 1986 (see p 267).
Supervision
Britain’s banks and financial institutions are
regulated principally under the Financial
Services Act 1986, the Building Societies Act
1986 (see p 262) and the Banking Act 1987
(see p 259). Responsibility for this legislation
lies with the Treasury and regulation is by
the Bank of England, the Building Societies
Commission and the Securities and
Investments Board (SIB). The SIB is
empowered to recognise practitioner-based
self-regulating organisations (SROs).
The main provisions of the Financial
Services Act came into force in 1988. Under
the Act, investment businesses (those dealing
in, arranging, managing or giving advice on
investments or operating collective
investment schemes) require authorisation
and are subject to rules on the conduct of
business and other rules made under the
legislation. Most investment businesses have
achieved authorisation by obtaining
membership of an SRO. The SROs are:
• the Financial Intermediaries, Managers
and Brokers Regulatory Association
(FIMBRA), which covers firms such as
financial advisers and insurance brokers;
• the Investment Management Regulatory
Organisation (IMRO), whose members
include merchant banks and pension fund
managers with mainly corporate clients;
• the Life Assurance and Unit Trust
Regulatory Organisation (LAUTRO); and
• the Securities and Futures Authority
(SFA), whose members include member
firms of the London Stock Exchange, as
well as futures brokers and dealers.
Government responsibility for
investigations lies with the Department of
Trade and Industry and the Serious Fraud
Office. There are strengthened government
powers to investigate insider dealing—dealing
carried out on the basis of privileged access
to relevant information. An agreement
258
FINANCE AND OTHER SERVICE INDUSTRIES
between Britain and the United States to
counteract international financial fraud was
announced in 1991. It features greater powers
of enforcement than previous agreements.
Agreements about exchange of information
are also in place with Japan and Switzerland.
In July 1992 the Basle Committee on Banking
Supervision, on which Britain’s banking
supervisory authorities are represented, issued
minimum standards which its members
agreed to apply in the supervision of
international banking groups and their cross-
border establishments. The Government’s
inquiry into the Bank of Credit and
Commerce International (BCCI) is
continuing.
Bank of England
The Bank of England was established in 1694
by Act of Parliament and Royal Charter as a
corporate body. Its entire capital stock was
acquired by the Government in 1946. The
Bank acts as banker to the Government,
holding its main accounts, managing Britain’s
reserves of gold and foreign exchange,
arranging new government borrowing and
managing the stock of its existing debt. The
Bank’s main objectives are to:
• maintain the value of the nation’s money,
mainly through policies and market
operations agreed with government;
• ensure the soundness of the financial
system through the direct supervision of
banks and specialised City institutions;
and
• promote the efficiency and
competitiveness of the financial system.
The Financial Services Act makes the
Bank responsible for the supervision of the
wholesale money markets in London in
sterling, foreign exchange and bullion. The
markets are wholesale in the sense that the
participants are professional operators dealing
in substantial amounts of money.
Under the Banking Act 1987, deposit¬
taking organisations require authorisation
from the Bank of England, unless they are
specifically exempted, and are subject to the
Bank’s supervision. The Act created a Board
of Banking Supervision and gives the Bank
powers to modify the conduct of banking
institutions, to investigate cases of illegal
deposit-taking, block bank mergers and
takeovers on prudential grounds and require
information from banks. The Act also enables
information to be shared, in strictly
controlled ways, among supervisors in
different financial services, and permits
auditors to make reports to the Bank of
England about a bank if the circumstances
justify it.
As agent for the Government, the Bank is
responsible for managing the National Debt,
which involves arranging government
borrowing and repayment of debt. It also
maintains the register of holdings of
government securities on behalf of the
Treasury and manages the Exchange
Equalisation Account (EEA), which holds
Britain’s official reserves of gold, foreign
exchange, Special Drawing Rights (SDRs,
which are claims on the International
Monetary Fund) and European Currency
Units (ECUs). The Bank may intervene in
the foreign exchange markets on the
Government’s behalf, using the resources of
the EEA, to check undue fluctuations in the
exchange value of sterling.
The Bank is able to influence money-
market conditions through its dealings with
the discount houses (see p 263), which
developed in the nineteenth century as bill
brokers for industrialists. The discount
houses hold mainly Treasury, local authority
and commercial bills, and negotiable
certificates of deposit financed by short-term
loans from the banks. If on a particular day
there is a shortage of cash in the banking
system as a result, for example, of large tax
payments, the Bank relieves the shortage
either by buying bills from the discount
houses or by lending directly to them. This
permits banks to replenish their cash balances
at the Bank by recalling some of their short¬
term loans to the discount houses. The
Bank’s dealings with the discount houses give
it powerful influence over short-term interest
rates.
The Bank of England has the sole right in
England and Wales to issue banknotes. The
note issue is no longer backed by gold but by
government and other securities. Three
259
BRITAIN 1993: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Scottish and four Northern Ireland banks also
issue notes. These issues, apart from a small
amount specified by legislation for each bank,
must be fully covered by holdings of Bank of
England notes and coinage. Responsibility for
the provision of coin lies with the Royal
Mint, a government trading fund which
became an executive agency in 1990.
Banks and Building Societies
In addition to banks, the chief institutions
offering banking services are the building
societies and the National Savings Bank.
Banks and building societies are broadly
covered by the definition of ‘credit
institutions’ used in EC banking legislation.
The First Banking Directive, adopted in
1977, established the principle that variations
in supervisory practices between member
states should be eliminated. The Second
Banking Directive, to come into operation at
the beginning of 1993, will complete the
single European market in banking by
establishing mutual recognition of home
country authorisation for credit institutions.
A useful distinction can be made between
‘retail’ and ‘wholesale’ banking. Retail
banking is primarily for personal customers
and small businesses. Its main services are
cash deposit and withdrawal facilities, and
money transmission systems. Competition
between the banks and the building societies
in providing money transmission services to
individuals has increased during the last two
decades and is expected to intensify further
(see p 262). Building societies can now also
offer money transmission services to
companies.
Wholesale business involves taking large
deposits at higher rates of interest, deploying
funds in money-market instruments (see
p 267) and making large loans and
investments. Nearly all banks in Britain
engage in some wholesale activities and some,
such as the merchant and overseas banks,
centre their business on them. Many such
wholesale dealings are conducted on the
inter-bank market, that is, between banks
themselves.
In February 1992 there were 518
institutions authorised under the Banking Act
1987, including retail banks, merchant banks,
branches of overseas banks, discount houses
and banking subsidiaries of both banking and
non-banking institutions from Britain and
overseas. Of these, around 320 were members
of the British Bankers’ Association, the main
representative body for British banks.
Retail Banks
The major retail banks have a significant
branch network, offering a full range of
financial services to both individuals and
companies. Among services generally available
are interest-bearing current accounts; deposit
accounts; and various kinds of loan
arrangements, together with a full range of
money transmission facilities increasingly
featuring plastic card technology.
The major banks in England and Wales
are Barclays, Lloyds, Midland, National
Westminster, the TSB Group and Abbey
National; and in Scotland the Bank of
Scotland and Royal Bank of Scotland. Other
important retail banks are the Clydesdale
Bank, the Co-operative Bank, the Yorkshire
Bank and Girobank. Girobank, previously a
subsidiary of the Post Office, was privatised
in 1990 and became a subsidiary of the
Alliance and Leicester Building Society.
Northern Ireland is served by branch
networks of four major banking groups.
With the growth of financial services and a
relaxation of restrictions on competition
among financial institutions, the major banks
have diversified their services. They are
lending more money for house purchases, and
most now own finance houses, leasing and
factoring companies, merchant banking,
securities dealers, insurance companies, unit
trust companies and estate agencies.
The banks offer loan facilities to
companies; since the 1970s, they have
provided more medium- and long-term loans
than they did formerly. They have also
become important suppliers of finance for
small firms. A loan guarantee scheme is
supported by the banks, under which 70 per
cent of the value of loans to small companies
is guaranteed by the Government. Some
banks have set up special subsidiaries to
provide venture capital for companies
260
FINANCE AND OTHER SERVICE INDUSTRIES
(see p 266). Most retail banks maintain
overseas subsidiaries which may account for a
substantial proportion of their business, and
are active in eurocurrency markets (see
p 268).
The total liabilities/assets of the retail
banks amounted to almost £440,000 million
in 1992. Of the liabilities, 70 per cent was
sterling deposits, 16 per cent other currency
deposits, and the remainder items in suspense
or transmission, and capital and other funds.
Of the £306,500 million of sterling deposits,
sight deposits withdrawable on demand
constituted 47 per cent and time deposits
requiring notice of withdrawal 45 per cent.
Certificates of deposit and other short-term
instruments accounted for the other 8 per
cent. The banks’ main liquid assets consist of
money at call (mainly short-term loans to
discount houses), their holdings of Treasury
and other bills, short-dated British
government securities and balances at the
Bank of England. They also hold a proportion
of their assets as portfolio investments
(mainly longer-dated British government
securities) or trade investments.
At the beginning of 1992 the retail banks
operated through some 13,000 branches and
sub-branches in Britain. National
Westminster had the largest number (2,683),
followed by Barclays (2,496), Lloyds (1,929),
Midland (1,824), TSB (1,399), the Royal
Bank of Scotland (805), Abbey National
(683), Bank of Scotland (502), Clydesdale
Bank (346), Yorkshire Bank (261) and the
Co-operative Bank (107). Around three-
quarters of adults in Britain have a current
account and over one-third a deposit account.
Payment Systems
The main payment systems are run by three
separate companies operating under an
umbrella organisation, the Association for
Payment Clearing Services (APACS). One
covers bulk paper clearings—cheques and
credit transfers. A second deals with high-
value clearings for same-day settlement,
namely the nationwide electronic transfer
service Clearing House Automated Payment
System (CHAPS) and the cheque-based
Town Clearing (which operates only in the
City of London). A third covers the bulk
electronic clearing which handles standing
orders and direct debits. Membership of each
of these clearing companies is open to any
bank, building society or other financial
institution meeting the criteria for
appropriate supervision and volume of
transactions.
Plastic Card Technology
All the major retail banks and building
societies have substantial networks of
automated teller machines or cash dispensers;
in all, almost 18,000 machines were in
operation at the beginning of 1992.
Automated teller machines give customers
access to cash and other services for up to 24
hours a day. Many banks and building
societies offer home banking services whereby
customers can use telephone or screen-based
access devices to obtain account information,
make transfers and pay bills.
The banks and major building societies
also offer their customers cheque guarantee
cards which entitle holders to reciprocal
cheque-cashing facilities up to, in most cases,
£50 a day, although some cards have higher
limits. The cards also guarantee transactions
with retailers up to the same amount.
Uniform eurocheques supported by a
eurocheque card are available from all major
banks. These standard-format cheques may
be used to obtain cash or make payments in
Britain, elsewhere in Europe and in a few
other overseas countries. The cheques are
made out in the currency of the country in
which they are being used, with a guarantee
limit of approximately £100 per cheque.
Credit cards issued by major retail banks
and building societies are a popular means of
payment and are widely accepted throughout
Britain. Most cards are affiliated to one of the
two major international credit card
organisations, Visa and MasterCard. Annual
fees on credit cards were introduced in 1990
and the number of cards declined between
1990 and 1991.
Some of the major retail stores issue their
own cards, which operate like credit cards. A
charge card, like a credit card, enables the
holder to make retail payments, but there is
261
BRITAIN 1993: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
either no credit limit or a very high limit,
and the balance must be settled in full on
receipt of a monthly statement.
As well as the traditional paper-based
systems for making retail payments by credit
or charge cards, many stores and garages now
provide EFTPOS (electronic funds transfer at
point of sale—see p 272) facilities. Using debit
cards, payments can be deducted directly from
the purchaser’s bank account. Most cards are
affiliated either to Visa or to the Switch
organisation, which is based in Britain.
Building Societies
Building societies are mutual institutions,
owned by their savers and borrowers. They
raise short-term deposits from savers, who
are generally able to withdraw their money
on demand or at short notice. The societies
make long-term loans, mostly at variable rates
of interest, against the security of property—
usually private dwellings purchased for
owner-occupation.
Building societies are the major lenders for
house purchase in Britain and are the
principal repository for the personal sector’s
liquid assets, although banks’ shares have
increased in both areas since 1985. Some 60
per cent of adults have building society
savings accounts. Competition between the
building societies and between building
societies and other financial institutions has
increased in the last decade. A variety of
savings schemes have been established, and a
growing number of societies provide current
account facilities such as cheque books and
automated teller machines. In 1992 there
were some 3,200 building society automated
teller machines, about one-sixth of the total.
Two building societies issue credit cards.
In 1992 there were 108 registered
societies, of which 90 were members of the
Building Societies’ Association. Building
societies’ assets totalled £248,000 million in
1992; about £43,000 million was advanced in
new mortgages in the course of 1991. The
three largest—the Halifax, Nationwide and
Woolwich—account for 47 per cent of the
total assets of all building societies and the 20
largest for some 95 per cent. Societies may
operate throughout the EC.
The Building Societies Act 1986 allows
societies to provide a wider range of services
than was possible previously. Up to 17 5 per
cent of a society’s commercial assets may be
used for purposes other than loans on first
mortgage of owner-occupied houses,
including as much as 7-5 per cent in other
types of asset such as unsecured loans. These
limits will increase to 25 per cent and 15 per
cent respectively in 1993. Directly or through
subsidiaries, societies may offer services
within the general areas of banking,
investment, insurance, trusteeship,
executorship and estate agency. However,
their main business will continue to be
financial and housing-related services.
The 1986 Act established the Building
Societies Commission to carry out the
prudential supervision of building societies. It
also made provision for a society to seek the
approval of its members to convert into a
public limited company. In this event the
society becomes an authorised institution
under the Banking Act 1987 (see p 259) and
is then supervised by the Bank of England.
Abbey National pursued this course and no
longer contributes to building society
statistics.
The Council of Mortgage Lenders is a
trade body established in 1989 for all
mortgage lending institutions, including
building societies, insurance companies,
finance houses and banks.
Merchant Banks
Merchant banks have traditionally been
concerned primarily with accepting, or
guaranteeing, commercial bills and with
sponsoring capital issues on behalf of their
customers. Today they undertake a
diversified and complex range of activities.
They have important roles in equity and debt
markets; the provision of expert advice and
financial services to industrial companies,
especially where mergers, takeovers and other
forms of corporate reorganisation are
involved; and in the management of
investment holdings, including trusts,
pensions and other funds. The sector is split
between independent houses and those which
are part of larger banking groups.

FINANCE AND OTHER SERVICE INDUSTRIES
Overseas Banks
A total of 255 banks incorporated overseas
were represented in Britain in 1992. Of these,
26 were from the United States and 27 from
Japan. Some 78 institutions incorporated in
Britain were subsidiaries of overseas
companies. They offer a comprehensive
banking service in many parts of the world
and engage in the financing of trade not only
between Britain and other countries but also
between third-party countries.
British-based Overseas Banks
A small number of banks have their head
offices in Britain, but operate mainly abroad,
often specialising in particular regions.
Standard Chartered, which is represented in
Asia, Africa and the Middle East, is the major
example of this type of bank.
Discount Houses
The nine discount houses are specialised
institutions unique in their function and
central position in the British monetary
system. They act as financial intermediaries
between the Bank of England and the rest of
the banking sector, promoting an orderly flow
of short-term funds. They guarantee to
tender for the whole of the weekly offer of
the Government’s Treasury bills, which are
instruments to raise funds over a period of up
to six months. In return for acting as inter¬
mediaries, the discount houses have secured
borrowing facilities at the Bank of England,
acting as ‘lender of last resort’. Assets of the
discount houses consist mainly of Treasury
and commercial bills, negotiable certificates of
deposit and short-term loans. Their liabilities
are for the most part short-term deposits.
National Savings Bank
The National Savings Bank is run by the
Department for National Savings, a
government department. It contributes to
government borrowing and aims to encourage
saving by offering personal savers a range of
investments, designed to meet various
requirements. Important products include:
• Savings Certificates, which either pay a
fixed rate of interest alone or a lower
fixed rate of interest combined with
index-linking;
• Premium Bonds, where interest is paid in
the form of prizes chosen by lottery;
• Income and Capital Bonds;
• Children’s Bonus Bonds, which are
designed to accumulate capital sums for
those under 21;
• Ordinary and Investment Accounts,
where deposits and withdrawals can be
made at some 20,000 post offices
throughout Britain; and
• FIRST Option Bonds, launched in 1992,
which are ‘tax-paid’ and offer a
guaranteed rate of interest that is fixed
for one year.
With the exception of FIRST Option
Bonds, interest on National Savings products
is paid without deduction of tax at source.
Certain National Savings products offer tax
exempt returns. In some cases the best
returns are paid to those who leave their
savings untouched for several years. In May
1992 the total amount of money invested in
National Savings was over £40,000 million.
Insurance
The British insurance industry provides a
service that falls broadly into two parts: long¬
term life insurance, where contracts may be
for periods of many years; and general
insurance, including accident and short-term
life insurance, where contracts are for a year
or less. The London market is the world’s
leading centre for insurance and for the place¬
ment of international reinsurance. It handles
an estimated 20 per cent of general insurance
business placed on the international market.
In addition to the British companies and
Lloyd’s (see p 264), a large number of
overseas companies are represented, with
which many British companies have formed
close relationships. Some British companies
confine their activities to domestic business
but most large companies undertaking general
business transact a substantial amount
overseas through branches and agencies or
affiliated local companies.
263
BRITAIN 1993: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Insurance companies carrying on business
in Britain are supervised by the Department
of Trade and Industry under the Insurance
Companies Act 1982. Marketing of life
insurance is regulated by the Securities and
Investments Board (see p 258).
European Community directives
introducing the ‘single-licence’ system
in insurance are due to be in force by
July 1994. Life and non-life insurers
will be able to operate throughout the
EC on the basis of authorisation in
their home state.
European Community directives cover
aspects of insurance, including reinsurance,
compulsory motor insurance, EC co-
insurance, insurance intermediaries, freedom
of establishment for life and non-life
insurance, and freedom to provide cross-
border services for non-life risks. A directive
on cross-border services for life assurance will
come into force in May 1993.
Some 836 companies are authorised to
carry on one or more classes of insurance
business in Britain, of which 7 per cent are
EC companies with their head office outside
Britain, and a further 10 per cent are
companies established outside the
Community. The total invested assets of
companies representing about 98 per cent of
the British insurance market amounted to
nearly £358,000 million in 1991. About 450
companies belong to the Association of
British Insurers (ABI). Some companies are
mutual institutions, owned by their policy
holders. Insurance is also available from
certain friendly societies—mutual institutions
administered by trustees.
Long-term Insurance
Long-term insurance is handled by 266
companies. As well as providing life cover,
long-term insurance is a vehicle for saving
and investment by individuals, premiums
being invested in securities and other assets.
The net long-term insurance premium
income of companies representing about 99
per cent of the British market in 1991
was almost £47,000 million from their
worldwide operations, £39,500 million of
which was earned in Britain.
General Insurance
General insurance business is undertaken by
insurance companies and by Lloyd’s. It
covers fire, accident, general liability,
short-term life, motor, marine, aviation and
transport. Total ABI member company
premiums worldwide in 1991 were £27,600
million, of which £17,000 million was earned
in Britain. Over £9,000 million was for
motor insurance worldwide and £1,800
million for marine, aviation and transport
insurance. Fire and accident insurance was
worth around £16,600 million throughout
the world. The bulk of business by ABI
companies in the latter categories was
written through the Institute of London
Underwriters (see p 265).
Lloyd's
Lloyd’s, the origins of which go back to the
seventeenth century, is an incorporated
society of private insurers in London.
Although its activities were originally
confined to the conduct of marine insurance,
a considerable worldwide market for the
transaction of other classes of insurance
business, such as aviation and motor
insurance, has been built up.
Lloyd’s is not a company but a market for
insurance administered by the Council of
Lloyd’s. Business is carried out for individual
elected underwriting members, or ‘names’,
who must show sufficient available wealth
and lodge a deposit. Insurance is transacted
for them with unlimited liability, in
competition with each other and with
insurance companies. In 1992 there were
22,300 members, grouped into 279
syndicates. Each syndicate is managed by an
underwriting agent responsible for appointing
a professional underwriter to accept insurance
risks and settle claims on the syndicate
members’ behalf. Insurance may only be
placed through accredited Lloyd’s brokers,
who negotiate with Lloyd’s syndicates on
behalf of the insured.
Lloyd’s net premium income in 1989, the
264
FINANCE AND OTHER SERVICE INDUSTRIES
most recent year for which figures are
available, was £3,966 million, which can be
broken down as follows:
• £596 million for motor insurance;
• £1,326 million for marine insurance;
• £281 million for aviation insurance;
and
• £1,762 million for non-marine insurance.
A report published in January 1992, after
an investigation into Lloyd’s by the Rowland
task force, contained proposals that could, if
implemented, significantly change the
operation of Lloyd’s. The proposed reforms
include the introduction of limited-liability
capital, restructuring of the agency system
and the creation of a secondary market for
syndicate participation.
Institute of London Underwriters
The Institute of London Underwriters was
formed in 1884, originally as a trade
association for marine underwriters. It now
provides a market where insurance companies
transact marine, commercial transport and
aviation business. The Institute issues
combined policies in its own name which are
underwritten by member companies. The
premium income processed by the Institute
in 1991 was some £2,210 million. About half
of the 101 member companies are branches
or subsidiaries of overseas companies.
Insurance Brokers
Insurance brokers, acting on behalf of the
insured, are a valuable part of the company
market and play an essential role in the
Lloyd’s market. Many brokers specialise in
reinsurance business, serving as
intermediaries in the exchange of contracts
between companies, both British and
overseas, and often acting as London
representatives of the latter. The Insurance
Brokers (Registration) Act 1977 makes
provision for the voluntary registration and
regulation of insurance brokers by the
Insurance Brokers Registration Council. Only
those registered with the Council can use the
title ‘insurance broker’. In 1992 some 13,600
individuals were registered with the Council,
through 2,195 partnerships or sole traderships
and 2,885 limited companies.
Investment Funds
Pension Funds
Virtually all occupational pension schemes are
based on trust law. Benefits are funded in
advance by employer (and wholly employee)
contributions, which are held and invested by
trustees on behalf of beneficiaries. Pension
funds are major investors in securities
markets. Total pension fund assets were
worth more than £300,000 million in 1992
and pension funds held around 40 per cent of
securities listed on the London Stock
Exchange. Since 1986, members of
occupational pension schemes have been able
to opt out and set up a personal pension
scheme. Over 11 million people belong to
occupational pension schemes and more than
4 million to personal pension schemes.
In July 1992 the Government announced
the establishment of an independent
committee to review the legal and regulatory
framework for occupational pension
schemes.
Investment and Unit Trusts
An approved investment trust is a collective
investment facility, structured as a company
with fixed capital and quoted on the London
Stock Exchange. It must invest mostly in
securities, and the trust itself is exempt from
capital gains tax. Its assets are purchased
mainly out of the capital subscribed by
shareholders but investment trusts are also
allowed to borrow funds to invest. The shares
of investment trust companies are traded in
the normal way on the Stock Exchange.
There are around 210 members of the
Association of Investment Trust Companies,
with some £23,000 million worth of assets
under management in 1992.
Authorised unit trusts are forms of open-
ended mutual or pooled investment funds
which are regulated by the Securities and
Investments Board. As with investment
trusts, investors with relatively small amounts
265
BRITAIN 1993: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
to invest are able to benefit from diversified
and expertly managed portfolios. Unit trusts
are exempt from capital gains tax. Investors
in unit trusts buy units, the supply and
demand for which is met by selling or buying
the underlying assets.
The British industry has grown rapidly
during the last decade and in 1992 there were
about 14,000 authorised unit trusts, with total
holdings approaching £60,000 million. As a
result of an EC directive, cross-border
marketing of mutual funds in Europe has
been possible since 1989. Unit trust
management groups are represented by the
Unit Trust Association.
Special Financing Institutions
There are many specialised institutions
offering finance to personal and corporate
sector borrowers. These borrowers are found
in both the public and the private sectors.
Among public sector agencies are Scottish
Enterprise, Highlands and Islands Enterprise,
the Welsh Development Agency, the
Industrial Development Board for Northern
Ireland and ECGD (Export Credits
Guarantee Department—Britain’s official
export credit insurer). The part of ECGD that
handled the export of capital goods sold on
short-term credit was privatised in 1991 and
is now dealt with by NCM Credit Insurance.
Some private sector institutions were set
up with government support and with
financing from banks and other financial
institutions. They may offer loan finance or
equity capital. The main private sector
institutions are described below.
Finance and Leasing Companies
At the beginning of 1992 the Finance Houses
Association and the Equipment Leasing
Association together formed a single new
representative body, the Finance and Leasing
Association (FLA), which represents the
interests of companies offering motor finance,
consumer credit, and business finance and
leasing. The FLA expects its 105 members to
undertake £30,000 million of new business in
1992, which would represent over 30 per cent
of all British fixed investment in equipment
and more than 80 per cent of all credit apart
from lending by the clearing banks and
building societies. The FLA also has 32
associate members.
Factoring Companies
Factoring comprises a range of financial
services which provide growing companies
with a flexible source of finance in exchange
for the outstanding invoices due to them.
Factoring has developed as a major financial
service since the early 1960s, covering
international activities as well as domestic
trade. Member companies of the Association
of British Factors and Discounters handled
business worth £14,200 million in 1991, 47
per cent of which was undertaken for clients
in manufacturing industry, 29 per cent for
clients in distribution and 17 per cent for
clients in the services sector.
Venture Capital Companies
Venture capital companies offer medium- and
long-term equity financing for new and
developing businesses when such funds are
not easily or directly available from
traditional sources, like the stock market or
banks. The 114 full members of the British
Venture Capital Association make up some 98
per cent of Britain’s venture capital industry.
Many venture capital companies are
subsidiaries of other financial institutions,
including banks, insurance companies and
pension funds.
Britain’s venture capital industry
invested £1,150 million in Britain,
elsewhere in Europe, and in the United
States in 1991.
The largest of Britain’s venture capital
companies, 3i, supports investment
programmes over a whole range of industries.
Within the last few years it has become
involved in financing management ‘buy¬
outs’—the purchase of businesses from their
owners by the management and other staff.
The shares in 3i are currently owned by the
Bank of England (15 per cent) and six of the
major retail banks.
266
FINANCE AND OTHER SERVICE INDUSTRIES
Financial Markets
The City of London has a variety of financial
markets. They include the London Stock
Exchange, the foreign exchange market, the
financial futures and options market,
eurobond and eurocurrency markets, Lloyd’s
insurance market (see p 264), and bullion and
commodity markets.
London Stock Exchange
The London Stock Exchange has its main
administrative centre in London, as well as
centres in Belfast, Birmingham, Leeds,
Glasgow and Manchester. As a result of a set
of reforms implemented in 1986 and known
popularly as ‘Big Bang’, the Exchange has
changed radically in recent years. The main
reforms were as follows:
• the Exchange’s rules on membership were
altered to allow corporate ownership of
member firms;
• the system under which dealers charged
fixed minimum scales of commission to
investors was abolished in favour of
negotiated commissions;
• dealers were permitted to trade in
securities both on their own behalf, as
principals, and on behalf of clients, as
agents, these two roles formerly having
been kept distinct; and
• a screen-based dealing system came into
operation, which led to the closing of the
trading floor.
The London Stock Exchange is one of the
largest in the world in terms of the number
and variety of securities listed. Its turnover of
equities in 1991 accounted for 9 per cent of
equity trading worldwide. Some 7,300
securities are quoted; in 1992 these had a
market value of almost £2,055,000 million.
Nearly 4,700 company securities are quoted,
including those of a growing number of
leading overseas companies, with a value of
some £1,770,000 million. The remainder is
made up of British and overseas government
and corporation stocks as well as eurobonds
(see p 268).
In recent years the largest market for new
issues has been that for companies’ securities,
including issues of shares resulting from the
Government’s privatisation programme.
Trading in British government securities—
‘gilt-edged stocks’—in 1991 accounted for
about three-fifths of transactions by value
(excluding traded options). New issues are
made on the Government’s behalf by the
Bank of England when required.
European Community Directives
The London Stock Exchange altered its rules
in 1990 to conform to EC directives on
listing particulars, prospectuses and mutual
recognition. The major effect of the EC
directive on Mutual Recognition of Listing
Particulars is that, subject to certain
limitations, each member state is required to
recognise listing particulars accepted in
another member state. In order to put British
companies on an equal footing with those in
other EC countries, the Exchange reduced
the minimum trading record requirement for
full listing from five years to three. At the
same time the corresponding requirement for
the Unlisted Securities Market, on which the
securities of smaller companies are quoted,
was reduced from three years to two.
Money Markets
The London money markets are a series of
parallel markets in wholesale funds, usually
short-term in maturity. They include:
• the interbank deposit market, in which
banks place and take unsecured deposits
for maturities from overnight to as long
as 12 months, frequently through
specialist broking firms;
• the secured deposit market, in which
only the main banks and discount houses
operate;
• the market in certificates of deposit
issued by banks and building societies;
• the market in Treasury bills, short-term
claims on government which can be
issued for up to one year but in practice
are only issued at three- and six-month
maturities;
• a market in local authority bills; and
267
BRITAIN 1993: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
• a market in bank bills, namely
commercial bills accepted by banks.
In addition to these ‘cash’ markets, there
are also markets in futures (contracts covering
transactions in financial instruments or
physical commodities for future delivery on
an exchange) and options (which feature the
right to buy or sell shares or property within
a stated period at a predetermined price),
swaps and options on futures.
The major participants in money
markets are banks, which are supervised by
the Bank of England in accordance with the
Banking Act 1986. Under the Financial
Services Act 1986 the Bank is responsible for
regulating certain other market participants
and has developed a code of conduct which is
observed by all market participants.
Capital markets have been undergoing
continuous transformation since the 1960s
(see p 258). Throughout the 1980s a trend
towards the ‘securitisation of debt’
developed—major borrowers increasingly
raised funds by issuing securities instead of
seeking bank loans. In 1986 large companies
were permitted to develop a sterling
commercial paper market: this consisted
initially of issues of short-term debt
denominated in sterling with a maturity of up
to one year. Since 1989 the sterling
commercial paper and the short-term
corporate bond markets have been
consolidated. The range of issuers has been
broadened since 1986 to include, for example,
banks and building societies, and overseas
public authorities. The market now enables
such bodies to borrow directly from the
money market by issuing short-term debt of
up to five years’ maturity.
Euromarkets
These are markets in currencies lent or
invested outside their domestic marketplace,
particularly as a means of financing
international trade and investment.
Transactions can thus be carried out in
eurodollars, eurodeutschmarks, euroyen and
so on. London is at the heart of the
euromarkets and houses most of the major
international banks and securities firms.
The euromarkets developed in the late
1950s following the restoration of
convertibility between the major currencies,
partly to avoid incurring the costs of
exchange control and other regulations. In
recent years distinctions between markets
have been breaking down and the
euromarkets form a major part of the wider
international money and capital markets.
Participants in the markets include
multinational trading corporations, financial
companies and governments.
Securities markets have grown
considerably in recent years as flexible
alternatives to bank loans. These include
euro-commercial paper and euro-medium-
term notes and eurobonds. In the last few
years a market in internationally syndicated
equities has grown up. Banks continue to
lend internationally, both bilaterally and
through syndicates as part of the euro-
syndicated loans market.
Foreign Exchange Market
London’s foreign exchange market has no
physical centre, but consists of telephone and
electronic links between the participants,
which include banks, other financial
institutions and several firms of foreign
exchange brokers acting as intermediaries
between the banks. It provides those engaged
in international trade and investment with
foreign currencies for their transactions. The
banks are in close contact with financial
centres abroad and are able to quote buying
and selling rates for both immediate (‘spot’)
and forward transactions in a range of
currencies and maturities. The forward
market enables traders and dealers who, at a
given date in the future, wish to receive or
make a specific foreign currency payment, to
contract in advance to sell or buy the foreign
currency involved for sterling at a fixed
exchange rate.
London has the largest foreign
exchange market in the world, wdth an
average daily turnover of about
$200,000 million.
There is a growing private sector market
in European Currency Units (ECUs),
268
FINANCE AND OTHER SERVICE INDUSTRIES
particularly in ECU-denominated deposits,
securities and eurobonds.
Financial Futures and Options
Over 200 banks, other financial institutions,
brokers and individual traders are members
of the London International Financial
Futures and Options Exchange (LIFFE),
which trades at the Cannon Bridge
development. Futures markets allow parties
that are affected by movements in prices,
interest rates or exchange rates to adjust
their exposure to the underlying market.
Futures contracts are legally binding
documents for the purchase or sale of a fixed
amount of a commodity, at a price agreed in
the present, on a specified future date,
thereby facilitating the transfer of risk
between two parties.
The London Traded Options Market,
previously part of the London Stock
Exchange, merged with the London
International Financial Futures Exchange in
March 1992. Trading is in 68 equity options
on the equity of prominent British
companies and in stock index options.
LIFFE has the most internationally
diverse range of financial futures and options
products of any exchange in the world. In
the first seven months of 1992 some 39,700
million futures and options contracts were
traded—more than in the whole of 1991. In
July 1992 some 322,000 contracts were
traded daily on average, representing a daily
turnover of £74,000 rnillion.
London Bullion Market
Over 60 banks, securities and trading
companies comprise the London gold and
silver markets which, like the foreign
exchange market, trade by telephone and
telex links. Five of the members of the
London Bullion Market Association meet
twice daily to establish a London fixing price
for gold—a reference point for worldwide
dealings. The silver fixing is held once a
day. Although much interest centres upon
the fixings, active dealing takes place
throughout the day. London and Zurich are
the main world centres for gold dealings.
Commodity, Shipping and Freight Markets
Britain remains the principal international
centre for transactions in a large number of
commodities, although most of the sales
negotiated in London relate to consignments
which never pass through the ports of
Britain. The need for close links with sources
of finance and with shipping and insurance
services often determined the location of
these markets in the City of London. There
are also futures markets in cocoa, coffee,
grains (wheat and barley), potatoes, soya bean
meal, sugar and pigs at London Fox (the
Futures and Options Exchange); non-ferrous
metals (aluminium, copper, lead, nickel, silver
and zinc) at the London Metal Exchange;
and gas oil (heating oil) and unleaded
gasoline at the International Petroleum
Exchange.
Members of London’s Baltic Exchange are
involved in over half of the world’s
international ship chartering business and a
freight futures market is in operation at
London Fox.
OTHER SERVICES
Distribution
Distributing goods to their point of sale by
road, rail, air and sea is a significant
economic activity. In 1991 there were some
3-4 million employees in the distributive and
allied trades in Great Britain. The sector
accounts for about a sixth of national income.
The large retailers and wholesalers of food,
drink and clothing operate their own
extensive distribution networks using fleets of
trailers, vans and lorries. Also notable is the
highly competitive specialist express delivery
sector.
Wholesaling
There were 119,000 businesses, with a
turnover valued at £222,100 million (see
Table 14.1), engaged in wholesaling and
dealing in Great Britain in 1989. Total
turnover had increased by 8 per cent between
1988 and 1989.

Note: Differences between totals and the sums of their component parts are due to rounding.
large retailers have their own buying and
central distribution operations. Elsewhere in
the trade, voluntary groups have been formed
by wholesalers and small independent
retailers; the retailers are encouraged by
discounts and other incentives to buy as
much as possible from the wholesaler. This
has helped to preserve many smaller retail
outlets, including the traditional ‘corner
shops’ and village stores, and has given small
retailers the advantages of bulk buying and
co-ordinated distribution.
London’s wholesale markets play a
significant part in the distribution of
foodstuffs. New Covent Garden is the main
market for fruit and vegetables, Smithfield
for meat and Billingsgate for fish.
The co-operative movement has its own
wholesale organisation, the Co-operative
Wholesale Society (CWS). Retail co-operative
societies are encouraged to buy from the
CWS, which is their main supplier. The
CWS is also a major retailer in Scotland,
Northern Ireland, the Midlands and south¬
east and north-east England.
Retailing
Of the 25 largest retailers in Western Europe
(by sales in the period 1988-90), ten were
British firms. In 1989 there were 242,000
retail businesses, with 350,000 outlets, in
Great Britain (see Table 14.2). In recent
years the large multiple retailers have grown
in size, reducing numbers of stores but
increasing outlet size and diversifying their
product ranges. Decline has been particularly
evident among small independent businesses
and retail co-operative societies.
The largest multiple retailers in the
grocery market are Sainsbury, Tesco,
Safeway, Asda and Gateway. These five
groups are responsible for around £27,000
million of grocery sales a year. Among
retailers, these companies are generally the
ones that have best weathered the recession
that has affected Britain since 1990.
Retail co-operative societies are voluntary
organisations controlled by their members,
membership being open to anyone paying a
small deposit on a minimum share. There are
4,700 retail co-operative outlets, 64 per cent
of which sell food and groceries.
The leading mixed retail businesses
include Marks & Spencer, Boots, Kingfisher,
Storehouse, W. H. Smith, Argos,
Littlewoods, Savacentre, John Menzies,
Sears, Burton Group and House of Fraser.
About 20 million people regularly
purchase all kinds of goods and services
through mail order catalogues. In 1991 sales
by general mail order totalled some £3,560
270
FINANCE AND OTHER SERVICE INDUSTRIES
million, representing nearly 3 per cent of all
retail sales. The largest selling items sold by
the mail order companies are clothing,
footwear, furniture, household textiles,
televisions, radios and electrical goods.
Large Shopping Centres
Britain has a wide range of complementary
shopping facilities inside and outside town
and city centres. One of the most
significant trends in retailing is towards the
development of large supermarkets and
superstores in order to increase efficiency and
the range of goods available. However, the
nine largest multiple retailers have only
around one-quarter of retail turnover, partly
because there continues to be a demand for
the services provided by small, specialised
shops.
The main multiple grocery companies have
been steadily increasing the size of their
stores both in towns and cities and on
suburban and out-of-town sites. Also, retailers
of goods such as do-it-yourself (DIY)
products, furniture and electrical appliances
have built retail warehouses outside town and
city centres, particularly to attract
shoppers with cars. More recently, there
has been a trend towards the grouping of
retail warehouses into retail warehouse
parks. Many towns and cities have
purpose-built shopping centres.
A number of regional out-of-town
shopping centres have been established on
sites offering good access to large numbers
of customers with cars. One of the first
centres was the Metro Centre at
Gateshead, Tyne and Wear, which has
over 93,000 sq m (1 million sq ft) of
floorspace and is the largest of its kind in
Europe. Other centres include the
Meadowhall shopping centre in Sheffield
and the Lakeside centre at Thurrock in
Essex, both opened in 1990.
All new retail development requires
planning permission from the local
government planning authority. These
authorities must consult the appropriate
central government department before
granting permission for developments of
23,325 sq m (250,000 sq ft) or more. The
Government’s policy is to encourage the
provision of a broad range of shopping

facilities to the public, while ensuring that
the effects of major new retail development
do not undermine the viability and vitality
of existing town centres.
Diversification
Many of the large multiple groups sell a
much greater number of goods and services
than previously. However, in some cases
extensive diversification has proved
unprofitable and large food retailers are
increasing their range of foods instead. More
emphasis is also being placed on selling
own-label goods and environmentally
friendly products, including organic
produce. Many superstores and large
supermarkets offer fresh food, such as fresh
meat, fish, vegetables and bread baked on
the premises, as well as selling packaged
foods. Some large retailers have in recent
years begun to provide financial and estate
agency services.
Promotions
Retailers are placing greater emphasis on
price competition and quality as a means of
promoting sales. Some large retailers have
issued their own credit cards for regular
customers in an attempt to encourage sales,
particularly of high-value goods.
Use of Technology
Laser-scanning electronic checkouts are
having a major impact on British retailing.
Bar-codes on retail products are scanned at
the checkout to generate a price and to give
the store instant information about the
depletion of its stock. Electronic data
interchange (EDI) allows data such as that
contained in invoices and orders to be
transmitted electronically, rather than
printing and posting a paper document. A
legal change permitting tax invoices in forms
other than paper has made it easier for
retailers to use EDI when dealing with their
suppliers.
Electronic ordering, pricing and delivery
systems are used increasingly, even by small
independent retailers. High-speed labelling
techniques are being adopted, including the
use of electronic printers which can overprint
labels, and of pressure-sensitive glues and
printing in foil instead of ink.
Nearly 200,000 EFTPOS terminals in
retail outlets allow shoppers to pay for
goods using a debit card to transfer
funds electronically.
Several major EFTPOS schemes are well
established, and the number of terminals is
growing quickly. In many cases the terminals
are integrated with retailers’ in-house
computer systems.
Vehicle and Petrol Retailing
In 1991 there were 264,000 people employed
in the retail distribution of motor vehicles
and parts, and in petrol stations. Many
businesses selling new vehicles are franchised
by the motor manufacturers.
Over one-third of the 19,247 petrol
stations are owned by oil companies. The
three companies with the largest number of
outlets in 1991 were Shell (2,587), Esso
(2,470) and BP (1,922). Unleaded petrol
accounts for about two-fifths of petrol sold.
The majority of petrol stations are self-
service. About 16,000 outlets sell diesel fuel.
Hotels and Catering
The hotel and catering trades employed some
L25 million people in Great Britain at the
end of 1991:
• 334,000 in public houses and bars;
• 310,000 in restaurants, cafes and snack
bars;
• 301,000 in hotels and other residential
establishments;
• 162,000 in canteens; and
• 145,000 in clubs.
A large number of self-employed people
also work in hotels and catering.
There were about 29,600 hotels in Great
Britain in 1991, with a turnover of £6,200
million. Many licensed hotels as well as most
of the numerous guest houses have fewer
272
FINANCE AND OTHER SERVICE INDUSTRIES
than 20 rooms. Of the major hotel business
groups, the biggest is Forte, which runs 721
hotels, including 338 in Britain, and has
catering and leisure interests. Among the
largest firms running holiday centres
(including holiday camps with full board,
self-catering centres and caravan parks) are
Butlins, Warner Holidays and Pontin’s.
Britain has a very wide range of restaurants,
offering cuisine from virtually every country
in the world. The Food Safety Act 1990 has
contributed to a raising of food safety
standards, as has the application of the
relevant British standard on quality.
In 1991 there were about 83,500 public
houses (pubs), which mainly sell beer, wines,
soft drinks and spirits for consumption on the
premises. Many pubs are owned by the large
brewing companies, which either provide
managers to run them or offer tenancy
agreements; others, called free houses, are
independently owned and managed. The
Government has acted to strengthen
competition in the sale of beer and other
drinks in pubs.
Advertising
Advertising expenditure in 1991 amounted to
£1,511 million. The press accounted for 64
per cent of the total, television for 30 per
cent, posters for nearly 4 per cent, and
commercial radio and cinema for the rest.
The largest advertising expenditure is on
food, retail and mail order services, cars,
financial services, household goods, drink and
leisure equipment. Campaigns are planned
mainly by several hundred advertising
agencies which, in some cases, offer
marketing, consumer research and other
services.
Computing Services
The computing services industry comprises
software houses, production of packaged
software, consultancy, facilities management,
processing services, and the provision of
complete computer systems. It also includes
companies providing information technology
education and training, independent
maintenance, contingency planning and
recruitment, and contract staff. The industry
is one of the fastest growing sectors of the
British economy.
The turnover of companies in the
Computing Services Association totalled
almost £4,000 million in 1991, representing
some 75 per cent of the industry in Britain.
Important areas for software development
include data and word processing,
telecommunications, computer-aided design
and manufacturing, defence and consumer
electronics. The financial services sector is a
major user of computer services. Logica, a
leading British systems company and
consultancy, developed systems for the
‘Lloydslink’ service that enables Lloyds
Bank’s corporate customers to conduct
banking business using their personal
computers.
Management Consultancy
There are about 14,000 management
consultants, of whom 3,750 are individual
practising members of the Institute of
Management Consultants. Among the largest
management consultancy companies are the
33 member firms of the Management
Consultancies Association, with revenue
earned within Britain totalling £850 million,
and overseas revenue amounting to almost
£110 million in 1991. The Association reports
a growing demand for the application of
information technology to all aspects of
business. The Association’s members account
for around 60 per cent of Britain’s fee-paying
management consultancy market.
Market Research
Market research is a well-established sector of
the marketing services industry in Britain.
Britain accounts for about 10 per cent of
worldwide expenditure, and spends more on
market research, per head, than any other
European country.
The Association of Market Survey
Organisations (AMSO) is the main trade
organisation. AMSO’s member companies
carry out over two-thirds of all commercial
market research in Britain. In 1991 they
accounted for total research revenues of £265
273
BRITAIN 1993: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
million—a growth in revenues of just under
2 per cent since 1990. Research revenues
come from a large range of clients and
industries.
Exhibition and Conference Centres
Britain is one of the world’s three leading
countries for international conferences (the
others being the United States and France).
With the steady increase in new and
renovated facilities, some 95 towns and cities
now have facilities for conferences and
exhibitions.
Among the most modern purpose-built
conference and exhibition centres are the
International Conference Centre in
Birmingham and the Queen Elizabeth II and
Olympia Conference Centres, both in
London. Others are situated in Brighton
(East Sussex), Harrogate (North Yorkshire),
Bournemouth (Dorset), Cardiff, Birmingham,
Manchester, Nottingham and Torquay. In
Scotland, both Glasgow and Aberdeen have
exhibition and conference centres. Other
large exhibition facilities are situated in
London at the Barbican, Earls
Court/Olympia, Alexandra Palace and
Wembley Arena.
Many of the larger sites belong to a
marketing group, the British Conference and
Exhibition Centres Export Council.
Auction Houses
Britain’s chief auction houses are active in
the international auction markets for works of
art, trading on their acknowledged expertise
as well as that of British dealers. The two
largest houses, Sotheby’s and Christie’s, are
established worldwide. Sotheby’s handled
sales valued at nearly £639 million in 1991,
while Christie’s sales were valued at £103
million.
Tourism and Travel
Tourism is one of Britain’s most important
industries and is a major source of
employment. It is estimated that nearly L5
million people are employed in the tourism
industry in Britain.
In 1990 over 18 million overseas visitors
came to Britain and spent nearly £7,800
million. Total spending on tourism in Britain
amounted to over £25,000 million in 1990.
British residents made 31 million trips abroad
and spent £9,900 million, giving a deficit on
the travel account of £2,100 million. Fifty-
nine per cent of overseas visitors to Britain
came from Western Europe and 21 per cent
from North America. Eighty-three per cent
of trips abroad by British visitors were to
Western Europe.
Although the number of overseas visitors
to Britain fell by 8 per cent in 1991, to 16 7
million, due to the recession and the
aftermath of the Gulf War, it is thought that
earnings from tourism will continue to
increase. The number of overseas visitors to
Britain is forecast to rise by an average of
around 5 per cent each year to 1996.
Some 90 per cent of travel agencies belong
to the Association of British Travel Agents
(ABTA). Although most travel agents are
small businesses, there are a few large
firms—such as Lunn Poly and Thomas
Cook—which have hundreds of branches.
Computerised information and booking
systems are used extensively in travel
agencies. There are also 660 tour operator
members of ABTA; about half are both retail
agents and tour operators.
ABTA operates financial protection
schemes to safeguard its members’ customers,
maintains codes of conduct drawn up with
the Office of Fair Trading, and offers a free
consumer affairs service to help to resolve
complaints against members and an
independent arbitration scheme for tour
operators’ customers.
Tourist Authorities
Tourism falls under the remit of the
Department of National Heritage.
Government support is made available by the
British Tourist Authority (BTA) and the
tourist boards for England, Scotland, Wales
and Northern Ireland. The BTA promotes
overseas tourism to Britain and is represented
in 32 countries. The tourist boards improve
and promote facilities for tourism in each
area. The English Tourist Board (ETB)
274
FINANCE AND OTHER SERVICE INDUSTRIES
works closely with 12 regional tourist boards,
which are responsible for the planning,
development and marketing of tourism in
their areas. Each board is a partnership
between the ETB, local government and trade
interests in their region.
Some 17,000 hotels and other serviced
accommodation are inspected and classified
by the tourist boards. The various
classifications—‘listed’ and one to five
crowns—indicate the range of facilities and
services provided. Quality standards are
indicated by the terms ‘Approved’,
‘Commended’, ‘Highly Commended’ and
‘De Luxe’. A similar arrangement applies to
self-catering holiday homes. There is also a
‘Q^ quality grading scheme for caravans,
chalets and camping parks. Information on
tourist facilities and accommodation is
available from official tourist information
centres, most of which are administered by
local government.
275
15 Energy and Natural
Resources
Energy and non-fuel minerals make an
important contribution to the British
economy. The approximate value of minerals
produced in 1990 was £16,803 million
(representing just over 4 per cent of gross
domestic product—GDP), of which crude oil
accounted for 48 per cent, coal 23 per cent
and natural gas 15 per cent.
Minerals in Great Britain are mainly
privately owned, with the exception of gold,
silver, oil and natural gas (which are owned
by the Crown), and coal and some minerals
associated with coal. In Northern Ireland gold
and silver are owned by the Crown, while
rights to exploit petroleum and other
minerals are vested in the Department of
Economic Development.
On the United Kingdom Continental
Shelf the right to exploit all minerals except
coal is vested in the Crown.
The exclusive right to extract coal, or
license others to do so, both on land in Great
Britain and under the sea, is vested in the
British Coal Corporation. Normally,
ownership of minerals belongs to the owner
of the land surface, but in some areas,
particularly those with a long history of
mining, these rights have become separated.
Mining and quarrying, apart from deep
coalmining, are usually carried out by
privately owned companies.
Energy Resources
Britain has the largest energy resources of
any country in the European Community and
is a major world producer of oil, natural gas
and coal—called primary sources. The other
main primary sources are nuclear power and
some water power; secondary sources
(derived from primary sources) are electricity,
coke and smokeless fuels, and petroleum
products. In 1991 Britain was a small net
importer of energy, amounting to 13 8 million
tonnes of oil equivalent. In financial terms,
however, the higher value of its exports
meant that it was a net exporter of energy, to
the value of £104 million. There are large
reserves of coal, which is expected to
continue to supply a significant proportion of
the country’s energy needs. Nuclear power
provided about 21 per cent of electricity
supplied by the British electricity companies
in 1991.
Private sector companies carry out
offshore oil and gas production and oil
refining, while a publicly owned body is at
present responsible for most coal production.
The electricity supply industry in Great
Britain, apart from nuclear power, has been
privatised. The privatisation of the electricity
supply industry in Northern Ireland is in
progress.
ENERGY POLICY
In 1992 the functions of the former
Department of Energy were transferred to
the Department of Trade and Industry, with
the exception of energy efficiency, which was
transferred to the Department of the
Environment. The President of the Board of
Trade and the Secretary of State for the
Environment are thus responsible for energy
matters in Great Britain, except for electricity
in Scotland, which is under the Secretary of
State for Scotland. The Secretary of State for
Northern Ireland is responsible for all energy
matters there.
Energy policy is designed to ensure the
secure, adequate and economic provision of
energy to meet Britain’s requirements. The
Government encourages the exploitation of
Britain’s diverse energy sources. It seeks to
ensure that all economic forms of energy are
produced, supplied and used as efficiently as
276
ENERGY AND NATURAL RESOURCES
possible, having regard also to the
international application and environmental
implications of the technologies involved.
Central government spending on energy is
planned to decline by over 50 per cent
between 1991-92 and 1994—95, with an
increasing share of expenditure directed at
non-nuclear items and at energy efficiency.
The Government stresses the importance
of the continued profitable development of
Britain’s oil and gas resources, the
development of a competitive coal industry,
the safe and economic development of nuclear
power, and the most cost-effective use of
energy through the adoption of energy
efficiency measures. It also funds an extensive
research and development programme into
renewable sources of energy.
Privatisation
Privatisation has already had an impact in the
energy field, with the transfer of British Gas,
Britoil, Enterprise Oil, and the non-nuclear
electricity supply industry in Britain to the
private sector. The Government has
announced plans to privatise the coal
industry. It considers that privatised
industries improve their competitiveness and
efficiency, free of government pressures, and
attract new investment to provide cheaper
and cleaner energy. The Competition and
Service (Utilities) Act 1992 aims to give
customers of privatised utilities fair treatment
and strengthens the powers of regulators.
Customers are to be compensated when
standards are not met and greater competition
introduced into the gas industry.
International Commitments
Britain is actively engaged in international
collaboration on energy questions, notably
through its membership of the European
Community and of the International Energy
Agency (IEA; a body with 23 member
countries attached to the Organisation for
Economic Co-operation and Development).
In 1990 the European Community introduced
the THERMIE scheme for the promotion of
energy technology, including support for
demonstration projects in the hydrocarbons
sector.
European Energy Charter
In 1991 Britain (along with other member
states of the Community and European Free
Trade Association, eastern European
countries, the republics of the former Soviet
Union, the United States, Japan, Australia
and Canada) signed the European Energy
Charter. Associated legally binding
agreements are currently under negotiation.
The main objectives are:
• an open competitive market for trade in
energy, including a framework for
investment promotion and protection;
• co-operation in the energy field, through,
for example, co-ordination of energy
policies and mutual exchange of technical
data; and
• promotion of energy efficiency and
environmental protection, including the
use of new and renewable sources of
energy.

BRITAIN 1993: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
ENERGY CONSUMPTION
During 1980-91, when Britain’s GDP rose by
25 per cent, final energy consumption on a
‘heat supplied’ basis increased by only 8-4 per
cent. Energy consumption by final users in
1991 amounted to 61,302 million therms1 on
a ‘heat supplied’ basis, of which transport
consumed 31 per cent, industrial users 26 per
cent, domestic users 29 per cent, and
commerce, agriculture and public services
13 per cent.
ENERGY EFFICIENCY
The Energy Efficiency Office (EEO),
established in 1983 and part of the
Department of the Environment, provides a
wide range of services and programmes
designed to encourage cost-effective energy
efficiency improvements. The EEO promotes
its programmes through a restructured and
strengthened network of regional energy
efficiency officers. Since 1983, EEO
programmes have cost some £190 million and
have led to savings now worth over
£500 million a year. The EEO’s budget for
1992-93 is £59 million.
Consumers in Britain spent £49,000
million (including taxes) on energy in
1990—9 per cent of GDP. Of this
amount the EEO estimates that about
20 per cent could have been saved if
consumers had invested in cost-
effective energy efficiency measures.
The Government stresses that
improved energy efficiency not only
saves valuable energy resources, but
also has a significant role to play in
achieving the Government’s
environmental objectives.
All major government departments and
English health authorities have been set a
target to reduce energy consumption by 15
per cent over five years. Energy efficiency in
local authorities and schools is also being
promoted.
The EEO’s main technical information
1 1 therm = 105,506 kilojoules.
transfer and research and development
programme, ‘Best Practice’, aims to advance
and spread good practice in energy efficiency
by providing energy users, building
professionals and those responsible for
industrial production with a wide range of
advice and information. Work under the Best
Practice programme is managed by the
Energy Technology Support Unit (ETSU;
for industry) and the Building Research
Energy Conservation Support Unit
(BRECSU; for buildings). The aim of the
Best Practice programme is to stimulate
additional savings of £700 million a year at
1992 prices by the year 2000.
The EEO promotes the wider use of
Combined Heat and Power (CHP)
technology, primarily through the Best
Practice programme. CHP plant produces
usable heat as well as electricity, making it
significantly more efficient than conventional
energy options. This can lead to substantial
energy cost savings and also makes CHP an
environmentally friendly technology. CHP is
operated on over 600 sites in Britain. It has a
total installed capacity of some 2,000
megawatts (MW).2 This accounts for about
3 per cent of electricity generated.
The Energy Management Assistance
Scheme aims to help companies with 500
employees or fewer to invest in energy
efficiency. The budget is £13 million over
three years. Assistance is limited to costs
incurred by consultants hired by the client.
An organisation may make only one
application during each financial year. There
is an upper limit on grants of £25,000 for
organisations employing between 300 and
500 people.
The EEO’s Home Energy Efficiency
Scheme provides grants for draughtproofing,
insulation of lofts, tanks and pipes, and
energy efficiency advice to low-income
households in both public and private sector
housing. Its main aim is to boost the
adoption of these basic measures.
Householders are eligible if they receive
income support, housing benefit, disability
working allowance, family credit or
community charge support.
2 1 MW = 1,000 kilowatts (kW).
278
ENERGY AND NATURAL RESOURCES
In 1991 the EEO launched a three-year,
£10 million, advertising and publicity
campaign, called ‘Helping the Earth Begins at
Home’, to improve understanding of the
greenhouse effect and the impact of domestic
energy use on the environment.
The EEO has also launched a promotional
campaign, ‘Making a Corporate
Commitment’, aimed at directors. It is
designed to motivate industrial, commercial
and public sector organisations to make a
corporate commitment to responsible energy
management.
The Government’s Energy Efficiency
Demonstration Programme funds over 70
schemes to improve energy efficiency and
reduce carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from
council houses in England. Some £50 million
is available in 1992-93.
In 1992 the Government, British Gas and
the regional electricity companies in England
and Wales agreed to establish an Energy
Saving Trust to develop programmes to
promote the efficient use of energy.
Britain has been working with its
European Community partners on the
development of effective legislative measures
on appliance labelling. A framework directive
for mandatory energy labelling of domestic
appliances has been agreed. Until the first
labels appear, the EEO and regional
electricity companies have developed an
interim voluntary scheme to put energy
efficiency labels on appliances, starting with
fridges and freezers, sold in the companies’
1,100 showrooms throughout Great Britain.
A standard assessment procedure for
comparing home energy labels produced by
different schemes, designed by the Building
Research Establishment, has been launched—
to be used in the National Energy Founda¬
tion and MVM Starpoint schemes. A home
energy labelling certificate tells a householder
how energy efficient his or her house is and
generally contains advice about cost-effective
measures which can be taken to improve a
property’s energy efficiency and cut fuel bills.
OIL AND GAS
Britain’s energy position is strengthened by
substantial oil and gas reserves offshore on
the United Kingdom Continental Shelf
(UKCS). The trend in offshore oil and gas
developments is towards the exploitation of
smaller reservoirs, and the advances in
science and technology (for example, seismic
acquisition technology, reservoir
characterisation and subsea production
systems) have made this a more economic
proposition.
The Government has granted exploration
and production licences as a result of 12
offshore licensing rounds since 1964. It
announced two separate offshore licensing
rounds in April 1990: the twelfth round and
the thirteenth (frontier) round. In May 1991,
74 twelfth round awards were announced,
covering 107 blocks. The thirteenth (frontier)
round awards were announced in May 1991;
six awards were made covering 66 blocks.
The thirteenth round was aimed at
promoting exploration of deep water areas
north and west of Scotland. By the end of
1991, 4,846 wells had been or were being
drilled in the UKCS: 2,198 development
wells, 1,660 exploration wells and 988
appraisal wells.
In the fourteenth round, announced in
March 1992, licensed acreage on offer will
include remaining acreage in the main mature
areas of the northern, central and southern
North Sea; more speculative acreage on the
margins of the main mature areas; and true
frontier acreage, where any finds will take a
long time to prove.
Offshore Supplies
The Offshore Supplies Office (OSO) of the
Department of Trade and Industry aims to
promote fair commercial opportunity in all oil
and gas markets, to support development of
the latest technologies and to foster British
exports.
In 1991 the total value of orders reported
by operators for oil and gas development
work on the UKCS was £6,079 million, close
to the 1990 figure of £6,186 million, the
highest ever. The British share in 1991 was
£4,734 million (78 per cent). The total value
of orders placed in 1991 for goods and
services in support of onshore activity was
£38-5 million.

BRITAIN 1993: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Research
Advice on the direction and content of the
OSO’s research and development in offshore
technology is provided by the Offshore
Energy Technology Board. The Petroleum
Science and Technology Institute, set up in
Edinburgh in 1989, is funded by 35 oil
companies and the OSO. Its remit is to
support oil-related research in British
universities. The Offshore Technology Park
in Aberdeen comprises several projects and is
part-funded by Scottish Enterprise.
Economic and Industrial Aspects
In 1991 UKCS oil and gas production
accounted for about 15 per cent of Britain’s
gross national product at factor cost. Total
revenue from the sale of oil and gas produced
from the UKCS in 1991 is estimated to have
been £8,000 million and £2,800 million
respectively. Taxes and royalty receipts
attributable to UKCS oil and gas are
estimated to have been £1,000 million in
1991-92 (£1,500 million lower than in
1990-91 because of lower oil prices and
higher investment).
Expenditure on offshore and onshore
development amounted to some £5,100
million in 1991. This was about 21 per cent
of British industrial investment and 5 per
cent of gross domestic fixed capital formation.
Total investment between 1965 and 1991
came to about £46,000 million (£79,000
million at 1991 prices). Some 33,200 people
were employed offshore in September 1991.
Offshore Safety
In November 1990, the Cullen report into the
destruction by explosion and fire of the Piper
Alpha fixed oil production platform in July
1988 resulted in 106 recommendations for a
new regulatory system of offshore safety.
The Offshore Safety Act 1992 assists in
enabling the major recommendations to be
implemented. It clears the way for progressive
replacement of existing prescriptive offshore
safety legislation by new regulations made
under the Health and Safety at Work etc. Act
1974. It also raises the maximum penalties for
offences which show a failure to manage
health and safety adequately and to comply
with an improvement or prohibition notice.
The Act will also allow the recommendations
to be implemented by regulations rather than
primary legislation. The Act completes the
statutory transfer of offshore safety
responsibilities to the Health and Safety
Executive.
OIL
Before the 1970s Britain was almost wholly
dependent for its oil supplies on imports, the
only indigenous supplies coming from a small
number of land-based oilfields. However, the
first notable offshore discovery of oil in the
UKCS was made in 1969 and the first oil was
brought ashore in 1975. Output of crude oil
in Britain in 1991 averaged over 187 million
barrels (about 256,000 tonnes) a day, making
Britain the world’s ninth largest producer.
North Sea Fields
There were 45 offshore fields producing
crude oil at the end of 1991, and 14 new
offshore development projects were approved
during the year.
Output is likely to increase until the
mid-1990s, and Britain should remain
self-sufficient in oil well into the 1990s
and a significant producer into the
twenty-first century.
The fields with the largest cumulative
production totals are Forties and Brent.
Ninian, Piper, Beryl, Fulmar, Thistle and
Claymore are other high-producing fields.
Production from most large fields is
controlled from production platforms of
either steel or concrete which have been built
to withstand severe weather, including gusts
of wind of up to 260 km/h (160 mph) and
waves of 30 m (100 ft). The Petroleum Act
1987 lays down measures to be taken in
connection with the abandonment of offshore
installations and pipelines.
The Government’s oil policy encourages
exploration, development and investment,
with the objective of maximising economic oil
280
ENERGY AND NATURAL RESOURCES
production for the foreseeable future.
Remaining recoverable reserves of UKCS oil
in the proven plus probable categories
amount to 1,230 million tonnes, while the
total remaining potential of the UKCS could
be as high as 7,180 million tonnes.
Structure of the Oil Industry
About 250 companies, including many large
oil firms, operate in Britain or engage in
work in the UKCS. Exploration and
development of the UKCS are carried out by
the private sector. The Government receives
royalties from UKCS oil.
The two leading British oil companies are
British Petroleum (BP) and Shell Transport
and Trading, which has a 40 per cent interest
in the Royal Dutch/Shell Group of
Companies. BP and Shell are the two largest
industrial companies in Britain in terms of
turnover.
Land-based Fields
1979. In addition to minor production from
various mining licensees, other onshore fields
include Humbly Grove and Stockbridge
(Hampshire), Palmers Wood (Surrey),
Nettleham and Welton (Lincolnshire), and
Wareham (Dorset). Small, independent
companies play an increasingly prominent
role in onshore exploration. At the end of
1991, 194 landward petroleum licences were
in force, covering an area of 29,647 sq km
(11,447 sq miles).
Refineries
At the beginning of 1992 the distillation
capacity of Britain’s 11 major oil refineries
stood at 90 million tonnes a year. Excess crude
distillation capacity has largely been
eliminated, while existing refineries have been
adapted to the changing pattern of demand by
the construction of upgrading facilities (for
example, ‘catalytic crackers’), which are
leading to a higher output of lighter products,
mainly petrol, at the expense of fuel oil.
Onshore production of crude oil is much less
significant than offshore production. In 1991,
however, it increased by 110 per cent to 3 7
million tonnes, 85 per cent of which came
from Britain’s largest onshore field at Wytch
Farm (Dorset), which started production in

kerosene, 19-3 million tonnes of gas and
diesel oil (including derv fuel used in road
vehicles), and 12-1 million tonnes of fuel oil.
Virtually all exports went to Britain’s
partners in the European Community and the
IEA, the largest markets being the Nether¬
lands, France, Germany, Canada and the
United States. Though self-sufficient, Britain
continues to import other crude oils, to
enable the full range of petroleum products
to be made efficiently and economically.
Oil Pipelines
Oil pipelines brought ashore about 74 per
cent of offshore oil in 1991. Some 1,934 km
(1,202 miles) of major submarine pipeline
bring oil ashore from the North Sea oilfields.
Major crude oil onshore pipelines in
operation from harbours, land terminals or
offshore moorings to refineries include those
connecting Grangemouth to Finnart, Cruden
Bay to Grangemouth, and Purbeck to
Southampton. Onshore pipelines also carry
refined products to major marketing areas;
for example, a 423-km (263-mile) pipeline
runs from Milford Haven to the Midlands
and Manchester, while similar pipelines also
run from Fawley to Wolverhampton and
from Lindsey to north London. Chemical
pipelines include one from Mossmorran to
Grangemouth and another (405 km—252
miles) from Grangemouth to Stanlow.
GAS
Public supply of manufactured gas in Britain
began in the early nineteenth century in
central London. For many years gas was
produced from coal, but during the 1960s
growing imports of oil brought about
production of town gas from oil-based
feedstocks. Following the first commercial
natural gas discovery in the UKCS in 1965
and the start of offshore gas production in
1967, supplies of offshore natural gas grew
rapidly and by 1977 natural gas had replaced
town gas in the public supply system in
Great Britain. Some £12,000 million has
been spent on developing natural gas
resources on the UKCS and over 840,000
million cubic metres have been produced.
Structure
The gas industry in Great Britain, in state
ownership since 1949, was privatised in 1986.
British Gas pic supplies gas to consumers in
accordance with its authorisation as a public
gas supplier under the Gas Act 1986. It is
currently the only public gas supplier. It has,
however, an obligation to act as a common
carrier for other companies. There are
currently eight independent companies which
supply gas in competition with British Gas,
using the company’s transport network. The
regulatory regime for the private gas sector
was established by the Gas Act 1986 and
places responsibility on the Office of Gas
Supply (Ofgas) for ensuring that British Gas
is operating within the terms of its
authorisation as a public gas supplier. The
Act also established the Gas Consumers’
Council, independent of both British Gas and
Ofgas, and responsible for investigating
consumer complaints.
British Gas has about 21 million private
and institutional shareholders. In 1991 the
turnover of British Gas and its subsidiary
companies amounted to £10,485 million, of
which gas supply in Britain accounted for
£8,423 million. Current cost operating profit
was £1,673 million. British Gas has just over
74,000 employees in Britain.
Production
In 1991 indigenous production of natural gas
amounted to 55,242 million cubic metres.
This included 3,444 million cubic metres of
gas used for drilling, production and
pumping operations on North Sea production
platforms and at terminals. Total sales of
UKCS gas amounted to 52,000 million cubic
metres—1L9 per cent higher than in 1990. In
addition, 7,000 million cubic metres of gas
were imported from Norway. British
production of gas accounts for some 20 per
cent of total primary fuel consumption in
Britain. Natural gas from the seven largest of
the 35 gasfields—Leman, Indefatigable,
Ravenspurn North, Hewett and Della,
Vulcan, Audrey, and Victor—accounted for
about one-third of the total gas produced in
the UKCS. In addition to supplies from
283
ENERGY AND NATURAL RESOURCES
gasfields, associated gas delivered to land via
the Far North Liquids and Associated Gas
System (FLAGS) and from Alwyn North
made further significant contributions. Gas
from the South Morecambe field in the Irish
Sea and from the twin North Sean and South
Sean fields is used to augment supplies to
meet peak demand in winter.
Reserves
Remaining recoverable gas reserves are
estimated at between 540,000 million and
L8 million million cubic metres. If possible
gas from existing discoveries and potential
future discoveries are added, total reserves are
estimated to be in the range of L74 million
million to 4-17 million million cubic metres.
Indigenous offshore natural gas reserves are
likely to meet most of the British demand
well into the next century.
Transmission and Storage
The British Gas national and regional high-
pressure pipeline system of some 17,600 km
(11,100 miles) transports natural gas around
Great Britain. It is supplied from four North
Sea shore terminals, and from a terminal in
Barrow-in-Furness (Cumbria). The high-
pressure transmission system is inspected
regularly.
Newly built natural gas pipelines, not
operated by British Gas, run from Horndean
to Barking and from Theddlethorpe to
Killingholme.
Various methods of storage of natural gas
to meet peak load conditions are used,
including salt cavities and storage facilities for
liquefied natural gas. British Gas has also
developed the partially depleted Rough field
as a major gas store. This, the first such use
of an offshore field, involves the injection into
the Rough reservoir in summer of gas drawn
from the national transmission system for
recovery at high rates during periods of peak
winter demand.
Consumption
Sales of gas by the supply industry in Britain
totalled 20,220 million therms in 1991. About
31 per cent of all gas sold by British Gas to
its 18 million consumers is for industrial and
commercial purposes, the remainder being for
domestic use.
Gas is used extensively in industries
requiring the control of temperatures to a
fine degree of accuracy, such as the pottery
industry, and in certain processes for making
iron and steel products.
In 1991, 5,284 million therms of gas were
sold to industry in Britain, and 3,457 million
therms to commercial and other non¬
domestic users. An increasingly large part of
domestic demand is for gas for central
heating. In 1991, 11,479 million therms were
sold to domestic users.
Research
British Gas has a worldwide reputation for
gas technology, with a research programme
costing £90 million in 1991. It is involved in
joint research with overseas gas companies.
Its technology transfer group is assisting
utilities in over 20 countries in transmission,
distribution and other areas. British Gas is
today exploring for and producing gas and oil
in some 20 countries.
Competition in Gas Marketing
The gas market in Britain is being
progressively liberalised. Following a review
by the Office of Fair Trading of
competition in the industrial and
commercial gas market in Britain, British Gas
gave undertakings in 1992 designed to
increase competition. It agreed to reduce its
share of the industrial and commercial
contract gas market from 95 per cent to 40
per cent in 1995 and to set up a separate
transportation and storage unit. The
Government signalled its intention in 1992
to reduce British Gas’s statutory
monopoly threshold in the supply market,
thus enabling smaller industrial and com¬
mercial users to benefit from competition.
COAL
Coalmining in Britain can be traced back to
Roman times. It played a crucial part in the
285
BRITAIN 1993: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
industrial revolution of the eighteenth and
nineteenth centuries. In its peak year, 1913,
the industry produced 292 million tonnes of
coal, exported 74 million tonnes and
employed over 1 million workers. In 1947 the
coalmines passed into public ownership, and
the National Coal Board (now the British
Coal Corporation) was set up. The
Government has introduced legislation to
privatise the coal industry. It has also
reduced the debt under which the industry
was operating and eliminated accumulated
liabilities incurred by British Coal.
British Coal Corporation
British Coal has, with limited exceptions,
exclusive rights over the extraction of coal in
Great Britain. It is empowered to license
private operators to work mines with an
employee limit of 150 and opencast sites with
a production limit of 250,000 tonnes, so that
underground and opencast deposits too small
for British Coal to work can be usefully
exploited. It also has powers to work other
minerals, where discoveries are made in the
course of searching for, or working, coal;
and to engage in certain petrochemicals
activities beneficial to the future of the coal
industry.
Production
Rationalisation of the industry in recent years
has entailed British Coal improving its
productivity and reducing costs to ensure
effective competition. Increases in
productivity (reaching some 6 tonnes in one
manshift) have been accompanied by a
programme of pit closures. In 1991—92 total
output of 911 million tonnes comprised
71 million tonnes of deep-mined coal,
16-7 million tonnes from opencast mines and
3 4 million tonnes from licensed mines. In
March 1992, there were 50 British Coal
collieries in operation and 44,000 miners
(compared with 850 and 695,000 in 1955).
Coal capacity is being reduced and British
Coal is to close ten more pits in 1992-93.
British Coal Opencast also had 58 sites in
operation at the end of March 1992. Since
1984, British Coal, through its job creation
activity, British Coal Enterprise, has helped
create job opportunities for 76,500 people in
areas where mining was previously the main
source of employment.
Development
Britain’s coal industry is the largest hard-
coal industry in Western Europe, and one of
the world’s most technologically advanced.
British Coal has a substantial investment
programme, which amounted to £286
million in 1991-92. Technical progress has
been concentrated on equipment capable of
obtaining higher output from fewer faces.
By mid-1992, 79 per cent of all coal faces
were equipped with heavy duty supports
available across the full range of seam
thicknesses. Production at the new mining
complex at Selby in North Yorkshire (one
of the world’s most advanced deep mines)
is planned at up to 10 million tonnes
a year.
Significant reserves of lignite (brown
coal) have been discovered in Northern
Ireland in the clay basins around Lough
Neagh and at Ballymoney. Companies under
government licence are prospecting to
determine their extent, possibly over 1,000
million tonnes.
Consumption
In 1991-92 inland consumption of coal was
105 million tonnes, of which 76-7 per cent
was by power stations, 9-5 per cent by coke
ovens and 5 per cent by domestic users.
With a substantial proportion of coal being
used by power stations for electricity
generation, British Coal sales of coal to
them totalled 73 million tonnes in 1991-92.
Exports of coal in 1991-92 were L4 million
tonnes, while imports amounted to 20
million tonnes.
Research
The Government’s and British Coal’s
principal research objective is to make the
burning of coal more environmentally
acceptable. It aims to reduce emissions of
sulphur dioxide, nitrogen oxides (NOx),
286

CO2 and other gases associated with the
greenhouse effect. The British Coal topping
cycle development programme is designed to
improve the efficiency of combined cycle
power generation to 45 per cent. It offers a
20 per cent reduction in CO2 emissions from
coal-fired power stations. Further studies into
combined cycle power plant worked by coal
gasification have been possible through the
British Coal gasification development
programme. A number of projects aimed at
reducing NOx emissions in pulverised coal
combustion have government support, some
in collaboration with the IEA.
Over £500 million has been spent by
the public sector in Britain on coal
utilisation research and development
since the early 1980s. Some £1,000
million has been spent if all coal
research and development work were
to be included.
The coal liquefaction plant at Point of Ayr
(Clwyd), opened in 1990 and costing £40
million, converts 2 5 tonnes of coal a day into
petrol, diesel and other transport fuels. The
Government will also be considering the
work carried out by its coal task force, which
reviewed clean coal technologies and
technologies aimed at maximising
economically recoverable coal from Great
Britain’s coal reserves.
ELECTRICITY
In 1990-91 certain parts of the electricity
supply industry were restructured and sold.
Restructuring after Privatisation
The privatised electricity supply industry in
England and Wales consists of three main
generating companies, the National Grid
Company (NGC) and 12 regional electricity
companies (RECs). The two main non¬
nuclear generators, National Power and
PowerGen, the publicly owned nuclear
generator, Nuclear Electric pic, and other
generators and importers sell electricity to
suppliers through a market known as the
pool. The NGC operates the transmission
system—the bulk transfer of electricity
across the national grid—and owns the
pumped storage stations at Dinorwig and
Ffestiniog. It is owned by the RECs through
a holding company. Distribution and supply
of electricity are the business of the RECs.
Distribution involves transfer of electricity
from the national grid and its delivery,
across local systems, to consumers. Supply is
the sale of electricity to customers. Each
REC is authorised to supply any premises
within its area. Other companies may obtain
a second-tier licence to supply, although
initially competition is limited to premises
with a maximum consumption of 1 MW.
The Government retains approximately
40 per cent of the issued ordinary share
capital of each of National Power and
PowerGen, and will not sell, or otherwise
dispose of, this holding before 1 April 1993.
Restructuring in Scotland created three
companies. Two vertically integrated
companies, Scottish Power pic and Scottish
Hydro-Electric pic, generate, transmit,
distribute and supply electricity. They are
also contracted to buy all the output from
Scottish Nuclear Ltd, a government-owned
company which operates the nuclear power
stations at Hunterston (Strathclyde) and
Torness (Lothian), and have contracts to
share the output from each other’s
generation capacity. Opportunities exist to
export and import electricity to and from
the pool (see above). The boundary
separating the Scottish Power and Scottish
Hydro-Electric supply areas runs from Loch
Long on the Firth of Clyde to Newburgh on
the Firth of Tay.
Certain service and co-ordinating
functions for the industry are undertaken by
the Electricity Association, jointly owned by
the electricity companies of Great Britain.
Regulation of the industry is the
responsibility of the Office of Electricity
Regulation, headed by the Director General
of Electricity Supply, whose duties include
the promotion of competition and the
protection of consumer interests.
Generation, transmission and supply of
electricity in Northern Ireland have hitherto
been carried out by Northern Ireland
Electricity, a public corporation.

Note: Differences between totals and the sums of their component parts are due to rounding.
Privatisation of the industry is under way: the
trade sale of Northern Ireland’s four power
stations is complete and the flotation of the
transmission and supply system (NIE pic) is
due to take place late in 1992.
Consumption
In 1991 sales of electricity through the
distribution system in Britain amounted to
277,550 gigawatt3 hours (GWh). Domestic
users took 36 per cent of the total, industry
34 per cent and commercial and other users
the remainder. About 24 per cent of domestic
sales is for space heating, 13 per cent for
water heating and 8 per cent for cooking.
Electricity is used in industry mainly for
motive power, melting, heating and lighting.

National Power owns 35 operational fossil-
fuelled power stations which generate about
46 per cent of the electricity supplied to the
transmission and distribution networks in
England and Wales. PowerGen owns 19
fossil-fuelled power stations which generate
about 30 per cent of this electricity. The 12
nuclear stations of Nuclear Electric generate
approximately 17 per cent.
In 1991-92, 40 per cent of electricity
supplied in Scotland was produced by
3 1 GW = 1,000 MW.
Scottish Nuclear’s two stations. The power
stations operated by Scottish Power and
Hydro-Electric provided most of the balance.
Scottish Power has 15 power stations and in
1991-92 its three coal-fired stations produced
50 2 per cent of the electricity supplied in its
area, with nuclear power contributing 43-5
per cent. Hydro-Electric has 59 stations
(mostly hydro, but one major oil/gas station),
and in 1991-92 they produced 61 9 per cent
of the electricity supplied in its area, with
nuclear power contributing 22-5 per cent. All
of Scottish Nuclear’s production is sold to
Scottish Power and Hydro-Electric in the
proportions 74 9 per cent and 25-1 per cent
respectively.
Non-nuclear power stations owned by
Britain’s major generating companies
consumed 69-2 million tonnes of oil
equivalent in 1991, of which coal accounted
for 70 per cent and oil 10 per cent.
Independent generators are allowed to
compete on equal terms with the major
generators and have equal access to the grid
transmission and local distribution systems.
To control acid emissions the Government
expects National Power and PowerGen each
to fit flue gas desulphurisation (FGD)
equipment to 4 GW of their existing coal-
fired power stations. Work is in progress
towards fitting FGD equipment to National
Power’s Drax station (North Yorkshire). For
its part, Scottish Power expects to fit FGD
as necessary at the Longannet station. In

ENERGY AND NATURAL RESOURCES
addition, a ten-year programme to control
NOx emissions through the installation of
low-NOx burners at the 12 largest power
stations in England and Wales, at a cost of
approximately £185 million, is also in
progress. The Scottish companies are
expected to fit low-NOx burners at the main
coal stations.
For new stations the trend is towards the
construction of combined cycle gas turbines
(CCGTs). They are less costly to build than
other types of station, and have shorter
construction times and lower capital costs.
Their use of natural gas, low in sulphur, also
helps to reduce acid and CO2 emissions. The
installation of the more efficient CCGT plant
should also help to stabilise CO2 emissions
from the electricity supply industry. In
England and Wales, nine such stations over
50 MW have been given planning consent
under the Electricity Act 1989. Britain’s first
independent CCGT station, in Cumbria, was
opened in 1991.
The pumped storage station at Dinorwig
(Gwynedd), the largest of its type in Europe,
has an average generated output of
1,728 MW. In pumped storage schemes
electricity generated in off-peak periods is
used to pump water to high-level reservoirs,
from which it descends to drive turbines,
rapidly providing a large supply of electricity
at peak periods or to meet sudden increases
in demand.
The NGC, together with Electricite de
France, runs a 2,000-MW cross-Channel
cable link, providing the capacity for the
transmission of electricity between the two
countries. Transmission lines linking the
Scottish and English grid systems enable
cross-border trading. This interconnector is
run jointly by the NGC and Scottish Power.
Its capacitv is planned to be increased from
850 MW to 1,600 MW by 1994-95. Northern
Ireland Electricity and Scottish Power have
agreed to construct a 250-MW interconnector
between Scotland and Northern Ireland, to
come into operation in 1996.
Nuclear Power
In 1956, the world’s first industrial-scale
nuclear power station, at Calder Hall
(Cumbria), began to supply electricity to the
national grid. There are 14 operating
commercial nuclear power stations that
generate electricity in Britain: seven Magnox
stations (with capacities ranging from 245 to
840 MW) and seven Advanced Gas-cooled
Reactor stations (AGRs; ranging from
720 MW to 1,320 MW). Construction of a
pressurised water reactor (PWR) of 1,175 MW
at Sizewell (Suffolk) is expected to be com¬
pleted in 1994. There are also two Magnox
stations which have been shut down and are
in the process of being decommissioned.
The Government recognises two main
advantages to continued nuclear power
generation: first, it increases diversity of
energy supply and helps maintain its security;
and secondly, it can help curb acid rain and
combat global warming—nuclear stations emit
no SO2, NOx or CO2. The Government
wishes to maintain the nuclear option, but
only if nuclear power becomes more
competitive with other energy sources. It
intends to carry out a full-scale review of
nuclear power in 1994. Meanwhile it and the
industry will take several initiatives, which
will include: improving the efficiency of
nuclear stations; extending the lives of
existing nuclear stations; speeding
investigations into a potential repository for
radioactive waste; a full-scale review of civil
nuclear research and development; and
commissioning further research into the
medical aspects of radiation.
In England and Wales the Government
has introduced a ‘fossil fuel levy’, which is
currently set at 11 per cent, on electricity
sales. Most of the revenue raised is used to
pay a premium to nuclear generators, as the
cost of producing energy from nuclear
sources is greater than that of producing it
from fossil fuel sources. The premium is,
however, set to be phased out by 1998, by
which time it is hoped that nuclear power
generation will be economically competitive.
British Nuclear Fuels
British Nuclear Fuels pic (BNFL) provides
services covering the whole nuclear fuel
cycle. All of its shares are held by the
Government. The company, with
291
BRITAIN 1993: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
headquarters at Risley (Cheshire), conducts
operations at four further sites: Springfields
(Lancashire), where fuel is manufactured;
Capenhurst (Cheshire), where uranium is
enriched to provide fuel for nuclear reactors;
Sellafield (Cumbria), where spent fuel is
reprocessed and where Calder Hall is located;
and Chapelcross Magnox power station
(Dumfries and Galloway).
A substantial investment programme is in
progress, mainly at Sellafield. BNFL’s major
project is the thermal oxide reprocessing
plant (THORP), construction of which has
now been completed at a cost of some
£2,800 million, including its share of
associated facilities. THORP will reprocess
spent fuel from British and overseas oxide
reactors and is expected to start operations
early in 1993. At the same time, BNFL will
bring into operation the latest of its waste
management and effluent treatment facilities.
The enhanced actinide removal plant (EARP)
will use a revolutionary ultrafiltration process
to provide further treatment facilities for low-
level radioactive waste.
Nuclear Research
The nuclear research and development
funded by the Department of Trade and
Industry is carried out by the United
Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority’s
(UKAEA) nine semi-autonomous businesses,
which operate as AEA Technology. The work
is carried out at six sites: Harwell and
Culham (Oxfordshire), Risley, Winfrith
(Dorset), Windscale (Cumbria) and Dounreay
(Highland). In addition, safety research is
carried out by AEA Safety and Reliability at
Culcheth (Cheshire).
Co-operation on nuclear energy between
Britain and other countries takes place within
a framework of intergovernmental agreements
and membership of bodies such as the
International Atomic Energy Agency and the
Nuclear Energy Agency, as well as through
direct links on research between AEA
Technology and equivalent organisations
overseas.
Britain takes part in the co-operative
research programmes of the European Atomic
Energy Community (Euratom).
Under an agreement with its French and
German counterparts, AEA Technology is
carrying out research and development work
for the European fast reactor collaboration.
The detailed design phase of this
collaboration, sponsored by the utilities in
Britain, France and Germany, is due to be
completed in 1993.
A major component of this
programme is the Joint European
Torus (JET) project at Culham, which
started operating in 1983. In 1991 it
successfully carried out an experiment
which, it is claimed, demonstrates the
scientific feasibility of thermonuclear
fusion. The JET device, called a
Tokamak, is reported to have
produced an energy release equivalent
to 1 MW for two seconds.
Nuclear Safety
Britain has a rigorous system of nuclear safety
regulation, enforced by the Health and Safety
Executive’s Nuclear Installations Inspectorate,
which ensures that high standards of safety
are incorporated into the design, construction,
operation, maintenance, decommissioning of
all nuclear plant, and eventual disposal of
resulting wastes. While the safety of such
plant in Britain is the ultimate responsibility
of the nuclear operator, the Inspectorate has
extensive powers. An operator must satisfy it
before a licence is granted. Operators must
protect their workers and the public by
complying with the Health and Safety at
Work etc. Act 1974, as well as with the
conditions of their nuclear site licences under
the Nuclear Installations Act 1965. The
Inspectorate has the power to shut down a
plant if it is believed to be unsafe and may
also require improvements to an installation if
it thinks the appropriate safety standards are
not being met.
Discharges have to be kept within the
limits and conditions set by authorisations
granted under the Radioactive Substances Act
1960. In England and Wales separate
authorisations are required from the
Secretaries of State for the Environment and
for Wales, and from the Minister of
292
ENERGY AND NATURAL RESOURCES
Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, and in
Scotland from the Secretary of State for
Scotland. Within maximum dose limits,
operators of nuclear facilities are required to
keep discharges as low as is reasonably
achievable and failure to do so makes them
liable to prosecution. Compliance with the
legislation is overseen by Her Majesty’s
Inspectorate of Pollution in England and
Wales, and by Her Majesty’s Industrial
Pollution Inspectorate in Scotland.
On nuclear safety, Britain has a number of
bilateral agreements and arrangements, with,
for example, France and the United States,
covering the exchange of information relating
to all matters affecting nuclear safety.
International conventions have been
established on the early notification of a
nuclear accident with possible transboundary
effects, and on the mutual provision of
assistance in the event of a nuclear accident
or radiological emergency.
Emergency Plans
The precautions taken in the design and
construction of nuclear installations in
Britain, and the high safety standards in their
operation and maintenance, reduce the chance
of accidents which might affect the public to
an extremely low level. However, all
operators are required, as a condition of their
site licences, to prepare emergency plans,
including those for dealing with an accidental
release of radioactivity, which are regularly
tested in exercises under the supervision of
the Nuclear Installations Inspectorate.
Research on Electricity
Research and development are a matter for
the individual companies, but some research
is carried out jointly. National Power and
PowerGen maintain a joint environmental
programme. Technological research on
generation and main transmission is
undertaken primarily by the generating
companies and by the NGC. A new
company, EA Technology, has been created
to carry out research and development
programmes on behalf of the electricity
industry. It is based at Capenhurst.
RENEWABLE SOURCES OF ENERGY
The Department of Trade and Industry
supports research, development and
demonstration in the renewable energy
technologies. It aims to exploit alternative
sources of energy which have the potential to
be economically viable and environmentally
acceptable. It also encourages industry to
develop both internal and export markets. Its
current programme includes some 350
projects with a financial commitment of
£87 million. Work is at present concentrated
on the most promising technologies.
The Government is aiming at a figure of
1,000 MW of electricity generation capacity
from renewable energy by the year 2000. In
1990 and 1991 Orders under the non-fossil
fuel obligation in England and Wales allowed
for 197 renewable energy projects, with a
declared net capacity of 559 MW.
The Government is reviewing its
renewable energy strategy. As part of that
process, a ministerial advisory group has
been formed to provide an independent
comment on the overall review. The group’s
members are drawn from the renewables
industry, business, management and academic
life.
Wind Power
Wind power remains one of the most
promising technologies. The Government’s
research and development programme into
wind power has cost more than £40 million
over ten years. Expenditure is running at
about £6 million a year. The programme for
1991-92 initiated some 25 new projects and
managed 100 projects.
If wind development programmes are
successful, it is thought that Britain could
generate the equivalent of about 10 per cent
of current electricity consumption from wind
power by the year 2025.
Among the projects supported by the
Government are:
• two vertical-axis wind turbines,
inaugurated in 1986 and 1990 at
Carmarthen Bay (Dyfed);
• a 300-kW turbine also at Carmarthen
Bay;
293
BRITAIN 1993: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
• a 3-MW, 60-m (200-ft) turbine, in
collaboration with Scottish Hydro-
Electric, on Orkney, inaugurated in 1987;
• a 1-MW, 55-m (180-ft) diameter turbine
at Richborough (Kent), inaugurated in
1990; and
• two 300-kW turbines at the National
Wind Turbine Centre (East Kilbride),
opened in 1991.
Plans for experimental wind farms are
progressing. The Government has agreed
with National Wind Power to pursue
collaborative projects at Cold Northcott
(Durham) and Llangwyryfan (Powys) which
are scheduled for completion during 1993.
Tidal Power
Tidal power is one of the most promising of
the renewable technologies for large-scale
electricity generation. Its exceptionally high
tidal range makes the Severn estuary one of
the best potential sites in the world. The
Government has funded, with the Severn
Tidal Power Group and the electricity supply
industry, a £4-2 million study into the
viability of a Severn tidal barrage (16 km—10
miles), of which a general report has been
published. The Government has contributed
about £900,000 towards further
environmental, regional and financing studies.
Government grants of some £5 million on
three phases of studies, and £12 million on a
15-month extension of the third phase, have
gone towards an energy barrage on the
Mersey estuary.
Solar Power
The Government continues support for a
solar programme and the Best Practice
programme of the EEO encourages the
technology.
Recent advances in photovoltaics—in
which treated glass plates convert sunlight
directly into electricity—have suggested that
photovoltaic materials incorporated into the
cladding and roofing of buildings could
provide competitive electricity generation.
The Government is supporting a two-year
assessment of photovoltaics, costing
£250,000.
Passive solar design is considered the
best way to utilise solar energy in
Britain and has already proved cost-
effective in both domestic and non¬
domestic buildings, using their form
and fabric to admit, store and
distribute solar energy for heating and
for improving daylight.
Biofuels
Biofuels offer possibly the largest
contribution from the renewable energy
resources in the medium term. The main
work of the government programme is on the
combustion of wastes, anaerobic digestion
(particularly as applied to the production and
use of landfill gas) and energy forestry.
Britain is the largest user of landfill gas as an
energy source in the European Community,
and is second only to the United States in its
exploitation.
Wave Energy
Britain’s first shoreline wave energy system
was inaugurated in 1991 on the island of
Islay. The small-scale gulley device was
constructed from 1985 by the Queen’s
University of Belfast, which is carrying out a
complementary study to assess the potential
for shoreline devices in Britain. The system
is rated at 75 kW and is connected to the
local grid.
Small-scale Hydro
Small-scale hydro power was the original
energy source for the industrial revolution in
the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. The
Government urges organisations interested in
small-scale hydro-electricity generation to
take advantage of government assistance in
funding feasibility studies.
Geothermal Energy
Under its geothermal hot dry rock
programme (during 1976-91), the
Government investigated, through work
carried out in Cornwall by the Camborne
School of Mines, the economic possibilities of
294
INWARD INVESTMENT
Overseas firms invest more in
Britain than in any other
European country. In 1991-92
foreign-owned companies
made a total of 332 decisions
to invest in Britain. These
include the Japanese company
Mitsubishi Electric, with a
factory at Livingston,
Scotland, and Robert Bosch,
a German company which
makes alternators for the motor
car industry, in South
Glamorgan, Wales.
The Forth Railway Bridge,
built between 1883 and 1890,
is one of the marvels of
Victorian railway engineering
and was the world’s first
major structure built entirely
of steel. The road bridge,
seen here in the distance,
was built between 1958 and
1964.
The Craigavon Bridge in
Londonderry, Northern
Ireland, is made of steel and
consists of two ‘decks’ over
which traffic flows. It was
opened in 1933, and is
named after Northern
Ireland’s first Prime
Minister.
The Pontecysyllte Aqueduct,
near Llangollen, north Wales, is
one of the masterpieces of the
Scottish engineer Thomas
Telford (1757-1834). The span
carries the Ellesmere Canal over
the River Dee at a height of
some 127 feet.
The Queen Elizabeth II
Bridge, which carries traffic
over the Thames between
Dartford in Kent and
Thurrock in Essex, is the
longest cable-stayed bridge in
Europe. The bridge, which
was officially opened in
October 1991, cost £86
million at 1986 prices; it was
Britain’s first privately funded
major road scheme.
THE WATER SUPPLY INDUSTRY
The water supply industry in
England and Wales is
committed to a ten-year
investment programme costing
over £28,000 million. To meet
the growing demand for water in
London, Thames Water is
constructing an 80-km (50-mile)
distribution system, due to be
completed in 1996.
Kielder Water, Northumberland,
was built at a cost of £167
million in 1982. It is one of the
largest artificial reservoirs in
Europe.
ENERGY AND NATURAL RESOURCES
extracting heat from rocks at a depth of 2 to
6 km (1-25 to 4 miles). It has concluded that
further funding should go largely towards
participating in a joint programme with
France, Germany and the European
Community, which could resolve some of the
technical uncertainties.
Non-fuel Minerals
Although much of Britain’s requirements for
industrial raw materials is met by imports,
non-fuel minerals produced in Britain make
an important contribution to the economy.
Output of non-fuel minerals in 1990 totalled
over 318 million tonnes, valued at
£1,993 million. The total number of
employees in the extractive industry was
some 47,700 in 1990.
Exploration
Exploration for, and exploitation of,
indigenous mineral resources to meet the
needs of industry are encouraged by the
Government. The British Geological Survey
is carrying out a long-term programme for
the Department of Trade and Industry aimed
at identifying areas with the potential for the
economic extraction of minerals. Exploration
for gold, for example, continues, especially in
Scotland, Northern Ireland and south-west
England.
Production
In terms of value, production of limestone
and dolomite was estimated at £594 million
in 1990, sand and gravel £543 million, clays
£270 million, igneous rock £241 million,
sandstone £78 million, potash £63 million,
chalk £48 million, silica sands £43 million,
salt £37 million, gypsum and anhydrite
£22 million, fuller’s earth £15 million,
fluorspar £13 million and tin £11 million. In
1990 the production of metals in non-ferrous
ores totalled 12,500 tonnes, mainly tin and
zinc from Cornwall. The two remaining
Cornish mines, one of the very few sources
of tin in the European Community, produced
some 3,500 tonnes in 1990, satisfying about
half of Britain’s demand. Wheal Jane mine
was closed early in 1991. South Crofty mine
continues in production. Small amounts of
copper and silver were produced in
association with tin and zinc, and some lead
and zinc with barytes and fluorspar. A little
gold came from a mine in north Wales.

ENERGY AND NATURAL RESOURCES
Water
Britain’s water supplies are obtained partly
from surface sources such as mountain lakes,
streams impounded in upland gathering
grounds and lowland river intakes, and partly
from underground sources by means of wells,
springs, adits and boreholes. About 99 per
cent of the population in Great Britain and
97 per cent in Northern Ireland are
connected to the public water supply system.
Water put into the public supply system in
England and Wales amounted to about
17,370 megalitres (Ml) a day in 1990-91 and
average daily domestic consumption per head
was 140 litres.
Some 35,250 Ml a day were abstracted in
England and Wales in 1990, of which public
water supplies accounted for 18,336 Ml a
day. The electricity generating companies and
other industry took some 16,400 Ml a day.
Agriculture took just over 500 Ml a day.
England and Wales
The Water Act 1989 privatised the utility
functions of the ten former water authorities
in England and Wales. It provided for the
Secretaries of State for the Environment and
for Wales, the Director General of Water
Services and the National Rivers Authority
(NRA) to be the principal regulators of the
industry. The Minister of Agriculture,
Fisheries and Food and the Secretary of State
for Wales are responsible for policy relating
to land drainage, flood protection, sea
defence, and the protection and development
of fisheries. The Drinking Water Inspectorate
was set up to regulate drinking water quality.
Water Companies
The ten water service companies are the
principal operating subsidiaries of the ten
water holding companies. They have
statutory responsibilities for water supply,
sewerage and sewage treatment, and for
ensuring adequate supplies. The supply-only
companies, of which there were already 29 in
the private sector in 1989, supply water to
about a quarter of the population.
The Water Industry Act 1991 allows the
water companies to determine their own
methods of charging. At present most charges
are based on the former rateable value
system, although customers may choose to
pay to have a water meter installed. In
general, companies require new properties to
have metered supplies. An alternative to the
system based on rateable values, however,
must be found by the year 2000. Wide-scale
water metering is one of the choices being
considered.
A system of economic regulation and
guaranteed standards of service is overseen by
the Director General of Water Services. The
Water Supply (Water Quality) Regulations
1989 define wholesomeness and incorporate
the requirements of the European
Community’s drinking water directive. They
impose physical, chemical and microbiological
standards for water intended for domestic
and food production purposes. The task of
the Drinking Water Inspectorate is to ensure
that drinking water is wholesome and that
companies comply with the Regulations. Of
3 3 million tests carried out in 1990, 99 per
cent came within the legal limits.
National Rivers Authority
The NRA, the environmental regulator, is a
non-departmental public body with statutory
duties and powers in relation to water
resources, pollution control, flood defence,
fisheries, recreation, conservation and
navigation in England and Wales. The water
environment for which it has responsibility
includes all rivers, lakes, reservoirs, estuaries,
coastal waters and water stored naturally
underground. The NRA’s consent is needed
for the abstraction of water and for
discharges to water.
Development Projects
The water industry in England and Wales is
committed to a ten-year investment
programme costing over £28,000 million at
1989-90 prices. Thames Water is
constructing an 80-km (50-mile) distribution
system to meet the growing demand for
water in London. This is due to be
completed in 1996. North West Water has a
297
BRITAIN 1993: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
major 25-year programme of investment to
clean up the polluted rivers of the Mersey
Basin.
Water is an increasingly scarce resource.
The industry, through contingency planning
and publicity campaigns, aims to encourage
the wise use of water, especially when
supplies run low because of prolonged warm,
dry weather. A national review of water
consumption and conservation, prompted by
the drought in south-east England which
began in 1988, has been put in hand by the
Government. The NRA has published a
survey of the prospects for public water
supplies to the year 2011 in England and
Wales. It is investigating the strategic
development of water resources, including
major new transfer schemes, and is
reviewing the possibilities of a national grid
and desalination. The Government has
issued a consultation paper about possible
ways of augmenting water resources in
England and Wales; measures that might be
taken to cut waste and reduce usage; and
ways of controlling demand.
Scotland
In Scotland responsibility for public water
supply, sewerage and sewage disposal rests
with the nine regional and three islands
councils (‘the water authorities’). In addition,
the Central Scotland Water Development
Board is responsible for developing new
sources of supply to provide water in bulk to
the regional councils in an area of
25,900 sq km (10,000 sq miles) in central
Scotland. The Secretary of State for
Scotland is responsible for promoting
conservation of water resources and
provision by water authorities and water
development boards of adequate water
supplies. He has a duty to promote the
cleanliness of rivers and other inland waters,
and the tidal waters of Scotland. River
purification authorities have a statutory
responsibility for water pollution control.
Water is charged for according to type of
consumer: domestic consumers pay
community water charges (from April 1993,
council water charges); non-domestic
consumers pay by means of non-domestic
water rates, or through metered charges.
Charges and rates are decided by each
authority.
Scotland has a relative abundance of
unpolluted water from upland sources. An
average of 2,301 Ml a day was supplied in
Scotland in 1990-91.
Northern Ireland
The Department of the Environment for
Northern Ireland is responsible for public
water supply and sewerage throughout
Northern Ireland. It is also responsible for
the conservation and cleanliness of water
resources and, with the Department of
Agriculture for Northern Ireland, may
prepare a water management programme with
respect to water resources in any area. There
is a domestic water charge which is contained
in the regional rate, while agriculture,
commerce and industry pay metered charges.
There are abundant potential supplies of
water for both domestic and industrial use.
An average of 681 Ml of water a day was
supplied in 1990-91.
Research
Several organisations and centres of expertise
provide water research services to
government, the NRA, water companies and
the Scottish river purification boards. The
Water Research Centre, a private company,
has a large programme of research into, for
example, environmental issues and drinking
water safety. Research carried out by
institutes of the Natural Environment
Research Council embraces river modelling,
water quality, climate change effects on
resources and the impact of pollution on
freshwater. Among its various roles the
Institute of Hydrology studies the statistics of
floods and droughts.

16 Agriculture, Fisheries
and Forestry
Agriculture
British agriculture is noted for its high level
of efficiency and productivity. In 1991 it
employed 21 per cent of the total workforce
and Britain was self-sufficient in 58 per cent
of all types of food and animal feed. It was
self-sufficient in nearly 74 per cent of
indigenous-type food and feed. Food, feed
and beverages accounted for over 10 per cent
of Britain’s imports by value in 1991,
compared with about a quarter in the 1960s.
The agricultural contribution to gross
domestic product was £6,324 million in 1991,
about 13 per cent of the total. Britain is also
a major exporter of agricultural produce and
food products, agrochemicals and agricultural
machinery.
The Government aims to foster an
efficient and competitive agriculture industry
through the provision and sponsorship of
research, development and advisory services;
the provision of financial support where
appropriate; measures to control disease, pests
and pollution; and improved marketing
arrangements for food and food products. It
also insists on high standards of animal
welfare. Agriculture ministers must balance
the needs of an efficient agricultural industry
with other interests in the countryside. These
include conservation of its natural beauty and
promotion of its enjoyment by the public.
Land Use
The area of agricultural land has been
declining, although there has been a reduction
in the net rate of loss in recent years. In 1991
there were just under 11-9 million hectares
(29-3 million acres) under crops and grass.
Some 5-9 million hectares (14-6 million acres)
were used for rough grazing, most of it in
hilly areas. Soils vary from the thin poor ones
of highland Britain to the rich fertile soils of
low-lying areas such as the fenlands of
eastern England. The temperate climate and
the relatively even distribution of rainfall over
the year ensure a long growing season;
streams rarely dry up and grassland normally
remains green throughout the year.
Land Use in Britain
Farming
In 1991 there were some 241,000 farm
holdings in Britain (excluding minor
holdings), with an average size of 71 hectares
(175 acres)—again excluding minor holdings.
About two-thirds of all agricultural land is
owner-occupied. About 40 per cent of
holdings are of 4 British Standard Units
(BSUs)1 or less.
The number of people (excluding spouses)
engaged in agriculture in 1991 was about
552,000, compared with 565,000 in 1990 and
an average of 639,000 in 1980-82. The total
for whole-time farmers, partners and
1 BSUs measure the gross income potential of the holding and 4
BSUs is judged to be the minimum size for full-time holdings.

directors in 1991—about 178,300—had
declined from 183,500 in 1990 and from an
average of 206,000 in 1980—82. The number
of farmers, partners and directors working
part-time (100,400 in 1991) has continued to
increase (from 98,100 in 1990 and an average
of 89,000 in 1980-82). Regular whole-time
workers (family and hired) have continued to
decline, to 119,500 in 1991, compared with
125,200 in 1990 and an average of 174,000 in
1980-82. The number of regular part-time
workers (family and hired) remained at about
the same level as in 1990, at some 58,700,
compared with an average of 63,000 in
1980-82.
Labour productivity has increased by 51
per cent over the last ten years. Total
income from farming (that of farmers,
partners, directors and their spouses) was
£2,168 million in 1991, 6 per cent less than
in 1990.
At the end of 1990 the industry’s capital
stock amounted to some £23,710 million
(compared with £24,000 million at the end
of 1989), of which buildings and works
made up nearly two-thirds. The overall
stock of fixed capital is estimated to be at a
similar level to the average for 1980-82.
There were over 400,000 tractors and over
40,000 combine harvesters in use during
1988-89.
PRODUCTION
Home production of the principal foods is
shown in Table 16.1 as a percentage by
weight of total supplies (that is, production
plus imports minus exports).
Livestock
Over half of full-time farms are devoted
mainly to dairying or beef cattle and sheep.
The majority of sheep and cattle are reared
in the hill and moorland areas of Scotland,
Wales, Northern Ireland and northern and
south-western England. Beef fattening
occurs partly in better grassland areas, as
does dairying, and partly on arable farms.
British livestock breeders have developed
many of the cattle, sheep and pig breeds
with worldwide reputations, for example, the
Hereford and Aberdeen Angus beef breeds,
the Jersey, Guernsey and Ayrshire dairy
breeds, Large White pigs and a number of
sheep breeds. Because of developments in
artificial insemination and embryo transfer,
Britain is able to export semen and embryos
from high-quality donor animals.
Cattle and Sheep
Most dairy cattle in Britain are bred by
artificial insemination. In 1991 the average
size of dairy herds in Britain was 63
(excluding minor holdings), while the
average yield of milk per dairy cow was

5,143 litres (1,131 gallons). Average
household consumption of liquid (including
low-fat) milk per head in 1991 was 1-09 litres
(1-91 pints) a week.
About two-thirds of home-fed beef
production originates from the national dairy
herd, in which the Friesian breed is
predominant. The remainder is derived from
suckler herds producing high-quality beef
calves in the hills and uplands, where the
traditional British beef breeds, such as
Hereford and Aberdeen Angus, continue to
be important. Imported breeds which have
been established include the Charolais,
Limousin, Simmental and Belgian Blue. In
1991 the size of the beef-breeding herd
continued to expand and reached its
highest level for 14 years. This increase
partially offset the further decrease in the
dairy herd.
Britain has a long tradition of sheep
production, with more than 40 breeds and
many crosses between them. Research has
provided vaccine and serum protection
against nearly all the epidemic diseases.
Although lamb production is the main source
of income for sheep farmers, wool is also
important.
Grass supplies 60 to 80 per cent of the
feed for cattle and sheep. Grass production
has been enhanced by the increased use of
fertilisers, methods of grazing control, and
improved herbage conservation for winter
feed. Rough grazings are used for extensively
grazed sheep and cattle, producing young
animals for fattening elsewhere.
Pigs and Poultry
Pig production occurs in most areas but is
particularly important in eastern and northern
England. There is an increasing concentration
into specialist units and larger herds.
Output of poultry meat has continued to
benefit from better husbandry and genetic
improvements. Production of broilers from
holdings of over 100,000 birds accounts for
over a half of total production. In 1991
British egg production continued to recover
following stringent government measures to
deal with salmonella. Output of hen and duck
eggs rose from 813 million dozen in 1990 to
841 million dozen in 1991. Over two-thirds
of laying birds are on holdings with 20,000 or
more birds. Britain remains broadly self-
sufficient in poultry meat and eggs.
Animal Welfare
The welfare of farm animals is protected by
legislation and it is an offence to cause
unnecessary pain or distress to commercially
reared livestock. For example, there are
regulations requiring owners of intensive
units to arrange for the daily inspection of
their stock and the equipment on which it
depends. There is increased protection for all
livestock, poultry, rabbits and horses at
markets, and specific controls on the
marketing of foals and calves. There are laws
which ban close confinement crates for
keeping veal calves, and which will phase out
tether and close confinement systems for

keeping pigs, and protect animals at slaughter
from unnecessary pain or distress. The Farm
Animal Welfare Council, an independent
body set up by the Government, advises on
any legislative or other changes it considers
necessary. Britain continues to take the lead
in pressing for higher standards of animal
welfare throughout Europe. The
Government’s proposed charter on animal
welfare in the European Community aims to
raise welfare standards.
Crops
The farms devoted primarily to arable crops
are found mainly in eastern and central-
southern England and eastern Scotland. In
Britain in 1991 cereals were grown on 3 52
million hectares (8 7 million acres), compared
with 3-66 million (9.04 million acres) in 1990.
Production of cereals, at 22-7 million tonnes,
was similar to that in 1990. An increase in
plantings of higher-yielding wheat contributed
to increased output—13-2 million tonnes,
compared with 12-9 million tonnes in 1990.
Between 40 and 50 per cent of available
domestic wheat supplies (allowing for imports
and exports) are normally used for flour
milling, and about half for animal feed.
About a third of barley supplies are used for
malting and distilling, and virtually all the
remainder for animal feed.
There was a significant increase in the area
planted to oilseed rape—from 390,000 hectares
(963,700 acres) in 1990 to an estimated
445,000 hectares (11 million acres) in 1991.
Production was about 1-31 million tonnes, a
small increase over 1990 production.
Large-scale potato and vegetable
cultivation is undertaken in the fens (in
Cambridgeshire and south Lincolnshire), the
alluvial areas around the rivers Thames and
Humber, and the peaty lands in south
Lancashire. Early potatoes are an important
crop in Pembrokeshire (Dyfed), Kent and
Cornwall. High-grade seed potatoes are
grown in Scotland and Northern Ireland.
Sugar from home-grown sugar beet
provides just over 60 per cent of
requirements, most of the remainder being
refined from raw cane sugar imported levy-
free from developing countries under the
Lome Convention (see p 373).
Horticulture
In 1991 the land utilised for horticulture
(excluding potatoes) was about 200,000
hectares (494,220 acres). Vegetables grown in
the open accounted for 68 per cent of this,
orchards for 17 per cent, soft fruit for 7 per
cent and ornamentals (including hardy
nursery stock, bulbs and flowers grown in
the open) for 7 per cent. More than one
302
AGRICULTURE, FISHERIES AND FORESTRY
vegetable crop is, in some cases, taken from
the same area of land in a year, so that the
estimated area actually cropped in 1991 was
259,400 hectares (641,000 acres).
Field vegetables account for about one-
third of the value of horticultural output and
are widely grown throughout the country.
Most horticultural enterprises are increasing
productivity with the help of improved
planting material, new techniques and the
widespread use of machinery. Some field
vegetables, for example, are raised in blocks
of compressed peat or loose-filled cells, a
technique which reduces root damage and
allows plants to establish themselves more
reliably and evenly.
Glasshouses are used for growing
tomatoes, cucumbers, sweet peppers, lettuces,
flowers, pot plants and nursery stock.
Widespread use is made of automatic control
of heating and ventilation, and semi-automatic
control of watering. Energy-efficient
glasshouses use thermal screens, while low-
cost plastic tunnels extend the season for
certain crops previously grown in the open.
Government grants are available for replacing
heated glass and heating systems.
The Government also provides grants for
replanting apple and pear trees. Output of
apples in Britain in 1991 was some 268,000
tonnes, compared with 270,000 tonnes in
1990.
Under the European Community’s
Common Agricultural Policy (see below), a
wide range of horticultural produce is subject
to common quality standards.
Under Community rules, Britain has a
production limit of 2 5 million litres of wine
a year. It is produced in southern England
and south Wales. A pilot Quality Wine
Scheme was launched by the Government for
the 1991 vintage.

Organic Farming
The Government aims to establish a
framework in which organic farming in
Britain can respond to consumer demand.
The organic sector is eligible for the support
given to all farmers under a number of
general schemes. Other support includes a
significant commitment to research and
development.
The United Kingdom Register of Organic
Food Standards (UKROFS) is an
independent body set up in 1987 with
government support. It has established
national voluntary standards for organic food
production tied to a certification and
inspection scheme. It is also responsible for
enforcing the Community regulation on
organic foodstuffs, adopted in June 1991,
which sets production, processing and
labelling standards for organic produce within
the Community.
FOOD SAFETY
Government spending on programmes to
promote food safety and against diseases
affecting food supply is over £100 million in
1992-93. Its expenditure on food safety
research will total £18-5 million. Recent
investigations have covered the performance
of microwave ovens and the handling of
chilled food.
The Food Safety Directorate within the
Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food
focuses ministry resources on ensuring
adequate supplies of the right kinds of food,
and its safety, wholesomeness and proper
labelling, through regulations and guidelines.
Food safety responsibilities are separated from
food production and agriculture
responsibilities within the Ministry. The
Government^ commitment to food safety was
emphasised by the Food Safety Act 1990,
which ensures food safety and consumer
protection throughout the food chain. It
combines basic provisions with wide enabling
powers, so that detailed regulations made
under the Act can adapt to technological
change and innovation. It also introduces
more effective enforcement powers and
greatly increased penalties for offenders.
The Food Advisory Committee advises
ministers on the exercise of powers relating
to the labelling, composition and chemical
safety of food. The Advisory Committee on
Novel Foods and Processes advises on any
matter relating to the irradiation of food or to
the manufacture of novel foods or foods
produced by novel processes. The Steering
Group on the Chemical Aspects of Food
Surveillance is charged with keeping under
review possible chemical contamination of the
national food supply and monitoring the
intakes of food additives and nutrients. The
Advisory Committee on the Microbiological
Safety of Food advises on matters relating to
this topic and there is also a Steering Group
on the Microbiological Safety of Food.
In addition, a consumer panel—nine
consumer members nominated by the main
consumer organisations, but appointed to
serve as individuals—gives consumers a direct
means of conveying their views on food
safety and consumer protection issues to the
Government.
National regulations to implement
Community measures have also been
introduced. In 1991 these covered exports,
packaging materials in contact with food,
additives, fruit juices and animal feed.
EXPORTS
Today Britain imports about 42 per cent of its
food. The Government encourages the growth
of exports related to agriculture. The volume
of these exports rose in 1991, when their value
amounted to £5,792 million, the main markets
being Western Europe, North America and
the Middle East. Exports include speciality
products such as fresh salmon, Scotch whisky,
biscuits, jams and conserves, as well as beef
and lamb carcasses and cheese.
Food From Britain is an organisation
funded by the Government and industry,
which aims to assist the food and drink
industry in Britain to improve its marketing at
home and overseas. In Britain, it runs
promotional campaigns and quality assurance
schemes among other marketing activities and
works with farmers and producers to develop
market-led enterprises. Through its export
association, the British Food Export Council,
304
AGRICULTURE, FISHERIES AND FORESTRY
and its network of seven overseas offices,
Food From Britain is able to identify market
opportunities, provide introductions to buyers
and arrange in-store promotions. Food From
Britain also co-ordinates the British presence
at major international food and drink trade
exhibitions worldwide. The British
Agricultural Export Committee of the London
Chamber of Commerce represents exporters of
technology, expertise and equipment.
The Agricultural Engineers’ Association
represents exporters of agricultural and
horticultural machinery. In 1991 Britain
exported £2,080 million of farm machinery
and spares.
One of the world’s largest agricultural
events, the annual Royal International
Agricultural Exhibition, held at Stoneleigh in
Warwickshire, provides an opportunity for
visitors to see the latest techniques and
improvements in British agriculture. Over
189,000 visitors attended in 1992, of whom
25,500 were from overseas. Virtually every
British agricultural machinery manufacturer
is represented at the exhibition, which is also
the most important pedigree livestock event
in the country. Other major agricultural
displays include the annual Royal Smithfield
Show, held in London, which exhibits
agricultural machinery, livestock and
carcasses; the Royal Highland Show; the
Royal Welsh Show; and the Royal Ulster
Agricultural Show. There are also important
regional shows.
MARKETING
Agricultural products are marketed by private
traders, producers’ co-operatives and
marketing boards. The latter are producers’
organisations (each including a minority of
independent members appointed by
agriculture ministers) with certain statutory
powers to regulate the marketing of milk,
wool and potatoes. For the most part the
boards buy from producers or control
contracts between producers and first-hand
buyers; the Potato Marketing Board,
however, maintains only a broad control over
marketing conditions, leaving producers free
to deal individually with buyers. For home¬
grown cereals, meat and livestock, apples and
pears, there are marketing organisations
representing producer, distributor and
independent interests.
Food From Britain is responsible for
improving the marketing of food and
agricultural products, both in the domestic
market and abroad. Its quality assurance
schemes guarantee a repeatable quality in a
number of product sectors.
Co-operatives
A substantial amount of agricultural and
horticultural produce, such as grain, fruit and
vegetables, is handled by marketing co¬
operatives, which had a turnover of £2,830
million in 1988. They have been formed to
meet the demand from retailers for a
continuous supply of fresh, quality produce.
Food From Britain provides a range of
advisory services for co-operatives.
ROLE OF THE GOVERNMENT
Four government departments have joint
responsibility—the Ministry of Agriculture,
Fisheries and Food; the Scottish Office
Agriculture and Fisheries Department; the
Welsh Office; and the Department of
Agriculture for Northern Ireland.
Common Agricultural Policy
The European Community’s Common
Agricultural Policy (CAP) accounts for about
two-thirds of the Community’s budget and
aims to ensure stable agricultural markets and
a fair standard of living for agricultural
producers, and to guarantee regular supplies
of food at reasonable prices. For many
commodities minimum prices are set annually
at which agencies of the member states will
purchase products, and there are levies on
imports to maintain internal support prices.
Surpluses are bought by intervention boards
(the Intervention Board executive agency in
Britain) to be stored and sold when
appropriate. Intervention stocks can be
disposed of within the Community where this
can be done without disrupting internal
markets. Exports are facilitated by the
provision of export refunds to bridge any gap
305
BRITAIN 1993: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
between Community prices and world prices.
In some cases, in particular in the beef and
sheep sectors, there are also direct payments
to producers—the suckler cow premium and
the annual premium on ewes.
The support prices, as well as rates of levy,
export refunds and other aids, are set in
European Currency Units and are converted
into the currencies of the member states at
fixed rates of exchange—‘green rates’—which
can be out of line with the market rate of
exchange between each currency and the
European Currency Unit. Monetary compen¬
satory amounts, based on the percentage
difference between the green and market rates
of each currency, are applied to prevent
distortions in trade.
Nearly all the Community’s agricultural
expenditure (£24,105 million in 1991) is
channelled through the European Agricultural
Guidance and Guarantee Fund. The Fund’s
guarantee section finances market support
arrangements, while the guidance section
provides funds for structural reform—for
example, farm modernisation and
investment—and payments to assist certain
farmers to change to alternative enterprises.
Agricultural production under the CAP
has increased considerably in recent years,
reflecting rapid technical progress and
farming efficiency as well as the high level of
Public Expenditure under the CAP

Agricultural Departments

price support. As consumption has remained
relatively stable, this has resulted in the
emergence of surpluses.
Britain has consistently pressed for CAP
reform, to bring supply and demand into
better balance, to increase the role of market
forces in agriculture and to make environ¬
mental considerations an integral part of the
CAP. Since 1988 there has been a legally
binding limit on CAP market support expen¬
diture. Stabilisers, brought in or extended for
most CAP commodities, ensure that CAP
support is automatically cut if production
exceeds specified quantities. Significant price
cuts of up to 20 per cent have already been
made in a number of sectors.
Each annual price-fixing settlement since
1988 has consolidated this reform process, the
cost being within the guidelines established
by the Council of Ministers, and the
stabiliser mechanisms have remained intact.
The settlements have also helped to improve
the competitive position of British farmers.
Reform
In 1991 the European Commission published
detailed reform proposals for consideration by
member states. Ministerial negotiations
culminated in the agreement reached in May
1992 on measures to reform the CAP in the
arable, milk, beef and sheepmeat sectors and
on support prices for the 1992-93 marketing
year.
Arable Crops. From the start of the 1993-94
marketing year a new price support structure
for cereals will come into effect. A new target
price is to be established, and over three
years this will be reduced progressively from
the present level by about 30 per cent. An
intervention price will set the minimum
support level for Community cereals.
As a result of the price cuts, producers’
returns for growing cereals are to be reduced.
To compensate, producers will be offered a
direct subsidy on an area basis provided that
they agree to take 15 per cent of their arable
land out of production. They will be required
to do this from autumn 1992; those with only
small arable areas, however, are exempt. If
these measures prove less effective than
expected in reducing production, the
306
AGRICULTURE, FISHERIES AND FORESTRY
Community will be able to increase the 15
per cent level.
Pigs and Poultry. Pig and poultry farmers are
expected to benefit from lower feed costs.
Beef. The intervention price for beef for
1992-93 has been frozen. From 1 July 1993 it
will be reduced by 15 per cent over three
years. Ceilings will be introduced
progressively from the start of 1993 on the
annual amount which may be purchased into
intervention. This will be 750,000 tonnes in
1993, falling to 350,000 tonnes in 1997. In
1991- 92 over 1 million tonnes of beef were
purchased into intervention.
There will be a significant increase in the
beef special premium (subject to regional
ceilings on the number of claims) and the
suckler cow premium paid to producers.
There will be no headage limits on the
suckler cow premium as originally proposed
by the Community.
Sheep. Basic sheepmeat support prices for
1993 will remain at the 1992 level. But from
1993 ewe premium will be paid on individual
producer quotas, which will set a limit on the
number of animals eligible for ewe premium
in future.
Milk. Milk support prices for 1992-93 have
been frozen. In 1993-94 and 1994—95,
however, the butter support price will be cut
by 2 5 per cent a year. There will be no cuts
in national milk production quotas for
1992- 93. Quota cuts of 1 per cent in 1993-94
and 1994-95 have been agreed in principle-
subject to Community review.
Environment. All member states will run
programmes to encourage environmentally
sensitive farming. These schemes may be
drawn from the following list:
• extensification2 of crop or livestock
production where this would be
environmentally beneficial;
• organic farming;
• environmentally friendly management of
farmland;
• environmental upkeep of abandoned land;
• setting aside farmland for at least 20
years for environmental purposes; and
2 Extensification is the reduction of surpluses through the offer
of financial payments to farmers to lessen production.
• management of land for public access and
recreation.
Member states have until June 1993 to
draw up area programmes covering their
entire territory.
Forestry. The agreement offers higher
Community reimbursement for afforestation
of agricultural land and for premium
payments to farmers. It also offers limited
premium payments to non-farmers, to aid the
initial maintenance of trees.
GATT Uruguay Round
Agriculture was identified as a major issue for
the GATT round of multilateral trade
negotiations launched in 1986 (see p 373).
These aimed to achieve a freer and more
market-oriented agricultural trading system,
and to agree cuts in production—and
exemptions from them. The Community
proposed reform on an aggregate measure of
support, which would be reduced by 30 per
cent between 1986 and 1996, with credit for
reforms already made. Tariffs would replace
other restrictions on market access, and be
reduced over the next five years, with a
corrective mechanism reflecting changes in
world markets.
Negotiations resumed in 1991. Participants
in the eighth round agreed to reach specific
binding commitments on internal support,
border measures and export competition.
Price Guarantees, Grants and Subsidies
Expenditure in Britain in 1991-92 on price
guarantees, grants and subsidies and on CAP
market regulations was estimated to be £350
million and £1,736 million respectively.
About £1,745 million is to be reimbursed
from the Community budget.
Potatoes and wool are not covered by the
CAP; potato market support measures are
operated through the Potato Marketing Board
and the Department of Agriculture for
Northern Ireland, and a price stabilisation
fund for wool is administered by the British
Wool Marketing Board. The Government
intends to end the guarantee arrangements
when parliamentary time permits.
Farmers are eligible for grants aimed at
307
BRITAIN 1993: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK.
environmental enhancement of their farms
and pollution control. Hill and upland
farmers can also benefit from headage
payments on cattle and sheep, known as
compensatory allowances. Launching aid is
available to production and marketing groups
in the horticultural sector.
In Less Favoured Areas (LFAs), where
land quality is poor, farmers benefit from
enhanced rates of grant and special payments
on livestock. Their purpose is to support the
continuation of livestock farming in the hill
and upland areas, thereby conserving the
countryside and maintaining a viable
population in the LFAs.
Smallholdings and Crofts
Local authorities provide over 5,500 statutory
smallholdings in England and just under 900
in Wales. They make loans of up to 75 per
cent of required working capital to their
tenants. Land settlement in Scotland has
been carried out by the Government, which,
while now seeking to dispose of holdings to
its sitting tenants, still owns and maintains
120,228 hectares (296,963 acres) of land
settlement estates, comprising 1,455 crofts
and holdings.
In the crofting areas of Scotland (the
former counties, in the Highlands and
Islands, of Argyll, Inverness, Ross and
Cromarty, Sutherland, Caithness, Orkney and
Shetland) much of the land is held by tenants
as ‘crofters’. They enjoy the statutory
protection provided by crofting legislation
and can benefit from government schemes
which exist to support and help crofting
communities. Most crofters are part-time or
spare-time agriculturalists using croft income
to supplement income from activities such as
weaving, fishing, tourism and other
occupations. The Crofters Commission has a
statutory duty to promote the interests of
crofters and to keep all crofting matters
under review.
Tenancy Legislation
Approximately 35 per cent of agricultural
land in England and Wales is tenanted. The
agricultural holdings legislation protects the
interests and rights of landlords and tenants,
with provision for arbitration in the event of
a dispute. Most agricultural tenants have the
right to contest a notice to quit, which is
then ineffective unless the landlord obtains
consent to its operation from an independent
body (in England and Wales, the Agricultural
Land Tribunal and in Scotland, the Scottish
Land Court). On termination of tenancy, the
tenant is entitled to compensation in
accordance with a special code. Practically all
farms in Northern Ireland are owner-
occupied, but, under a practice known as
‘conacre’, occupiers not wishing to farm all
their land let it annually to others. About
one-fifth of agricultural land is let under this
practice and is used mainly for grazing.
Agriculture and Protection of the
Countryside
Agriculture ministers have a general duty,
under the Agriculture Act 1986, to seek to
achieve a reasonable balance between the
needs of an efficient and stable agriculture
industry and other interests in the
countryside, including the conservation of its
natural beauty and amenity and the
promotion of its enjoyment by the public. In
addition, they are required to further
conservation of the countryside in the
administration of farm capital grant schemes
both in National Parks and in Sites of Special
Scientific Interest designated by the nature
conservancy bodies.
Environmentally Sensitive Areas
Under the Environmentally Sensitive Areas
(ESA) Scheme, a British idea which other
European Community members are
following, 19 areas in Britain—ten in
England, five in Scotland, two in Wales and
two in Northern Ireland—have been
designated. Twelve further areas in England,
five in Scotland, four in Wales and two in
Northern Ireland, have been proposed for
designation over the next couple of years.
The Scheme is designed to help protect some
of the most beautiful parts of the country
from the damage and loss that can come from
agricultural change. ESAs are notable for
308
AGRICULTURE, FISHERIES AND FORESTRY
their landscape, wildlife or historic
importance.
Since the Scheme began in 1987, each
ESA’s environmental and economic impact
has been closely monitored. Following a
review of the first areas, significant changes
and improvements have been made to the
Scheme, including opportunities for farmers
to restore key environmental features of their
land.
Environmentally Sensitive Areas are
unique and diverse in character, and
include the heather moorlands of the
North Peak and grassland of the
Broads in England; the landscape of
the Cambrian Mountains in Wales;
part of the coastal areas of the North
and South Uists, Benbecula, Barra and
Vatersay in the Outer Hebrides off
north-west Scotland; and the steep
sided glens and unique farming
patterns of Antrim in Northern
Ireland.
Participation in the ESA scheme is
voluntary, and farmers enter into agreements
with the relevant Ministry; initially they
lasted for five years. In the reviewed areas
ten-year agreements are offered—with a five-
year break clause. An agreement specifies the
agricultural management practices to be
carried out by the farmer. Each ESA has
varying tiers of management practices, from
basic care and maintenance to more extensive
forms of management. Details vary from one
ESA to another, but all participants are
prohibited from converting grassland to arable
and are subject to restrictions on fertiliser and
chemical usage. Most ESAs also restrict the
numbers of stock that can be carried on the
land as well as other operations—including
the timing of cultivation. The annual
payments are designed to compensate the
farmers for reduced profitability, through the
adoption of these less intensive production
methods, and for the further work some
management practices require. In Scotland
additional payments are made for distinct
items of conservation work set out in a
mandatory farm conservation plan. Annual
government expenditure on payments to
farmers within ESAs throughout Britain is
expected to rise to £64-5 million in 1994—95.
At the end of 1991 some 340,000 hectares
(840,000 acres) of farmland were within the
ESAs in England; 193,000 hectares
(477,000 acres) in Wales; 220,000 hectares
(540,000 acres) in Scotland; and 40,000
hectares (100,000 acres) in Northern Ireland.
Some 3,100 farmers in England, 715 in
Wales, 800 in Scotland and 1,030 in
Northern Ireland have signed management
agreements. Some 114,000 hectares
(280,000 acres) in the English ESAs were
covered by the agreements; 61,000 hectares
(150,000 acres) in Wales; 120,000 hectares
(300,000 acres) in Scotland; and 22,000
hectares (54,000 acres) in Northern Ireland.
Other Schemes
Farmers are encouraged to develop new
sources of income as an alternative to surplus
production through grants to diversify into
tourism and other non-agricultural activities
on the farm. The Farm Woodland Premium
Scheme, introduced in 1992, assists the
planting of woodlands on agricultural land,
with incentives for broadleaved trees. Annual
incentives of up to ,£250 a hectare are to be
paid for either ten or 15 years, depending on
the type of woodland created on arable or
improved grassland. Annual incentives of £60
a hectare are to be paid for trees planted on
unimproved grassland in the LFAs. Planting
must not, in aggregate, exceed more than 50
per cent of any individual agricultural unit.
The European Community set-aside
scheme, introduced in Britain in 1988, offers
annual payments to farmers to take at least 20
per cent of their arable land out of
agricultural production for five years.
Additional payments for managing five-year
set-aside land for the benefit of wildlife,
landscape and the local community are
available under the Countryside Premium
Scheme (at present limited to eastern
England). The Farm and Conservation Grant
Scheme, part-funded by the European
Community, provides grants for farmers to
undertake environmental improvements and a
limited range of farm investments. Under
pilot Beef and Sheep Extensification
309
BRITAIN 1993: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Schemes, farmers receive annual
compensation payments to reduce output by
at least 20 per cent and to maintain this
reduction over a five-year period. The
Government has also designated ten nitrate-
sensitive areas in England, where payments
have been made to farmers who voluntarily
undertake to restrict their agricultural
practices and thus prevent unacceptable levels
of nitrate leaching from farmland into water
sources.
In the Highlands and Islands of Scotland
the Rural Enterprise Programme offers
special funding, with Community support, to
encourage farmers and crofters to develop
new businesses.
Farm Diversification
Farm-based enterprises other than food
production have become increasingly
important. A survey published in 1991
calculated that diversified enterprises
generated an average trading profit of over
j£5,000 a year, with 80 per cent of farmers
considering their ventures to be successful.
The most common diversification enterprises
provide leisure amenities such as golf courses,
tourist accommodation, or riding. Often such
enterprises are small-scale, with low financial
returns. In contrast, many farmers run large-
scale farm shops which make a substantial
contribution to farm business income. Farm
diversification is estimated to provide over
30,000 full-time jobs. The Government gives
grants for some types of enterprise. At the
end of June 1992 over £9 million had been
committed.
Agricultural Training
The Agricultural Training Board receives
government grant to arrange training for the
agricultural industry. The Board has evolved
a more strategic role, as a broker for training
provision rather than as a direct course
provider. A network of employer-led local
boards has been set up, to identify and
arrange local training needs in co-operation
with existing training providers (primarily
agricultural colleges) and in liaison with
Training and Enterprise Councils. Training
provision is arranged through some 600
autonomous training groups throughout
Great Britain.
Professional, Scientific and Technical
Services
In England and Wales the Agricultural
Development and Advisory Service (ADAS),
an executive agency, provides a wide range of
professional, scientific and technical services
for agriculture and its ancillary industries.
Most types of advice and servicing are on a
fee-paying basis, although initial advice to
farmers on conservation, rural diversification
(including use of land for woodlands) and
animal welfare is available free. Similar
services are provided in Scotland by the
Scottish Office Agriculture and Fisheries
Department through the Scottish Agricultural
College. In Northern Ireland these services
are available from the Department of
Agriculture’s agriculture and science services.
These organisations also advise the
Government on the scientific, technical and
business implications of policy proposals and
assist in implementing policies concerning
disease and pest eradication, food hygiene,
animal welfare, land drainage and other
capital grant schemes, and safeguarding
agricultural land in relation to other land
uses.
ADAS carries out research and
development work under commission from
the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and
Food, and works under contract directly for
others and for levy-funded bodies. These
undertakings are carried out at a range of
experimental husbandry farms across England
and Wales, and through regional centres or
on clients’ premises. The Central Science
Laboratory also carries out research and
development work commissioned by the
Ministry.
CONTROL OF DISEASES AND PESTS
Farm Animals
Britain is free from many serious animal
illnesses. If they were to occur, diseases such
as foot-and-mouth disease and classical swine
310
AGRICULTURE, FISHERIES AND FORESTRY
fever would be combated by a slaughter
policy applied to all animals infected or
exposed to infection, and by control over
animal movements during the outbreaks.
The Government has taken comprehensive
measures to tackle the cattle disease bovine
spongiform encephalopathy and to ensure that
consumers are protected from any remote
risk. It has:
• banned the feeding of ruminant protein
to ruminants;
• ordered the destruction of the milk and
carcasses of affected animals;
• banned from human or animal use those
offals from other cattle which might be
harbouring the agent; and
• committed significant funding for
research.
It has also established an expert committee to
advise on matters relating to spongiform
encephalopathies.
The Government has ordered restrictions
on the movement of pigs to prevent the
spread of blue-eared pig disease.
Strict controls are exercised on the import
of animals, birds, meat, and meat products so
as to prevent the introduction of animal or
avian diseases. Special measures apply to
prevent the introduction of rabies, and dogs,
cats and certain other mammals are subject to
import licence and six months’ quarantine.
There are severe penalties for breaking the
law. There have been no cases of rabies
outside quarantine in Britain since 1970.
Professional advice and action on the
control of animal disease and the welfare of
farm livestock are the responsibility of the
government State Veterinary Service. Its
laboratory facilities and investigation centres
perform specialist research work and advise
private practitioners responsible for treating
animals on the farm.
Fish
The fisheries departments operate statutory
controls to prevent the introduction and
spread of serious diseases of fish and
shellfish. These controls include the
licensing of live fish imports, the licensing of
deposits of shellfish on the seabed, and
movement restrictions on sites where
outbreaks of notifiable diseases have been
confirmed.
Plants
The agriculture departments are responsible
for limiting the spread of plant pests and
diseases and for preventing the introduction
of new ones. They also issue the health
certificates required by other countries to
accompany plant material exported from
Britain. Certification schemes encourage the
development of healthy and true-to-type
planting stocks.
Pesticides
There are strict controls on the supply and
use of pesticides, and their maximum residue
levels. All pesticides supplied in Britain must
be approved for their safety and efficacy in
use. Controls on pesticides are the joint
responsibility of six government departments
on the basis of advice from the independent
Advisory Committee on Pesticides. The
Government is currently reviewing pesticides
approved before 1981.
Veterinary Medicinal Products
The manufacture, sale and supply of
veterinary medicinal products are prohibited
except under licence. Licences are issued by
the agriculture ministers, who are advised on
safety, quality and efficacy by the Veterinary
Products Committee, which comprises
independent experts.
Fisheries
Britain, one of the European Community’s
leading fishing nations, plays an active role in
the implementation and development of the
Community’s Common Fisheries Policy
(CFP) agreed in 1983. The CFP covers
access to coastal waters, the conservation and
management of fish stocks, fisheries
arrangements with third countries, the
allocation of catch quotas among member
311
BRITAIN 1993: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
states, the trade in and marketing of fish and
fish products, and financial aid to promote
the adaptation and development of the
Community’s fishing fleet.
The fishing industry provides 59 per cent
by quantity of British fish supplies, and is an
important source of employment and income
in a number of ports.
Cod, haddock, whiting, herring, plaice and
sole are found in the North Sea off the east
coasts of Scotland and England; mackerel,
together with cod and other demersal fish, off
the west coast of Scotland; sole, plaice, cod,
herring and whiting in the Irish Sea; and
mackerel, sole and plaice off the south-west
coast of England. Nephrops, crabs, lobsters
and other shellfish are found in the inshore
waters all around the coast.
At the end of 1990 there were 16,967
fishermen in regular employment and 5,088
occasionally employed. The Government aims
to encourage the development of a viable,
efficient and market-oriented fisheries
industry within the CFP framework. Two
main policy issues are conservation of fish
stocks and capacity of the fleet.
Fish Caught
In 1990 demersal fish (caught on or near the
bottom of the sea) accounted for 44 per cent
by weight of total British landings, pelagic
fish (caught near the surface) for 41 per cent
and shellfish for 15 per cent. Landings of all
types of fish (excluding salmon and trout) by
British fishing vessels totalled 621,510 tonnes.
Cod and haddock represented 23 and 18 per
cent respectively of the total value of
demersal and pelagic fish landed, while
anglerfish (8 per cent), whiting (8 per cent),
plaice (7 per cent), mackerel (5 per cent), and
sole (4 per cent) were the other most
important sources of earnings to the industry.
The quayside value of the British catch of
wetfish and shellfish in 1990 was £431
million. Landings of nephrops represented 11
per cent of the total value of all British
landings of fish and shellfish in 1990.
Imports of fresh, frozen, cured and canned
salt-water fish and shellfish in 1991 totalled
287,079 tonnes, those of freshwater fish
46,835 tonnes, those of fish meal 258,453
tonnes and those of fish oils 4,771 tonnes.
Exports and re-exports of salt-water fish and
fish products amounted to 390,267 tonnes
and those of freshwater fish to 23,622 tonnes.
The Fishing Fleet
At the end of 1991 the British fleet consisted
of 10,871 registered vessels, including 424
deep-sea vessels longer than 24 4 m (80 feet).
Among the main ports from which the
fishing fleet operates are Aberdeen,
Peterhead, Fraserburgh (Grampian),
Lerwick (Shetland), Kinlochbervie,
Ullapool (Highland), North Shields
(Tyne and Wear), Grimsby
(Humberside), Lowestoft (Suffolk),
Brixham (Devon), Newlyn (Cornwall),
and Kilkeel, Ardglass and Portavogie
(Northern Ireland).
With the extension of fishery limits to 200
miles, Britain’s distant water fleet was
considerably reduced. A much smaller fleet
has, however, continued to maintain its
activities in distant waters.
The Government, in accordance with the
CFP agreement, aims to conserve fish stocks,
and to reduce total fish mortality, by
restricting the time fishing vessels may spend
at sea and to set down, as a licence condition,
precisely how time at sea will be defined,
notified and controlled. Its policy comprises
decommissioning, an extension of licensing,
technical conservation and ‘effort control’. It
is to make £25 million available for a cash-
limited decommissioning scheme. Licensing
is to be extended to the 7,000 vessels of 10 m
and under in length.
Fish Farming
Fish farming production is centred on
Atlantic salmon and rainbow trout, which are
particularly suited to Britain’s climate and
waters. Production of salmon and trout has
grown from less than 1,000 tonnes in the
early 1970s to some 40,000 tonnes of salmon
and 13,500 tonnes of trout in 1991. Scotland
produces the largest amount of farmed
salmon (40,000 tonnes in 1991—with a first-
312
AGRICULTURE, FISHERIES AND FORESTRY
sale value of ^130 million) in the European
Community. Shellfish farming concentrates
on molluscs such as oysters, mussels, clams
and scallops, producing an estimated 5,000
tonnes a year.
The fish and shellfish farming industries
make an important contribution to rural
infrastructure, especially in remote areas such
as the Highlands and Islands of Scotland. In
1991 the industries were estimated to have a
combined wholesale turnover of some £150
million. Production is based on almost 1,200
businesses operating from some 1,800 sites
and employing more than 5,000 people.
Administration
The fisheries departments are responsible for
the administration of legislation concerning
the fishing industry and for fisheries research.
The safety and welfare of crews of fishing
vessels and other matters common to shipping
generally are provided for under legislation
administered by the Department of Transport.
The Sea Fish Industry Authority is
concerned with all aspects of the industry,
including consumer interests. It undertakes
research and development, provides training,
and encourages quality awareness. It also
administers a government grant scheme for
fishing vessels, to promote a safe, efficient
and modern fleet.
Fishery Limits
Only British vessels may fish within 6 miles
of the coast; certain other Community
member states have traditional fishing rights
between 6 and 12 miles, as British vessels
have in other member states’ coastal waters.
Outside 12 miles the only non-Community
countries whose vessels may fish in
Community waters are those (for example,
Norway) with which the Community has
reciprocal fisheries agreements.
Common Fisheries Policy
The CFP’s system for the conservation and
management of the Community’s fishing
resources means that total allowable catches—
with these decisions based partly on
independent scientific advice—are set each
year in order to conserve stocks. These catch
levels are then allocated between member
states on a fixed percentage basis, taking
account of traditional fishing patterns.
Activity is also regulated by a number of
technical conservation measures, including
minimum mesh sizes and the kind of gear
used by fishermen, minimum landing sizes
and closed areas designated mainly to protect
young fish. Each member state is responsible
for ensuring that its fishermen abide by the
various fisheries regulations and their
performances are monitored by the
Community’s inspectors.
The 1983 settlement also covered the
common organisation of the market in fish
and fish products, and a policy for
restructuring the Community fleet during
1987-97, designed to address the problem of
over-capacity. The measures include financial
assistance for the building and modernisation
of fishing vessels.
Fishery relations between the European
Community and other countries are extensive
and are governed by different agreements.
Those of most importance to Britain are with
Norway, Greenland, the Faroe Islands and
Sweden. Annual Community quotas have also
been established in international waters in the
north-west Atlantic and around Svalbard.
Fish Hygiene Directive
The single European market aims to facilitate
trade among Community members and to
protect public health by harmonising
measures for the handling and treatment of
all fish and shellfish (including aquaculture
products) at all stages up to, but excluding,
retail’level. It will take effect from 1 January
1993, and lays down rules to ensure the safe
and hygienic handling of fish and fish
products. This includes the conditions on
board factory vessels; requirements during
and after landing, including auction markets
on shore; and establishments on land,
primarily processors. The single market
provisions also lay down the conditions for
processed products, as well as hygiene rules
for those who come into contact with fish
and fish products.

Salmon and Freshwater Fisheries
Salmon and sea-trout are fished commercially
in inshore waters around the British coast.
Eels and elvers are also taken commercially in
both estuaries and freshwater. Angling for
salmon and sea-trout (game fishing) and for
other freshwater species (coarse fishing) is
popular throughout Britain. In England and
Wales fishing is licensed by the National
Rivers Authority; in Scotland salmon fishing
is administered by salmon district fishery
boards. In Northern Ireland fishing is
licensed by the Fisheries Conservancy Board
for Northern Ireland and the Foyle Fisheries
Commission in their respective areas, and 65
public angling waters, including salmon, trout
and coarse fisheries, are accessible to
Department of Agriculture permit holders.
Agriculture, Fisheries and
Food Research
The total government-funded programme of
research and development in agriculture,
fisheries and food in 1992-93 amounts to
some £305 million, including funding by the
Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food,
the Scottish Office Agriculture and Fisheries
Department, the Department of Agriculture
for Northern Ireland and the Office of
Science and Technology. The agriculture
departments, the Agricultural and Food
Research Council (AFRC) and private
industry share responsibility for research,
which is carried out in a network of research
institutes, specialist laboratories and
experimental husbandry farms, and with
Horticulture Research International (HRI;
established in 1990) and in higher education
institutions.
Agriculture and Food Research
The research aims to maintain an efficient
and competitive industry in Britain consistent
with high standards of animal welfare and
care for the environment. The work of the
AFRC and the agriculture departments is co¬
ordinated into national programmes,
primarily on the recommendations of the
Priorities Board for Research and
Development in Agriculture and Food. The
Board advises on the research needs and on
the allocation of available resources between
and within areas of research.
The AFRC (see p 384), a non-
departmental public body, receives funds
from the science budget through the Office
of Science and Technology, and income from
work commissioned by the Ministry of
Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, by industry
and by other bodies. The Council is
responsible for research carried out in its
seven institutes and in British higher
education institutions through its research
grants scheme. In addition to commissioning
research with the AFRC and other
organisations, such as HRI, the Ministry
commissions research and development at its
Food Science Laboratory, at the Central
Veterinary Laboratory and at the Central
Science Laboratory, and with ADAS.
The five Scottish Agricultural Research
Institutes, funded by the Scottish Office
Agriculture and Fisheries Department, cover
areas of research complementary to those of
the AFRC institutes, while including work
relevant to the soils, crops and livestock of
northern Britain. Development work in
Scotland is carried out by the Scottish
Agricultural College, which operates from
three centres.
In Northern Ireland basic, strategic and
applied research is carried out by the
Department of Agriculture in its specialist
research divisions and at its three agricultural
colleges. It also has links with the Queen’s
University of Belfast and the Agricultural
Research Institute of Northern Ireland.
In addition, the food industry funds or
undertakes relevant research. The
Government funds strategic research essential
for the public good, for example, into food
safety, human health, animal welfare and
flood protection, but has withdrawn funding
from research which promises commercial
application or exploitation within a
reasonable timescale—for which it looks to
industry to take on a greater degree of
funding.
In 1992-93 the Ministry will spend
314
AGRICULTURE, FISHERIES AND FORESTRY
£30 million of its £131 million annual
research budget on research relevant to the
environment. This includes the protection of
the countryside, water supplies and rivers;
ensuring that straw and other crop residues
are disposed of other than by burning—a
practice to be banned after the 1992 harvest;
reducing the use of pesticides to the
minimum compatible with efficient
production; flood and coastal defences; and
care of the marine environment. By the end
of 1992-93 the Ministry will have spent £12
million on research into bovine spongiform
encephalopathy.
Fisheries and Aquatic Environment
Research
The Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and
Food laboratories deal with marine and
freshwater fisheries, shellfish, marine
pollution, fish farming and disease. Research
work is also commissioned by the Ministry
with the Natural Environment Research
Council, with the Sea Fish Industry
Authority and with a number of universities
and polytechnics. The Ministry has two
seagoing research vessels. In Scotland, the
Scottish Office Agriculture and Fisheries
Department undertakes a similar, and
complementary, range of research and also
has two seagoing vessels. The Department of
Agriculture laboratories in Northern Ireland
undertake research on marine and freshwater
fisheries, and also have a seagoing research
vessel.
Forestry
Woodland covers an estimated 2-35 million
hectares (5'8 million acres) in Britain: about 7
per cent of England, 15 per cent of Scotland,
12 per cent of Wales and 6 per cent of
Northern Ireland—about 10 per cent of the
total land area and well below the 25 per cent
average for the whole of Europe. The
Government supports the continued
expansion of forestry, which makes an
increasing contribution to meeting the
national demand for timber; brings
employment in forestry and related industries;
creates opportunities for recreation and public
access to the countryside; is a component of
landscapes and a habitat for wildlife; and
provides an effective means by which carbon
dioxide can be absorbed from the atmosphere
and stored over long periods. Over 230,000
hectares (570,000 acres) of new forest have
been created during the last decade, mainly
on the initiative and enterprise of private
owners.
The area of productive forest in Great
Britain is 215 million hectares (5-3 million
acres), 40 per cent of which is managed by
the Forestry Commission. The rate of new
planting in 1991-92 was 2,999 hectares (7,410
acres) by the Commission and 14,270
hectares (35,260 acres) by other woodland
owners, with the help of grants from the
Commission, mainly in Scotland. The
planting of broadleaved trees is encouraged
on suitable sites and in 1991-92, 7,070
hectares (17,470 acres) of broadleaved trees
were planted. An increasing proportion of
new planting is by private owners.
Wood production has nearly doubled
since 1970. British woodlands meet 15
per cent of the nation’s consumption
of wood and wood products. The
volume of timber harvested on
Commission lands in 1991-92 totalled
3 9 million cubic metres (137 million
cubic feet).
The Commission’s expanded Woodland
Grant Scheme pays establishment grants to
help in the creation of new woodlands and
forests and for the regeneration of existing
ones. It highlights such features as native tree
species, woody shrubs, short-rotation coppice
and agroforestry. Management grants under
the scheme contribute to the cost of
managing woodlands to provide silvicultural,
environmental and social benefits.
Supplements are available for planting
community woodlands and for planting on
better land.
Total employment in state and private
forests in Great Britain was estimated at
42,000 in 1990, including about 10,000 people
engaged in the haulage and processing of
home-grown timber.

BRITAIN 1993: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
The Forestry Commission and Forestry
Policy
The Forestry Commission, established in
1919, is the national forestry authority in
Great Britain. The Commissioners give
advice on forestry matters and are responsible
to the Secretary of State for Scotland, the
Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food,
and the Secretary of State for Wales.
Within the Commission, reorganised in
1992, the Forestry Authority administers
felling licence procedures, provides advice to
private woodland owners, administers
payment of grants for approved planting and
restocking schemes, and liaises with local
authorities and woodland and countryside
groups. Forest Enterprise develops and
manages the Commission’s forests and
forestry estate as a multiple-use resource,
providing timber for the wood-using
industries and opportunities for recreation,
and is responsible for nature conservation and
the forest environment. A Policy and
Resources Group is responsible for
parliamentary business, policy development,
and European and international liaison.
The Commission has sold 79,000 hectares
(195,000 acres) of plantation and plantable
land since 1981 and has been asked by the
Government to dispose of a further 100,000
hectares (247,000 acres) by the end of the
century. The Commission is financed partly
by the Government and partly by receipts
from sales of timber and other produce, and
from rents.
Forestry Initiatives
The Forestry Commission and the
Countryside Commission plan to create 12
community forests (covering between 10,000
and 20,000 hectares each—40 to 80 sq miles)
on the outskirts of major cities in England.
These include the Great North Forest (Tyne
and Wear), the Forest of Mercia
(Staffordshire) and Thames Chase, east of
London. As part of its rural initiative for
Wales, the Government plans to give local
communities greater involvement in the
development of 35,000 hectares (135 sq miles)
of forest in the coalfield valleys of south
Wales—about 20 per cent of the land area—
owned by the Forestry Commission. A
Central Scotland Woodland Initiative has also
been launched. More than 6 million trees
have been planted.
Forestry Research
The Forestry Authority maintains two
principal research stations, at Alice Holt
Lodge, near Farnham (Surrey), and at Bush
Estate, near Edinburgh, for basic and applied
research into all aspects of forestry. Aid is
also given for research work in universities
and other institutions. A database on forestry
and tree-related research in Great Britain has
been compiled by the Forestry Research Co¬
ordination Committee and is updated
annually.
The Forestry Authority conducts an
annual forest health survey which monitors
the effects of air pollution and other stress
factors on a range of broadleaves and
conifers. It has increased research into
wildlife conservation and farm forestry,
including an evaluation of agroforestry
systems combining wide-spaced conifers and
broadleaves with sheep grazing. The
Government has set up an expert scientific
review group on tree health in Britain.
Forestry in Northern Ireland
The Department of Agriculture may acquire
land for afforestation and give financial and
technical assistance for private planting. The
state forest area has grown steadily since
1945. By 1992, 75,000 hectares (185,000
acres) of plantable land had been acquired, of
which 60,000 hectares (148,250 acres) were
planted. There were 16,000 hectares (39,500
acres) of privately owned forest. Some 500
professional and industrial staff work in state
forests.

17 Transport and
Communications
Major improvements in transport have
resulted from the construction of a network
of motorways, the extension of fast inter-city
rail services and expansion schemes at many
airports. Transport policy rests on the
fundamental aims of:
• promoting economic growth and higher
national prosperity;
• ensuring a reasonable level of personal
mobility;
• improving safety;
• ensuring full consideration is given to the
environment; and
• using energy economically.
Britain is taking an active part in the
European Community’s development of a
common transport policy.
Users’ expenditure on transport, including
taxation, in Britain totalled an estimated
£92,000 million in 1990, of which £89,000
million represented expenditure on road
transport (including buses and goods
vehicles).
Inland Transport
There has been a considerable increase in
passenger travel in recent years. Travel in
Great Britain rose by 34 per cent between
1980 and 1990. Travel by car and taxi rose by
42 per cent and air travel expanded rapidly.
Recently, however, travel by motor cycle and
by bus and coach has been declining. In all,
car and taxi travel accounts for 85 per cent of
passenger mileage within Great Britain, buses
and coaches for about 6 per cent, rail for
6 per cent and air less than 1 per cent.
Car ownership has also risen substantially,
and 66 per cent of households in Great
Britain have the regular use of one or more
cars, with 22 per cent having the use of two
or more cars in 1990. At the end of 1991
there were 24-5 million vehicles licensed for
use on the roads of Great Britain, of which
20 3 million were cars (including 2 4 million
cars registered in the name of a company);
2-2 million light goods vehicles (that is,
vehicles other than cars in the passenger and
light goods category of vehicle); 449,000
other goods vehicles; 750,000 motor cycles,
scooters and mopeds; and 109,000 public
transport vehicles (including taxis).
ROADS
Total traffic for 1991 is provisionally
estimated at 417,300 million vehicle-km. The
total road network in Great Britain in 1991
was 360,000 km (224,000 miles). Trunk
motorways accounted for 3,032 km (1,884
miles) of this length, less than 1 per cent, and
trunk roads for 12,400 km (7,700 miles), or
about 3 5 per cent. However, motorways
carry over 15 per cent of all traffic and trunk
roads about 17 per cent. Combined, they
carry over half of all heavy goods vehicle
traffic in Great Britain.
Administration
Responsibility for trunk roads, including most
motorways, in Great Britain rests in England
with the Secretary of State for Transport, in
Scotland with the Secretary of State for
Scotland and in Wales with the Secretary of
State for Wales. The costs of construction
317
BRITAIN 1993: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
and maintenance are paid for by central
government. The highway authorities for
non-trunk roads are:
• in England, the county councils, the
metropolitan district councils, the
London borough councils and the
Common Council of the City of
London;
• in Wales, the county councils; and
• in Scotland, the regional or islands
councils.
In Northern Ireland the Northern
Ireland Department of the Environment
is responsible for the construction,
improvement and maintenance of all
public roads.
Research on transport provides
information necessary for the Department
of Transport to set standards for highway
and vehicle design, to obtain better value
for money in highway construction and
repair, and to formulate transport,
environmental and safety policies and
legislation. Research is carried out by the
Transport Research Laboratory, an
executive agency of the Department of
Transport. Its Overseas Unit advises the
Overseas Development Administration on
giving assistance to developing countries to
help solve their transport problems.
Research is also carried out by universities
and other higher education institutions,
consultants and industry, while some is
done collaboratively within European
Community programmes.
Road Programme
The Government has implemented a major
programme to improve the motorway and
trunk road network (see map, rear
endpapers). The programme is aimed at
increasing the traffic capacity of major
through routes and removing traffic from
unsuitable roads in towns and villages. Over
one-third of schemes in the programme are
bypasses or relief roads. In spring 1992, some
70 motorway and trunk road schemes were
under construction in England and over 400
further schemes were in preparation.
Expenditure of £1,400 million for new trunk
road construction is planned for 1992-93.
Important schemes include the Ml-Al link
road, which will be completed in 1993, thus
improving communications between the
Midlands and East Anglia. Some 312 major
local authority road schemes are being
supported by the Department of Transport,
including 38 new schemes. Some £892
million is available to support local authority
road schemes in England in 1992-93.
Road communications in Wales are
expected to benefit from the second Severn
crossing, the completion of the M4 motorway
and improvements in the A55 coast road in
north Wales. The A55 improvements
included the construction under the Conwy
estuary of the first immersed tube road
tunnel to be built in Britain, opened in
October 1991. The Welsh Office’s 1992-93
roads and transport programme totals £197
million, and will include starting on the

TRANSPORT AND COMMUNICATIONS
schemes that will complete the M4 link and
the upgrading of the A55 into dual carriage¬
way from Chester to Bangor. Some £74
million is also being made available to support
major local authority road schemes in Wales.
The Government has committed £330
million over three years to new road
construction in Scotland. The main priorities
within the trunk road programme in Scotland
are the upgrading of the A74 to motorway
standard and completion of the central
Scotland motorway network. These routes
provide links for commerce and industry to
the south and to Europe. The Government’s
future strategy includes a series of ‘route action
plans’ designed significantly to improve safety
and journey times on specific major routes.
In Northern Ireland the emphasis is on
improving arterial routes, constructing more
bypasses, and improving roads in the Belfast
area, including the construction of a new
cross-harbour link planned for the mid-1990s.
The Government is committed to
changing the system for the provision of
motorway service areas, and has introduced a
new deregulated regime under which such
areas will be constructed more quickly and
the consumer provided with more choice.
Private Finance
The Government encourages greater private
sector involvement in the design,
construction, operation and funding of roads.
A framework for encouraging privately
funded schemes is provided for in recent
legislation. Privately funded schemes recently
completed or being undertaken include:
• a crossing of the River Thames at
Dartford, which opened to traffic in
late 1991 and links into the M25
London orbital motorway;
• a second crossing of the River Severn,
which should be completed by 1996;
• a relief road north of Birmingham, which
will be the first overland toll route in
Britain; and
• a bridge between the mainland of
Scotland and Skye, which is now going
through the statutory procedures
necessary for approval.
The Government proposes to hold a
competition for a privately financed orbital
route to complete the motorway box around
the West Midlands conurbation. Other
schemes, including a new crossing of the
Tamar estuary at Plymouth and a link
between the M25 and Chelmsford (Essex),
have been identified as possible candidates for
private finance.
Licensing and Standards
Official records of drivers and vehicles are
maintained by the Driver and Vehicle
Licensing Agency. It holds records on 34-5
million drivers and 24-5 million licensed
vehicles in Great Britain. New drivers of
motor vehicles are required to pass a driving
test before being granted a full licence to
drive.
The Driving Standards Agency is the
national driver testing authority. It also
supervises professional driving instructors
and is responsible for the compulsory basic
training scheme for motor cyclists. Minimum
ages for driving are:
• 16 for riders of mopeds and disabled
drivers of specially adapted vehicles;
• 17 for drivers of cars and other passenger
vehicles with nine or fewer seats
(including that of the driver), motor
cycles and goods vehicles not over 3 5
tonnes permissible maximum weight;
• 18 for goods vehicles over 3-5 but not
over 7 5 tonnes; and
• 21 for passenger vehicles with over nine
seats and goods vehicles over 7-5 tonnes.
Before most new cars and goods vehicles
are allowed on the roads, they are required to
meet a number of safety and environmental
requirements, based primarily on standards
drawn up by the European Community. This
form of control, known as type approval, is
operated by the Vehicle Certification Agency.
The Secretary of State for Transport has a
statutory responsibility for ensuring the
roadworthiness of vehicles in use on the
roads. The Vehicle Inspectorate is the
national testing and enforcement authority. It
meets this responsibility mainly through:
319
BRITAIN 1993: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
• annual testing and certification of heavy
goods vehicles, buses and coaches;
• administration of the car, light goods
vehicle and motor cycle testing scheme,
under which vehicles are tested at private
garages authorised as test stations; and
• means such as roadside checks and
inspection of operators’ premises.
In Northern Ireland, the Driver and
Vehicle Testing Agency (DVTA) is
responsible for testing drivers and vehicles
under statutory schemes broadly similar to
those in Great Britain. Private cars five or
more years old are tested at DVTA centres.
Road Safety
Although Great Britain has one of the highest
densities of road traffic in the world, it has a
good record on road safety, with the lowest
road accident death rate in the European
Community. Figures for 1991 show that some
4,570 people were killed on the roads, 51,600
seriously injured and 255,100 slightly injured.
This compares with nearly 8,000 deaths a
year in the mid-1960s. A number of factors,
such as developments in vehicle safety
standards and improvements in roads, the
introduction of legislation on seat belt
wearing and drinking and driving, and
developments in road safety training,
education and publicity, have contributed to
the long-term decline in casualty rates.
The Government’s aim is to reduce road
casualties by one-third by the end of the
century, compared with the 1981-85 average.
To achieve this, resources are being
concentrated on measures which are
demonstrably cost-effective in terms of
casualty reduction. Priority is given to
reducing casualties among vulnerable road-
users (children, pedestrians, cyclists, motor
cyclists and older road users), particularly in
urban areas, where some 70 per cent of road
accidents occur. For example, the child road
safety campaign is directed at encouraging
drivers to slow down when children are likely
to be about, particularly in urban areas.
Other areas for achieving lower casualties are
improvements in highway design, better
protection for vehicle occupants, encouraging
the use of cycle helmets and measures to
combat drinking and driving.
The Road Traffic Act 1991 introduced
several additional measures to improve road
safety, including:
• a new offence of dangerous driving;
• mandatory retesting of drivers convicted
of the most serious driving offences;
• in England and Wales, a new offence of
causing danger, to deal with vandals who
put lives at risk by damaging road signs
or dropping objects onto roads;
• tougher measures to deal with drink-
drive offenders;
• the use of new technology, such as
remote-operated cameras and radar
speed-detectors, to improve the detection
of speeding and traffic-light offences; and
• new powers to prohibit dangerous
vehicles.
Traffic in Towns
Traffic management schemes are used in
many urban areas to reduce congestion, create
a better environment and improve road
safety. Such schemes include, for example,
one-way streets, bus lanes, facilities for
pedestrians and cyclists, and traffic calming
measures such as road humps and chicanes to
constrain traffic speeds in residential areas.
Many towns have shopping precincts which
are designed for the convenience of
pedestrians and from which motor vehicles
are excluded for all or part of the day.
Controls over on-street parking are enforced
through excess charges and fixed penalties,
supported where appropriate by powers to
remove vehicles. In parts of London wheel
clamping to immobilise illegally parked
vehicles is also used.
In June 1992 the Government announced
the designation of a network of priority ‘red
routes’ in London some 480 km (300 miles)
long. It is expected that the first of these
routes will be in operation by the end of
1993. Red routes, to be marked by red lining
and special signs, will be subject to special
stopping controls and other traffic
management measures, strictly enforced with
higher penalties. Monitoring of a pilot
320
TRANSPORT AND COMMUNICATIONS
scheme in north and east London, introduced
in January 1991, has shown significant falls in
journey times and greater reliability for buses.
A Traffic Director for London has been
appointed to ensure the coherent development
and operation of the priority routes
throughout London.
ROAD HAULAGE
Road haulage traffic by heavy goods vehicles
amounted to 125,000 million tonne-km in
1991, 5 per cent less than in 1990. There has
been a move towards larger and more
efficient vehicles carrying heavier loads—
about 78 per cent of the traffic, in terms of
tonne-km, is carried in vehicles of over 25
tonnes gross laden weight. Much of the
traffic is moved over short distances, with 75
per cent of the tonnage being carried on hauls
of 100 km (62 miles) or less. Public haulage
(private road hauliers carrying other firms’
goods) accounts for 69 per cent of freight
carried in Great Britain in terms of
tonne-km. In 1991 the main commodities
handled by heavy goods vehicles were:
• crude minerals (298 million tonnes);
• food, drink and tobacco (291 million
tonnes); and
• building materials (155 million tonnes).
Road haulage is predominantly an industry
of small, privately owned businesses. There
were some 132,000 holders of an operator’s
licence in 1990. About half the heavy goods
vehicles are in fleets of ten or fewer vehicles.
The biggest operators in Great Britain are
NFC pic, Transport Development Group pic,
TNT Express (UK) Ltd and United Carriers
International Ltd.
Licensing and Other Controls
In general, those operating goods vehicles
over 3-5 tonnes gross weight require an
operator’s licence. Licences are divided into
restricted licences for own-account operators
carrying goods connected with their own
business, and standard licences for hauliers
operating for hire or reward. Proof of
professional competence, financial standing
and good repute is needed to obtain a
standard licence. In Northern Ireland own-
account operators do not require a licence,
although this matter is under consideration.
Regulations lay down limits on the hours
worked by drivers of goods vehicles, as well
as minimum rest periods. Tachographs,
which automatically record speed, distance
covered, driving time and stopping periods,
must be fitted and used in most goods
vehicles over 3 5 tonnes gross weight in
Great Britain. The Government has
announced a proposal to fit speed limiters to
heavy lorries, preventing them from travelling
above 60 mph (97 km/h).
International Road Haulage
International road haulage has grown rapidly
and in 1991 about L3 million road goods
vehicles were ferried to the Continent or the
Irish Republic. Of these, 360,000 were
powered vehicles registered in Britain. In
1990 British vehicles carried over 9 million
tonnes to and from continental Europe, with
average lengths of haul of 1,167 km (725
miles) outwards and 1,097 km (683 miles)
inwards, compared with 79 km (49 miles) for
national road haulage. Much additional traffic
crossed the Irish land boundary.
International road haulage has been
constrained by the need for permits issued
under bilateral agreements with individual
countries. Many agreements allow
unrestricted numbers of British lorries into
the country concerned, but others specify an
annual quota of permits. Quotas of European
Community permits are also available which
allow international haulage or cabotage (the
operation of domestic road haulage services
within a member state by a non-resident)
anywhere within the Community. The
European Conference of Transport Ministers
also issues permits valid throughout all
member states. Full liberalisation of
international road haulage within the
Community will apply from 1 January 1993.
PASSENGER SERVICES
Major changes in the structure of the
passenger transport industry have occurred in
recent years. Privatisation of the National Bus
321
BRITAIN 1993: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Company (which was the largest single bus
and coach operator in Britain, operating
through 72 subsidiaries in England and
Wales) was completed in 1988. Each
subsidiary was sold separately, and
encouragement was given for a buy-out by
the local management or employees. The
privatisation as ten separate companies of the
Scottish Bus Group, formerly the largest
operator of bus services in Scotland with
some 3,000 vehicles, was completed in 1991.
Legislation also facilitated the privatisation of
bus services run by municipal authorities.
The Government is committed to the
privatisation of the remaining local authority
bus companies.
London Transport (LT) is a statutory
corporation, with its board members
appointed by the Secretary of State for
Transport. Within LT the main wholly
owned operating subsidiaries are London
Underground Ltd and London Buses Ltd.
Financial support—almost entirely for capital
projects—is provided by central government.
LT is required to involve the private sector
in the provision of services where this is
more efficient, and has been set objectives on
safety, the quality of services and on its
financial performance. Many London bus
routes are now run by private firms operating
under contract to LT.
In December 1991 the Government
announced a package of at least £10
million over two years to support local
authority measures to promote bus
use in England. Some £3 7 million of
this has been allocated to 26 local
authorities for 1992-93 to support
schemes such as redesigning junctions
and providing passenger information
systems. An allocation of £500,000 has
been announced for similar schemes
in Wales.
In Northern Ireland almost all road
passenger services are provided by
subsidiaries of the publicly owned Northern
Ireland Transport Holding Company.
Citybus Ltd operates services in the city of
Belfast and Ulsterbus Ltd operates most of
the services in the rest of Northern Ireland.
These companies have some 300 and 1,000
vehicles respectively.
As well as major bus operators, there are
also a large number of small, privately owned
undertakings, often operating fewer than five
vehicles. Double-deck buses are the main
type of vehicle used for urban road passenger
transport in Britain, with some 22,000 in
operation. However, there has been a
substantial increase in the number of mini¬
buses and midibuses in recent years, with
some 20,000 now in use. In addition, there
are some 30,000 other single-deck buses and
coaches.
International Travel
British coaches regularly travel across the
continent of Europe, carrying passengers as
far afield as Greece. Some coach services still
require authorisation or permission from the
authorities of countries to or through which
they travel. However, an increasing number
do not need this, particularly within the
European Community, including holiday
shuttle services where accommodation is
included as part of the package.
Deregulation
Local bus services in Great Britain (except in
London) were deregulated in 1986. Bus
operators are now able to run routes without
needing a special licence. Local authorities can
subsidise the provision of socially necessary
services after competitive tendering. Six
weeks’ notice of the introduction, variation or
cancellation of a service has to be given to the
appropriate traffic commissioner (one for each
of the eight traffic areas of Great Britain).
Deregulation led to an increase of 19 per
cent in local bus mileage outside London
between 1985-86 and 1990-91, with some 84
per cent of services operated without subsidy
in 1990-91. Over the same period the
number of passengers has fallen by 19 per
cent outside London, in line with long-term
trends. Deregulation also had a noticeable
effect during the 1980s on long-distance
express coach services, bringing about
reductions in fares, the provision of more
services and an increase in passengers.
322
TRANSPORT AND COMMUNICATIONS
The Government is proposing the
deregulation of bus services in London and
the privatisation of London Buses Ltd, for
which legislation would be necessary.
Deregulation is unlikely before 1995. The
privatisation of London Buses Ltd
subsidiaries would then take place about a
year later. A new London Bus Executive
would be created to undertake certain
functions which the market would have little
incentive to provide or which would benefit
from central co-ordination. Provision would
be made for the operation of socially
necessary but uneconomic services and for
the continuation of a London-wide
concessionary travel scheme.
Taxis
There are about 51,000 licensed taxis in
Great Britain, mainly in urban areas;
London has some 16,000. In London and a
number of other cities taxis must be
purpose-built to conform to very strict
requirements and new ones have to provide
for people in wheelchairs. In most cases,
drivers must have passed a test of their
knowledge of the area. Private hire vehicles
with drivers may be booked only through
the operator and not hired on the street; in
most areas outside London private hire
vehicles are licensed. The Government is
considering whether a licensing regime is
needed in London.
A local authority can only limit the
number of licensed taxis if it is satisfied that
there is no unfulfilled demand for taxis in
its area. Taxi operators are able to run
regular local services and can tender in
competition with bus operators for services
subsidised by local authorities. To do this,
they may apply for a special ‘restricted’ bus
operator’s licence, allowing them to run local
services without having to obtain a full bus
operator’s licence. Taxis and licensed private
hire vehicles may also offer shared rides to
passengers paying separate fares.
In Northern Ireland there are some 4,000
licensed taxis. Licences are issued by the
Department of the Environment for
Northern Ireland on a basis broadly similar
to that in Great Britain.
RAILWAYS
Railways were pioneered in Britain: the
Stockton and Darlington Railway, opened in
1825, was the first public passenger railway
in the world to be worked by steam power.
The main railway companies in Great Britain
were nationalised in 1948. In Northern
Ireland the Northern Ireland Railways
Company Ltd, a subsidiary of the Northern
Ireland Transport Holding Company,
operates the railway service on some 320 km
(200 miles) of track.
Organisation
The British Railways Board, set up in 1962,
controls most of the railway network in Great
Britain. Of its five business sectors, InterCity,
Network SouthEast and Regional Railways
services are responsible for the passenger
services. The. other two sectors are Railfreight
Distribution and Trainload Freight. A
subsidiary company, European Passenger
Services Ltd, has been set up to operate
international rail services through the
Channel Tunnel. Other subsidiary businesses
are British Rail Maintenance Ltd, which is
responsible for maintenance and light repair
of British Rail rolling stock; Transmark,
which provides consultancy services overseas
on railway and associated operations; and BR
Telecommunications, a new company
marketing communications services. British
Rail is currently developing its sector
structure further to devolve decision-making
from the Board’s headquarters. The aim is to
make the sectors more responsive to customer
requirements.
The Government wishes to bring better
rail services for all passengers as rapidly as
possible. It considers that the franchising of
services to the private sector provides the
best way to achieve this. Its proposals,
published in July 1992, include:
• the franchising of all British Rail’s
existing passenger services to the private
sector;
• the transfer of British Rail’s existing
freight and parcels operations to the
private sector;
323
BRITAIN 1993: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
• the creation of a new right of access to
the rail network for private operators of
both passenger and freight services;
• the reorganisation of British Rail’s
internal structures into one part,
Railtrack, that will continue to be
responsible for operating all track and
infrastructure, and another that will
operate passenger services until they are
all franchised out to the private sector;
• the creation of two independent
authorities responsible to the
Government—a Rail Regulator to oversee
the application of arrangements for track
access and charging, and a Franchising
Authority responsible for negotiating,
awarding and monitoring franchises;
• the provision of opportunities for the
private sector to buy or lease stations;
and
• improved grant arrangements for
individual rail services or groups of
services.
Operations
In 1991-92 the Board’s turnover, including
financial support and income from other
activities but excluding internal transactions,
was £3,948 million, of which £3,021 million
was derived from rail passenger services and
£680 million from freight services. It
received grants of £890 million as
compensation for the public service obligation
to operate sections of the passenger network
in the Regional sector and Network
SouthEast which would not otherwise cover
their cost.
Under the Citizen’s Charter, British Rail
has agreed detailed service standards with the
Government for InterCity, Network
SouthEast and Regional Railways sectors.
The Passenger’s Charter was published in
March 1992. Automatic compensation will be
payable to passengers when these standards
are breached by more than a small margin.
Service is also being improved through better
information, staff training and extra assistance
for disabled passengers.
British Rail has a substantial investment
programme. Investment totalled £1,005
million in 1991-92 and is expected to remain
at about that level for the subsequent two
years. Major areas of expenditure in British
Rail’s investment programme include:
• rolling stock and facilities for Channel
Tunnel traffic from 1993 (see p 326);
• new rolling stock and infrastructure
improvements in Network SouthEast;
and
• investment in new diesel multiple-unit
trains in the Regional Railways sector.

a In addition, a number of privately owned wagons and locomotives are operated on the railway network for customers of
British Rail.
324
TRANSPORT AND COMMUNICATIONS
Safety is a key objective; expenditure on
specific safety measures in 1991-92 was £225
million. The numbers of significant accidents
per million train miles in 1989 and 1990
were the lowest on record. A Railway Code,
designed to educate the public on the safe
use of the railway system, was launched in
1991.
Passenger Services
The passenger network (see map on inside
back cover) comprises a fast inter-city
network, linking the main centres of Great
Britain; local stopping services; and
commuter services in and around the large
conurbations, especially London and south¬
east England. British Rail runs over 700
InterCity expresses each weekday, serving
about 90 business and leisure centres.
InterCity 125 trains, travelling at maximum
sustained speeds of 201 km/h (125 mph),
provide over 40 per cent of InterCity train
mileage and are the world’s fastest diesel
trains. They operate from London:
• to the west of England and south Wales;
• to the East Midlands; and
• on cross-country services through the
West Midlands, linking south-west
England or south Wales with north-west
England or north-east England and
Edinburgh.
With the introduction of the new electric
InterCity 225 trains, British Rail now has
more trains running at over 160 km/h (100
mph) than any other railway.
About 28 per cent of route-mileage is
electrified, including British Rail’s busiest
InterCity route, linking London, the West
Midlands, the North West and Glasgow.
The most recent major electrification scheme
was that for the east-coast main line between
London and Edinburgh (including the line
from Doncaster to Leeds). This scheme,
covering some 644 km (400 miles) and
costing £450 million at 1990-91 prices,
commenced full passenger services between
London King’s Cross and Edinburgh in July
1991, using InterCity 225 electric trains.
A new generation of diesel multiple-unit
trains is being introduced on regional
services, while many of the older electric
multiple units used for commuting services in
London and south-east England are being
replaced by more efficient rolling stock. The
first of a new generation of ‘Networker’ trains
was due to enter service in Kent in October
1992. Some 400 coaches will be progressively
introduced, with a further 274 on order. A
diesel version is being brought into service on
lines to the west of London, with 180
vehicles due to be delivered between 1992
and 1994. Three major new rail links to
airports have been built or are planned:
• a new link between Stansted airport and
London Liverpool Street, which opened
in March 1991;
• a joint venture with BAA pic for a £235
million project (to be financed largely by
BAA) between Heathrow airport and
London Paddington, scheduled to be
ready by the end of 1996; and
• a link to connect Manchester airport to
the Manchester to Wilmslow (Cheshire)
line, currently under construction.
Freight
Over 90 per cent of rail freight traffic is of
bulk commodities, mainly coal, coke, iron and
steel, building materials and petroleum.
The opening of the Channel Tunnel (see
p 326) will present an important opportunity
for non-bulk freight movement. Freight
routes in Kent and Sussex are being
upgraded in preparation for the traffic, and
new locomotives are being purchased.
Container traffic to the continent of Europe
and further afield is being developed and new
container-carrying wagons have been ordered.
Services are being developed to give easy
transfer of loads between road and rail, using
vehicles that can be configured for travel on
either road or rail.
Railways in London
London Underground Ltd (LUL) operates
services on 394 km (245 miles) of railway, of
which about 169 km (105 miles) are
underground. The system has 248 stations,
with 478 trains operating in the peak period.
325
BRITAIN 1993: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Some 751 million passenger journeys were
made on London Underground trains in
1991-92. Major investment in the
Underground is planned, including:
• an extension of the Jubilee Line to
Stratford (east London) via Docklands
and the north Greenwich peninsula;
• CrossRail, linking Paddington with
Liverpool Street, the tunnel of which
would be used by British Rail as well as
Underground trains; and
• a new line running through central
London from Chelsea in the west to
Hackney in the north-east.
These three projects would cost a total of
about £5,000 million at 1990 prices. Much
work is also under way on the existing
system, including a £750 million
modernisation of the Central Line and the
refurbishment of over 200 trains at a cost of
£145 million. LUL expects to invest at least
£1,000 million in safety improvements by the
end of the 1990s; total investment will rise to
well over £700 million a year from 1993-94.
The Docklands Light Railway (DLR), a
12-km (7-5-mile) route with 17 stations,
provides a service between the City of
London and Docklands. An extension
eastward to Beckton is under construction
and the line may be extended to Lewisham
(south-east London) through a tunnel under
the River Thames. The ownership of the
DLR was transferred from LT to the London
Docklands Development Corporation in April
1992.
The first stage of a new light railway
project proposed by London Transport and
the London Borough of Croydon for the
Croydon area of south London is under way.
The Tramlink network, which will link with
the British Rail network at Wimbledon, could
be ready by 1996.
Other Urban Railways
Other urban railways in Great Britain are the
Glasgow Underground and the Tyne and
Wear Metro, a 59-km (37-mile) light rapid
transit system which has recently been
extended to serve Newcastle International
Airport. In Greater Manchester the first
phase of the 31-km (19-mile) Metrolink light
rail system was officially opened in July 1992.
It is owned by the Greater Manchester
Passenger Transport Executive and was
designed and built, and is operated and
maintained by, GMML, a private sector
consortium. It links Manchester’s main
railway termini with Bury and Altrincham. In
Sheffield and the surrounding district (South
Yorkshire), a 29-km (18-mile) light rail
system is being constructed. Midland Metro,
a major light rail project in the West
Midlands, has been approved by Parliament.
Light rail schemes are being considered in a
number of other areas, including Bristol,
Cardiff, Chester, Cleveland, Edinburgh,
Glasgow, Nottingham, Leeds and
Portsmouth.
Private Railways
There are over 70 small, privately owned
passenger-carrying railways in Great Britain,
mostly operated on a voluntary basis and
providing limited services for tourists and
railway enthusiasts. The main aim of most of
these railways is the preservation and
operation of steam locomotives. They are
generally run on old British Rail branch lines,
but there are also several narrow-gauge lines,
mainly in north Wales.
Channel Tunnel
Construction work is almost complete on the
Channel Tunnel, the largest civil engineering
project in Europe to be financed by the
private sector. Services in the twin single-
track rail tunnels between Britain and France
are due to start in the second half of 1993.
The project, with a total financing
requirement of over £8,000 million, is being
undertaken by Eurotunnel, a British-French
group. A concession agreement between the
British and French governments and
Eurotunnel gives Eurotunnel the right to
operate the tunnel for 55 years. Construction
is being carried out for Eurotunnel by
Transmanche Link, a consortium of ten
British and French construction companies.
The first link-up under the Channel, that of
326
TRANSPORT AND COMMUNICATIONS
the central service tunnel, took place in
December 1990, and break-through of the
two rail tunnels was achieved in mid-1991.
Eurotunnel Services
Eurotunnel will operate shuttle trains through
the tunnel between the terminals at Cheriton
(near Folkestone) and Coquelles (near Calais),
with the journey taking about 35 minutes
from terminal to terminal. Eurotunnel trains
will provide a drive-on, drive-off service, with
separate shuttle trains for passenger and
freight vehicles. Car and coach passengers
will stay with their vehicles during the
journey. Eurotunnel is planning to run
passenger shuttle services every 15 minutes
during peak periods and freight shuttle
services every 20 minutes. As traffic
grows, the frequency of services will be
increased.
Through Rail Services
Some 30 high-speed through passenger
services are planned to run each day between
London (Waterloo) and Paris, and London
and Brussels. Specially-designed international
rolling stock is on order to provide through
day passenger services from the Midlands,
northern England and Scotland to the
Continent; these trains will come into service
in early 1995. Overnight services are also
planned. The locations of nine regional
depots to handle freight traffic to the
Continent have been announced. British Rail
plans to invest some £1,400 million in new
passenger and freight rolling stock and
infrastructure; over £800 million has already
been approved by the Secretary of State for
Transport.
To meet the forecast growth in demand
for through rail services, additional capacity
will eventually be required between London
and the Channel Tunnel. The Government
has announced a route for a new high-speed
rail link crossing the River Thames east of
London and approaching London through
Essex; it intends that this project should be
taken forward by the private sector, but
detailed planning on the route is in the
interim being undertaken by British Rail.
INLAND WATERWAYS
Inland waterways are popular for recreation,
make a valuable contribution to the quality
of Britain’s environment, play an important
part in land drainage and water supply, and
are used to a limited extent for freight¬
carrying. An official survey of inland
waterway freight traffic reported that in
1990, 69 million tonnes of freight were
carried on inland waterways and estuaries,
amounting to some 2,400 million tonne-km
moved. The most significant amounts of
freight were carried on the Rivers Thames,
Forth, Humber and Mersey and the
Manchester Ship Canal. The publicly
owned British Waterways Board (BWB) is
responsible for some 3,200 km (2,000 miles)
of waterways in Great Britain. The majority
of waterways are primarily for leisure use,
but about 620 km (385 miles) are
maintained as commercial waterways. The
BWB is in the process of developing its
business more commercially, with greater
responsiveness to market needs and
waterway users. In 1991-92 the BWB’s
turnover amounted to £77 9 million and it
received a government grant of £49-7
million to maintain its waterways to
statutory standards.
Shipping and Ports
In December 1991 British companies
owned 785 trading vessels of 14-8 million
deadweight tonnes. Among the ships
owned by British companies were 200
vessels totalling 8-8 million deadweight
tonnes used as oil, chemical or gas carriers
and 556 vessels totalling 5-6 million
deadweight tonnes employed as dry bulk
carriers, container ships or other types of
cargo ships. Some 80 per cent of British-
owned vessels are registered in Britain or
British dependent territories such as
Bermuda.
The tonnage of the British-registered
trading fleet has been declining in recent
years. In recognition of this and in response
to the 1990 report of a joint government
and shipping industry working party, the
327
BRITAIN 1993: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Government has simplified technical
procedures and regulations governing ship
registration requirements. The Government
also has work in hand designed to:
• introduce flexibility into the rules
governing the nationality of officers on
British ships;
• allow chartered-in vessels to be registered
in Britain; and
• secure the liberalisation of cabotage and a
more competitive financial environment,
both within Europe and on a wider
international basis.
The Government also makes funds
available for Merchant Navy officer training,
the repatriation of crews in the deep-sea
trades and to support a Reserve of ex¬
seafarers willing to serve in the Merchant
Navy in an emergency.
Cargo Services
About 94 per cent by weight (77 per cent by
value) of Britain’s overseas trade is carried by
sea. In 1991 British seaborne trade amounted
to 300 million tonnes (valued at £169,000
million) or 1,150,000 million tonne-km
(714,000 million tonne-miles). British-
registered ships carried 18 per cent by weight
and 35 per cent by value. Tanker cargo
accounted for 45 per cent of this trade by
weight, but only 7 per cent by value;
foodstuffs and manufactured goods accounted
for 83 per cent by value.
Virtually all the scheduled cargo liner
services from Britain are containerised. The
British tonnage serving these trades is
dominated by a relatively small number of
private sector companies and, in deep sea
trades, they usually operate in conjunction
with other companies on the same routes in
organisations known as ‘conferences’. The
object of these groupings is to ensure regular
and efficient services with stable freight rates,
to the benefit of both shipper and shipowner.
In addition to the carriage of freight by liner
and bulk services between Britain and
Europe, there are many roll-on, roll-off
services to carry cars, passengers and
commercial vehicles.
Passenger Services
In 1991 there were 31 million international
sea passenger movements between Britain and
the rest of the world, compared with some 72
million international air movements. Almost
all the passengers who arrived at or departed
from British ports in 1991 travelled to or
from the continent of Europe or the Irish
Republic. In 1991 some 89,000 people
embarked on pleasure cruises from British
ports. Traffic from the southern and south¬
eastern ports accounts for a substantial
proportion of traffic to the continent of
Europe. The main British operators are
Sealink Stena Line, P & O and Hoverspeed,
although not all of their vessels are under the
British flag. Services are provided by roll-on,
roll-off ferries, hovercraft, hydrofoils and
high-speed catamarans. Domestic passenger
and freight ferry services also run to many of
the offshore islands, such as the Isle of
Wight, the Orkney and Shetland islands, and
the islands off the west coast of Scotland. It
is estimated that in 1990 there were some 37
million passengers on such internal services.
Merchant Shipping Legislation and
Policy
The Government’s policy is one of minimum
intervention and the encouragement of free
and fair competition. However, regulations
administered by the Department of
Transport provide for marine safety and
welfare, the investigation of accidents and the
prevention and cleaning up of pollution from
ships.
The Government also plays an important
role in the formulation of shipping policy
within the European Community. The first
stage of a Common Shipping Policy involved
agreement in 1986 on regulations designed to:
• liberalise the Community’s international
trade;
• establish a competitive regime for
shipping; and
• enable the Community to take action to
combat protectionism from other
countries and to counter unfair pricing
practices.
328
TRANSPORT AND COMMUNICATIONS
For the second stage, now under
consideration, a range of measures have been
proposed to harmonise operating conditions
and strengthen the competitiveness of
Community members’ merchant fleets. One
such measure, facilitating the transfer of ships
between member states’ registers, has already
been agreed.
Ports
There are about 80 ports of commercial
significance in Great Britain, and in addition
there are several hundred small harbours
which cater for local cargo, fisheries, island
ferries or recreation. Port authorities are of
three broad types—trusts, local authorities
and companies—and most operate with
statutory powers under private Acts of
Parliament. Major ports controlled by trusts
include Dover, Ipswich, London, Milford
Haven and Tyne. Local authorities own many
small ports and a few much larger ports,
including Portsmouth and the oil ports in
Orkney and Shetland.
Associated British Ports Holdings PLC (a
private sector company) operates 23 ports,
including Southampton, Grimsby and
Immingham, Hull, Newport, Cardiff and
Swansea. Other major ports owned by
companies include Felixstowe, Liverpool,
Manchester and a group of ferry ports,
including Harwich (Parkeston Quay) and
Stranraer.
The Ports Act 1991 facilitates the transfer
of trust ports to the private sector; Clyde,
Forth, Medway, Tees and Hartlepool and
the Port of London Authority dock
undertaking at Tilbury have already moved
to the private sector.
Port Traffic
In 1991 traffic through the ports of Britain
amounted to 493 million tonnes, comprising
143 million tonnes of exports, 183 million
tonnes of imports and 167 million tonnes of
domestic traffic (which included offshore
traffic and landings of sea-dredged
aggregates). About 55 per cent of the traffic
was in fuels, mainly petroleum and
petroleum products.
Britain’s main ports, in terms of total
tonnage handled, are given in Table 17-3.
Sullom Voe (Shetland), Milford Haven and
Forth mostly handle oil, while the main
ports for non-fuel traffic are London, Tees
and Hartlepool, Grimsby and Immingham,
Felixstowe and Dover.
Container and roll-on, roll-off traffic in
Britain has almost trebled since 1975 to 88
million tonnes in 1991 and now accounts for
about 77 per cent of non-bulk traffic. The
leading ports for container traffic are
Felixstowe, London and Southampton.
Those for roll-on, roll-off traffic are Dover
(Britain’s leading seaport in terms of the
value of trade handled), Felixstowe,
Portsmouth, Grimsby and Immingham, and
Harwich.

Development
Most recent major port developments have
been at east- and south-coast ports. For
example, at Felixstowe a £50 million
extension to the terminal was completed in
1990, and a new £100 million terminal on the
Medway caters for deep-sea container traffic.
Purpose-built terminals for oil from the
British sector of the North Sea have been
built at Hound Point on the Forth, on the
Tees, at Flotta and at Sullom Voe (one of the
largest oil terminals in the world). Supply
bases for offshore oil and gas installations
have been built at a number of ports, notably
Aberdeen, Great Yarmouth and Heysham.
Safety at Sea
HM Coastguard Service, part of the
Department of Transport, is responsible for
co-ordinating civil maritime search and rescue
operations around the coastline of Britain. In
a maritime emergency the Coastguard calls
on and co-ordinates facilities such as:
• Coastguard helicopters and cliff rescue
companies;
• lifeboats of the Royal National Lifeboat
Institution (a voluntary body);
• Ministry of Defence aeroplanes,
helicopters and ships; and
• merchant shipping and commercial
aircraft.
The establishment of new coastal search
and rescue consultative committees was
announced in March 1992. These will
improve liaison between the Coastguards,
potential users of the rescue services and
interested authorities.
In 1991 the Coastguard Service co¬
ordinated action in some 7,200
incidents (including cliff rescues), in
which 13,000 people were assisted.
Compliance with rules of behaviour when
navigating in traffic separation schemes
around the shores of Britain is mandatory for
all vessels of countries party to the
Convention on the International Regulations
for Preventing Collisions at Sea 1972. The
most important scheme affecting British
waters is in the Dover Strait, the world’s
busiest seaway. Britain and France jointly
operate the Channel Navigation Information
System, which provides navigational
information and also monitors the movement
of vessels in the strait. A new radar system
will come into service in 1993, providing
increased coverage of the area.
The lighthouse authorities, which between
them control about 370 lighthouses and many
minor lights and buoys, are:
• the Corporation of Trinity House, which
covers England, Wales and the Channel
Islands;
• the Northern Lighthouse Board, for
Scotland and the Isle of Man; and
• the Commissioners of Irish Lights for
Ireland.
They are funded mainly by light dues
levied on shipping in Britain and Ireland.
The Ports Act 1991 provided for the transfer
of certain lights and buoys to harbour
authorities where these are used mainly for
local rather than general navigation.
Responsibility for pilotage rests with harbour
authorities under the Pilotage Act 1987.
Among measures to improve the safety of
roll-on, roll-off ferries introduced following
the loss of the Herald of Free Enterprise in
1987 is a duty on shipowners to ensure the
safe operation of their vessels, as well as a
wide range of technical measures. Most
measures introduced by Britain have been
incorporated in the relevant international
maritime safety conventions.
Civil Aviation
An innovative British air transport industry
responds to the demands of both
international and domestic passengers.
Airlines are seeking opportunities for
modernisation, and this is complemented by
the work of the aviation authorities in
negotiating new international rights and
improving facilities such as air traffic control.
British airlines are entirely in the private
sector, as are a number of the major airports.
330
TRANSPORT AND COMMUNICATIONS
Role of the Government
The Secretary of State for Transport is
responsible for aviation matters, including:
• negotiation of air service agreements with
more than 100 other countries;
• control of air services into Britain by
overseas airlines;
• British participation in the activities of
international aviation bodies;
• aviation security policy;
• environmental matters, such as aircraft
noise and emissions;
• investigation of accidents; and
• airports policy.
The Government’s civil aviation policy
aims to maintain high standards of safety and
security and to achieve environmental
improvements through reduced noise and
other emissions from aircraft. It is concerned
to promote the interests of travellers by
encouraging a competitive British industry,
and is committed to encouraging more
international services to and from regional
airports. The Government has taken the lead
in the European Community and with
bilateral partners in negotiating freer
arrangements within which airline
competition can flourish; agreement was
reached within the European Community in
June 1992 on a further package of
liberalisation measures. New arrangements
with an increasing number of countries are
resulting in better provision of services at
more competitive fares.
Civil Aviation Authority
The Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) is an
independent statutory body, responsible for
the economic and safety regulation of the
industry and, jointly with the Ministry of
Defence, for the provision of air navigation
services. The CAA’s primary objectives are to
ensure that British airlines provide air
services to satisfy all substantial categories of
public demand at the lowest charges
consistent with a high standard of safety and
to further the reasonable interests of air
transport users.
Air Traffic
Total capacity offered on all services by
British airlines amounted to 20,100 million
available tonne-km in 1991: 15,200 million
tonne-km on scheduled services and 4,920
million tonne-km on non-scheduled services.
The airlines carried 34 6 million passengers
on scheduled services and 21 1 million on
charter flights; some 72-8 million passengers
travelled by air (international terminal
passengers) to or from Britain, a 6 per cent
decrease on 1990.
The value of Britain’s overseas trade
carried by air in 1991 was some £41,900
million—20 per cent of exports by value and
18 per cent of imports. Air freight is
important for the carriage of goods with a
high value-to-weight ratio, especially where
speed of movement is essential.
British Airways
British Airways pic is one of the world’s
leading airlines. In terms of international
scheduled services it is the largest in the
world. During 1991-92 British Airways’
turnover was £5,220 million (including
£4,800 million from airline operations), and
the British Airways group carried 24-8
million passengers on scheduled and charter
flights both domestically and internationally.
The British Airways scheduled route
network serves 153 destinations in 69
countries. Its main operating base is
London’s Heathrow airport, but services from
Gatwick and regional centres such as
Manchester and Birmingham have been
expanding. Scheduled Concorde supersonic
services are operated from London Heathrow
to New York, Washington and, in the
summer, Toronto, crossing the Atlantic in
about half the time taken by subsonic aircraft.
In March 1992 British Airways had a fleet of
230 aircraft, the largest fleet in Western
Europe, comprising 7 Concordes, 53 Boeing
747s, 8 McDonnell-Douglas DC-lOs, 6
Lockheed TriStars, 37 Boeing 757s, 10
Airbus A320s, 54 Boeing 737s, 16 Boeing
767s, 24 BAC One-Elevens, 13 BAe
Advanced Turboprops and 2 BAe 748s. A
total of 82 aircraft were on firm order.
331
BRITAIN 1993: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Other Airlines
About 500 aircraft are operated by other
airlines. Britannia Airways is the world’s
largest charter airline, undertaking flights
from 20 British airports to more than 100
destinations in Europe and elsewhere. It
carried over 6 million passengers in 1991. It
has 39 aircraft. British Midland operates a
large network of scheduled services, and is
strongly represented in regional as well as
European networks. It possesses 25 aircraft.
Air UK operates scheduled passenger
services to Europe, and is the only British
airline to operate from all three main airports
in the London area (Heathrow, Gatwick and
Stansted). It has 29 aircraft. Dan-Air
Services is a major operator of both
scheduled and charter services, and had a
fleet of 39 aircraft in 1991. It intends to
concentrate its fleet on just two types, the
Boeing 737 and BAe 146. Virgin Atlantic
operates scheduled services between Britain
and several North American destinations,
and to Tokyo. It also operates charter flights
to Florida. It has eight aircraft.
Helicopters and Other Aerial Work
Helicopters are engaged on a variety of work,
especially operations connected with Britain’s
offshore oil and gas industry. The three main
operators in Britain are Bristow Helicopters,
Bond Helicopters and British International
Helicopters, with 63, 50 and 27 helicopters
respectively. Light aircraft and helicopters
are also involved in other activities, such as
charter operations, search and rescue
services, medical evacuation, crop-spraying,
aerial survey and photography, and police
operations.
Air Safety
The CAA is responsible for both technical
and operational air safety. Its Safety
Regulation Group deals with the
development and application of safety
requirements for all civil aviation operations.
It licenses flight crew, ground engineers and
air traffic control officers, as well as
aerodromes and fire and rescue services.
Training of air traffic controllers is also
provided by the CAA.
Every company operating aircraft used for
commercial purposes must possess an Air
Operator’s Certificate, which is granted by
the CAA when it is satisfied that the operator
is competent to secure the safe operation of
its aircraft. The CAA’s flight operations
inspectors, all of whom are experienced
airline pilots, and airworthiness surveyors
check that satisfactory standards are
maintained.
Each member of the flight crew of a
British-registered aircraft, every ground
engineer who certifies an aircraft fit to fly,
and every air traffic controller must hold the
appropriate official licence issued by the
CAA. Except for those with acceptable
military or other qualifying experience, all
applicants for a first professional licence must
have undertaken a full-time course of
instruction which has been approved by the
CAA.
Air Traffic Control and Navigation
Services
Responsibility for civil and military air traffic
control over Britain and the surrounding seas
rests with the National Air Traffic Services
(NATS), jointly operated by the CAA and
the Ministry of Defence. At 13 civil
aerodromes, including most of the major
British airports, the NATS provides the
navigation services necessary for aircraft
taking off and landing, and integrates them
into the flow of traffic within British airspace.
Britain plays a major role in European air
traffic control developments through
participation in a number of international
fora. Britain has put forward several
European initiatives, including the centralised
management of traffic flows throughout
Europe, which is being progressively
implemented over the period 1991-95.
Within Britain, NATS has an investment
programme currently running at around £80
million a year, which includes the
construction of a new air traffic control
centre for England and Wales, due to be
completed in 1996. Schemes for a new centre
for Scotland are under consideration.
332
TRANSPORT AND COMMUNICATIONS
Aircraft and the Environment
The replacement of older aircraft with new
quieter types has done much to reduce the
problem of noise near airports, as have noise
abatement measures such as noise-preferential
routes, night restrictions and noise insulation.
A new noise monitoring system for
Heathrow, Gatwick and Stansted airports was
announced in February 1992. The system,
which is expected to be installed by late 1992,
will help to ensure that aircraft are operated
in a way that minimises disturbance to local
communities.
Research is in hand on the effect of
aircraft emissions on the upper atmosphere to
help regulators decide what measures may be
needed, including possible changes to
international emission standards for aircraft.
Airports
Of the 144 licensed civil aerodromes in
Britain, about one-fifth handle more than
100,000 passengers a year each. Twelve
handle over 1 million passengers a year each
(see Table 17.4). In 1991 Britain’s civil
airports handled a total of 97-3 million
passengers (95-8 million terminal passengers
and 1-5 million in transit), and 11 million
tonnes of freight. Heathrow airport is the
world’s busiest airport for international travel
and is Britain’s most important airport for
passengers and air freight, handling 40-5
million passengers (including transit
passengers) and 655,000 tonnes of freight in
1991. Gatwick is also one of the world’s
busiest international airports.
Ownership and Control
Seven airports—Heathrow, Gatwick, Stansted
and Southampton in south-east England, and
Glasgow, Edinburgh and Aberdeen in
Scotland—are owned and operated by BAA
pic. Together they handle about 75 per cent
of air passengers and 80 per cent of air cargo
traffic in Britain.
Many of the other airports are controlled
by local authorities. A total of 15 major local
authority airports now operate as Companies
Act companies. The Government is
encouraging the introduction of private
capital into these new companies. It is
intended that Belfast International Airport be
privatised in early 1994.
The CAA has responsibility for the
economic regulation of the larger airports. It
has powers to take action to remedy practices
considered to be unreasonable or unfair, in
particular any abuse of an airport’s monopoly
position and also to limit increases in charges
to airlines at certain airports. All airports
used for public transport and training flights
must also be licensed by the CAA for reasons
of safety. Stringent requirements, such as the
provision of adequate fire-fighting, medical
and rescue services, must be satisfied before a

licence is granted. Strict security measures
are in force, and the Aviation and Maritime
Security Act 1990 provides for greater
powers to enforce security requirements.
Development
The Government’s policy is to:
• promote a strong and competitive British
airline industry by encouraging the
provision of airport capacity where it is
needed;
• encourage the use and development of
regional airports; and
• minimise the impact of airports on the
environment.
Major expansion has been undertaken at
Stansted. A new terminal was opened in
March 1991, with an initial capacity of 8
million passengers a year. After further
expansion it will cater for 15 million
passengers a year. Under major expansion
plans at Manchester, the first phase of a
second terminal is under construction and is
due to open in spring 1993, increasing
capacity by one-half to 18 million passengers
a year. A second terminal at Birmingham was
opened in 1991, increasing capacity to 6
million passengers a year. Facilities are also
being improved at other regional airports.
In February 1992 the Government
announced a study of possible sites for a
heliport in central London. The study is
considering suitable sites but will not
recommend a specific location. It will
examine whether London could enjoy the
benefits of a permanent heliport close to the
centre without undue environmental
disturbance.
Communications
The telecommunications industry is one of
the most rapidly growing sectors of the
British economy. Major changes occurred in
the 1980s with the progressive introduction
of competition into the markets for
telecommunications equipment and services.
In 1984, British Telecommunications (BT)
was privatised, and has faced competition
from Mercury Communications in the
provision of services over fixed links.
Competitive mobile, satellite and data services
have been licensed. The Telecommunications
Act 1984 established a regulatory regime, the
main feature of which is the establishment of
an independent industry regulator, the
Director General of Telecommunications.
Duopoly Review
In 1991 a major review of government
telecommunications policy resulted in the
publication of a White Paper Competition and
Choice: Telecommunications Policy for the
1990s. This stated that the Government
would consider sympathetically applications
from companies wishing to run fixed
telecommunications networks, ending the
‘duopoly policy’, under which only BT and
Mercury were permitted to run such systems.
By mid-1992, the Government had received
41 applications of this kind. Other important
points of the review were:
• greater freedom for existing mobile
telecommunications operators and the
ability of cable television operators to
provide services in their own right;
• more effective and streamlined
procedures for the interconnection of
systems, giving OFTEL (see p 335) the
power to set interconnection terms where
agreement could not be reached between
the parties;
• the introduction of ‘equal access’, by
which customers can exercise choice over
the trunk operator that carries their calls;
• the introduction of new class licences for
satellite systems and to enable companies
to build and operate their own
telecommunications systems; and
• the establishment of a new national
numbering scheme, and the modification
of operators’ licences to allow for the
introduction of number portability.
The Government concluded that it would
be unlikely to license any new international
operators to establish their own system in the
short term. However, the resale of capacity
on international leased circuits has already
334
TRANSPORT AND COMMUNICATIONS
been liberalised where this involves the
conveyance of messages over a circuit
connected to the public network at one end
only. In addition, the Government is
discussing with other countries the possibility
of liberalising international simple resale—
that is, where messages are conveyed over an
international leased circuit connected to the
public network at both ends.
Office of Telecommunications
The Office of Telecommunications (OFTEL),
a non-ministerial government department, is
the independent regulatory body for the
telecommunications industry. It is headed by
the Director General of Telecommunications,
among whose functions are:
• to ensure that licensees comply with the
conditions of their licences;
• to initiate the modification of licence
conditions by agreement or a reference to
the Monopolies and Mergers
Commission;
• to promote effective competition in the
telecommunications industry;
• to provide advice to the Secretary of
State for Trade and Industry on
telecommunications matters; and
• to investigate complaints.
The Director General also has a duty
to promote the interests of consumers
in respect of prices, quality and variety in
telecommunications services.
Under the White Paper proposals,
OFTEL will be taking over responsibility for
administering the new national telephone
numbering scheme. They wdll also oversee the
introduction of a limited ‘number portability’
scheme, enabling someone wLo wished to
change service provider at the same address
to retain their existing number, rather than
change it, as at present.
BT
In 1984 BT was reconstituted as a public
limited company and a majority of the
ordinary voting shares were sold to private
investors. It has about 2 7 million registered
shareholders. More than 95 per cent of its
210,000 employees own shares and nearly 50
per cent are members of the Employee Share
Save Scheme. In December 1991 the
Government sold a further tranche of shares
in a public offer, reducing its holding in BT
to about 22 per cent.
BT runs one of the world’s largest public
telecommunications networks, including:
• 19-6 million residential lines;
• 6 million business lines;
• about 58,000 telex connections;
• more than 104,000 public payphones; and
• a wide range of specialised voice, data,
text and visual services.
The inland telephone and telex networks
are fully automatic. International direct
dialling is available from Britain to 200
countries, representing 99 per cent of the
world’s telephones. Automatic telex service is
available to more than 200 countries.
Network Modernisation
BT has invested more than £17,000 million
in the modernisation and expansion of its
network to meet the increasing demand for
basic telephone services and for more
specialised services. The company has more
than 2 million km (L2 million miles) of
optical fibre laid in its network in Britain, a
higher proportion than any other world
operator. There are more than 3,650 digital
and modern electronic exchanges serving
some 80 per cent of telephone lines. The
combination of digital exchange switching
and digital transmission techniques, using
optical fibre cable and microwave radio links,
is substantially improving the quality of
telephone services for residential and business
customers, as well as making possible a wider
range of services through the company’s main
network.
General Services
BT’s services include:
• a free facility for emergency calls to the
police, fire, ambulance, coastguard,
lifeboat and air-sea rescue services;
335
BRITAIN 1993: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
• directory enquiries;
• various chargeable operator-connected
services, such as reversed-charge calls
and alarm calls;
• an operator-handled Freefone service and
automatic ‘LinkLine’ facilities that enable
callers to contact organisations anywhere
in Britain, either free or at local call
rates;
• Callstream, a premium-rate service which
allows callers to obtain information from
independent providers; and
• network services such as three-way
calling, call waiting and call diversion,
which are available to customers on
digital exchanges.
Under a public payphone service
modernisation programme, a total of £165
million has been spent on modernisation and
additional provision on sites convenient for
travellers, such as railway stations and
motorway service areas. A number of cashless
call developments are being carried out,
including the Phonecard service, using
prepaid encoded cards, and cardphones that
use credit cards. Phonecard payphones
account for more than 19,000 of the total of
104,000 payphones. There are about
280,000 private rented payphones on
premises to which the public has access and
these are also being upgraded with push¬
button equipment.
Prestel, BT’s videotext service, and
Telecom Gold (an electronic mail and
information service) form part of the
company’s data services division, BT Tymnet
Europe. Prestel was the first service of its
kind to enable a wide variety of computer-
stored information to be called up via the
telephone on a computer, a terminal or an
adapted television. Up to 100,000 terminals
can connect to Prestel, primarily in
businesses. Through its ‘gateway’ links with
other databases, a wide range of other
services, such as company accounting and
market research information, banking
services, holiday booking and reservation
facilities, insurance and financial markets
information, and BT’s telephone directories,
are available.
International Services
BT is the second largest shareholder in the
International Telecommunications Satellite
Organisation (of which 120 countries are
members) and in the European
Telecommunications Satellite Organisation.
It is also a leading shareholder in the
International Maritime Satellite
Organisation, with interests in a number of
other consortia.
A substantial proportion of the
intercontinental telephone traffic to or from
Britain is carried by satellite. BT operates
satellite earth stations in the London
Docklands and at Goonhilly Downs
(Cornwall), Madley (near Hereford) and
Aberdeen. Its range of digital transmission
services includes a number available
overseas, including ‘Satstream’ private
circuit digital links covering North America
and Western Europe using small-dish
aerials, and an ‘International Kilostream’
private circuit service available to the United
States, Australia and most major business
centres in Asia and the rest of Europe.
Extensive direct-dial maritime satellite
services are available for vessels worldwide.
In-flight operator-controlled telephone call
facilities are available via Portishead radio
station near Bristol. Digital transmission
techniques have been introduced for services
to the United States, Japan, Hong Kong and
Australia via the Madley and Goonhilly
stations.
Recent advances in submarine cable
design, with the use of optical fibre
technology, have significantly increased
capacity. A high-capacity transatlantic
optical fibre cable (TAT 9), which cost
about £250 million and is able to carry
about 75,000 telephone calls simultaneously,
came into operation in March 1992 to
supplement an earlier link.
British Telecom’s overseas consultancy
service, Telconsult, has so far completed 270
projects in more than 60 countries.
Mercury Communications
Mercury Communications Ltd, a wholly
owned subsidiary of Cable and Wireless pic,
336
TRANSPORT AND COMMUNICATIONS
is licensed as a public telecommunications
operator in Britain. Mercury has constructed
its own long-distance all-digital network
comprising over 3,000 km (1,875 miles) of
optical fibre cables and 2,700 km (1,685
miles) of digital microwave links. The
network runs from the north of Scotland to
the south coast, serving some 88 cities and
towns across Britain. Coverage is enhanced
through Mercury’s own city cable networks as
well as through partnerships with local cable
television operators. Service is also provided
over microwave connections.
Mercury offers a full range of long¬
distance and international telecommunications
services for both business and residential
customers. In addition to voice and data
transmission, the company supplies
sophisticated messaging systems, mobile
telecommunications and a range of equipment
for customers’ premises. Major customers can
have a direct digital link between their
premises and the Mercury network. A
number of routeing devices have also been
developed to enable customers to use
Mercury indirectly via their existing exchange
lines. Residential customers can buy a
Mercury-compatible phone and access the
network at the touch of a button.
International services are provided by
satellite communications centres in London’s
docklands and in Oxfordshire, as well as by
submarine cable links to Europe and the
United States.
Mobile Communications
The Government has encouraged the
expansion of mobile telecommunications
services. It has licensed Vodafone Ltd and
Telecom Securicor Cellular Radio Ltd to run
competing national cellular radio systems.
Considerable investment has been made in
establishing their networks to provide
increased capacity for the growing numbers of
cellular radio telephone users (over L2
million by the end of 1991). The two
companies will also run the new pan-
European mobile system in Britain.
Britain will be the first country to offer
personal communications network (PCN)
services^ which are intended to allow the
same telephone to be used at home, at work
and as a portable wherever there is network
capacity. In 1991 the Government issued
licences to three operators—Mercury
Personal Communications Ltd, Microtel
Communications Ltd and Unitel Ltd (which
has since merged with Mercury Personal
Communications) to run PCNs in the
frequency range around L8 gigahertz. The
first service is expected to start in 1993.
Two operators, GEC National One and
Band 3 Radio Ltd, have been licensed to
offer a nationwide trunked radio service as a
joint venture, while a number of licences
have been awarded for London and regional
services. Licences have also been granted to a
number of companies to run nationwide
paging and mobile data networks.
In January 1992 the Government decided
in principle to license lonica L3 Ltd to set
up a new network to provide telephone and
other telecommunications services to homes
and businesses using radio to make the final
connection.
Fax
It is estimated that the number of fax
terminals in Britain rose from 86,000 in
December 1986 to 900,000 in December
1990.
Cable Television
The Government has licensed 119 companies
that were awarded local cable television
franchises to run broadband cable
telecommunications systems. The 45 systems
in operation provide television programmes,
but some are already offering interactive
services including local voice telephony. The
Government concluded in the duopoly review
that cable operators should be able to offer
voice telephony in their own right, which
could previously only be provided in
conjunction with BT or Mercury.
Cable & Wireless
Cable and Wireless pic provides a wide range
of telecommunications in some 50 countries
worldwide. Its main business is the provision
337
BRITAIN 1993: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
and operation of public telecommunications
services in over 30 countries and territories,
including the United States, Japan and Hong
Kong, under franchises and licences granted
by the governments concerned. It also
provides and manages telecommunications
services and facilities for public and private
sector customers, and undertakes consultancy
work. It operates a fleet of 11 ships and
three submersible vehicle systems for laying
and maintaining submarine
telecommunications cables. In recent years
the company has been constructing and
bringing into service a broadband digital
network linking major world economic and
financial centres in Europe, north America
and the Pacific rim. The first leg of this
‘Global Digital Highway’, the private
transatlantic optical fibre cable linking
Britain, the Irish Republic, the United States
and Bermuda, entered service in 1989, and
the North Pacific Cable, the first direct cable
between the United States and Japan,
entered service in 1991, connecting to other
optical fibre cables in the Pacific rim region.
Cable & Wireless is pursuing a strategy of
providing premium services for business
customers, expanding basic
telecommunications services and building up
mobile communications businesses around
the world.
POSTAL SERVICES
The Post Office, founded in 1635, pioneered
postal services and was the first to issue
adhesive postage stamps as proof of advance
payment for mail.
The Royal Mail provides deliveries to
24-5 million addresses and handles over 60
million letters and parcels each working day,
which comes to over 15,000 million items a
year. Some 166 million parcels were handled
in 1990-91. Mail is collected from over
120,000 posting boxes, as well as from post
offices and large postal users.
Mail sorting was traditionally done by
hand at some 600 offices of varying size and
capacity. During the past 20 years, however,
much of the process has been mechanised
and concentrated into larger offices. Some 80
such mechanised letter offices are now in
operation. The British postcode system is one
of the most sophisticated in the world,
allowing mechanised sorting down to part of
a street on a postman’s round and, in some
cases, to an individual address. The Post
Office’s parcels operation, Parcelforce, will be
investing £250 million over the next five
years in developing an advanced distribution
network and in other improvements. In July
1992 the Government announced its intention
to privatise Parcelforce in due course; an
essential requirement would be the
continuation of a universal parcel service at a
uniform and affordable tariff.
Britain has good international postal
services, with prices among the cheapest.
Royal Mail International dispatches 600
million items a year, including some 500
million by air. It has its own mail handling
centre at Heathrow, opened in 1989, which
handles some four-fifths of outward airmail.
It uses 1,400 flights a week to send mail
direct to over 300 destinations worldwide.
Post Office Counters Ltd handles a wide
range of transactions; it acts as an agent for
the letters and parcels businesses, government
departments, local authorities and Girobank,
which was transferred to the private sector in
1990. There are over 20,000 post offices, of
which some 1,050 are operated directly by
the Post Office. The remainder are franchise
offices or are operated on an agency basis by
sub-postmasters.
Post Office Specialist Services
The Post Office offers a range of specialist
services. Parcelforce ‘Datapost’, a door-to-
door delivery service, provides overnight
delivery throughout Britain and an
international service to over 160 countries.
‘Datapost Sameday’ provides a rapid delivery
within or between more than 100 cities and
towns in Britain. The Philatelic Bureau in
Edinburgh is an important outlet for the
Post Office’s philatelic business, including
sales to overseas collectors or dealers. The
British Postal Consultancy Service offers
advice and assistance on all aspects of postal
business to overseas postal administrations,
and nearly 40 countries have used its services
since 1965.
338
TRANSPORT AND COMMUNICATIONS
Competition in Postal Services
The Post Office has a monopoly on the
conveyance of letters within Britain, but the
Secretary of State for Trade and Industry has
the power to suspend the monopoly in
certain areas or for certain categories of mail
and to license others to provide competing
services. The Secretary of State has
suspended the monopoly on letters subject to
a minimum fee of £1, and has issued general
licences enabling mail to be transferred
between document exchanges and allowing
charitable organisations to carry Christmas
cards. The Government intends to introduce
wider competition in postal services by:
• the reduction of the present £1 letter
monopoly to a level much closer to the
price of a first-class stamp;
• an extended discount system, so that the
Post Office could offer further discounts
to users who carry their mail in bulk as
far as the final delivery office; and
• the licensing of ‘niche’ services under the
monopoly limit.
Under these proposals, the Secretary of State
would be advised by a new regulator on ways
of preventing the Post Office from cross¬
subsidising its services in ways which may be
unfair to its competitors or to specific groups
of customers.
Private Courier and Express Service
Operators
Private sector couriers and express operators
are able to handle time-sensitive door-to-door
deliveries, subject to a minimum fee of £1.
The courier/express service industry has
grown rapidly, by about 20 per cent a year,
and the revenue created by the carriage of
these items is estimated at over £3,000
million a year. Britain is one of the main
providers of monitored express deliveries in
Europe, with London an important centre for
air courier/express traffic.
339
18 Employment
Employment in Britain grew substantially
during the 1980s, although recently it has
declined as a result of the recession. There
was also a considerable decline in
unemployment during the late 1980s. This
represented the longest period of falling
unemployment since the second world war,
although in common with many other
industrialised countries unemployment has
risen during the 1990s.
The Government has taken a number of
steps to improve the labour market, with the
aim of creating an economic climate in which
business can flourish and create more jobs.
These include:
• increasing the flexibility of the labour
market;
• removing burdens on employers,
including regulatory barriers which
hinder recruitment; and
• encouraging better training, especially by
setting up Training and Enterprise
Councils and, in Scotland, Local
Enterprise Companies (see p 168).
In February 1992 the Government set out
its proposals for action to widen the
opportunities and choices for people at work
in a White Paper, People, Jobs and
Opportunity.
The Government supports a social
dimension to the European Community
which takes account of the different
employment patterns and practices in the 12
member states. It is committed to
Community action to facilitate the free
movement of workers and to ensure good
standards of health and safety at work and
equal treatment of men and women.
However, it believes that central regulation of
employment conditions in the Community
would restrict unnecessarily the freedom of
action of individual employers and
employees. It has therefore opposed proposals
for a European Social Charter based on wider
Community regulation and Community-wide
restrictions on working time.
TRENDS IN THE LABOUR MARKET
The total workforce in June 1991 was 28-3
million, of whom 22-2 million (11.6 million

EMPLOYMENT
men and 10 6 million women) were classed as
employees in employment. Major long-term
trends have included the growth in the
proportion of the workforce accounted for by
women, as more married women have sought
work, especially in part-time employment;
and a substantial increase in self-employment.
By June 1991 the number of self-employed
people was estimated at 31 million,
representing 12-1 per cent of the employed
workforce. There has been a continuing shift
towards part-time, temporary and sub¬
contracting employment. Together with the
growth of self-employment, this has
encouraged greater labour market flexibility.
Patterns of Employment
As in other industrialised countries, there has
been a marked shift in jobs from
manufacturing to service industries. Between
1955 and 1991 the proportion of employees in
employment engaged in service industries
rose from 36 per cent to 71 per cent as higher
living standards and technological
developments stimulated the growth of many
service industries.
Employment in most service industries,
with some exceptions such as transport, has
grown considerably, although the trend was
reversed in 1991. Nevertheless, the number of
employees in service industries in Great
Britain in June 1991, at 15 4 million, was 2-2
million (17 per cent) higher than in 1981.
The largest rise in this period was in the
banking, finance and insurance sector (which
rose by 55 per cent to 2 7 million), while
there was also a substantial increase in hotels
and catering (32 per cent). Manufacturing
industry accounted for 43 per cent of
employees in employment in 1955, but by
1991 the proportion had fallen to 22 per cent.
Nearly all manufacturing industries have
experienced a decline in employment as
markets for manufactured goods changed
and as new technology brought greater
efficiency.
Unemployment
Unemployment reached a peak in July 1986
when, on a seasonally adjusted basis
(excluding school-leavers), it totalled over 31
million, 11-2 per cent of the workforce. It
then fell continuously, declining by 1-5
million by March 1990. Since then
unemployment has been rising. In August
1992 it totalled 2 8 million, 9 9 per cent of
the workforce.
The Government has introduced a wide
range of measures to help combat
unemployment. These include Employment
Action, a programme offering temporary
work to maintain existing skills and support
in searching for a job. It is targeted on those
unemployed for six months or more,
particularly in inner city and rural areas.
With funding of some £78 million in
1992-93, it is expected to provide work
experience for some 60,000 people a year
on local projects of benefit to the
community.
TRAINING, EDUCATION AND
ENTERPRISE
Employers in Britain spend over £20,000
million a year on employee training and
development. A wide-ranging survey of
training in 1986-87 found that the health
sector provided most training in terms of the
number of days per employee, followed by
education and central government. Overall,
the 1991 Labour Force Survey found that the
number of employees who had received
recent training was 73 per cent higher than it
had been seven years previously. Individuals
are also being encouraged to train by means
of tax reliefs and loan schemes.
The Government funds a number of
training, education and enterprise
programmes. Expenditure by the Department
of Employment Group on training, enterprise
and vocational education has risen to £2,700
million in 1992-93. Resources have been
increased in several areas, with 100,000
additional opportunities for training and help
for the unemployed being provided compared
with 1991-92.
Government Policy
The Government’s major aims for the 1990s
are that:
341
BRITAIN 1993: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
• employers should invest more effectively
in the skills their businesses need;
• young people should have the motivation
to achieve their full potential and to
develop skills the economy needs;
• individuals should be persuaded that
training is worthwhile and that they
should take more responsibility for their
own development;
• people who are unemployed and those at
a disadvantage in the job market should
be helped to get back to work and to
develop their abilities to the full;
• providers of education and training
should offer high quality and flexible
provision which meets the needs of
individuals and employers; and
• enterprise should be encouraged
throughout the economy, particularly
through the continued growth of small
business and self-employment.
Training and Enterprise Councils
A network of 82 employer-led Training and
Enterprise Councils (TECs) has been set up
throughout England and Wales. Their main
functions are:
• to promote more effective training by
employers and individuals;
• to develop innovative solutions to local
problems;
• to provide practical help to employers
through Business Enterprise Training;

EMPLOYMENT
• to deliver and develop Youth Training
and Employment Training (see below);
and
• to stimulate enterprise and economic
growth by providing support to new and
existing small firms.
TECs are playing an increasingly
important role in the delivery of training
programmes and in influencing local
education provision, for example, in the
development of the Technical and Vocational
Education Initiative (see p 157). TECs have
also taken charge of the money that the
Department of Employment previously spent
on work-related further education; this
amounts to some £101 million in 1992-93 in
England. They have thus become able to
work directly with further education colleges
and local education authorities. Total
government funding to TECs in 1992-93 is
some £2,200 million.
A separate network of 22 Local Enterprise
Companies (LECs) exists in Scotland. These
have wider-ranging responsibilities than the
TECs, covering economic development and
environmental improvement. LECs operate
the same programmes as TECs, but, unlike
them, have no responsibility for work-related
further education. They run under the
supervision of the two enterprise bodies,
Scottish Enterprise and Highlands and
Islands Enterprise (see p 168).
Industry Training Organisations
Industry Training Organisations (ITOs) act
as the focal point for training matters in their
particular sector of industry, commerce or
public service. Their role is to ensure that
the skills needs of their sectors are being met
and that occupational standards are being
established and maintained for key
occupations. There are over 120 independent
ITOs, many of which superseded former
statutory training boards, covering sectors
employing about 85 per cent of the civilian
workforce. The National Council of Industry
Training Organisations, a voluntary body set
up to represent the interests of ITOs, aims to
improve the effectiveness of these bodies, for
example, by encouraging good practice.
Employment Training
Employment Training provides a flexible
and individually adapted training
programme to help longer-term
unemployed people acquire the skills
needed for work, including for many the
chance to acquire an appropriate
qualification or credit towards one. An
individual’s training needs are identified
and an agreed action plan is drawn up.
Training is carried out by training
providers under contract with the local
TEC or LEC. For 1992—93 Employment
Training has a budget of £807 million to
provide training opportunities for up to
250,000 trainees.
Entry to the programme can be through
a variety of routes, including a Restart
interview (see p 346) or by application at a
jobcentre. Trainees receive a training
allowance of £10 a week more than their
benefit entitlement, and they may also
receive help towards travel fares and other
expenses.
Youth Training
Youth Training gives young people who
choose not to stay on in full-time education
and who are not already employed the
opportunity of a broad-based vocational
education and to achieve a vocational
qualification or a credit towards one. It puts
an emphasis on raising the level of
qualifications of new entrants to the
workforce and on results, such as vocational
qualifications, rather than on time spent in
training. It offers the chance to gain specific
skills of relevance to work and to improve
the employment prospects of young people.
Training Credits, which operate within
the broad framework of Youth Training,
give young people who have left full-time
education to join the labour market an
entitlement to train to approved standards.
Ten TECs and one LEC started pilot
projects in April 1991, offering Training
Credits to around 10 per cent of 16- and
17-year-old school-leavers. Over 21,300
young people started to use their credits in
the first full year of operation. In 1991 the
343
BRITAIN 1993: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Government announced its intention to
extend Training Credits to all school-leavers
aged 16 and 17 by 1996. In April 1993 seven
more TECs and two LECs will start offering
Training Credits to a further 10 per cent of
eligible young people.
Enterprise Development
TECs and LECs are taking over the running
and development of business and enterprise
training to meet the needs of local
employers. They now have a combined
budget for all their enterprise development
activities, which includes training and
financial support to new entrepreneurs.
The TECs and LECs offer a range of
flexible programmes designed to help small
to medium-sized businesses to improve their
planning, and to develop the business skills
of owner-managers. Training advice,
information and financial support are also
available for people wishing to set up in
business.
Education Initiatives
In 1991 the Government set out in two
White Papers (one of which related to
Scotland) its proposals for education and
training. The White Papers contain
proposals to achieve a fully integrated
system of education and training which
aims to:
• fulfil the potential of more young people
who would otherwise miss out on
education and training after 16;
• equip everyone with stronger basic skills
and more people with higher-level skills;
• bridge the academic-vocational divide;
and
• build up a partnership between
employers and the education system.
Specific government initiatives to make
education more relevant to the needs of
working life include:
• the Technical and Vocational Education
Initiative, which aims to equip all 14- to
18-year-olds in full-time education for
the demands of working life;
• Education Business Partnerships, which
encourage a broad range of activities to
help young people reach their highest
potential, encourage learning throughout
life, and meet employers’ needs for a
well qualified and motivated workforce;
• Compacts—originally introduced in
inner city areas, but now extended more
widely—which are agreements between
young people, employers,
schools/colleges and training providers,
under which young people work towards
locally agreed goals and employers
commit jobs with training for those
achieving their goals;
• Enterprise in Higher Education, which
works with higher education institutions
to promote enterprise in those
institutions, and the development of
enterprise and other personal skills in
learning;
• High Technology National Training, for
unemployed people in sectors affected
by skill shortages; and
• Work Related Further Education, which
is intended to make further education
more responsive to the needs of the
labour market.
Vocational Qualifications
Reform and rationalisation of vocational
qualifications has been carried out by the
National Council for Vocational
Qualifications (NCVQ), set up in 1986, and
by the Scottish Vocational Education
Council. New National Vocational
Qualifications (NVQs) have been established
in England, Wales and Northern Ireland,
and the Scottish Vocational Qualification
(SVQ) in Scotland. They are based on
national standards of competence set by
industry. Candidates are usually assessed in
the workplace under normal working
conditions.
There are five levels within the NVQ^and
SVQ framework (see p 164). NVQs and
SVQs at levels 1 to 4 to cover 80 per cent of
the employed workforce are expected to be
accredited by the end of 1992.

National Education and Training
Targets
In 1991 national targets for education and
training were agreed by over 100 national
and local organisations including all TECs,
LECs and ITOs, and other major education,
training and employer bodies. The
Government also confirmed its support for
the targets, since they underpin its aims and
are a measure of action needed to raise skill
levels. The task of meeting the targets lies
with many interests—primarily with
employers, but also with schools, colleges
and higher education institutions, with trade
unions, with individual people and with
TECs, LECs and ITOs. The Government is
making its contribution by carrying through
its fundamental reforms of education,
qualifications and training.
The targets cover both young people and
the workforce as a whole. Examples of the
targets set are that by 1997, 80 per cent of
young people should reach NVQ/SVQ_level
II, or its academic equivalent; and that by
1996 all employees should take part in
training or development activities.
Investors in People Initiative
The Government has launched the Investors
in People initiative, developed by employers.
As its focus, it has a national standard for
effective investment in people, and aims to
encourage employers to develop all
employees in line with business goals.
Investors in People is delivered locally by
TECs and LECs, which provide advice and
information to help organisations to work
towards the standard. By August 1992, 76
organisations had been ‘recognised’ by their
local TEC as Investors in People, and some
1,200 organisations had made a formal
commitment to work towards the standard.
Other Training Measures
In March 1993 the Government will launch
through the TECs and LECs a new
initiative to develop effective local
information, assessment and guidance
services. Individuals will be offered credits
to be used to buy the guidance and
assessment services of their choice. The
initiative is planned from April 1993
involving 16 TECs and LECs, with 250,000
people involved in 1993-94 and 1994-95. If
credits prove successful, the Government
intends to make them available across Great
Britain.
Open learning opportunities have been
increased by the creation of the Open
College, an independent company which
promotes the acquisition of skills through
the method of open learning. Over 160,000
people have taken its courses since 1987.
People wishing to undertake vocational
training of their choice can apply for a
Career Development Loan to one of three
major banks. Loans of £300 to £5,000 can
help to pay for vocational training courses
between a week and a year in length. Loans
may cover up to 80 per cent of course fees,
plus the cost of books and materials. The
Government’s involvement is to pay the
interest on the loan during the course and
for up to three months afterwards.
Scotland
Two new bodies have been set up under
recent legislation—Scottish Enterprise for
the lowlands of Scotland, and Highlands
and Islands Enterprise for the highlands
and islands area. They assumed
responsibility for the functions of economic
development and training previously
exercised by the Scottish Development
Agency, the Highlands and Islands
Development Board and the Training
Agency in Scotland. Their main duties are
to:
• stimulate self-sustaining economic
development;
• maintain and safeguard employment;
• enhance employment skills; and
• promote industrial efficiency and
international competitiveness.
The new bodies contract out much of
their work to the network of 22 Local
Enterprise Companies led by the private
sector (see p 168).
345
BRITAIN 1993: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Northern Ireland
The Training and Employment Agency, an
executive agency within the Department of
Economic Development for Northern Ireland,
has primary responsibility for training and
employment services. Its overall aim is to
assist economic growth by ensuring the
provision and operation of training and
employment services that contribute to
Northern Ireland firms becoming more
competitive and individuals obtaining the
skills required. The Agency works closely
with employers and is encouraging each of
the key sectors of industry to form a sector
representative body to represent the opinion
of employers, and others, about individual
sectoral training needs. It has also established
sectoral working groups to develop training
strategies for individual sectors.
Northern Ireland has its own training and
work experience schemes, including:
• the Action for Community Employment
programme, which provides training and
jobs for long-term unemployed people;
• the Job Training programme, which
parallels Employment Training in Great
Britain; and
• the Youth Training programme.
Management training and development is
an important area for the Training and
Employment Agency. It provides a range of
schemes designed to improve and develop
management skills both for existing and
unemployed managers and for graduates
seeking to follow managerial careers. The
Agency’s Client Advisory Staff promote the
benefits of training and offer advice suited to
the needs of individual companies and
indusrrial sectors. Responsibility for
enterprise development in Northern Ireland
lies with the Local Enterprise Development
Unit (see p 229). Its enterprise responsibilities
include enterprise training, enterprise grants
and the development of the Northern Ireland
network of local enterprise agencies.
EMPLOYMENT SERVICES
The main priorities of the Employment
Service, an executive agency within the
Department of Employment, are to help
unemployed people back to work and to
maintain the accurate and prompt payment of
benefit to unemployed people, while ensuring
that payment is made only to those entitled
to it. The Employment Service has issued the
Jobseeker’s Charter, setting out the standards
of service which those seeking work are
entitled to expect from jobcentres and
unemployment benefit offices.
The Employment Service’s range of
services to jobseekers includes:
• a network of jobcentres, at which people
can find details of job opportunities;
• advice and guidance, so that people can
find the best route to return to
employment, for example, by training;
• special programmes such as Jobclubs and
the Job Interview Guarantee; and
• advice and guidance on services available
for people with disabilities.
The jobcentre network handles about one-
third of vacancies in the economy, and over
85 per cent of the E5 million people whom it
placed in jobs in 1991-92 were unemployed.
Jobcentres are now being integrated with
unemployment benefit offices, so as to
provide a comprehensive service to
unemployed people.
Advisory Services
As part of the Employment Service
programme of individual interviews, advisers
provide unemployed people with information
on employment and training opportunities
available to them locally. New client advisers
interview newly unemployed people to check
their eligibility for benefit. Together with the
unemployed person, they agree a ‘Back to
Work Plan’ which shows them the best
course of action to follow to get back to
work. These plans are reviewed at every
advisory interview.
Under the Restart programme, everyone
who has been unemployed six months or
more is asked to attend a Restart interview
with a claimant adviser. The adviser and
unemployed person discuss that person’s
circumstances, with the aim of helping them
346
EMPLOYMENT
back into work as soon as possible. This
could include:
• advice on job vacancies;
• enrolment on a training programme;
• a place in a Jobclub, where participants
are given training and advice in job-
hunting skills and have access to facilities
to help an intensive job search;
• help through the Job Interview
Guarantee programme, whereby
employers guarantee interviews to
everyone submitted for their vacancies
through the programme;
• a Restart course, usually over five days,
designed to rebuild self-confidence and
motivation and including help with job-
hunting skills; or
• the chance of self-employment with
direct financial help through the
Enterprise Allowance Scheme, which
gives financial support to unemployed
people to start their own business.
Other Functions
The Employment Service also aims to help
people with disabilities find work. All
Employment Service programmes make
provision for people with disabilities. Services
for people with disabilities are now being
delivered through local integrated specialist
teams—Placing Assessment and Counselling
Teams. They are supported by nine regional
Ability Development Centres, which will
develop new techniques in providing
assessment, work preparation and practical
help for people with disabilities. A wide
range of programmes, such as one offering
sheltered employment opportunities, is
available for people with disabilities who need
specialist help.
Careers Service
Local education authorities in Great Britain
provide a careers service for people attending
educational institutions (apart from
universities, which normally have their own
careers service) and an employment service
for those leaving them. The Government is
seeking to establish closer links between
employers and the Careers Service and make
it more responsive to local needs.
INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS
The structure of industrial relations in
Britain has been established mainly on a
voluntary basis. The system is based chiefly
on the organisation of employees and
employers into trade unions and employers’
associations, and on freely conducted
negotiations at all levels.
Collective Bargaining and Joint
Consultation
In many industries terms and conditions of
employment and procedures for the conduct
of industrial relations have traditionally been
settled by negotiation between employers and
trade unions. Trade unions are widely
recognised by employers, especially in the
public sector and in large firms and
establishments. Agreements may be industry¬
wide, as has generally been the case in the
public sector, but they are often
supplemented by local agreements in
companies or factories (plant bargaining).
Individual companies may have their own
agreements, either for the whole company or
for each plant.
In some industries or companies,
negotiations are conducted by meetings held
when necessary. In others joint consultative
committees have been established on a
permanent basis. Joint committees are fairly
widespread, especially in large firms. The
scope of the various bodies (from national
joint industrial councils for whole industries
to works committees in individual work¬
places) varies widely. It can cover matters
other than pay and conditions, such as:
• production plans;
• training;
• welfare; and
• safety.
Such committees often also act as a forum
for more general consultation between
workers and employers. Day-to-day
negotiations on various aspects of pay (such
347
BRITAIN 1993: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
as bonuses or performance pay) are normally
handled at plant level. Arrangements for
collective bargaining usually suffice to settle
all questions which are raised, but there is
often provision for matters which cannot be
settled in this way to be referred to
independent conciliation or arbitration. The
law provides for information needed for
collective bargaining purposes to be disclosed
by employers to trade unions, subject to
certain safeguards.
Developments
In recent years employers have moved away
from long-standing national or industry-wide
arrangements for bargaining and consultation
with trade unions towards negotiation at a
more local level. The proportion of the
workforce covered by multi-employer national
agreements declined from 60 per cent in 1978
to 34 per cent in 1991. Areas in which
national industry-wide pay bargaining has
been ended include electricity generation and
supply, the printing of national newspapers,
commercial broadcasting and the London
clearing banks.
The Government has favoured moves
away from national pay bargaining towards
systems where pay increases are dependent
primarily on performance, merit, company
profitability, and local labour market
conditions. Many employers have sought
greater flexibility through a closer relationship
between pay and performance, particularly
through performance-related pay schemes.
Another recent feature has been the
development of ‘new style’ agreements, often
associated with overseas-owned companies,
although they are also found in British-owned
firms. These agreements often involve:
• the recognition of a single union for all of
a company’s employees (particularly for
companies recognising unions for the first
time);
• ‘single status’, involving the elimination
of the traditional distinction between
managers, supervisors and other
employees;
• a greater emphasis on employee
participation; and
• flexibility in working practices.
Employee Involvement
Employers practise a wide variety of methods
of informing and consulting their employees,
not only through committees but also
through direct communication between
management and employees. These methods
include:
• employee bulletins and reports;
• briefing systems;
• quality circles;
• financial participation schemes; and
• attitude surveys.
Arrangements of this sort are seen by the
Government as a key factor in increasing
employee commitment and improving
business productivity and performance.
Trade Unions
Trade unions have members in nearly all
occupations. As well as negotiating pay and
other terms and conditions of employment
with employers, they provide benefits and
services such as educational facilities,
financial services, legal advice and aid in
work-related cases. In recent years several
unions have extended considerably the range
of services they offer to members. Trade
unions vary widely in the composition of
their membership, and may be organised
either by occupation (for example, they may
recruit clerical staff or managers wherever
employed) or by industry, while some are
based on a combination of both. Staff
associations represent the employees of a
particular company.
There has been a decline in trade union
membership, and by the end of 1990 total
union membership was about 9-9 million, of
whom 58 per cent were in the nine largest
unions. The decline reflects the moves away
from manufacturing and public services, both
of which have a relatively high level of
membership.
The number of unions has also fallen,
reflecting a number of mergers and the
absorption by larger unions of small unions
and of long-established craft unions. Several
unions are discussing possible mergers. At
348
EMPLOYMENT
the end of 1991 there were 309 trade unions
on the list maintained by the Certification
Officer. To be eligible for entry on the list a
trade union must show that it consists wholly
or mainly of workers and that its principal
purposes include the regulation of relations
between workers and employers or between
workers and employers’ associations.
Six unions had over 500,000 members at
the end of 1991:
• the Transport and General Workers’
Union (11 million);
• the GMB (863,000);
• the National and Local Government
Officers’ Association (760,000);
• the Amalgamated Engineering Union
(622,000);
• the Manufacturing, Science and Finance
Union (604,000); and
• the National Union of Public Employees
(551,000).
The Amalgamated Engineering Union
and the Electrical, Electronic,
Telecommunication and Plumbing
Union merged in 1992 to form the
Amalgamated Engineering and
Electrical Union, with 940,000
members. Proposals are being
considered for a merger of the
Confederation of Health Service
Employees, the National Union of
Public Employees and the National
and Local Government Officers
Association. If this went ahead, it
would create a combined union with
some L5 million members.
Trade union organisation varies widely,
but the central governing body usually
consists of a national executive council or
committee, elected by a secret ballot of the
individual members and responsible to the
conference of delegates from local branches,
normally held annually. Many unions also
have regional and district organisations. At
the level of the individual member there are
local branches, covering one or more
workplaces. The organising of members in
individual places of work and the negotiation
of local pay agreements with management at
the workplace may be done by full-time
district officials of the union or, in many
cases, by elected workplace representatives,
often called ‘shop stewards’. Where two or
more unions have members in the same
workplace, shop stewards’ committees may
be formed to discuss matters of common
concern.
Trades Union Congress
In Britain the national centre of the trade
union movement is the Trades Union
Congress (TUC), founded in 1868. Its
affiliated membership comprises 72 trade
unions, which together represent some 7-8
million people, or about 78 per cent of all
trade unionists in Britain.
The TUC’s objectives are to promote the
interests of its affiliated organisations and to
improve the economic and social conditions
of working people. The TUC deals with all
general questions which concern trade
unions, both nationally and internationally,
and provides a forum in which affiliated
unions can collectively determine policy.
There are eight TUC regional councils for
England and a Wales Trades Union
Council.
The annual Congress meets in September
to discuss matters of concern to trade
unionists. A General Council represents the
TUC between annual meetings by:
• carrying out Congress decisions;
• watching economic and social
developments;
• providing educational and advisory
services to unions; and
• presenting in national debate the trade
union viewpoint on economic, social and
industrial issues.
The TUC plays an active part in
international trade union activity, through
its affiliation to the International
Confederation of Free Trade Unions and
the European Trade Union Confederation.
It also nominates the British workers’
delegation to the annual International
Labour Conference.
349
BRITAIN 1993: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Scotland and Northern Ireland
Trade unions in Scotland also have their own
national central body, the Scottish Trades
Union Congress, which in many respects is
similar in constitution and function to the
TUC. Trade unions in Northern Ireland are
represented by the Northern Ireland
Committee of the Irish Congress of Trade
Unions (ICTU). Most trade unionists in
Northern Ireland are members of
organisations affiliated to the ICTU, while
the majority also belong to unions based in
Great Britain which are also affiliated to the
TUC. The Northern Ireland Committee of
the ICTU enjoys a high degree of autonomy.
Legal Framework
The Government’s reforms of industrial
relations and trade union law have helped
establish a better balance of power between
trade unions and employers, and between
trade unions and their own members. These
reforms have played a key role in
transforming Britain’s industrial relations.
The Government believes that the
Employment Acts of 1980, 1982, 1988 and
1990, and the Trade Union Act 1984 have
helped to make union leaders more
accountable to their members and to promote
an acceptance of the role of the law in
industrial relations.
There were 761,000 working days lost as a
result of industrial action in 1991, the lowest
since records began 100 years ago. The
number of stoppages was 369, the lowest
since 1933.
Trade Union Recognition
The previous statutory recognition procedure
was repealed in 1980. Employers are now
free to decide whether or not they wish to
recognise, or continue to recognise a
particular union, or unions, for collective
bargaining purposes.
Industrial Action
Under common law, it is unlawful to induce
workers to break a contract or to threaten to
do it. Thus, without special protection, trade
unions (or any other person or organisation)
would face the possibility of legal action for
inducing breaches of contract every time they
called a strike or other form of industrial
action. To prevent this, ‘statutory
immunities’ were introduced, which provide
that trade unions and others can, in certain
circumstances, organise industrial action
without fear of being sued in the courts.
These immunities only protect those who call
for or organise industrial action. They do not
protect individuals who choose to take
industrial action from being dismissed, or
from legal action by their employer.
Prior to the 1980s, the circumstances in
which these immunities applied were very
wide, so that the organisation of almost any
industrial action was protected. The
legislative reforms of the past decade have
restricted the scope of these immunities in a
number of ways. To have the benefit of
statutory immunity, the organisation of
industrial action must now be in
contemplation or furtherance of a trade
dispute between workers and their own
employer, and must not:
• involve workers who have no dispute
with their own employer (so-called
‘secondary’ action);
• involve unlawful picketing;
• be done to establish or maintain a union-
only labour agreement (the ‘closed shop’);
or
• be done in support of any employee
dismissed while taking unofficial
industrial action.
Before calling for industrial action, a trade
union must first obtain the support of its
members in a properly-conducted secret ballot.
Moreover, any trade union member has the
right to restrain his union from calling on
him, and other members, to take action
unless a ballot has supported the action.
A trade union is now responsible in law if
industrial action is called for or organised by
any of its officials. This means that if a trade
union acts unlawfully, for example, by calling
for industrial action without a proper secret
ballot, legal proceedings can be taken against
the union itself. The law also means that if a
350
EMPLOYMENT
union defies a court order, for example, an
order to withdraw an unlawful call for
industrial action, it can be held to be in
contempt of court. In such circumstances
severe penalties can be imposed, including
sequestration of the union’s assets.
Trade Union Elections
The law requires a trade union to elect every
member of its governing body, its general
secretary and its president. Elections must be
held every five years and be carried out by
secret postal ballot of the union’s members.
The election must be held under independent
scrutiny. Any union member who believes
that the union has not complied with the
statutory requirements may complain to the
courts or to the Certification Officer.
Members ’ Rights
All individuals have the right under the law
not to be dismissed or refused employment
because they are, are not or will not become
trade union members. They also have the
right not to be refused any of the services of
an employment agency because they are, or
are not, members of a union. Individuals who
believe that they have been dismissed or
refused employment on grounds related to
their union membership or non-membership
may complain to an industrial tribunal. Other
members’ rights include:
• a statutory remedy if unjustifiably
disciplined by their union;
• the right to inspect their union’s
accounting records; and
• the right to have automatic deduction of
their union subscription from their pay
stopped if they leave the union.
An independent Commissioner for the
Rights of Trade Union Members can provide
assistance to help ensure that members need
not be disadvantaged in bringing legal
proceedings against their union to enforce
certain rights and duties.
Political Funds
A trade union may establish a political fund if
it wishes to use its money for what the law
defines as ‘political objects’. If a union wishes
to set up a political fund, its members must
first agree in a secret ballot a resolution
adopting those political objectives as an aim
of the union. The union must also ballot its
members every ten years to maintain the fund.
Union members have a statutory right to opt
out of contributing to a political fund.
Government Proposals
Following consultation on proposals
contained in the Green Paper Industrial
Relations in the 1990s, published in July 1991,
the Government has announced its intention
to make further reforms of the law. These
reforms would include:
• giving individuals greater freedom to
belong to the trade union of their choice;
• protecting union members against abuse
of the arrangements for deducting union
subscriptions from pay;
• providing union members with more
information about their union’s financial
affairs; and
• creating a right for anyone deprived of
goods and services because of the
unlawful organisation of industrial action
to bring court proceedings to stop it
occurring.
Employers’ Organisations
Many employers in Britain are members of
employers’ organisations, some of which are
wholly concerned with labour matters,
although others are also concerned with
commercial matters or trade associations. The
primary aims of such organisations are:
• to help to establish suitable terms and
conditions of employment;
• to promote good relations with employees
and the efficient use of manpower; and
• to provide means of settling any disputes
which may arise.
Combined employers’ organisations and
trade associations may also represent
members’ points of view on commercial
matters as manufacturers or traders.
351
BRITAIN 1993: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Employers’ organisations are usually
established on an industry basis rather than a
product basis, for example, the Engineering
Employers’ Federation. A few are purely local
in character or deal with a section of an
industry or, for example, with small businesses;
most are national and are concerned with the
whole of an industry. In some of the main
industries there are local or regional
organisations combined into national
federations. In others, within which different
firms are engaged in making different principal
products, there is a complex structure with
national and regional federations for parts of
an industry as well as for the industry as a
whole. At the end of 1991, 131 listed and 146
unlisted employers’ associations were known
to the Certification Officer. Those which are
national organisations negotiate the national
collective agreements for their industry with
the trade unions concerned; most of these
national organisations belong to the
Confederation of British Industry.
Confederation of British Industry
The Confederation of British Industry (CBI)
is the largest employers’ organisation in
Britain, representing directly or indirectly
some 250,000 businesses, which together
employ about half the working population. It
aims primarily to ensure that Government,
national and international institutions and the
public understand the needs, intentions and
problems of business. Membership ranges
from the smallest to the largest companies,
private sector and nationalised, and covers a
broad spectrum which includes
manufacturing, agriculture, construction,
distribution, mining, finance, retailing and
insurance. Most national employers’
organisations, trade associations and some
chambers of commerce are members. Policy is
determined by a council of 400 members, and
there is a permanent staff of 295; there are 13
regional offices and an office in Brussels. The
CBI is the British member of the Union of
Industries of the European Community.
Terms and Conditions of Employment
Basic rates of pay vary widely, and in private
industry rates are frequently determined
locally, with less importance attached to
national agreements. Higher rates are usually
paid for overtime and shift work, and weekly
earnings may be further increased by
incentive bonus schemes or other
performance-related arrangements.
Earnings
According to the Department of
Employment’s New Earnings Survey, the
average weekly earnings, unaffected by
absence and including overtime payments, in
April 1992 of full-time employees on adult
rates were £305. Earnings were higher for
non-manual employees (£335) than for
manual employees (£251). Some 48 per cent
of manual employees and 18 per cent of non-
manual employees received overtime
payments. In the year to April 1992 the
underlying average increase in earnings was
about 7 per cent.
Remuneration in commercial, technical
and professional careers is normally by annual
salary paid monthly, often on a scale carrying
annual increments. Many of the top posts in
leading commercial and industrial companies
carry salaries which are performance-related.
It is thought that the majority are between
£100,000 and £300,000 a year before tax,
reflecting increasing competition for top
management. Senior management salaries are
generally in the range £40,000 to £100,000 a
year, while middle management salaries
typically fall between £20,000 and £40,000 a
year.
Since 1987 income tax relief has been
available for employees receiving
profit-related pay under the schemes
registered by the Inland Revenue. By the
end of March 1992, there were nearly 2,600
registered schemes covering some 718,000
employees.
Employee Share Schemes
The Government has taken a number of
steps to encourage direct ownership by
employees of shares in the businesses for
which they work. The number of all¬
employee share schemes registered under
352
EMPLOYMENT
Finance Act legislation was 2,070 at the end
of March 1992, benefiting over 2-6 million
employees.
Other Benefits
Additional benefits exist in varying degrees.
About half of employees in employment—
some 11 million people—are covered by
pension schemes provided by their
employers. Many employees are also
covered by occupational sick-pay schemes
which are additional or complementary to
the state schemes, and by schemes to
provide private medical treatment. Such
benefits are more usual among clerical and
professional employees than among manual
workers.
The provision of low-priced meals at the
place of employment is usual in large firms
and quite common in smaller ones, while
many offices and shops which are unable to
provide canteen facilities have adopted
luncheon voucher schemes.
Company cars are provided for directors
and employees in a wide variety of
circumstances. Some 2 million people had a
company car in 1991-92, and about half of
these received fuel for private motoring in
their cars. Other fringe benefits available
include low-interest loans.
Hours of Work
The basic working week in Great Britain is
in the range 37-5 to 40 hours for manual
work and 35 to 38 for non-manual work; a
five-day week is usually worked. While the
basic working week has been gradually
shortening, the general trend in total hours
worked has been rising since 1981. In April
1992 total hours a week actually worked
(including overtime) for full-time adult
employees were 41-4 for men, compared
with 37 3 for women. Men and women in
non-manual occupations generally work less
overtime than manual employees.
In general, there are no limits on hours
worked by adults except in a few
occupations (such as for drivers of goods
vehicles and public service vehicles).
Restrictions on working hours for women
and for school-leavers aged under 18 were
repealed by the Sex Discrimination Act 1986
and the Employment Act 1989.
Holidays with Pay
There are no general statutory entitlements to
holidays, and holiday entitlements are
frequently determined by collective
agreements. These generally provide for at
least four weeks’ paid holiday a year, and
nearly all manual employees covered by
national collective agreements have
entitlements of four weeks or more, with
about 30 per cent having five weeks or more.
Non-manual workers tend to have longer
holidays than manual workers. Holiday
entitlements may also be dependent upon
length of service.
Office of Manpower Economics
The Office of Manpower Economics is an
independent non-statutory organisation
responsible for servicing independent review
bodies which advise on the pay of various
public-sector groups. These are:
• the Top Salaries Review Body;
• the Armed Forces’ Pay Review Body;
• the Doctors’ and Dentists’ Review Body;
• the Review Body for Nurses and other
National Health Service professions; and
• the Review Body on School Teachers’
Pay.
The Office also provides services for the
Pharmacists’ Review Panel, the Police
Negotiating Board and the Civil Service
Arbitration Tribunal. It is responsible for
research into pay and associated matters as
requested by the Government.
Wages Councils
Wages councils fix statutory minimum pay
for 2-5 million workers aged 21 and over,
primarily in service industries such as
retailing, catering and hairdressing. There are
26 such councils in Great Britain, each
consisting of equal numbers of representatives
353
BRITAIN 1993: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
of employers and employees in the industry
concerned, and up to five independent
members. Councils are empowered to fix a
minimum hourly rate, an overtime rate and a
limit on the amount an employer can charge
for accommodation provided. However, the
Government is concerned about the
continued relevance of the system, and is
keeping it under review. In Northern Ireland
there are nine wages councils, which fix
statutory minimum pay for some 34,000
workers.
Employment Rights
Employment protection legislation provides a
number of safeguards for employees. For
example, most employees are entitled to
receive from their employers written
information on their main terms and
conditions of employment, while minimum
periods of notice when employment is to be
terminated are laid down for both employers
and employees. Employees with the necessary
period of continuous employment with their
employer (currently two years for those
working 16 hours a week or more) are
entitled to lump-sum redundancy payments if
their jobs cease to exist (for example, because
of technological improvements or a fall in
demand) and their employers cannot offer
suitable alternative work. Where employers
are insolvent, the cost is partly met from the
National Insurance fund, and direct payments
are made by the Department of Employment.
Most employees who believe they have
been unfairly dismissed have the right to
complain to an industrial tribunal, again
provided they have the necessary qualifying
period of employment. If the complaint is
upheld, the tribunal may make an order for
reinstatement or award compensation.
Most pregnant women who have the
necessary qualifying period of continuous
employment have the right to return to their
former job, or a suitable alternative, after
maternity absence. Legislation forbids any
employment of children under 13 years of
age, and employment in any industrial
undertaking of children who have not reached
the statutory minimum school-leaving age,
with some exceptions for family undertakings.
Equal Opportunities
The Race Relations Act 1976 makes it
generally unlawful to discriminate on
grounds of colour, race, nationality
(including citizenship) or ethnic or national
origin, in employment, training and related
matters. The Department of Employment
operates a nationwide Race Relations
Employment Advisory Service. Its objective
is to promote the Government’s policies
aimed at eliminating racial discrimination in
employment and promoting fair treatment
and equality of opportunity in employment.
Advisers provide employers with advice
and practical help in developing and
implementing effective equal opportunity
strategies.
The Sex Discrimination Act 1975, as
amended, makes it generally unlawful in
Great Britain to discriminate on grounds of
sex or being married when it comes to
recruiting, training, promoting, dismissing
or retiring staff. It also provides redress
against victimisation and may also do so
against sexual harassment. The Equal Pay
Act 1970 makes it generally unlawful to
discriminate between men and women in
pay and other terms and conditions of
employment. The Act was significantly
extended in 1984 to meet European
Community requirements by providing
for equal pay for work of equal value.
There is equivalent legislation in Northern
Ireland.
Practical advice to employers and others
on the best arrangements for implementing
equal opportunities policies in Great Britain
is given in codes of practice from the
Commission for Racial Equality and from
the Equal Opportunities Commission (see
pp 25 and 24).
Northern Ireland
Similar legislation to that in Great Britain
on equal pay and sex discrimination applies
in Northern Ireland; there is at present no
legislation on race relations, but this is
under review. Discrimination, both direct
and indirect, in employment on grounds of
religious belief or political opinion is
354
EMPLOYMENT
unlawful. The Fair Employment Commission
has the task of promoting equality of
opportunity and investigating employment
practices, with powers to issue legally
enforceable directions. The Fair Employment
Tribunal adjudicates on individual complaints
of religious or political discrimination and
enforces the Commission’s directions. All but
the smallest employers are required to
monitor the religious composition of their
workforce and periodically to review their
employment practices. Where fair
participation is not being enjoyed by both
Protestants and Roman Catholics, the
introduction of ‘affirmative action’ measures
must be considered.
Advisory, Conciliation and Arbitration
Service
The Advisory, Conciliation and Arbitration
Service (ACAS) is an independent statutory
body providing industrial relations services to
employers, employees and trade unions. It has
a general duty of promoting the improvement
of industrial relations. ACAS seeks to dis¬
charge its responsibility through the voluntary
co-operation of employers, employees and
their representatives. Its main functions are
collective conciliation, provision of arbitration
and mediation facilities, advisory services for
promoting the improvement of industrial
relations through the joint involvement of
employers and employees, and providing an
information service. ACAS also conciliates in
individual rights’ disputes. Through its Work
Research Unit, it advises on issues such as
the quality of working life and the
management of change.
In 1991 ACAS:
• received nearly 1,400 requests for
collective conciliation, with a further 157
requests referred to arbitration, mediation
or investigation;
• dealt with some 60,600 individual
conciliation cases;
• made nearly 6,300 advisory visits;
• assisted with 221 joint working exercises;
and
• dealt with 467,000 enquiries through its
public enquiry points.
ACAS has offices in 12 towns or cities,
and a total staff of nearly 600. Its budget for
1990-91 was £17-7 million.
In Northern Ireland the Labour Relations
Agency, an independent statutory body,
provides services similar to those provided by
ACAS in Great Britain.
Central Arbitration Committee
The Central Arbitration Committee is an
independent standing arbitration body. It
provides boards of arbitration for the
settlement of trade disputes referred to it
with the consent of the parties concerned. It
also adjudicates on claims made under the
disclosure of information provisions of the
Employment Protection Act 1975.
HEALTH AND SAFETY AT WORK
Recent statistics indicate a reduction in the
rate of major and other reported injuries to
employees, although a high rate of injuries
remains in certain industries, such as
construction and agriculture. Employers have
a duty in law to take reasonable care of their
staff, as well as others affected by their work
activities. Employees have a duty to take care
of their own safety and that of their fellow
workers.
The principal legislation is the Health and
Safety at Work etc. Act 1974. It places
general duties on everyone concerned with
work activities, including employers, the self-
employed, employees, and manufacturers and
suppliers of materials for use at work.
Supporting Acts and regulations deal with
particular hazards and types of work.
Employers with five or more staff must
prepare a written statement of health and
safety policy and inform their staff of it.
The Act requires the Health and Safety
Commission to develop workable proposals to
update earlier legislation, much of which was
not adaptable to technical innovation.
Reforms have since been completed in many
areas. Much of the old law has been replaced
by modern provisions, supported as necessary
by codes of practice and other guidance
material.
The Control of Substances Hazardous to
355
BRITAIN 1993: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Health Regulations 1988 are some of the most
important regulations made under the 1974
Act. They replaced a range of outdated
legislation by a comprehensive and systematic
approach to the control of exposure to
virtually all substances hazardous to health.
These include chemicals, fumes, dust and
micro-organisms.
The European Year of Safety, Health
and Hygiene Protection at Work runs
from 1 March 1992 to 28 February
1993. In Britain the Health and Safety
Executive is concentrating on themes
such as small firms, the cost of
accidents and ill health, human
factors, and training and education. It
aims to raise the profile of health and
safety. A number of initiatives have
been announced, for example, on
construction.
Health and Safety Commission
The Health and Safety Commission (HSC),
which is accountable to Parliament through
the Secretary of State for Employment, has
responsibility for developing policies,
including guidance, codes of practice, or
proposals for regulations. In the case of
proposals for changes in legislation, the HSC
consults those who would be affected and
makes recommendations to the Secretary of
State concerned.
The HSC has seven advisory committees
covering subjects such as toxic substances,
genetic manipulation and the safety of nuclear
installations. There are also 12 industry
advisory committees, each of which deals with
a specific industry, two advisory boards and
one advisory council.
Health and Safety Executive
The Health and Safety Executive (HSE) is
the primary instrument for carrying out the
HSC’s policies and has day-to-day
responsibility for enforcing health and safety
law, except where other bodies, such as local
authorities, are responsible. The HSE’s field
services and inspections over the country as a
whole are carried out by the Field Operations
Division. This incorporates the Factory,
Agricultural and Quarries inspectorates,
together with the regional staff of the
Employment Medical Advisory Service
(which provides advice on medical aspects of
employment problems), and the Field
Consulting Groups, which provide technical
support to the inspectorates. The HSE also
includes:
• the Health Policy Division and Medical
Services headquarters;
• the Technology and Health Services
Division, which provides technical advice
on industrial health and safety matters;
and
• the Research and Laboratory Services
Division, which provides scientific and
medical support and testing services, and
carries out research.
In premises such as offices, shops,
warehouses, restaurants and hotels, health
and safety legislation is enforced by
inspectors appointed by local authorities,
working under guidance from the HSC.
Some other official bodies work under agency
agreement with the HSC.
Northern Ireland
In Northern Ireland the Health and Safety
Agency, roughly corresponding to the HSC,
and an Employment Medical Advisory
Service were set up by the Health and Safety
at Work (NI) Order 1978. The general
requirements of the Northern Ireland health
and safety legislation are broadly similar to
those for Great Britain. They are enforced
mainly by the Department of Economic
Development through its Health and Safety
Inspectorate.
356
19 Public Finance
Public finance is concerned with taxation,
expenditure and borrowing or debt
repayment by central and local government;
management of the public sector’s assets and
liabilities; and the financing of public
corporations.
Central government raises money from
individuals and companies by direct and
indirect taxation and from National Insurance
contributions. It spends money on goods and
services, such as health and defence, and in
payments to people, for instance, social
security and pensions.
Local government raises revenue mainly
through the community charge, which is to
be abolished and replaced by a council tax
from April 1993 (see p 366), and through
other taxes levied on domestic and business
properties. The community charge was not
introduced in Northern Ireland and domestic
rates remain in operation. Local government
provides services such as education, police
and fire services, and refuse collection.
The diagram (see p 364) shows the
relative importance of the various items of
receipts, including borrowing, and
expenditure for general government.
The government department responsible
for broad control of public finance and
expenditure is HM Treasury. The Bank of
England (the central bank) advises the
Government on financial matters, executes
monetary policy and acts as banker to the
Government.
PUBLIC EXPENDITURE
The three main definitions of public
expenditure are general government
expenditure, the planning total and Supply
expenditure.
General Government Expenditure
General government expenditure is the
spending of central and local government,
excluding transfers between them such as
central government grants to local authorities.
It is the key public spending aggregate and is
used in the medium-term financial strategy
(see p 358), where public spending is set in
the context of broader economic policy. It is
more appropriate than the other measures for
making international comparisons as it is
usually less affected by institutional
differences.
Planning Total
The planning total is used by the
Government for the purposes of planning and
control. The Government seeks to achieve its
wider medium-term objective (expressed in
terms of general government expenditure) by
controlling spending within this total. The
planning total covers:
• expenditure for which central
government is itself responsible;
• the support it provides or approves for
local authority expenditure;
• the external financing requirements of
public corporations, including
nationalised industries;
• privatisation proceeds; and
• a reserve to cover unanticipated
expenditure.
Supply Expenditure
Supply expenditure is financed out of money
voted by Parliament in the Supply Estimates
(see p 359). Practically all Supply
expenditure counts in the planning total, and
represents about three-quarters of it. The
main element of the planning total not
funded through Supply Estimates is
expenditure financed from the National
Insurance Fund.
357
BRITAIN 1993: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Medium-term Financial Strategy
The background to the Government’s
planning of public expenditure is the
medium-term financial strategy, which
provides a framework for monetary and fiscal
policy. The central objective of the strategy is
to defeat inflation. Public expenditure
(measured by general government
expenditure, excluding privatisation proceeds)
is expected to take a declining share of
national income over time, and provide
constantly improving value for money.
General government expenditure
(excluding privatisation proceeds), as a
proportion of gross domestic product (GDP),
fell from over 47 per cent in 1982-83 to
under 40 per cent in 1990-91. Since then,
recession has pushed up the ratio, which is
projected to peak at 43 per cent in 1992-93
before resuming a downward path. For
1992-93 taxes and social security
contributions are forecast to amount to 35-5
per cent of GDP. The Government also aims
to establish the conditions for sustainable
economic growth; reduce taxation; and
diminish the role of the State.
In July 1992 the Government endorsed a
new medium-term framework for controlling
public expenditure to ensure that the share of
national income taken by public expenditure
will fall over time. Annual ceilings are to be
set for the growth of total planned public
expenditure in line with the Government’s
medium-term objectives. For 1993-94
spending will be kept within existing plans
and for the next two years the growth in cash
terms in the ‘New Control Total’ (which
excludes unemployment-related social
security spending) is to be restricted to 3 per
cent in 1994—95 and 3-25 per cent in
1995-96.
This ‘top-down’ approach separates
decisions on overall public expenditure levels
from the allocation between programmes.
Departmental spending decisions will be
based on allocating available resources within
agreed ceilings for aggregate spending;
resources will be devoted to priority areas
with an emphasis on obtaining maximum
value for money. Together with the move to
a unified budget (see p 359), the new
framework represents an important reform of
fiscal planning proceedures.
Table 19.1 gives projections for
government expenditure and receipts and the
borrowing requirement for 1992-93 and
1993-94.
Planning Cycle
Each year the Government conducts a review
of its spending plans for the forthcoming
three years, known as the ‘Public
Expenditure Survey’. The plans agreed in the
Survey have in recent years been announced
by the Chancellor of the Exchequer in the
Autumn Statement, usually in November.
More detailed analyses are published in the
following January or February in a Statistical
Supplement and in individual departmental
reports. In March or April the Chancellor
presents his taxation proposals and forecast
for the economy in the Budget (see p 361).

FISHERIES
Peterhead, Scotland, is
one of the main ports
from which the British
fishing fleets operate.
At the end of 1991 the
British fleet consisted
of 10,871 registered
vessels, including 424
deep-sea vessels longer
than 24.4m (80 feet).
Wholesalers buying

TRANSPORT
A new vessel traffic
management system has
been installed at Dover, the
world’s busiest passenger
port. The consoles display
information on all radar
contacts from large ferries
to windsurfers, so that
accurate information can
be passed to mariners and
shore-based personnel.
The first of Manchester’s
‘supertrams’ began operating
in April 1992 on the line to Bury.
The initial stage of the
Manchester Metrolink project
will cover some 31 km (19 miles).
British Rail’s new
InterCity 225 trains
have been
introduced on the
recently electrified
London-Edinburgh
east coast main line.
The InterCity 225,
seen on the right of
this picture, is
designed to travel at
speeds of 225 km/h.

OLYMPICS
Britain won gold medals in five events
at the 1992 Olympics in Barcelona -
two in athletics, two in rowing
and one in cycling.
Chris Boardman won
the 4,000 metres
individual pursuit gold
medal on an advanced
Lotus-designed bicycle
In the coxed pairs event
the gold medallists were
Gregory and Jonathan
Searle, and cox Garry
Herbert.
PUBLIC FINANCE
Revenue and expenditure are brought
together in the Financial Statement and
Budget Report issued on the day of the
Budget.
In the 1992 Budget, the Chancellor
announced that from December 1993 the
Government would present taxation and
spending proposals to Parliament at the same
time. The Budget would, therefore, cover
both the Government’s taxation plans for the
coming financial year and its spending plans
for the next three years. As now, it would
also give a review of recent developments in
the economy, an economic forecast and a
statement of the Government’s medium-term
financial strategy (see p 358). The
Government would publish a second short¬
term economic forecast in the summer. A
December Budget would allow the spending
proposals to be considered alongside the
taxation proposals to pay for them. The
Finance Bill, with details of the taxation
changes, would be published in January for
parliamentary consideration.
Public Expenditure Totals
Public expenditure totals are analysed in
Table 19.2. The largest departmental
programmes are those of the Department of
Social Security (39 per cent of central
government expenditure in 1991-92), the
Department of Health (16 per cent) and the
Ministry of Defence (15 per cent).
About half of local authority spending is
financed by grants from central government.
The rest is met from the community charge
(replaced by the council tax from April
1993) and business rates, surpluses on
trading, rents and borrowing. Education
accounts for about two-fifths of local
authority spending; law and order, housing
and other environmental services, personal
social services, social security and roads and
transport take up most of the remainder.
Reserve
Planned expenditure includes an unallocated
reserve to cover additions to departmental
spending, whether arising from policy
changes, new initiatives or revisions to the
estimated costs of demand-led programmes.
For the current year, the reserve is used as
a control mechanism.
Estimates
The annual Public Expenditure Survey
conducted by HM Treasury provides the
basis for the Estimates which each
government department submits to the
Treasury, giving details of its cash
requirements for the coming financial year.
After Treasury approval, these Supply
Estimates are presented to Parliament.
Parliamentary authorisation is required for
the major part of the new spending plans

BRITAIN 1993: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
for the year ahead announced in the
Budget. Parliament approves them as part
of the Annual Appropriation Act;
expenditure between 1 April and this date
is covered by Votes on Account approved
before the start of the financial year.
Supplementary Estimates may also be
presented to Parliament during the course
of the year.
If any Supply Estimate is overspent, the
Committee of Public Accounts (see below)
may investigate before Parliament is asked
to approve any Excess Vote to balance the
account. In each parliamentary session, up
to three ‘Estimates days’ are available for
debates on the Supply Estimates, following
scrutiny by select committees of the House
of Commons.
Cash Limits
The Government sets cash limits on 62 per
cent of Supply expenditure. The imposition
of cash limits indicates that the
Government intends to avoid extra
provision for programmes even in the event
of unexpected increases in costs. It is
government policy to extend the coverage of
cash limits whenever possible. They cover
the major part of grants to local authorities,
which are financed out of Supply
expenditure. Cash limits also apply to some
expenditure not voted in the Estimates.
Running cost limits are imposed on the
administrative costs of central government,
which are separately identified in the
Estimates.
There is a limited facility for carrying
forward underspending on the capital
components of cash limits and on running
cost limits. Any overspending of cash or
running cost limits leads to an investigation
into the causes and, where appropriate, a
reduction in the limits in the following year.
Those Estimates not subject to cash
limits mainly finance demand-led services
like income support from the Department
of Social Security. In such cases, once
policy and rates of payment are determined,
expenditure depends on factors beyond the
direct control of government, such as the
number of eligible recipients.
Examination and Audit of Public
Expenditure
Examination of public expenditure is carried
out by select committees of the House of
Commons. These study in detail the
activities of particular government
departments and require the attendance of
ministers and officials for cross-examination.
Audit of the Government’s spending, which
follows up the control inherent in
parliamentary approval of the Estimates, is
exercised through the functions of the
Comptroller and Auditor General.
Comptroller and Auditor General
The Comptroller and Auditor General, an
officer of the House of Commons appointed
by the Crown, has two distinct functions.
As Comptroller General he or she is
responsible for ensuring that all revenue and
other public money payable to the
Consolidated Fund and the National Loans
Fund (see p 361) is duly paid and that all
payments from these funds are authorised
by statute. As Auditor General he or she
must certify the accounts of all government
departments and executive agencies and
those of a wide range of other public sector
bodies; scrutinise the economy, efficiency
and effectiveness of their operations;
examine revenue accounts and inventories;
and report the results of these examinations
to Parliament.
Committee of Public Accounts
The Committee of Public Accounts
considers the accounts of government
departments and other public sector bodies;
the Comptroller and Auditor General’s
reports on them; and on departments’ use
of their resources. The Committee takes
evidence from the heads of departments and
relevant public sector bodies and submits
reports to Parliament. The Government’s
formal replies to the reports are presented
to Parliament by the Treasury in the form
of Treasury minutes, and the reports and
minutes are usually debated annually in the
Commons.
360
PUBLIC FINANCE
Central Government Funds
The Government’s sterling expenditure is
largely met out of the Consolidated Fund, an
account at the Bank of England into which
tax receipts and other revenues are paid. Any
excess of expenditure over receipts is met by
the National Loans Fund, which is another
official sterling account at the Bank of
England and is the repository for funds
borrowed by the Government. The National
Insurance Fund, into which contributions are
paid by employers and employed people, is
used mainly to pay for social security
benefits.
THE BUDGET
The Budget sets out the Government’s
proposals for changes in taxation and is the
main occasion for an annual review of
economic policy (see p 217). The proposals
are announced to the House of Commons by
the Chancellor of the Exchequer in the
Budget statement and are published in the
Financial Statement and Budget Report. This
report also contains a review of recent
developments in the economy, together
with an economic forecast, and sets out the
fiscal and monetary framework within
which economic policy operates. This is
the medium-term financial strategy
(see p 358).
The Budget statement is followed by the
moving of a set of Budget resolutions in
which the proposals are embodied. These
resolutions are the foundation of the Finance
Bill, in which the proposals are set out for
detailed consideration by Parliament. The
Provisional Collection of Taxes Act 1968
allows the Revenue authorities to collect taxes
provisionally, at the levels provided by the
Budget proposals, pending enactment of the
Finance Bill.
For two taxes—income tax and corporation
tax—annual Ways and Means resolutions
followed by Finance Bill clauses are required
to maintain their existence, since they are
annual rather than permanent taxes. Tax
changes can be made at other times, either by
specific legislation or by the use of the
regulator, which permits limited changes
between Budgets in the rates of value added
tax (by up to 25 per cent) and of the main
excise duties (by up to 10 per cent).
MAIN SOURCES OF REVENUE
The main sources of revenue are:
• taxes on income (including profits), which
include personal income tax, corporation
tax and petroleum revenue tax;
• inheritance tax and capital gains tax; and
• taxes on expenditure, which include value
added tax (VAT) and customs and excise
duties.
Other sources of revenue are vehicle excise
duty; National Insurance contributions, which
give entitlement to a range of benefits; and
the community charge and business rates.
The personal income tax allowances, basic
rate limit, capital gains tax annual exempt
amount and inheritance tax threshold are
statutorily linked to the increase in the Retail
Prices Index (RPI), unless Parliament decides
otherwise. The Inland Revenue assesses and
collects the taxes on income, profits and
capital, and also stamp duty (see p 365).
Taxes on individual incomes are progressive
in that larger incomes bear a proportionatelv
greater amount of tax. HM Customs and
Excise collects the most important taxes on
expenditure (VAT, most duties and car tax).
Vehicle excise duty is the responsibility of the
Department of Transport and National
Insurance contributions that of the
Department of Social Security (although the
latter are generally collected by the Inland
Revenue). The community charge and
business rates are collected by local
authorities.
Taxpayer's Charter
The Taxpayer’s Charter was launched in
1991, one of the first separate charters issued
following the publication of the Citizen’s
Charter (see p 50). It sets out the standard of
service that people can expect from the Inland
Revenue and Customs and Excise. Both
departments should be fair, helpful,
courteous, efficient and accountable, and keep
taxpayers’ financial affairs private.

Taxes on Income
Income Tax
Income tax is imposed for the year of
assessment beginning on 6 April. In the 1992
Budget a new lower rate of 20 per cent was
introduced for the first £2,000 of taxable
income. The basic rate of 25 per cent applies
to the next £21,700 of taxable income. A rate
of 40 per cent is levied on income above
£23,700. These rates apply to total income,
including both earned and investment income.
A number of allowances and reliefs reduce
the amount of a person’s taxable income
compared with gross income. All taxpayers,
irrespective of sex or marital status, are
entitled to a personal allowance against
income from all sources. Married women pay
their own tax on the basis of their own
income. In addition, there is a married
couple’s allowance which, until April 1993,
goes to the husband in the first instance.
From April 1993 married couples will be able
to choose to allocate the married couple’s
allowance to the wife instead of the husband
or receive half each. Wives will be entitled to
claim half of the allowance as of right. For
1992-93, the values of the main allowances
are £3,445 for the personal allowance and
£1,720 for the married couple’s allowance.
Among the most important of the reliefs is
that for mortgage interest payments on
borrowing for house purchase up to the statu¬
tory limit of £30,000. Relief is restricted to
the basic rate and is usually given ‘at source’,
that is, repayments which the borrower makes
to the lender are reduced to take account of
tax at the basic rate and the tax refund is
then passed directly by the tax authorities to
the building society or bank making the loan
rather than to the individual taxpayer.
Employees’ contributions to their pension
schemes also qualify for tax relief within
limits laid down by Parliament.
Most wage and salary earners pay their
income tax under a Pay-As-You-Earn
(PAYE) system whereby tax is deducted and
accounted for to the Inland Revenue by the
employer, in a way which enables employees
to keep as up to date as possible with their
tax payments.
In general, income tax is charged on all
income which originates in Britain—although
some forms of income are exempt, such as
certain social security benefits—and on all
income arising abroad of people resident in
Britain. Interest on certain British
government securities belonging to people not
ordinarily resident in Britain is exempt.
Britain has entered into agreements with
many countries to provide relief from double
taxation; where such agreements are not in
force unilateral relief is often allowed. British
residents working abroad for the whole year
benefit from 100 per cent tax relief.
Corporation Tax
The rates of company tax in Britain are lower
than in most other industrialised countries.
Companies pay corporation tax on their
income after deduction of certain allowances
and any capital gains. A company which
distributes profits to its shareholders is
required to make an advance payment of
corporation tax to the Inland Revenue. In
general, this payment is set against a
company’s liability to corporation tax on its
income and capital gains. If resident in
Britain, the recipient of the distribution is
entitled to a tax credit, which satisfies his or
her liability to income tax at the basic rate.
The main rate of corporation tax is 33 per
cent for 1992-93, with a reduced rate of 25
per cent for small companies (those with
profits below £250,000 in a year). Marginal
relief between the main rate and the small
companies’ rate is allowed for companies with
profits between £250,000 and £1'25 million.
Expenditure on plant and machinery, on
scientific research and on industrial and
certain other buildings qualifies for annual
allowances.
Petroleum Revenue Tax
Petroleum revenue tax, deductible in
computing profits for corporation tax, is
charged on profits from the production, as
opposed, for example, to the refining, of oil
and gas under licence in Britain and on its
Continental Shelf. The rate of tax is 75 per
cent. Each licensee of an oilfield is charged
362
PUBLIC FINANCE
on the profits from that field after deduction
of certain allowances and reliefs which,
among other things, encourage exploration,
appraisal and future field development. There
is no distinction between capital and revenue
expenditure: both receive 100 per cent relief.
The tax is computed at half-yearly intervals
and the bulk of it is collected in monthly
instalments.
Inheritance Tax
Inheritance tax applies to transfers of
property made on, or up to seven years
before, the donor’s death. It is also
immediately chargeable on certain lifetime
transfers. The 1992 Budget exempted the
majority of business assets from inheritance
tax, so that most family businesses can be
passed on without a tax charge. The
threshold for inheritance tax is £150,000,
above which transfers are taxed at a single
rate of 40 per cent. A tapered system of relief
reduces the tax on transfers made between
three and seven years before the donor’s
death. Relief ranges from 20 per cent of the
tax payable on transfers made between three
and four years prior to death to 80 per cent
on those made between six and seven years
prior to death.
There are several other important
exemptions. Generally, transfers between
spouses are exempt, and gifts and bequests to
British charities, major political parties and
heritage bodies are also normally exempt.
Capital Gains Tax
Capital gains realised on the disposal of assets
are liable to capital gains tax or, in the case of
companies, to corporation tax. For 1992-93,
individuals are exempt from tax in respect of
total net gains of up to £5,800 in any one
year and most trusts on gains of up to
£2,900. Gains are treated as the taxpayer’s
top slice of income, being charged at the
individual’s highest income tax rate or the
company’s higher corporation tax rate.
Only gains arising since March 1982 are
subject to tax and the effects of inflation are
allowed for when measuring gains. The tax
on certain gifts may be deferred until the
assets are sold. Some assets are normally
exempt, including the principal private
residence; movable possessions worth less
than £6,000 and any movable possessions
with a predictable life of less than 50 years
except those on which the expenditure
qualifies for a capital allowance; private motor
cars; and National Savings Certificates and
Bonds. Gains on government securities and
certain corporate bonds are exempt from the
tax, as are gains on shares owned under
personal equity plans. This last exemption is
designed to encourage wider share ownership.
Taxes on Expenditure
Value Added Tax
Value added tax (VAT) is a broadly based
expenditure tax, chargeable at 17-5 per cent.
It is collected at each stage in the production
and distribution of goods and services by
taxable persons—generally those whose
business has a turnover of more than £36,000
a year. The final tax is borne by the
consumer. When a taxable person purchases
taxable goods or services, the supplier charges
VAT—the taxable person’s input tax. When
the taxable person supplies goods or services,
the customers are then in turn charged VAT,
which is the taxable person’s output tax. The
difference between the output tax and the
input tax is paid to, or repaid by, Customs
and Excise.
Certain goods and services are relieved
from VAT, either by charging at a zero rate,
in which case a taxable person does not
charge tax to a customer but reclaims any
input tax paid to suppliers, or by exemption,
in which case a taxable person does not
charge a customer any output tax and is not
entitled to deduct or reclaim the input tax.
Zero-rating applies to goods exported to non-
European Community countries, goods
despatched or transported to traders in
Community countries, new means of
transport, and goods shipped as stores on
ships and aircraft; most food; books,
newspapers and periodicals; some fuel and
power for domestic consumption;
construction of new residential buildings;
works to certain historic buildings;

international services; certain passenger
transport; supplies of certain caravans and
houseboats; young children’s clothing and
footwear; drugs and medicines supplied on
prescription; specified aids for handicapped
people; and certain supplies by or to
charities. Exemption applies to many
supplies of land and buildings, although
some are standard-rated; insurance; postal
services; betting; gaming (subject to certain
important exceptions); lotteries; finance;
much education and training; health and
welfare; charitable ‘one-off fundraising
events; burial and cremation; and many
supplies by trade unions and professional
bodies to their members.
VAT is not charged where an employee is
offered a reduction in salary in return for
the use of a company car for private
motoring. Private taxi and self-drive hire
firms and driving schools can recover the
VAT they pay on cars purchased for their
businesses.
A provisional European Community
agreement establishes a Community-wide
minimum standard rate of VAT of 15 per
cent for four years from January 1993.
Customs Duties
Customs duties are chargeable on goods
from outside the EC in accordance with the
EC’s Common Customs Tariff. The
introduction of the single European market
from 1 January 1993 means that goods can
move freely across internal frontiers between
different member states, without making
customs entries at importation or stopping
for routine fiscal checks. For commercial
consignments, excise duty is charged in the
member state of destination, at the rate in
force in that state.
Excise Duties
Hydrocarbon oils used as road fuel bear
higher rates of duty than those used for
other purposes, although the rate of duty on
unleaded petrol is lower than that on leaded.
Kerosene, most lubricating oils and other
oils used for certain industrial processes are
free of duty. There are duties on spirits,
beer, wine, made-wine, cider and perry,
based on alcoholic strength and volume.
Spirits used for scientific, medical, research
and industrial processes are generally free of
duty. Cigarette duty is based partly on a
cash charge per 1,000 cigarettes and partly
on a percentage of retail price. Duty on
other tobacco products is based on weight.
Duties are charged on off-course betting,
pool betting, gaming in casinos, bingo and
gaming machines. Rates vary with the
particular form of gambling. Duty is
charged either as a percentage of gross or
net stakes or, in the case of gaming
machines, as a fixed amount per machine
according to the cost of playing it and its
prize level.
Vehicle excise duty on a privately owned
motor car, light van or taxi with less than
nine seats is £110 a year; for motor cycles it
is £15, £30 or £50 a year according to
engine capacity. The duty on goods vehicles
is levied on the basis of gross weight and, if
over 12 tonnes, according to the number of
axles; the duty is designed to ensure that
such vehicles cover their road costs through
the tax paid (licence duty and fuel duty).
Duty on taxis and buses varies according to
seating capacity.
Car Tax
Cars, motor cycles, scooters, mopeds and
motor caravans, whether British made,
brought to Britain from another EC country
or imported from a non-EC country, are
chargeable with car tax. The current rate is
5 per cent and is calculated on the wholesale
value of the vehicle, except in the case of
motor caravans, where the tax is applied to
60 per cent of the wholesale value.
Stamp Duty
Certain kinds of transfer are subject to
stamp duty. These include purchases of
houses, at 1 per cent on the total price if
this exceeds £30,000, and instruments such
as declarations of trust. The Government
has plans to abolish stamp duty on shares.
Transfers by gift and transfers to charities
are exempt.

BRITAIN 1993: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
OTHER REVENUE
National Insurance Contributions
There are four classes of National Insurance
contribution:
• Class 1—paid by employees and their
employers;
• Class 2—paid by the self-employed;
• Class 3—paid voluntarily for pension
purposes; and
• Class 4—paid by the self-employed on
their taxable profits over a set lower
limit, currently £6,120 a year, and up to
a set upper limit, currently £21,060 a
year (in addition to their Class 2
contribution).
Employees with earnings below £54 a
week do not pay Class 1 contributions.
Contributions on earnings of £54 a week and
over are at the rate of 2 per cent of the first
£54 of total earnings and 9 per cent of the
balance, up to the upper earnings limit of
£405 a week. Employers’ contributions are
subject to the same threshold. On earnings
above the threshold, contributions rise in
stages from 4 6 per cent of total earnings up
to a maximum of 10-4 per cent when
earnings are £190 or more a week; there is no
upper earnings limit.
Class 2 and Class 3 contributions are at a
flat rate—£5-35 and £5-25 a week
respectively. The self-employed may claim
exemption from payment of Class 2
contributions if their profits are expected to
be below £3,030 for the 1992-93 tax year.
Class 4 contributions are payable at the
rate of 6 3 per cent.
Local Authority Revenue
A major source of local authority revenue in
Great Britain (but not Northern Ireland) is
the community charge. This is set at a level
reflecting spending decisions reached by a
council, for which it has to account to its
electors. However, the community charge is
to be abolished and replaced by a council tax
with effect from 1 April 1993.
In Northern Ireland, the rates—local
property taxes—have been retained. Domestic
rates were collected by local authorities
throughout Britain prior to the introduction
of the community charge.
The council tax, like the community
charge, will be collected by the local
authorities. It will be based on the
market value of property and will take
account of the number of adults in
each household, with discounts
available for single adult and certain
other households. Properties will be
allocated to one of eight broad
valuation bands and associated tax
rates will be established for England
and Wales. Similar provisions will
apply in Scotland.
In England and Wales the national non¬
domestic rate is set by central government
and collected by local authorities. It is paid
into a national pool and redistributed to local
authorities. In Scotland non-domestic rates
are levied by local authorities. In Northern
Ireland industrial premises are fully derated,
as are commercial premises in enterprise
zones. Certain other properties in Northern
Ireland, such as freight transport and
recreational premises, are partially derated.
FINANCIAL CONTROL
Balancing the budget over the medium-term
remains the objective of fiscal policy.
Between 1987-88 and 1990-91 the public
sector was in surplus, so that the
Government repaid debt. The onset of
recession in 1990 led to an increased level of
public borrowing. Following a Public Sector
Borrowing Requirement (PSBR) of about
£14,000 million—2-25 per cent of GDP—
in 1991-92, the PSBR for 1992-93 is
expected to increase to about £28,000
million, 4 5 per cent of GDP. The
Government is confident that, as the
economy recovers, the PSBR will move back
towards balance and the debt burden will
resume its downward trend. It aims to
finance the PSBR so as to support monetary
policy while having the least possible effect
on private sector liquidity.
The major government debt instrument is
known as gilt-edged stock as there is no risk
366
PUBLIC FINANCE
of default. Gilt-edged stock is marketable and
is widely traded. Individuals may also make
transactions through post offices in stocks
included on the National Savings Stock
Register. Pension funds and life insurance
companies have the largest holdings. On
behalf of the Government, the Bank of
England issues both conventional and indexed
stock (on which principal and interest are
linked to the movement in the Retail Prices
Index). Issues are mostly by auction or fixed
price ‘tap’ sales.
An important additional source of
government finance is the range of National
Savings products, which are non-marketable
and are designed to attract personal savings.
The chief products (see p 263) are Income
Bonds, National Savings Certificates (which
may be index-linked), the Investment
Account, Capital Bonds and a Children’s
Bonus Bond. A new product—the First
Option Bond, designed to appeal to
taxpayers—was launched in July 1992.
Other central government debt instruments
are Treasury bills and certificates of tax
deposit. Sterling Treasury bills are sold at a
weekly tender; the majority have a maturity
of three months. The Government has also
issued bills denominated and payable in
European Currency Units (ECUs) since 1988
and longer-dated ECU notes since January
1992. The proceeds have been added to the
official foreign exchange reserves as opposed
to being used to finance public expenditure.
The bulk of public corporations’
borrowing is funded by central government,
although their temporary borrowing needs are
met largely from the market, usually under
Treasury guarantee. That part of local
authority borrowing met by central
government is supplied by authorisation of
Parliament through the Public Works Loan
Board from the National Loans Fund. The
Board remains an independent body even
though it is merged for administrative
purposes with the former National Debt
Office, forming the National Investment and
Loans Office. Local authorities may also
borrow directly from the market, both short¬
term and long-term, through a range of
instruments. Some public corporations and
local authorities borrow on occasion, under
special statutory power and with Treasury
consent, in foreign currencies.
Net Public Sector Debt
Public sector borrowing, or debt repayment,
each year represents an addition to, or
subtraction from, the net debt of the public
sector. This debt is the consolidated debt of
the public sector less its holdings of liquid
assets. At the end of March 1991
consolidated debt amounted to 194,000
million. Central government accounted for
nearly 97 per cent, local authorities for almost
3 per cent and public corporations for under
0 5 per cent. With consolidated liquid assets
amounting to £40,000 million, net public
sector debt was £154,000 million. Central
government accounted for nearly 79 per cent
of consolidated liquid assets, local authorities
for 18 per cent and public corporations for
about 3 per cent.
367
20 Overseas Trade
Overseas trade has been of vital importance
to the British economy for hundreds of
years, and especially since the mid¬
nineteenth century, when the rapid growth
of industry, commerce and shipping was
accompanied by Britain’s development as an
international trading centre. Although small
in area and accounting for only about 1 per
cent of the world’s population, Britain is the
fifth largest trading nation in the world, and,
as a member of the European Community,
part of the world’s largest trading bloc,
accounting for about a third of all trade.
Exports of goods and services in 1991
were equivalent to about a quarter of gross
domestic product (GDP). Britain is a major
supplier of machinery, aerospace products,
electrical and electronic equipment and
chemicals, and a significant oil exporter. It
relies upon imports for about a third of
total consumption of foodstuffs, and for
many of the basic materials needed for its
industries.
VISIBLE TRADE
In 1991 Britain’s exports of goods were
valued at about £103,700 million and its
imports of goods at £113,800 million on a
balance-of-payments basis (see Table 20.1).
Between 1990 and 1991 the volume of
exports rose by T7 per cent and the value of
exports by 1-6 per cent. Over the same
period imports declined by 2 7 per cent in
terms of volume, and by 5-7 per cent in total
value.
Commodity Composition
Britain has traditionally been an exporter of
manufactured goods and an importer of food
and basic materials. In 1970 manufactures
accounted for 85 per cent of Britain’s
exports. The proportion fell in the early
1980s—to around 67 per cent by the middle
of the decade—as North Sea oil exports
increased their share. The proportion of

OVERSEAS TRADE
manufactures in exports has since risen, to 82
per cent in 1991. The share of finished
manufactures in total imports rose from 25
per cent in 1970 to 51 per cent in 1991.
Britain has not had a surplus on
manufactures since 1982. Machinery and
transport equipment account for over a third
of exports and a similar proportion of
imports. Export sectors that have declined in
relative importance include textiles and
vehicles. Textiles accounted for 5 per cent of
total exports in 1970 but only 2 per cent in
1991; the corresponding figures for vehicles
were 11 and 8 per cent.
Since the mid-1970s North Sea oil has
made a significant contribution to Britain’s
overseas trade both in terms of exports and
import substitution. Between 1975 and 1991
the share of fuels in exports changed from 4
to 7 per cent and in imports from 18 to 6 per
cent. North Sea oil production has now
passed its peak of the mid-1980s, when
exports of fuels accounted for over 20
per cent of total exports. In 1991 the
surplus on trade in oil amounted to about
£1,200 million.
Since the early 1960s Britain’s imports of
semi-manufactures have exceeded those of
basic materials; they are now more than six
times as high. This reflects the increasing
tendency for producing countries to carry out
the processing of primary products up to the
semi-finished or finished stage. Imported
manufactures have also taken a greater share
of the domestic market. The share of basic
materials in total imports has fallen from 15
per cent in 1970 to 4 per cent in 1991. The
share of food, beverages and tobacco in total

"On an overseas trade statistics basis. Exports are f.o.b.; imports c.i.f.
imports has fallen from around 35 per cent in
the 1950s to 10 per cent in 1991 as a result
both of the increasing extent to which food
demand has been met from domestic
agriculture and the decline in the proportion
of total expenditure on food.
Geographical Distribution
Britain’s overseas trade is mainly—and
increasingly—with other developed countries.
In 1970 these accounted for 73 per cent of
exports and a similar proportion of imports;
by 1991 the shares were 81 and 84 per cent
respectively. In 1970 non-oil developing
countries accounted for 17 per cent of
Britain’s exports and 15 per cent of imports;
by 1991 they accounted for 12 per cent of
both Britain’s exports and imports.
In 1972, the year before Britain joined the
European Community (EC), around a third
of Britain’s trade was with the other 11
countries which today make up the
Community. The proportion is now more
than half, and is expected to increase with
the completion of the single European market
by the end of 1992 (see p 64). Western
Europe as a whole took almost two-thirds of
Britain’s exports in 1991. Trade with other
Commonwealth countries has declined in
importance.
European Community countries accounted
for seven of Britain’s top ten export markets
and for six of the ten leading suppliers of
goods to Britain in 1991 (see Table 20.3).
From 1981 to 1989 the United States was
Britain’s largest single market but in 1990 it
was overtaken by Germany. Germany is also
Britain’s largest single supplier; in 1991 it
took 14 per cent of Britain’s exports and
supplied 15 per cent of Britain’s imports.
There have been a number of changes in
the pattern of Britain’s overseas trade in
recent years. The growth in wealth of the oil-

exporting countries during the 1970s led to a
sharp increase in their imports from all
sources and by the early 1980s they were
taking some 12 per cent of Britain’s exports.
However, by 1991, their share of Britain’s
exports had fallen to 5 per cent, partly
because of a reduction in the price of oil. In
1973 the oil-exporting countries supplied 10
per cent of Britain’s imports but, with Britain
achieving self-sufficiency in oil, the
proportion had fallen to 2 per cent by 1991.
Britain’s exports to the newly
industrialised economies of the Asia-Pacific
Rim, such as Thailand and Malaysia, have
been growing rapidly. In 1991, its exports to
Korea rose by 27 per cent, exports to Taiwan
grew by 21 per cent and those to Hong Kong
increased by 12 per cent. Japan has steadily
increased its share of Britain’s imports and
now accounts for about 6 per cent. Since
1980 the percentage of Britain’s total exports
going to Japan has doubled, and Japan is
Britain’s tenth largest market. There are signs
of improved prospects for trade with the
Middle East. In 1991, Britain’s exports to
Lebanon increased by over 60 per cent, those
to Iran, Syria and Morocco grew by around
30 per cent and exports to Turkey rose by
nearly 20 per cent.
INVISIBLE TRANSACTIONS
Transactions on invisible trade fall into three
main groups:
• internationally tradeable services;
• interest, profits and dividends on external
assets; and
• transfers between governments.
Invisible trade is of fundamental
importance to Britain’s economy; overseas
earnings from invisibles amounted to
£116,000 million in 1991—over £12,000
million more than earnings from visible trade.
Services range from banking, insurance
and stockbroking to specialist services such as
consultancy, computer programming, training
and tourism. Britain’s trade on services has
been in surplus for over 200 years, excluding
war periods. Its tradeable services account for
around 40 per cent of total output.
371
BRITAIN 1993: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Interest, profits and dividends on external
assets have rarely been in deficit; transfers,
however, have almost always been in deficit.
For invisible trade as a whole, the deficit of
general government is more than offset by
the substantial surplus of the private sector
(including public corporations), resulting in
an overall surplus. General government
transactions are relatively unimportant in
either the services or the interest, profits and
dividends accounts but they form the greater
part of the transfers account. In 1991 the
private sector had a surplus of about
million on invisible trade while government
had a deficit of about £3,600 million.
Britain’s earnings from invisible trade
are second only to those of the United
States and some 10 per cent of the
world’s exports of services come from
Britain.
Earnings from private sector services in
1991 amounted to £31,300 million and debits
were £23,900 million, leading to a surplus of
about £7,400 million, compared with one of
around £6,900 million in 1990. The surplus
on private sector interest, profits and
dividends was £460 million in 1991—about
the same as in 1990. Earnings on portfolio
investment (investment in overseas securities)
and on direct investment overseas remained
high—at £9,300 million and £13,500 million
respectively—reflecting in part the substantial
volume of overseas investment following the
abolition of exchange controls in 1979 and
changes in the method of foreign currency
lending by banks located in Britain.
The deficit on private sector transfers in
1991 was £300 million, while that on
government transfers was £1,050 million.
The deficit on government transfers was
lower than in previous years because of
contributions by other countries towards
Britain’s costs in the Gulf conflict.
COMMERCIAL POLICY
Britain remains committed to the open
multilateral trading system and to the further
liberalisation of world trade. To this end it
has taken a leading part in the activities of
such organisations as the General Agreement
on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), the
International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the
Organisation for Economic Co-operation and
Development (OECD). It has given full
support to the current round of multilateral
trade negotiations. Since 1973, when Britain
joined, the European Community has acted
for Britain in international trade negotiations.
The Community’s common customs tariff is,

at a trade-weighted average of 2 5 per cent,
similar to the tariffs of most major
industrialised countries.
Single European Market
Britain strongly supports the drive to
complete the single European market by the
end of 1992. The single European market
programme, launched in 1985, is designed to
eliminate the remaining trade barriers within
the Community and is expected to provide
substantial opportunities for business and
benefits for consumers.
European Community rules provide for
free and fair competition in trade between
member states. Practices which hinder
competition are prohibited under the Treaty
of Rome. Similarly, abuses of dominant
positions are not allowed and mergers can be
examined by the European Commission.
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade
Tariffs and non-tariff barriers to trade have
been considerably reduced in the seven
rounds of multilateral trade negotiations
completed since 1947 under the auspices of
GATT, the most recent one completed being
the Tokyo Round (1973-79). Britain
participates in these negotiations as a member
of the European Community.
The eighth round of GATT multilateral
trade negotiations (the Uruguay Round) was
launched in 1986. It is the most ambitious
and wide-ranging round of trade negotiations
ever. The most recent stage of negotiations
started in February 1991. The Uruguay
Round’s main concerns are:
• to bring trade in agriculture and textiles
fully within the GATT system;
• to achieve further reductions in tariff and
non-tariff barriers;
• to extend GATT disciplines to the new
areas of intellectual property, investment
and services; and
• to strengthen the GATT system, so that
it can deal more effectively with trade
distortions and disputes.
The British Government remains
committed to a successful conclusion to the
Uruguay Round and is working to bring this
about as soon as possible.
European Community Agreements
Britain applies the common customs tariff to
all countries neither belonging to, nor having
any special arrangement with, the European
Community (EC). There is duty-free trade
between those member states that joined
before 1986. Portugal and Spain joined at the
beginning of that year. Their trade with the
rest of the Community is in a transitional
stage: tariffs on industrial products are due to
be phased out by the beginning of 1993, but
those on certain agricultural products will
be dismantled over a longer period.
Austria, Turkey, Malta, Cyprus, Finland,
Switzerland and Sweden have applied for EC
membership.
The EC signed an agreement in May 1992
with the members of the European Free
Trade Association (EFTA—Austria, Finland,
Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway, Sweden and
Switzerland) on the creation of the European
Economic Area (EEA). The British
Government hopes that the draft agreement
will be ratified by all the national parliaments
by 1 January 1993.
The EEA will form a single market of
19 west European states based on
Community legislation establishing
free movement of goods, services,
capital and people. It will create a
market of 380 million consumers,
accounting for nearly half the world’s
trade.
The EC also has reciprocal preferential
trading agreements with Cyprus, Israel, Malta
and Turkey and non-reciprocal agreements
with Algeria, Morocco, Tunisia, Egypt,
Jordan, the Occupied Territories, Lebanon,
Syria and, under the Lome Convention, with
a group of 69 African, Caribbean and Pacific
developing countries. The Lome Convention
gives these countries tariff-free access, subject
to certain safeguards, to the EC for industrial
goods and most agricultural products. Tariff
preference is given to developing countries
under the Generalised System of Preferences,
373
BRITAIN 1993: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
and also to the Faroe Islands and the overseas
dependencies and territories of member states.
Economic co-operation agreements exist
between the EC and several Latin American
countries, the People’s Republic of China, the
Association of South East Asian Nations and
the six members of the Gulf Co-operation
Council. Negotiations are in progress which
may lead to the establishment of a free trade
area embracing the Community and the
Council.
The EC has negotiated trade, commercial
and economic co-operation agreements with
Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Poland,
Romania, Albania, the Baltic states and the
former Soviet Union. These agreements
cover trade concessions and co-operation in
areas such as energy, agriculture, transport
and the environment. Association agreements
are currently being negotiated with
Czechoslovakia, Bulgaria, Hungary and
Poland to facilitate closer political and
economic ties and the eventual creation of a
free trade zone, with a view to those
countries becoming full members of the EC.
CONTROLS ON TRADE
Britain maintains few restrictions on its
international trade. Most goods may be
imported freely and only a narrow range of
goods is subject to any sort of export control.
Import Controls
In accordance with its international
obligations under GATT and to the
European Community, Britain has
progressively removed almost all quantitative
import restrictions imposed on economic
grounds. The few remaining quantitative
restrictions mainly affect textile goods (in
view of the rapid contraction of the domestic
textile industry). They stem primarily from
the Multi-Fibre Arrangement (MFA), under
which a series of bilateral agreements cover
international trade in textiles, designed to
balance the interests of both exporting and
importing countries. The present MFA
expired in 1991 but has been extended to the
end of 1992, pending its phasing out as part
of the Uruguay Round of GATT. A small
number of quantitative restrictions are also
maintained against non-GATT countries.
Britain, in accordance with European
Community directives, operates a ban on the
import from North Korea and South Africa
of certain iron and steel products.
Quantitative restrictions have been
removed from imports of goods of EC origin.
However, there are exceptions: Britain
continues to apply internationally recognised
restrictions on non-economic grounds to
imports from all countries of products such
as Firearms, ammunition and nuclear
materials. Non-economic restrictions are also
applied to goods such as meat and poultry;
animals, birds, bees, fish and plants and some
of their derivatives; unlicenced controlled
drugs; explosives; fireworks; certain offensive
weapons; certain citizens’ band radios;
indecent or obscene articles and products
derived from endangered species.
Export Controls
The great majority of British exports are not
subject to any government control or
direction except for presentation and
declaration to HM Customs and Excise to
enable them to exercise any necessary
controls and collect overseas trade statistics.
Controls govern the export of goods
associated with biological, chemical and
nuclear weapons and missiles. There are also
controls on the export of firearms, military
equipment and of dual-use industrial goods—
those that can be used for both civil and
military purposes.
Other controls include those for health
certification purposes on certain animals, meat
and fish exported to another member of the
European Community; on endangered animal
and plant species; and on antiques and works
of art, including photographic material, docu¬
ments, manuscripts and archaeological items.
The Co-ordinating Committee for
Multilateral Export Controls (COCOM), of
which Britain is a member, has already
agreed on extensive relaxation in East/West
controls because of the political changes in
Eastern Europe. The break-up of the former
Soviet Union is expected to change these
controls still further.
374
OVERSEAS TRADE
Britain is a member of the Australia
Group and of the Missile Technology
Control Regime, international bodies which
aim to prevent the spread of weapons of
mass destruction. It has issued a list of
countries of concern, along with lists of
controlled goods and technologies used in
the production, handling or storage of
nuclear, chemical and biological weapons and
missile technology. Also listed are controlled
dual-use items. All controls are introduced
while attempting to minimise the regulatory
burden on business.
GOVERNMENT SERVICES
The Government assists exporters by
creating conditions favourable to the export
trade and by providing practical help, advice
and financial support.
Export Promotion Services
The major government departments involved
in export promotion collaborate under the
auspices of Overseas Trade Services. The
departments are: the Department of Trade
and Industry (DTI), the Foreign &
Commonwealth Office, the Industry
Department of the Welsh Office, Scottish
Trade International and the Industrial
Development Board of Northern Ireland.
The operation is conducted from the DTFs
London headquarters, from 11 regional
offices throughout Britain and from nearly
200 diplomatic posts overseas.
The range of services available includes
the dissemination of export intelligence,
assistance in researching potential markets,
help at trade fairs and support for firms
participating in trade missions. In 1991-92
some £173 million was spent on support for
exporters.
Overseas Trade Services is advised by the
British Overseas Trade Board (BOTB),
which involves some 200 experienced
business people in its work. The BOTB has
14 area advisory groups, each dealing with
different areas of the world, and particular
industrial sectors within them. Overseas
Trade Services focuses particular attention
on 54 target markets, 27 of which fall within
three top priority areas for official export
promotion—Western Europe, North America,
Japan and the Asia-Pacific Rim.
British Invisibles, which is financed almost
entirely by contributions from the private
sector, especially City institutions, promotes
measures to encourage invisible trade.
ECGD
ECGD is a government department,
responsible to the Secretary of State for
Trade and Industry. It provides facilities for
medium- and long-term export credit on
projects and capital goods exports. By
guaranteeing credit, ECGD helps British
exporters overcome many of the risks in
selling overseas. In December 1991 the
Insurance Services Group, formerly part of
ECGD, was sold to the private sector
following a competitive tendering process.
The ECGD specialises in making available
insurance for exporters of capital goods sold
on short-term credit.
BALANCE OF PAYMENTS
The balance-of-payments statistics record
transactions between residents of Britain and
non-residents. The transactions are classified
into two groups: current account (visibles and
invisibles) and transactions in assets and
liabilities. The balance on current account
shows whether Britain has had a surplus of
income over expenditure.
Since 1983 Britain has had a deficit on
visible trade. It has traditionally run a surplus
on trade in invisibles. Between 1990 and 1991
the deficit on visible trade fell from £18,800
million to £10,300 million. The surplus on
invisibles rose from £1,800 million to almost
£4,000 million. The surplus on services
increased by £400 million; that on interest,
profits and dividends declined by £1,800
million; and the deficit on transfers fell by
£3,500 million.
Capital Flows
Britain has no exchange controls; residents
are free to acquire foreign currency for any
purpose, including direct and portfolio

investment overseas. There are also no
controls on the lending of sterling abroad
and non-residents may freely acquire
sterling for any purpose. Gold may be
freely bought and sold. Exchange controls
were abolished in 1979, and Britain meets
in full its obligations on capital movements
under the OECD code on capital
movements and under European
Community directives.
The Government welcomes both
outward and inward investment. Outward
investment helps to develop markets for
British exports while providing earnings in
the form of interest, profits and dividends.
Inward investment is promoted by DTI’s
Invest in Britain Bureau as a means of
introducing new technology, products,
management styles and attitudes; creating
employment; and increasing exports or
substituting imports.
Inward direct investment in 1991 was
£12,000 million, compared with £18,600
million in 1990. In 1991 direct investment
overseas by British residents was about
£10,300 million, and outward portfolio
investment was £30,900 million, almost
twice the 1990 level. The inflow of direct
and portfolio investment into Britain
amounted to £28,700 million, an increase of
more than £4,700 million on the previous
year. An analysis of transactions in Britain’s
external assets and liabilities is given in
Table 20.6.
External Assets and Liabilities
At the end of 1991, Britain’s identified
external assets exceeded identified external
liabilities by £16,100 million. The previous
year, liabilities had exceeded assets by £400
million. Net assets of the private sector and
public corporations amounted to £7,100
million and those of general government to
£9,000 million.
Direct investment assets overseas of
British residents (investment in branches,
sudsidiaries and associated companies)
totalled £129,600 at the end of 1991 and
portfolio investment £239,100. At the end of
1989 (the latest year for which data are
available), over 86 per cent of direct
investment was in developed countries, with
over 42 per cent in the United States and 24
per cent in the European Community. In
1989 manufacturing accounted for 54 per
cent of net outward direct investment made
that year, energy for 6 per cent and financial
services for 8 per cent.
The significance of any inventory of
Britain’s aggregate external assets and
liabilities is limited because a variety of
claims and obligations are included that are
very dissimilar in kind, in degree of liquidity
and in method of valuation. For example,
while portfolio investment is valued at
estimated market prices, direct investment is
given at book value, which is likely to
understate its current market value.

Direct investment in Britain by overseas
residents amounted to £127,000 million at
the end of 1991 and portfolio investment to
£131,200 million. At the end of 1989,
investment from developed countries
accounted for 95 per cent of overseas direct
investment in Britain: 39 per cent originated
in the United States and 28 per cent in the
European Community. During 1989, 41 per
cent of net direct inward investment was in
manufacturing, 12 per cent was in energy and
30 per cent was in financial services.
Another type of overseas transaction is
company cross-border acquisitions and
mergers carried out by British companies. In
1991 these were valued at £8,300 million,
while the corresponding figure for operations
in Britain by overseas companies was £6,600
million. The European Community
accounted for 41 per cent of the value of
acquisitions and mergers by British
companies and the United States for 39 per
cent. The European Community also
accounted for 27 per cent of the value of
acquisitions and mergers by overseas
companies.
377
21 Promotion of Science
and Technology
Britain has a long tradition of research and
innovation in science and technology in
universities, research institutes and industry.
Its record of achievement is in many ways
unsurpassed, from the contributions of Isaac
Newton to physics and astronomy in the
sixteenth and seventeenth centuries (theory of
gravitation and three laws of motion) to the
inventions of Michael Faraday in the
nineteenth century (the first electric motor,
generator and transformer). This record has
been maintained throughout the twentieth
century. For example, fundamental
contributions to modern molecular genetics
were made through the discovery of the
three-dimensional molecular structure of
deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) by Francis
Crick, Maurice Wilkins, James Watson and
Rosalind Franklin at Cambridge University
in 1953.
Other notable contributions over the last
20 years have been made by Stephen
Hawking in improving the understanding of
the nature and origin of the universe; Brian
Josephson in superconductivity (abnormally
high electrical conductivity at low
temperatures); Martin Ryle and Anthony
Hewish in radio-astrophysics; Frederick
Sanger in molecular biology; Cesar Milstein
in monoclonal antibodies; and Godfrey
Hounsfield in computer-assisted tomography
for medical diagnosis.
Much pioneering work was done during
the 1980s. Michael Green helped to develop
the superstring theories, which shed new
light on the composition of matter. In 1985
Alec Jeffreys invented DNA fingerprinting, a
forensic technique which can identify an
individual from a small tissue sample. The
first combined heart, lungs and liver
transplant was carried out at Papworth
Hospital, Cambridge, in 1986. There have
been several breakthroughs in genetics
research, including the identification of the
gene in the Y chromosome responsible for
determining sex, and the identification of
other genes linked to diseases, including cystic
fibrosis and a type of inherited heart disease.
Nobel prizes for science have been won by
70 British citizens.
Research and Development in Industry
Industries with the highest levels of research
and development (R & D) spending are
electrical, electronic and instrument
engineering; chemicals; and aerospace. Some
examples of recent notable R & D projects in
these sectors are given below.
Electronics
British firms and research organisations, with
government support, are involved in the
development and application of the new
family of ‘three-five’ semiconductor materials
(such as gallium arsenide). These materials
are used in microwave devices and are
leading to the development of much faster
computers. British Telecom (BT) has led in
the development of optical fibre
communications systems and has paved the
way for simpler and cheaper optical cables by
laying the first non-repeatered cable over 100
km (62 miles) long, and by developing the
first all-optical repeater. Britain also has a
world lead in the transmission of
computerised data along telephone lines for
reproduction on television screens.
Chemicals
Research performed by the chemical industry
over the last few years has led to significant
technological and commercial breakthroughs.
ICI has pioneered the microbial production of
378
PROMOTION OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
a biodegradable plastic, Biopol, and is at the
forefront of global efforts to develop
substitutes for chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs).
Chemical companies increasingly devote their
resources to developing specific products and
processes, so that much of the basic research
is carried out in universities and other non-
profit-making establishments.
Pharmaceuticals is the most research¬
intensive sector of the chemicals industry (see
pp 243^1). Research conducted by ICI and
leading pharmaceuticals companies Glaxo,
SmithKline Beecham and Fisons has led to
the development of the first successful beta-
blockers, drugs used in the treatment of
cardiovascular conditions; semi-synthetic
penicillins and treatments for asthma and
arthritis. Glaxo is Britain’s biggest
pharmaceutical company. In 1992, it won its
fifth Queen’s Award for technology, for the
antibiotic Zinnat. It manufactures the world’s
best-selling pharmaceutical, Zantac, which is
used in the treatment of gastric ulcers. Glaxo
is believed to spend more on R & D than any
other pharmaceutical company in the world.
Wellcome’s drug zidovudine (AZT) is still
the only anti-viral agent for the treatment of
human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection
that is approved in many overseas countries.
Among a host of other research interests
are the application of biotechnology to
pharmaceuticals and to plant science, and the
development of advanced materials such as
engineering plastics. In 1992 a
pharmaceuticals company, Pharmaceutical
Proteins, developed a protein expressed in the
milk of a genetically altered sheep. The
protein, alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT), can be
used in the treatment of emphysema resulting
from a deficiency in the protein.
Aerospace
Britain has led the world in many aspects of
aerospace research and development over the
last 80 years. Pioneering achievements include
radar, jet engines, Concorde, automatic
landing, vertical take-off and landing, flight
simulators and ejector seats. British
Aerospace, with Marconi and Dowty Boulton
Paul, developed a system known as ‘fly-by¬
wire’, in which flying control surfaces are
moved by electronic rather than mechanical
means. GEC Avionics has also developed the
world’s first optically signalled (‘fly-by-light’)
system. The concept of head-up display
(HUD) was pioneered and developed in
Britain. This system electronically projects
symbols into the pilot’s view, avoiding the
need to look down at instruments. GEC
Avionics has developed a holographic HUD,
which enables pilots to fly at high speeds at
very low altitude in darkness.
Government Policy and Organisation
The main objectives of the Government’s
science programme are to advance scientific
knowledge and technological capability and
provide training for scientists, in order to
achieve economic, social and cultural benefits
for Britain. The Government considers that
public funding should support the pursuit of
basic scientific knowledge, while industry
should bear the chief responsibility for the
commercial development of scientific advances.
Science and technology issues are the
responsibility of a Cabinet Minister,
the Chancellor of the Duchy of
Lancaster, acting on behalf of the
Prime Minister. The Minister is
supported by an Office of Science and
Technology (OST)—part of the Office
of Public Service and Science within
the Cabinet Office—headed by the
Government’s Chief Scientific Adviser.
The OST receives independent advice
from eminent scientists, technologists and
industrialists.
In addition to its role in overall science
policy and co-ordination, the OST is
responsible for the science budget and the
five government-financed research councils
(see p 380). OST funding provides assistance
for research, through the research councils, in
the following ways:
• grants and contracts to universities and
other higher education establishments
and to research units;
• funding of research council
establishments;
• support for postgraduate study; and
379
BRITAIN 1993: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
• subscriptions to international scientific
organisations.
Research and Development Expenditure
Total expenditure in Britain on scientific
research and development in 1990 was
£12,137 million, 2-2 per cent of gross
domestic product. Some 50 per cent of this
was provided by industry and 36 per cent by
government. Significant contributions were
also made by private endowments; trusts and
charities; and from overseas.
Government finance for R & D goes to
research establishments, institutions of higher
education and private industry, as well as to
collaborative research programmes. In many
cases private-sector and state industries
finance their own research and run their own
laboratories. Industry also funds university
research and finances contract research at
government establishments. Some charities
have their own laboratories and offer grants
for outside research.
Total net government R & D expenditure
(both civil and defence) in 1991-92 was
£5,074 million, of which £2,824 million was
devoted to civil science.
The science budget (net of receipts)
has risen by 12 per cent in real terms
since 1982-83, totalling £846 million in
1991-92. The planned net expenditure
of £1,088 million for the five research
councils in 1993-94 represents a 14 per
cent increase in real terms compared
with 1990-91.
Among other government departments,
the Ministry of Defence (MoD) has the
largest research budget. The main civil
departments involved are the Department of
Trade and Industry (DTI—see p 385), the
Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food
(MAFF—see p 388) and the Department for
Education (DFE—see p 387).
Total spending on R & D in industry
amounted to £8,082 million in 1990-91, 6
per cent more than in 1989—90. Of this total,
industry’s own contribution was 68 per cent,
with 17 per cent from government and the
rest from overseas. The main areas of
expenditure were electronics (£2,327 million),
amounting to 29 per cent of the total;
chemicals (£1,923 million), comprising 24 per
cent; and aerospace (£1,212 million), at 15
per cent.
PUBLIC SECTOR RESEARCH
The five research councils (see pp 381-5) are:
the Science and Engineering Research
Council (SERC); the Medical Research
Council (MRC); the Natural Environment
Research Council (NERC); the Agricultural
and Food Research Council (AFRC); and the
Economic and Social Research Council
(ESRC). The OST provides funding for the
research councils, taking account of their
respective needs, and of the balance between
national and international scientific activities.
It also promotes effective links between the
five research councils and those using their
research, such as industry and government
departments.
Expenditure on science, together with
funding for the universities through the
Universities Funding Council (UFC),
sustains Britain’s science base in the research
councils and higher education institutions.
Each of the research councils is an
autonomous body established under Royal
Charter, with members of their governing
councils drawn from the universities,
professions, industry and the Government.
They conduct research through their own
establishments and by supporting selected
research, study and training in universities
and other higher education establishments. In
addition to funding from the OST, they also
receive income for research commissioned by
government departments and from the
private sector. Income from commissioned
research is particularly important for the
AFRC and NERC.
Institutions undertaking research with the
support of research council grants have the
rights and responsibility for the commercial
exploitation of that research, subject to prior
agreement with the sponsoring research
council. Universities and research institutes
may make use of the expertise of the British
Technology Group (BTG—see p 390) to
patent and license their inventions.
380
PROMOTION OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
Science and Engineering Research
Council
The Science and Engineering Research
Council is responsible for supporting research
and postgraduate training in pure and applied
science and engineering outside the areas of
agriculture, medicine and the environment
covered by the other research councils. SERC
has the largest share of research council
funding. Its expenditure in 1991-92 totalled
j£488-2 million (compared with £477-6
million in 1990-91). This included:
• research grants, chiefly to higher
education institutions (£168-6 million);
• contributions to international
organisations (£100 million—see p 393);
• financing for the Council’s own
establishments (£93 million); and
• funding of postgraduate training (£77
million).
The Council has funded interdisciplinary
research centres in fields such as high-
temperature superconductivity, engineering
design, molecular sciences, high performance
materials, and optical- and laser-related
science and technology. It encourages
collaboration between higher education and
industry, partly by sponsoring co-ordinated
research programmes in areas of special
industrial concern. SERC’s allocation for
1992-93 is £521 million, which includes £26
million transferred from the Universities
Funding Council to cover overheads in
scientific research. The increase in funding
will benefit the development of new
materials, clean technologies, earth
observation and atmospheric chemistry.
SERC is the largest single national source of
support for postgraduate students. Current
numbers supported are around 8,000 for
research degrees and 2,600 for advanced
taught courses.
SERC maintains four research
establishments: the Rutherford Appleton
Laboratory at Chilton (Oxfordshire),
Daresbury Laboratory at Warrington
(Cheshire), Royal Greenwich Observatory at
Cambridge, and the Royal Observatory,
Edinburgh. These centres of specialised
research have experimental facilities beyond
the resources of individual academic
institutions; they also undertake contract
research.
SERC research support is organised under
four boards, covering science (£130 million in
1990-91); engineering (£124 million); nuclear
physics (£87 million); and astronomy and
planetary science (£77 million). In recent
years its policy has been to shift the balance
of funding from the astronomy and nuclear
physics boards, largely representing ‘big’
science, to the more general areas of science
and engineering, representing research on a
smaller scale. In 1993 the Astronomy and
Planetary Science Board will merge with the
Nuclear Physics Board. Additional boards
being set up are a Science and Materials
Board and an Engineering and Technology
Board.
Science
The Science Board’s main objective is to
ensure the vitality of the core sciences—
chemistry, physics, biology and
mathematics—and of materials science and
biotechnology, for which it has joint
responsibility with the Engineering Board.
The Board supports academic research of the
highest priority and quality, encourages
interdisciplinary research, and promotes
collaboration between the academic sector,
industry and the international scientific
community. Research is supported through
grants and by providing access to major
world-class facilities, either on a national
basis, such as the ISIS pulsed neutron source
and the Synchrotron Radiation Source at
Daresbury Laboratory, or through
international collaboration, such as the
Institut Laue-Langevin and the European
Synchrotron Radiation Facility in Grenoble
(see p 393). While much of the programme
results from unsolicited proposals, a
substantial proportion of particular
significance is selected for special
co-ordination and support. Examples are
molecular recognition, applied non-linear
mathematics and atmospheric chemistry. The
Science Board also supports a range of LINK
programmes (see p 385) and interdisciplinary
research centres.
381
BRITAIN 1993: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Engineering
The Engineering Board supports fundamental
and strategic research into the development
of advanced technology. It aims to identify
promising areas of national importance and
initiates and sustains co-ordinated
programmes of research which may be
developed by others to give direct benefit to
industry. Subject areas of prime importance
are materials research and biotechnology
(where a special directorate, financed jointly
with the Science Board, is in operation).
Postgraduate training has the highest priority.
In 1992 the Science Board launched a
pilot scheme of engineering doctorates, to be
based at three centres. The doctorates involve
a combination of project work and taught
course work, carried out in close collaboration
with industry. The Board is also
administering a complementary pilot scheme
of industrial research organisation
studentships, to be based at five centres and
offered jointly by the industrial research
organisations and higher education
institutions. The Clean Technology
programme, launched in 1992 with the
AFRC, aims to stimulate research leading to
new technologies to prevent pollution caused
by industry and agriculture. In collaboration
with the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries
and Food, the Coastal Engineering Research
Programme was established to investigate
beach erosion and estuary pollution.
Nuclear Physics
The Nuclear Physics Board supports particle
physics and nuclear structure physics.
Particle physics funding is provided to allow
researchers in higher education institutions
access to leading facilities such as those at
CERN (the European Organisation for
Nuclear Research—see p 393) and DESY
(Deutsches Electronen Synchrotron). The
Rutherford Appleton Laboratory provides
valuable support to university researchers and
co-ordinates the development and
construction of essential items of equipment.
The Board supports a number of eminent
researchers in theoretical particle physics who
have gained an international reputation for
their work on the unification of the
fundamental forces of nature.
The nuclear physics programme is
presently concentrated largely at the
Daresbury Laboratory, which has a 20-
million volt tandem accelerator. This
accelerator is, however, due to close in April
1993, when British researchers will make use
of other European facilities. An example of
international scientific collaboration coming
to fruition is the development, with French
scientists, of EUROGAM, the world’s most
advanced gamma ray spectrometer.
Astronomy and Planetary Science
The Astronomy and Planetary Science Board
supports space science, including
contributions to international programmes
(see p 394), ground-based astronomy and
geophysics. In optical astronomy SERC is a
principal partner in the international
observatory on the island of La Palma in the
Canary Islands. The observatory’s four
telescopes include the 4-2-m William
Herschel. Opened in 1987, it is the third
largest single-mirror optical telescope in the
world. On Mauna Kea, Hawaii, SERC has a
3-8-m infra-red telescope, the largest
telescope in the world designed specifically
for infra-red observations, and the 15-m
James Clerk Maxwell radio telescope (built in
collaboration with the Netherlands and
Canada). Such telescopes have proved
invaluable to scientists researching the
creation of the universe. A centre costing
£L85 million is planned to co-ordinate data
from four satellite-borne instruments in the
SOHO cluster mission (see p 394), a
programme set up to investigate the Sun and
its impact on the Earth’s environment.
Medical Research Council
The Medical Research Council is the main
government agency supporting medical
research. It advises the Government on
matters relating to medical research and co¬
operates with government departments and
other organisations in Britain and overseas.
Its budget amounted to £223-4 million in
1991-92, of which £202-9 million came from
382
PROMOTION OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
the science budget. The Council supports
research in its own establishments and
through its grant systems to research workers
at higher education institutions and hospitals.
The MRC’s major research establishments
are the National Institute for Medical
Research at Mill Hill, London; the Clinical
Research Centre at Northwick Park Hospital,
London; and the Laboratory of Molecular
Biology at Cambridge. Three interdisciplinary
research centres have been established in
molecular medicine, protein engineering and
cell biology. Three more are planned, in
brain activity and human behaviour, brain
repair, and toxicology.
The Council’s scientists and doctors have
pioneered developments in molecular biology,
therapeutic clinical trials, applied psychology,
and methods of imaging the body such as
magnetic resonance and ultrasound. Larger
research programmes include psychiatric and
neurological (like Alzheimer’s) disease, heart
and respiratory ailments, cancer, tropical
medicine, reproduction and contraception,
and infection and immunity.
Recent important medical develop¬
ments include: the identification of the
male sex gene; the discovery of a gene
defect linked to Alzheimer’s disease;
the discovery of a gene defect linked
to a form of inherited heart disease;
and the construction of a silver
neurone which acts like a human
brain cell.
Major projects currently being undertaken
are:
• specially funded work on AIDS;
• research on vaccines against meningitis
and whooping cough;
• the mapping of the human genome, the
complete sequence of genes in a human
cell;
• the genetic and neurosciences approach
to human health;
• the Clinical Research Initiative;
• physiological mechanisms and public
health, which covers research in
nutrition, the environment, diabetes and
imaging techniques.
The Council encourages collaboration
between its establishments and industry in
order to promote the transfer of skills and
technologies, the exploitation of its
discoveries, and the development of new
health care products. The MRC
Collaboration Centre at Mill Hill, London,
and the Clinical Research Centre provide an
important technology transfer function for
the MRC.
Natural Environment Research Council
The Natural Environment Research Council
seeks to advance understanding of the
biological, physical and chemical processes of
the planet, and how the natural environment
is changing, either by natural causes or
through human activities. Its objectives
include contributions to exploration and
exploitation of natural resources, land-use
planning, environmental protection and
conservation, energy supply and aid to
overseas countries. The successful transfer of
technology from the science base to
government and the private sector takes high
priority.
In 1991-92 about £123-7 million (75 per
cent) of NERC’s funds came from the science
budget, with the remainder coming from
commissioned work for public authorities and
industry in Britain and overseas. Increases in
the science budget over the next three years
will enable a major new multidisciplinary
community research project, the Land-Ocean
Interaction Study (LOIS), to begin. This will
further the understanding of processes
affecting organic matter, such as river
sediment, sewage and gases transported
between land, ocean and atmosphere and
their effect on the properties and health of
coastal facilities.
The Council supports research and
training in 14 NERC institutes and research
units and in universities and polytechnics.
NERC institutes include the British
Geological Survey, the Institute of Terrestrial
Ecology, the Institute of Oceanographic
Sciences Deacon Laboratory, and the British
Antarctic Survey.
NERC conducts local and regional
research in Britain and in other countries,
383
BRITAIN 1993: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
while also participating in major international
environmental projects. Examples of NERC
research and new developments include:
• a comprehensive geological survey of
Britain’s inner continental shelf,
completed by the British Geological
Survey, yielding a detailed picture of its
margin and associated natural resources.
Britain is the first country in the world
to complete such a survey;
• the NERC biogeochemical ocean flux
study, which examines how carbon
dioxide is absorbed by the oceans and
buried in the sea floor sediments, helping
to stabilise the greenhouse effect;
• the Fine Resolution Antarctic Model,
which simulates 16 years of ocean
dynamics and gives new insights into
heat circulation, thereby making a vital
step towards climate prediction; and
• the Offshore Survey and Geophysical
Monitoring project, which investigates
the mineral resources and seismic hazards
of Britain’s offshore areas.
Among applied projects in progress
overseas are initiatives in biological pest
control; regeneration of tropical hardwoods;
drip irrigation techniques for tropical crops;
and surveys of potential resources, such as
freshwater and underground water supply
and geothermal energy.
The James Rennell Centre in
Southampton is a focal point for
Britain’s contributions to the World
Ocean Circulation Experiment, which
investigates the vital role of the oceans
in controlling climate. Major
programmes in global environmental
change—such as the World Climate
Research Programme—continue to
involve NERC.
The interdisciplinary research centre for
population biology at Imperial College,
University of London, was set up to aid
research into ecology and population
interactions. A series of 16 computer-
controlled environmental chambers provide
suitable living conditions for small
communities of plants and animals.
Several environmental data centres have
been established at NERC sites.
Agricultural and Food Research Council
The Agricultural and Food Research Council
supports research underpinning agriculture,
food and the biologically based industries.
Among the Council’s main research areas are
plant science, arable crops, horticulture,
grassland and environmental research, animal
physiology and genetics, food research, and
agricultural engineering.
Work is carried out at seven AFRC
institutes, at Horticulture Research
International (formerly the AFRC Institute of
Horticultural Research), and in higher
education institutions. The AFRC also
provides scientific advice to the Scottish
Office Agriculture and Fisheries Department
on research in the Scottish Agricultural
Research Institutes. Funding for 1992-93 will
enable further work to be done in
intracellular signalling (the chemical
language by which cells within plants and
animals communicate), global environmental
research, plant molecular biology and stem
cell biology.
The AFRC’s funding totalled £139-3
million in 1991-92. At present two-thirds is
drawn from the science budget and about a
quarter from MAFF for commissioned
research, with a growing proportion from
industry.
Recent developments include the
completion of the Transgenic Animals
Programme, extending existing transgenic
work in mice to farm livestock and the
manipulation of genetic proteins in animals’
milk. Significant advances have been made in
the study of plant reproductive processes and
plant/herbivore interactions. New
programmes have been launched, including a
study of the transport of pollutants in soils
and rocks, and a working group set up to
examine the use of animals in research.
Economic and Social Research Council
The Economic and Social Research Council
supports research and training in the social
sciences in universities, other higher
384
PROMOTION OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
education establishments, and some
independent research institutes. The aims of
the Council are to modernise social science
methods and research resources, and increase
recognition of the value of social science. The
Council conducts research in education, social
sciences, environment and planning,
psychology, industrial and business
management, economics and information
technology. In 1991-92 it received £36
million (95 per cent of its funding) from the
science budget, and has been allocated £45
million in 1992-93.
Examples of recent work are research on
the evolution of rules for the single European
market and on the management by firms of
new technologies and the functioning of
markets; a joint council initiative in cognitive
science/human computer interaction, also
funded by the MRC and SERC; and a multi¬
disciplinary initiative on social change and
economic life in Britain in 1990-91, which has
produced extensive data for use by policy¬
makers, social scientists and public sector
agencies. New programmes will research
global environmental change, East-West
Europe comparisons, economic performance,
taxation, education and personal welfare.
Department of Trade and Industry
Direct government support for research in
industry is led by the Department of Trade
and Industry. Although most industrial
research and development is financed by
industry itself, the DTI provides assistance
where there is a sound case for doing so. The
Department has moved away from support
for research by single companies with a strong
commercial emphasis towards collaborative
programmes of pre-competitive research, with
greater emphasis on encouraging links
between industry and the science base, and on
technology transfer.
In 1990-91 the DTI spent £310 million on
R & D, covering general industrial
innovation, aeronautics, space (see p 394) and
support for statutory, regulatory and policy
responsibilities. A further £103 million was
allocated to technology transfer and related
activities.
The DTI also funds research in support of
offshore oil and gas technology, which was
previously funded by the Department of
Energy. The largest part of its energy R & D
expenditure is on nuclear energy (£107
million in 1991-92), most of which is carried
out by the former United Kingdom Atomic
Energy Authority, now AEA Technology.
DTI Industrial Innovation Programmes
There are four main schemes of collaborative
R & D: LINK, Advanced Technology
Programmes, ‘Club’ R & D and EUREKA
(see p 393). These complement European
Community R & D programmes (see p 392).
The DTI has spent over £200 million since
1989 in support of collaborative research
programmes as part of the Government’s
strategy to stimulate innovation. Government
financial assistance for R & D in industry is
set to increase to £346 million by 1995.
The LINK scheme is a joint DTI-OST
initiative, encouraging collaboration on high-
quality, industrially relevant, research between
industry and higher education institutions and
research bodies. The aim is to bridge the gap
between scientific research and the resulting
commercial applications. Under the scheme,
government funds 50 per cent of costs and
industry the other half.
By April 1992 government funding
worth £193 million had been
committed to 30 LINK programmes,
mainly in the areas of biotechnology,
advanced materials, advanced
manufacturing and electronics, and
food processing.
Advanced Technology Programmes help
companies to collaborate in pre-competitive
research in new technologies in order to
accelerate their industrial application. Fifteen
programmes in high-temperature
superconductivity, marine exploitation and
several aspects of electronics and information
technology were in place in 1992.
Club R & D enables companies, particularly
small and medium-sized companies, to benefit
from collaborative research in a major research
organisation at a subsidised rate. Research is
conducted in a host organisation, such as a
385
BRITAIN 1993: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
higher education institution or a research and
technology organisation.
To encourage research work and
innovation in small companies, the DTI also
runs a competitive scheme called the Small
Firms Merit Award for Research and
Technology (SMART). Each year 180 awards
are offered to aid highly innovative and
potentially commercial projects being
developed by individuals and firms with
fewer than 50 employees. In 1992 an
additional £40 million of government funding
was committed for a new three-year
programme of SMART competitions.
Support for small and medium-sized
companies is available under the Support for
Products under Research (SPUR) scheme,
which helps smaller firms to be more
innovative by awarding grants towards the
cost of new product and process development
projects. Some £32 million is being made
available between February 1991 and March
1994. Over £12 million of DTI financing and
142 grants had been awarded by the end of
March 1992.
Aeronautics
Funding from the DTI supports research and
innovation in Britain’s aircraft and aeroengine
industry, helping it to compete effectively in
world markets. Over half of the work
supported is conducted in industry and the
universities, and the remainder in Ministry of
Defence establishments. The Civil Aircraft
and Aeroengine Research and Demonstration
Programme (CARAD) is part of a national
aircraft research effort undertaken by
industry, the Government, research
establishments and higher education
institutes; it covers research on airframe
technology, avionics and propulsion systems.
In 1990-91 CARAD was supported by
government funding of £26-1 million. Nearly
30 per cent of the programme is used to
finance the European Wind Tunnel project in
Cologne, due to become operational in 1997.
Launch Aid is a scheme providing
government assistance for specific
development projects in the aerospace
industry. British Aerospace is currently
receiving aid for its participation in the
European Airbus Industrie consortium for the
A330/340 airliner project, and Westland for
its participation in the commercial EH 101
helicopter.
Industrial Research Establishments
The DTI has four research establishments.
Their primary role is to provide the
Government with an effective source of
scientific and technological expertise. They
supply technological services to industry and
also undertake research commissioned by
industry. The laboratories, which are also
involved in a variety of international
activities, are:
1. the Laboratory of the Government
Chemist, the focus for chemical
measurement within government. It
provides both public and private sectors
with a comprehensive service based on
analytical chemistry and promotes sound
chemical measurement in Britain as part
of the National Measurement System. Its
Biotechnology Unit takes the lead within
government for promoting the industrial
application of biotechnology.
2. the National Engineering Laboratory
(NEL), which carries out a range of
technical services, including R & D,
testing and consultancies in engineering
and related disciplines. It also maintains
British Standards of flow measurement,
which are of special importance in the oil
and gas industries. NEL manages
technology transfer programmes for DTI
in open systems, as well as operating the
National Wind Turbine Centre.
3. the National Physical Laboratory (NPL),
Britain’s national standards laboratory
with responsibility for maintaining
national measurement standards for
physical quantities. It supplies essential
calibration and technology transfer
services for industry, and undertakes
performance-related research on standards
for engineering materials and information
technology. NPL is also the base for the
National Measurement Accreditation
Service, which provides accreditation of
calibration and testing laboratories in both
the public and private sectors.
386
PROMOTION OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
4. Warren Spring Laboratory, which
undertakes research and technical services
for the monitoring and abatement of
pollution, including waste treatment,
recycling and cleaner technologies.
All four laboratories are now executive
agencies. NEL is being restructured with a
long-term view to privatising it.
Technology Transfer
The DTI has introduced several programmes
specifically to encourage technology transfer.
They promote the use of best-practice
techniques and modern technology in
addition to exploiting the most recent
research. Examples are the Open Systems
information technology standards programme
and the Materials Matter programme,
concerned with modern materials and
associated manufacturing methods. Each
programme comprises an integrated package
of activities which may include seminars,
conferences and demonstration activities, as
well as the production of case study material
and other practical literature. There are also
general technology transfer programmes not
related to specific technology areas. For
example, in association with the Department
for Education and the Department of
Employment, the DTI supports 12 Regional
Technology Centres. These help disseminate
new technologies and promote flows of
knowledge from higher education institutions
to small and medium-sized enterprises.
The Manufacturing Planning and
Implementation Studies Programme and the
Technical Action Line help companies to
plan their use of advanced manufacturing
technology and gain access to technical
advice. With support from SERC, the DTI is
funding a programme aimed at exploiting the
potential of parallel computing. The aim is to
combine large numbers of microprocessors in
order to offer low-cost supercomputer
performance to industry and commerce. A
pilot scheme was set up by the DTI and OST
in September 1992 to foster closer links
between the science base, industrial research
and industry. Through this scheme, groups of
students carrying out research for higher
degrees will be able to undertake practical
work in an industrial research organisation in
partnership with a higher education institution.
Department for Education
The Department for Education (formerly the
Department of Education and Science) had
responsibility for civil science until April
1992, when it was transferred to the OST.
The DFE remains the main source of
public funding for the universities, whose
individual allocations are determined by the
Universities Funding Council (see p 389).
Together with the Scottish and Welsh
education departments, the DTI and
Department of Employment, the DFE funds
a number of schemes for training full-time
students and those working in industry in the
latest technology. For example, under the
Professional, Industrial and Commercial
Updating (PICKUP) initiative, scientists from
higher education institutions spend time at
the Regional Technology Centres, training
employees of private sector companies in
recent developments in their fields.
Ministry of Defence
Expenditure by the Ministry of Defence on
research and development in 1990-91
amounted to more than £2,190 million. Some
£410 million of this was medium- and long¬
term applied research relevant to military
needs, much of it carried out in the MoD’s
defence research establishments. Around
£158 million of research was undertaken
under contract in industry and the academic
sector. Research accounts for less than one-
fifth of total defence R & D expenditure.
The balance relates to the development of
specific items of equipment, most of which is
carried out by industry, and represents the
bulk of government expenditure on R & D in
industry. The Government is committed to
achieving a gradual reduction in real terms in
spending on defence R & D in future years.
Four non-nuclear research establishments,
the Royal Aerospace Establishment, the Royal
Signals and Radar Establishment, the
Admiralty Research Establishment, and the
Royal Armament Research and Development
Establishment have merged to become the
387
BRITAIN 1993: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Defence Research Agency. Its role is to
provide scientific and technical services to the
MoD and other government departments.
The defence research programme emphasises
the value of work financed jointly with
industry. Initiatives have been taken to
encourage ‘spin-off from defence technology
to the civil market in fields ranging from new
materials and electronic devices to advanced
aerodynamics to be used in civil aircraft and
jet engines. Some £171 million of research
work is done under contract in industry and
the universities.
The defence research establishments,
including the Defence Research Agency,
carry out work worth £46 million a year
funded by other government departments for
civil purposes. A further £22 million of work
is done for other customers, involving the use
of facilities by industrial firms for both
defence and civil work. Technologies
developed for civil use, such as information
technology, are also incorporated into defence
where possible.
Recent technological innovations by
research establishments include:
• development of a prototype video system
which gives aircraft flight crews an
external view of the aircraft and its
engines, providing a contribution to fire
safety;
• invention of a technique for detecting
low concentrations of gas at great
distances at sea, which has potential civil
applications for the identification of
hazardous gases.
Other Government Departments
The Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and
Food co-ordinates its research programme
with the Scottish Office Agriculture and
Fisheries Department, the Department of
Agriculture for Northern Ireland and the
AFRC (see p 384). Overall, the Ministry’s
research has four main objectives: to foster an
efficient and competitive agricultural industry;
to protect the consumer and the environment;
to assist in the formulation and assessment of
policy; and to underpin the applied R & D
undertaken by the agricultural industry.
MAFF’s wide-ranging responsibilities are
reflected in its research activities, which cover
land use and conservation of the countryside,
animal welfare, food safety and quality, and
conservation of fish stocks. Expenditure in
1991-92 was £127 million deployed with
contractors, which included the AFRC (£34
million); the Agricultural Development
Advisory Service (£16 million); Horticulture
Research International (£13 million); and
Central Science Laboratory (£11 million).
The Department of the Environment
funds research in several policy areas:
environmental protection, including
radioactive substances; water; the countryside;
planning and inner cities; local government;
housing; building and construction; and
energy efficiency. The largest individual sub-
programme concerns the safe disposal of
radioactive waste. An area of research of
increasing importance is that of pollution-
related climate change. Total research
expenditure in 1991-92 was £95 million.
The Department of Health is introducing
the first comprehensive R & D strategy for
the National Health Service in England and
Wales, which will focus on improving
methods of health care and achieving a cost-
effective use of resources. The Department
also manages a Health and Personal Social
Services research programme concerned with
the needs of ministers and policy-makers,
with emphasis on improving efficiency. The
Department’s Director of Research and
Development advises the Secretary of State
on research undertaken by non-departmental
public bodies answerable to the Department.
The National Computing Centre promotes
best practice in software engineering in
industry, while the Government’s Central
Computer and Telecommunications Agency
encourages the establishment of standards of
computer compatibility and the best use of
information technology in the public sector.
The Overseas Development
Administration (ODA) conducts research
programmes which are directly targeted on
the main needs of developing countries. Some
of these may be addressed by adapting
suitable existing Western technology, while
others are unique to the developing world
and therefore require special treatment. The
388
PROMOTION OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
ODA supports a research programme worth
around £5'5 million a year to tackle
infrastructure problems. It uses the
expertise of agencies such as the Transport
Research Laboratory, the British Geological
Survey, and the Institute of Hydrology. It
also commissions research from universities
and industry. Current programmes include
reduced cost sewerage systems; water
disinfection and waste treatment techniques;
simple pump technology; and heat storage
technology for cooking.
ACADEMIC RESEARCH
The Universities Funding Council, with
funding from the Department for
Education, is the largest single source of
finance for universities in Great Britain.
About 40 per cent of research carried out in
universities is financed from resources
allocated by the UFC. These funds
contribute to the cost of academic staff—
who teach as well as carry out research—
and pay for support staff, administration,
equipment and accommodation. The UFC
was allocated £930 million in the academic
year 1991-92. Total funds allocated in
1992-93 amount to £950 million.
The research councils also support
scientific research in the universities and
other institutions of higher education in two
main ways. First, they provide postgraduate
awards to over a quarter of postgraduate
students in science and technology.
Secondly, they give grants and contracts to
universities and other institutions for
specified projects, particularly in new or
developing areas of research. The research
councils have become responsible for
meeting all the costs of the research projects
they support in universities and other
higher education institutions. However, all
higher education institutions continue to
pay the costs of permanent academic staff
salaries and the upkeep of premises.
The other main channels of support for
scientific research in universities are
government departments, charities and
industry. The European Community also
provides substantial funding. Universities
are expected to recover the full cost of
short-term commissioned research from the
Government and industry. UFC funds are
allocated selectively to encourage universities
to focus on those areas where they have
existing research strength.
The high quality of research in
universities, and their marketing skills, have
enabled them to attract more funding from a
larger range of external sources. Close co¬
operation continues between the universities,
industry and the Government in joint
projects. The research income of universities
from industry and other outside sources is
rising rapidly and amounted to over
£915 million in 1989-90. Universities also
provide other services to industry, such as
professional updating courses. In addition,
the polytechnics and colleges carry out
contract research for industry and others,
mainly in applied and related strategic fields.
Many universities now operate industrial
liaison units.
Recent Research Developments
Universities in Britain have achieved a
number of recent technological breakthroughs
and enjoy a world-class reputation:
• Research into plant productivity at the
University of Essex has led to an
understanding of how a combination of
light and temperature extremes damages
maize and other crops;
• A printed liquidic circuit system for
performing instant chemical analysis in
the doctor’s surgery has been developed
by scientists at Birmingham University.
The device can test for a range of
conditions, including pregnancy,
cholesterol levels, and HIV antibodies;
• Researchers at Leeds University are
building a navigational aid that for the
first time will allow aircraft to fix their
position to the nearest 15 metres by
analysing signals from United States and
former Soviet navigational satellites.
Science Parks
Science parks are intended to promote closer
links between industry and university
389
BRITAIN 1993: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
research departments. By April 1992 there
were 40 such parks in operation, at or near
universities, with accommodation for around
1,000 companies. Most are involved in
computing, electronics, instrumentation,
robotics, electrical engineering, chemicals and
biotechnology. Research, development and
training activities are emphasised, rather than
large-scale manufacturing. The biggest
science park is at Cambridge, with some 85
companies on site.
OTHER ORGANISATIONS
Charitable Foundations
Charitable foundations sponsoring research
include the Cancer Research Campaign, the
Imperial Cancer Research Fund, the
Wellcome Trust and the Nuffield
Foundation. Their combined research
funding amounts to £216 million a year. In
1991 the largest spenders on medical research
were the Wellcome Trust at £100 million
and the Imperial Cancer Research Fund at
£52-6 million. The Wellcome Trust intends
to make more money available for research,
having sold half its stake in Wellcome pic.
Industrial Research and Technology
Organisations
Britain has the largest Research and
Technology Organisation (RTO) sector in
Europe, consisting of approximately 70
organisations. In 1991 it had a combined
turnover of approximately £400 million and a
total staff of over 10,000. RTOs provide
contract research and technological advice to
many customers and all specialise to some
extent in a range of technologies and in the
industries from which their customers are
drawn. The organisations are linked by the
Cambridge-based Association of Independent
Research and Technology Organisations.
CEST
The Centre for Exploitation of Science and
Technology (CEST), which was set up in
1988, studies the evolution of markets and
aims to identify scientific knowledge and
technologies needed to improve competitive
performance in particular industries. CEST is
funded by industry and government.
British Technology Group
British Technology Group promotes the
development of new technology into
commercial products, particularly where
the technology originates from public sector
sources, such as universities, other higher
education institutions, research councils and
government research establishments. It offers
to take responsibility for protecting and
licensing inventions from these sources,
makes available funds for development, seeks
licensees and negotiates licence agreements
with industry.
BTG provides finance to industry to
encourage innovation, most commonly
through equity or project finance. In the case
of project finance, companies are offered up
to 50 per cent of their development costs.
The Group also helps companies to negotiate
licences overseas for their inventions. BTG
expects to recover its investment by means of
a percentage levy on sales of the resulting
product or process.
At present, BTG administers over 9,000
patents covering some 1,600 technologies. In
1991 the Group’s total revenue exceeded £30
million. Annual sales value of products
currently licensed by BTG amounts to more
than £1,500 million. BTG is owned by a
consortium consisting of BTG management,
employees and financial institutions.
Professional Institutions and Learned
Societies
There are numerous technical institutions
and professional associations in Britain, many
of which promote their own disciplines or the
education and professional well-being of their
members.
The Council of Science and Technology
Institutes has seven member institutes
representing biology, chemical engineering,
chemistry, food science and technology,
geology, hospital physics and physics. The
Engineering Council (see p 235) promotes the
study of all types of engineering in schools
390
PROMOTION OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
and other organisations, in co-operation with
its 250 industry affiliates. These include large
private sector companies and government
departments. Together with 46 professional
engineering institutions, the Council accredits
courses in higher education institutions. It
also advises the Government on a range of
academic, industrial and professional issues.
The national academy of engineering in
Britain is the Royal Academy of Engineering
(formerly the Fellowship of Engineering). It
promotes the discipline and advises the
Government on related policy issues. Its
membership consists of distinguished
engineers.
More than 300 learned societies play
an important part in the promotion of
science and technology through
meetings, publications and
sponsorship.
The Royal Society
The most prestigious learned society is the
Royal Society (in full: The Royal Society of
London for Improving Natural Knowledge),
founded in 1660. The Society has over 1,000
Fellows and Foreign Members, many of
whom serve on governmental advisory
councils and committees concerned with
research. The Society’s expenditure in
1992-93 will be around £22 million. It
administers a grant from the OST,
amounting to £17 million in 1992-93; the
remainder is derived from private funds.
The Society encourages scientific research
and its application through a programme of
meetings and lectures, publications, and by
awarding grants, fellowships and other
funding. It recognises scientific and
technological achievements through election
to the Fellowship and the award of medals
and endowed lectureships. As the national
academy of sciences, it represents Britain in
international non-governmental organisations
and is involved in a variety of international
scientific programmes. It also facilitates
collaborative projects and the exchange of
scientists through bilateral agreements with
academies and research councils throughout
the world. It gives independent advice on
scientific matters, notably to government, and
represents and supports the scientific
community as a whole. The Society is
increasingly active in promoting science
understanding and awareness among the
general public, as well as science education. It
also supports research into the history of
scientific endeavour.
Other Societies
In Scotland, the Royal Society of Edinburgh,
established in 1783, promotes science by
awarding scholarships, organising meetings
and symposia, publishing journals and
awarding prizes. It also administers fellowship
schemes for post-doctoral research workers.
Three other major institutions publicise
scientific developments through lectures and
publications for specialists and for
schoolchildren. Of these, the British
Association for the Advancement of Science
(BAAS), founded in 1831, is mainly
concerned with science, while the Royal
Society of Arts, dating from 1754, deals with
the arts and commerce as well as science.
The Royal Institution, founded in 1799, also
performs these functions and runs its own
research laboratories.
The Committee on the Public
Understanding of Science (COPUS), set up
in 1986 by the Royal Society, the BAAS, and
the Royal Institution, acts as a focus for a
broad-ranging programme in Britain to
improve public awareness of science and
technology. It recommends initiatives to its
sponsoring bodies and promotes activities of
other organisations and institutions.
Zoological Gardens
The Zoological Society of London, an
independent scientific body, runs London
Zoo, which occupies some 15 hectares
(36 acres) of Regent’s Park, London. The zoo
has successfully operated a captive breeding
programme to conserve some of the world’s
most endangered animals, such as Brazilian
golden lion tamarins. The Society is
responsible for the Institute of Zoology,
which carries out research in conservation
391
BRITAIN 1993: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
and comparative medicine. It also organises
scientific meetings and symposia, and
publishes scientific journals.
Whipsnade Wild Animal Park near
Dunstable (Bedfordshire) is also managed by
the Society. Other well-known zoos include
those at Edinburgh, Bristol, Chester, Dudley
and Marwell (near Winchester).
Botanical Gardens
The Royal Botanic Gardens, founded in
1759, cover 121 hectares (300 acres) at Kew
in west London and a 187-hectare (462-acre)
estate at Wakehurst Place, Ardingly, in West
Sussex. They contain the largest collections
of living and dried plants in the world.
Research is conducted into all aspects of
plant life, including physiology, biochemistry,
genetics, economic botany and the
conservation of habitats and species. Kew has
the world’s largest seed bank for wild origin
species and is active in programmes to return
endangered plant species to the wild. It
participates in joint research programmes in
52 countries.
The Royal Botanic Garden in Edinburgh,
founded in 1670, is a centre for research into
taxonomy (classification of species), for the
conservation and study of living plants and
for horticultural education.
Scientific Museums
The Natural History Museum, which
includes the Geological Museum, has
60 million specimens ranging in size from a
blue whale skeleton to minute insects. It is
one of the world’s principal centres for
research into natural history, offering an
advisory service to institutions all over the
world. The museum is keen to promote
public appreciation of nature conservation
and in 1991 opened a major exhibition on
ecology, illustrating the diversity of living
species.
The Science Museum promotes
understanding of the history of science,
technology, industry and medicine. Its
extensive collection of scientific instruments
and machinery is complemented by
interactive computer games and audio-visual
equipment for visitors to use. In this way
the museum explains scientific principles to
the public and documents the history of
science, from early discoveries to space age
technology. These two museums are in
South Kensington, London. Other
important collections include those of the
Museum of Science and Industry in
Birmingham, the Museum of Science and
Industry in Manchester, the Museum of
the History of Science in Oxford, and the
Royal Scottish Museum, Edinburgh.
INTERNATIONAL SCIENTIFIC
RELATIONS
European Community
Since 1984, the European Community has
run a series of R & D framework
programmes in a number of strategic
sectors, with the aim of strengthening the
scientific and technological basis of
European industry and improving its
international competitiveness. The Third
Framework Programme lasts from 1990 to
1994, with a European Community budget
of 5,700 million ECUs (£4,200 million). It
overlaps with the Second Framework
Programme (1987 to 1991), and covers the
following broad categories:
• information and communication
technologies;
• industrial and material technologies;
• the environment;
• life sciences and technologies;
• energy; and
• human capital and mobility.
The share of the total funding available
which British organisations—research
organisations, companies and higher
education institutions—have secured is
broadly equal to Britain’s notional
contribution to the R & D budget of the
European Community.
Britain hosts the Joint European Torus
nuclear fusion project (JET), based at
Culham, Oxfordshire. In an experiment
conducted in December 1991, JET
produced a power release of 1 megawatt for
392
PROMOTION OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
a period of two seconds. This is regarded as a
potentially significant step towards
demonstrating the feasibility of fusion as an
energy source.
Other International Activities
EUREKA is an industry-led scheme to
encourage European co-operation in the
development and production of high-
technology products with worldwide sales
potential. There are currently 493 approved
EUREKA projects, with an estimated total
investment of £6,000 million. Over 300
British organisations are participating in 129
of these, 29 of which are British-led. In 1992
Britain became involved in 30 new projects,
over twice the level for 1991. The members
of EUREKA are the 12 countries of the
European Community, the six countries of
the European Free Trade Association, Turkey
and the European Commission.
The European Co-operation in the Field
of Scientific and Technical Research (COST)
programme encourages the co-operation of
national research activities, in which non-
European Community countries may
participate with member states on an equal
basis. There are currently 23 member states,
including the 12 countries of the European
Community.
Britain is a member of the European
Organisation for Nuclear Research (CERN) in
Geneva. Its contributions to CERN, to the
high-flux neutron source at the Institut Laue-
Langevin and to the European Synchrotron
Radiation Facility, both at Grenoble, are paid
through SERC.
The European Synchrotron Radiation
Facility, due for completion in 1998, has
received 12 per cent of its total costs from
Britain. British scientists and engineers had a
role in designing and constructing detectors
for three of the four major experimental
stations of the Large Electron Positron
collider at CERN. SERC is also a partner in
the European Incoherent Scatter radar
facilities in northern Scandinavia, which are
used for atmospheric research.
Through NERC, Britain is a member of
the Ocean Drilling Program, led by the
United States, and of the World Ocean
Circulation Experiment (see p 384). Through
the MRC, Britain participates in the
European Molecular Biology Organisation.
Britain is also a member of the science and
technology committees of international
organisations such as the Organisation for
Economic Co-operation and Development
and the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation,
and various specialised agencies of the United
Nations.
A number of inter-governmental and
inter-agency agreements have been concluded
with other countries for co-operation in
science and technology. Among non¬
governmental organisations, the five research
councils, the Royal Society and the British
Academy were founder members of the
European Science Foundation in 1974. The
research councils also maintain a joint office
in Brussels to further European co-operation
in research. Staff in British Embassies and
High Commissions promote contacts in
science and technology between Britain and
overseas countries: there are science and
technology counsellors in Paris, Bonn,
Washington, Tokyo and Moscow.
The British Council promotes better
understanding and knowledge of Britain
and its scientific and technological
achievements. It encourages exchanges
of specialists, supplies specialised
information, and fosters co-operation in
research, training and education. The Council
also identifies and manages technological,
scientific and educational projects in
developing countries.
Many British companies participate in
commercial co-operative research projects
with overseas manufacturers.
Examples of European technological
developments involving Britain are:
• the development of an experimental rig
for the European Fast Reactor nuclear
power project;
• a four-year collaborative programme led
by scientists at Harwell to investigate the
use of materials as catalysts and
adsorbents; and
© A two-year project, funded under the
European Community’s Science and
Technology for Environmental

BRITAIN 1993: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Technology Programme (STEP), involves
Warren Spring Laboratory and
organisations in other European countries
in the development of biotechnological
processes to remove metals from solid
wastes.
Space Activities
Britain’s support for civil space research is
co-ordinated by the British National Space
Centre (BNSC), a partnership between
various government departments and research
councils. The BNSC encourages industry to
exploit opportunities in space, based on
appraisal of project costs and potential
technological and commercial benefits.
Through BNSC, Britain spent some £158
million on space activities in 1991-92,
financed mainly by the DTI and SERC. Of
this around 60 per cent was devoted to
programmes shared with the European Space
Agency (ESA). The remainder supported a
programme of research and development in
government establishments, universities and
industry.
The major part of Britain’s space
programme is concerned with satellite-based
earth observation (remote sensing) for
commercial and environmental applications.
Britain has committed around £94 million to
the ESA’s satellite ERS-1, launched in 1991,
which is designed to give all-weather, 24-
hour coverage of the Earth. It has provided
the main active microwave instrument for
ERS-1, along with a precision instrument to
measure thermal infra-red emissions from the
sea surface. British remote sensing
instruments are also being flown on the
upper atmosphere research satellite launched
and operated by the United States National
Aeronautics and Space Administration
(NASA).
Britain is also contributing £260 million to
the Columbus programme, which is Europe’s
contribution to the United States-led
International Space Station project, and £34
million to ERS-2. It is playing a major role in
developing the polar-orbiting platform and
key instruments for the Columbus project.
In space science, Britain has played a role
in almost all of the ESA’s missions. These
include the investigation of Halley’s Comet
(1986) and Grigg Skjellerup (1992) by the
British-built Giotto spacecraft; the Inter¬
national Ultraviolet Explorer; the Hipparcos
star-mapping mission; and the Ulysses solar
polar probe which has used British-made
instruments to investigate Jupiter’s magnetic
field. Britain is contributing substantially to
the Cluster and SOHO missions to be
launched in 1995 to study the Sun, the
Earth’s magnetosphere and the solar wind. It
is also expected that Britain will participate in
the ESA’s X-ray spectroscopy mission due
for launching in 1998.
The Earth Observation Data Centre,
opened in 1991 at Farnborough,
Hampshire, and operated by the
National Remote Sensing Centre, is
equipped to process the data output
from ERS-1 and successor missions,
including ERS-2 and the Columbus
Polar Platform, due for launch in
1997-98. Remote sensing data is
distributed to scientists and
commercial users and makes vital
contributions to many global
environment programmes.
There are bilateral arrangements for space
research between Britain and other countries,
notably the United States through NASA,
the Commonwealth of Independent States
and the People’s Republic of China. British
groups have participated in several NASA
space science missions, and have developed
instruments for NASA’s Hubble Space
Telescope. In May 1991 Britain’s first
astronaut, Helen Sharman, participated in a
mission of the Soviet Mir space station,
during which she performed a number of
scientific experiments in orbit. Other
collaborations include the development of the
wide-field camera for Germany’s X-ray
satellite ROSAT and the X-ray sensor for the
Japanese-built Ginga satellite.
In satellite communications Britain
continues to collaborate with the ESA in such
programmes as Olympus, DRTM and
ASTP-4, with the aim of encouraging the use
and development of new services and
research concepts.

22 Promotion of the Arts
Artistic and cultural activity in Britain ranges
from the highest professional standards to the
enthusiastic support and participation of
amateurs. London is one of the leading world
centres for drama, music, opera and dance.
Other large cities such as Birmingham,
Bristol, Manchester, Edinburgh and Glasgow
have also sustained and developed their
reputations as centres of artistic excellence in
recent years. Arts festivals held in towns and
cities throughout the country attract wide
interest. Many British playwrights,
composers, film-makers, sculptors, painters,
writers, actors, singers, musicians,
choreographers and dancers enjoy
international reputations. Television and radio
bring a wide range of artistic events to a large
audience. Arts activities introduced and
developed by the ethnic minorities are also
thriving. At an amateur level, numerous
choral, orchestral, operatic, dramatic and
other societies for the arts make use of local
talent and resources. The arts in Britain
represent a major sector of economic activity.
In 1990 they contributed an estimated
£6,000 million to the country’s balance of
payments.
Arts 2000
Arts 2000 is an Arts Council of Great Britain
(see p 397) initiative which celebrates the
approach of the millennium. Each year
between 1992 and 2000, a city, town or
region in Britain will be nominated to
celebrate a particular art form, concluding
with the Year of the Artist in 2000.
Birmingham has been chosen as City of
Music 1992, the East Midlands will be the
Region of Dance 1993, Manchester is to be
City of Drama in 1994, and Swansea the City
of Literature in 1995.
Arts 2000 is a competitive process judged
by an expert Arts Council panel. Winners are
offered £250,000 from Arts Council funds,
for which co-sponsorship is being sought;
they are expected to make substantial
contributions of their own to create a wide-
ranging and imaginative programme with a
strong European context.
Policies
The Government’s policies for the arts aim
to develop a high standard of artistic and
cultural activity throughout Britain; to
encourage innovation and scholarship; and to
promote public access to, and appreciation of,
the arts and the cultural heritage. This is
achieved through providing funds and advice,
and expanding total resources by encouraging
partnership with the private sector, including
business sponsorship. National museums and
galleries are encouraged and given an
incentive to increase their resources, for
example, through trading and other activities.
An important concept in funding policy is
the ‘arm’s length’ principle, by which
government funds are distributed to arts
organisations indirectly, through bodies such
as the Arts Council of Great Britain and the
British Film Institute; this protects against
undue political influence over funding
decisions by ensuring that the allocation of
funds is made by those best qualified to do so.
Administration
Promotion and patronage of the arts are the
concern of both official and unofficial bodies.
The Government and local authorities play
an active part, and a substantial amount of
help comes from private sources, including
trusts and commercial concerns.
395
BRITAIN 1993: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
The Secretary of State for National
Heritage is responsible for general arts policy
and heads the Department of National
Heritage, which replaced the Office of Arts
and Libraries in April 1992. The new
Department determines government policy
and administers government expenditure on
national museums and art galleries in
England, the Arts Council of Great Britain,
the British Library and other national arts
and heritage bodies. Other responsibilities
include the regulation of the film industry,
broadcasting and the export licensing of
antiques. The Secretaries of State for Wales,
Scotland and Northern Ireland are
responsible for the national museums,
galleries and libraries in their countries, and
for other cultural matters.
Local authorities maintain more than 1,000
local museums and art galleries and a
network of over 5,000 public libraries. They
also support many arts buildings, arts
organisations and artistic events in their areas,
providing grant aid for professional and
voluntary organisations, including orchestras
and theatre, opera and dance companies.
They undertake direct promotions and
contribute to the cost of new or converted
buildings for the arts. In England this
support is estimated to be around £200
million a year. Arts education in schools,
colleges, polytechnics, evening institutes and
community centres is the responsibility of
central government education departments, in
partnership with local education authorities
and voluntary bodies.
Finance
Since 1988 the Government has set the arts
budget for a three-year period in order to
give recipient arts bodies a firm basis on
which to plan future activities and to
encourage greater self-reliance and
diversification in their sources of funding. It
considers that this strategy has proved
successful in encouraging arts bodies to
match their plans to a realistic view of the
total resources likely to be available. The
three-year settlement applies to the larger
part of the central government arts
programme.
Planned central government expenditure
through the Department of National Heritage
amounts to £609 million in 1992—93. About
£192 million is spent on 11 national galleries
and museums in England; £221 milllion is
channelled through the Arts Council to
support the performing and visual arts
throughout England, Scotland and Wales;
and over £70 million goes to the British
Library. Grants are also made to the British
Film Institute, the Crafts Council, certain
other museums and arts bodies, and to the
National Heritage Memorial Fund. The Fund
helps organisations wishing to acquire, for the
public benefit, land, buildings, works of art
and other objects associated with the national
heritage. In Scotland the Scottish Office
provides £20 5 million to the National
Galleries and Museums and £11-8 million to
the National Library.
Business Sponsorship
Industrial and commercial concerns offer vital
sponsorship and patronage to a wide range of
arts, including exhibitions, concerts and opera
seasons. The Business Sponsorship Incentive
Scheme was introduced by the then Office of
Arts and Libraries in co-operation with the
Association for Business Sponsorship of the
Arts (ABSA) in Great Britain in 1984, with
the aim of raising the overall level of business
sponsorship. (A similar scheme was set up in
Northern Ireland in 1987.) Since its inception
the Scheme has brought over £48 million
into the arts (including a government
contribution of over £16 million) and has
attracted over 2,000 first-time sponsors. An
estimated 80 per cent of the awards have
been made to arts organisations outside
London. In 1992-93 the Scheme is making
available £4-5 million to match new
sponsorships. ABSA is also participating in
UK Charity Lotteries, a venture launched in
1991 designed to benefit 200 charities, among
them many arts organisations.
The Arts Council’s Enhancement Fund,
introduced in 1990, aims to strengthen
leading arts organisations so as to improve
artistic quality and business and financial
planning. It is setting aside £22-5 million for
schemes in England, Scotland and Wales in
396
PROMOTION OF THE ARTS
the period 1991-92 to 1993-94, and is seeking
matching contributions. As a result of the
scheme, the City of London has agreed to
provide an extra £\1 million in matching
contributions for the Royal Shakespeare
Company and the London Symphony
Orchestra at the Barbican, in London, while
English National Ballet and Opera North will
be increasing their touring and enlarging their
repertoires.
Further support is encouraged by tax
concessions which allow companies and
individuals to obtain tax relief on donations to
arts charities. For example, under the Gift
Aid scheme, announced in 1990, single gifts
of ^400 and over in any one year qualify for
tax relief.
Foundation for Sport and the Arts
The Foundation for Sport and the Arts was
set up in 1991 by the Pool Promoters
Association, with grants expected to total £60
million a year. About two-thirds of the
revenue is used to benefit sport and the
remainder to benefit the arts.
Arts Councils
The independent Arts Council of Great
Britain, established in 1946 by Royal Charter,
is the main channel for government aid to the
performing arts. Its chief aims are to:
• improve the knowledge, understanding
and practice of the performing and visual
arts;
• increase their accessibility to the public;
and
• advise and co-operate with government
departments, local authorities and other
organisations.
The Council gives financial help and
advice to organisations ranging from the
major opera, dance and drama companies;
orchestras and festivals; to small touring
theatres and experimental groups.
It also trains arts administrators and helps
arts organisations to develop other sources of
income, including box-office, trading profits,
sponsorship and local authority support. It
encourages contemporary dance, mime, jazz,
literature, photography and art films, and
helps professional creative writers,
choreographers, composers, artists and
photographers through a variety of schemes.
The Council also promotes art exhibitions
and tours and makes funds available for some
specialist training courses in the arts.
Emphasis is being placed on obtaining funds
through partnership arrangements with local
authorities and other agencies, and from
commercial sources. As an extension of its
responsibilities for funding the arts and arts
organisations, the Arts Council promotes the
arts through broadcasting, film and video (see
p 406). Organisations in Scotland and Wales
receive their subsidies through the Scottish
and Welsh Arts Councils, which are
committees of the Arts Council of Great
Britain. Northern Ireland has an independent
Arts Council with aims and functions similar
to those of the Arts Council of Great Britain.
Developments
Government plans to change the structure of
arts funding in England took effect from
October 1992, when ten regional arts boards
(see p 398) were created to replace the 12
regional arts associations. These changes are
intended to improve the system of planning
and accountability by focusing more clearly
on the objectives of funding and monitoring
their progress. As part of the process the
Arts Council will delegate responsibility for
funding many of its clients to the new boards.
However, it will retain responsibility for
funding the four national companies—the
Royal Opera House, the English National
Opera, the Royal Shakespeare Company
and the Royal National Theatre—and also
for the South Bank Centre and the Institute
of Contemporary Arts; and for touring,
broadcasting, research, education and training.
As part of the same restructuring, the Arts
Council was asked to develop a medium-term
strategy for funding the arts, and in autumn
1991 it published a series of discussion papers
on different aspects of the arts. Following an
intensive period of public consultation, the
Council produced a draft strategy document
for final consultation in May 1992.
397
BRITAIN 1993: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Regional Arts Boards
Regional development of the arts in England
and Wales is promoted by ten regional arts
boards. Through a system of forward
planning and budgeting, the boards, each
with its own chair, are subject to a more
clearly focused system of financial
accountability to their national funders (the
Arts Council, British Film Institute and
Crafts Council) than were their predecessors.
The boards bring together all those in a
region—local authorities, private sector
companies, artists and arts groups and
organisations—with an interest in improving
the artistic life of their area. The boards offer
financial assistance to artists and arts
organisations, and advise on, and in some
cases help to promote, activities. They are
financed mainly by the Arts Council, with
smaller sums from the British Film Institute,
the Crafts Council and local authorities, and
these interests are represented on their
governing bodies. Business sponsorship is
also an important source of regional funds.
Arts of Minority Communities
A wide range of arts activities is undertaken
by Britain’s diverse communities, embracing
both the traditional and new forms of artistic
expression. In its support for cultural equity
the Arts Council has, over the last five years,
devoted particular attention to black and
Asian dance and drama. In 1990 ADiTi, a
development organisation for South Asian
dance, was launched in Bradford. The
Council has expanded its training schemes to
include arts administration and technical
skills. The Commonwealth Institute arranges
a varied programme of artistic events, and the
Minorities Arts Advisory Service is an
independent organisation which provides
advice and information on, and training in,
the arts of these communities.
Arts and Disabled People
In its recent consultation paper (see p 397),
the Arts Council expressed concern that the
buildings where arts activities take place often
fail to meet the needs of people with various
types of disability, despite sensitive planning
of new buildings and a considerable amount
of work undertaken by local authorities and
arts venues.
ADAPT, a voluntary organisation set up
in 1989, contributes towards the cost of
making new facilities accessible to disabled
people. Its funds are raised from government
and private sector sponsorship, administered
by the Carnegie Trust, which has made the
biggest contribution to the organisation.
ADAPT has so far raised over £1 million in
grants.
In late 1991 the Arts Council launched an
Arts and Disability Directory, which provides
information on all aspects of arts and
disability.
Arts Centres
More than 250 arts centres in Britain provide
opportunities for enjoyment of, and
participation in, a range of activities in the
performing and visual arts, literature, and
media arts, with educational projects
becoming increasingly important. Nearly all
are professionally managed and most are
supported by volunteer groups. About 70 per
cent of all arts centres are converted
buildings, including former churches,
warehouses, schools, town halls and private
houses. Nearly 90 per cent arrange holiday
programmes for young people. The centres
are assisted mainly by regional arts boards
and local authorities, while the Arts Council
funds two large centres in London—the
South Bank Centre and the Institute of
Contemporary Arts. Many theatres and art
galleries also provide a focal point for the
community by making available facilities for
other arts.
British Council
The British Council promotes a knowledge of
British culture overseas and maintains
libraries in many of the 95 countries in which
it is represented. The Council initiates or
supports overseas tours by British theatre
companies, orchestras, choirs, opera and
dance companies, and jazz, rock and folk
groups, as well as by individual actors,
398
PROMOTION OF THE ARTS
musicians and artists. It also arranges for
directors, designers, choreographers and
conductors to work with overseas companies,
orchestras and choirs. The Council organises
and supports fine arts and other exhibitions
overseas as well as British participation in
international exhibitions and film festivals. It
also maintains film libraries in many of the
countries in which it works, and encourages
professional interchange between Britain and
other countries in all cultural fields.
Visiting Arts Office
The Visiting Arts Office, an autonomous
body administered by the British Council,
promotes foreign arts in Britain. It provides a
clearing house for British and overseas arts
organisations, advises on touring matters and
makes awards for projects.
Broadcasting Organisations
Both BBC radio and television and the
independent companies broadcast a wide
variety of drama (including adaptations of
novels and stage plays), opera, ballet, and
music; and general arts magazine programmes
and documentaries. These have won many
international awards at festivals such as the
Prix Italia and Montreux International
Television Festivals. Independent television
companies also make grants for arts
promotion in their regions.
Broadcasting is thus a major medium for
making the arts available to the general public
and is a crucial source of work for actors,
musicians, writers, composers, technicians
and others in the arts world. It has created its
own forms—nothing like arts documentaries
or drama series, for instance, exists in any
other medium. Broadcasters commission and
produce a vast quantity of new work, notably,
but not confined to, music and drama; a
playwright or poet can reach a much larger
audience through radio or television than
through live performances. Television and
radio provide critical debate, information and
education about the arts, and, through listings
programmes, help to promote the arts.
The BBC has six orchestras, which
employ many of Britain’s full-time
professional musicians. Each week it
broadcasts about 100 hours of classical and
other music (both live and recorded) on its
Radio 3 FM channel. BBC Radio 1
broadcasts rock and pop music 24 hours a
day and a large part of the output of BBC
Radio 2 and of many independent local radio
stations is popular and light music. The first
national commercial radio station, Classic FM,
which broadcasts mainly popular classical
music, came on air in September 1992.
The BBC regularly commissions new
music, particularly by British composers, and
sponsors concerts, competitions and festivals.
Each summer it presents and broadcasts the
BBC Promenade Concerts (the ‘Proms’) at
the Royal Albert Hall.
Festivals
Some 650 professional arts festivals take place
in Britain each year. The Edinburgh
International Festival, featuring a wide range
of arts, is the largest of its kind in the world.
Other annual festivals held in the Scottish
capital include International Folk and Jazz
Festivals and the Film and Television
Festival, while the Mayfest, the second
largest festival in Britain, takes place in
Glasgow. Some well-known festivals
concentrating on music are the Three Choirs
Festival, which has taken place annually for
260 years in Gloucester, Worcester or
Hereford; the Cheltenham Festival, largely
devoted to contemporary British music; and
the Aldeburgh and Bath festivals. Among
others catering for a number of art forms are
the Royal National Eisteddfod of Wales, the
Llangollen International Musical Eisteddfod,
the National Gaelic Mod in Scotland, and the
festivals in Belfast, Brighton, Buxton,
Chichester, Harrogate, Malvern, Pitlochry,
Salisbury, Windsor and York.
European Festival of the Arts
A nationwide, £6 million, European Festival
of the Arts was held to mark Britain’s
Presidency of the European Community from
1 July to 31 December 1992, celebrating
British artistic achievement within a
European context and encouraging a wide
399
BRITAIN 1993: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
range of art forms. As well as major arts
events, the Festival included exchanges
between British towns and cities and their
European counterparts, and between young
people at school, university and college.
DRAMA
Professional Theatre
Britain is one of the world’s major centres for
theatre, and has a long and rich dramatic
tradition. There are many companies based in
London and other cities and towns, as well as
numerous touring companies which visit
theatres, festivals and other venues
throughout Britain, including arts and sports
centres and social clubs. There are 64
companies in receipt of subsidies from the
Arts Council; 27 of these are touring
companies.
Contemporary British playwrights who
have received international recognition
include Harold Pinter, Tom Stoppard, Alan
Ayckbourn, Caryl Churchill, Alan Bennett,
Peter Shaffer and David Hare. The musicals
of Sir Andrew Lloyd Webber have been
highly successful both in Britain and
overseas. Among the best-known directors are
Sir Peter Hall, Trevor Nunn, Adrian Noble,
Richard Eyre, Jonathan Miller, Terry Hands
and Deborah Warner, while the many British
performers who enjoy international
reputations include Sir John Gielgud, Sir
Alec Guinness, Vanessa Redgrave, Sir Ian
McKellen, Derek Jacobi, Albert Finney,
Dame Judi Dench, Jonathan Pryce, Brian
Cox, Juliet Stevenson, Dame Maggie Smith
and Diana Rigg. British stage designers such
as John Bury, Ralph Koltai and Carl Toms
are internationally recognised.
Britain has about 300 theatres intended
for professional use which can seat between
200 and 2,300 people. Some are privately
owned, but most are owned either
municipally or by non-profit-distributing
organisations. Over 30 of these house resident
theatre companies receiving subsidies from
the Arts Council.
London has about 100 West End and
suburban theatres, 15 of them permanently
occupied by subsidised companies. These
include the Royal National Theatre, which
stages a wide range of modern and classical
plays in its three auditoriums on the South
Bank; the Royal Shakespeare Company,
which presents plays mainly by Shakespeare
and his contemporaries, as well as some
modern work, both in Stratford-upon-Avon
and in its two auditoriums in the City’s
Barbican Centre; and the English Stage
Company at the Royal Court Theatre, which
stages the work of many talented new
playwrights. West End theatre attendances
reached 11 million in 1991.
Most theatres are commercially run and
self-financing, relying on popular shows and
musicals to be profitable. By contrast,
companies funded by the Arts Council tend
to offer a mixed repertoire of traditional and
experimental or innovative productions.
The Theatres Restoration Fund,
announced in February 1992, will
provide up to £1 million over three
years from 1992-93 for renovating and
repairing theatres. It will focus on
backstage projects such as rewiring,
plumbing and improvements to
dressing rooms and orchestra pits, for
which no other funds are likely to be
available. The Fund is financed jointly
by the Government and the Wolfson
Charities.
In 1989 the partial remains of the Globe
Theatre, where Shakespeare acted, and the
Rose Theatre, where his plays were
performed during his lifetime, were excavated
on the south bank of the Thames in central
London; both have since been listed as
ancient monuments. A modern reconstruction
of the Globe Theatre, on its original site, is
in progress. As well as a theatre, the plans
include a museum and an exhibition hall.
Regional Theatres
Outside London most cities and many large
towns have at least one theatre. Recent
examples of older theatres which have been
restored include the Theatre Royal,
Newcastle upon Tyne, which dates from the
eighteenth century, and the Alhambra,
400
PROMOTION OF THE ARTS
Bradford, the Lyceum, Sheffield, and the
Haymarket Theatre, Basingstoke, all dating
from the nineteenth century. Others, like the
West Yorkshire Playhouse, Leeds, and the
Theatre Royal, Plymouth, have been built to
the latest designs. Major rebuilding schemes
in progress include the restoration of
Edinburgh’s Empire Theatre (previously a
bingo hall), with £L7 million of public funds,
to provide an international venue for large-
scale theatrical and operatic productions.
Several universities have theatres which
house professional companies playing to the
general public.
Most regional repertory companies mount
about eight to ten productions a year; several
have studio theatres in addition to the main
auditorium, where they present new or
experimental drama and plays of specialist
interest. Repertory theatres also often
function as a social centre by offering
concerts, poetry readings and exhibitions, and
by providing restaurants, bars and theatre
shops.
Regional theatre companies with major
reputations include the Citizens’ Theatre,
Glasgow, the Royal Exchange, Manchester,
Bristol Old Vic, the Liverpool Playhouse (the
oldest surviving repertory theatre in Britain),
Birmingham Repertory Theatre and
Nottingham Playhouse, one of the first
modern regional theatres. Successful
productions from regional theatre companies
often transfer to London’s West End, while
the largest regional theatres receive visits
from the Royal National Theatre or the Royal
Shakespeare Company. The English
Shakespeare Company, a recently formed
classical company, tours the English regions
and worldwide.
Theatre for Young People
A number of companies provide theatre for
young audiences. Unicorn Theatre for
Children and Polka Children’s Theatre, both
in London, present plays specially written for
children; and the Whirligig Theatre tours
throughout Britain. The Young Vic Company
in London and Contact Theatre Company in
Manchester stage plays for young people.
Numerous Theatre-in-Education companies
perform in schools for all age ranges and
abilities. Some of these companies operate
independently—Theatre Centre, for example,
plays in London and tours further afield.
Others are attached to regional repertory
theatres such as the Belgrade in Coventry and
the West Yorkshire Playhouse in Leeds. Most
regional repertory theatres also mount
occasional productions for younger audiences,
and concessionary ticket prices are generally
available for those at school, college or
university. There are also a number of
puppet companies.
There has been a marked growth in youth
theatres, which number more than 500 in
England alone; both the National Youth
Theatre in London and the Scottish Youth
Theatre in Glasgow offer early acting
opportunities to young people.
Dramatic Training
Training for actors, directors, lighting and
sound technicians and stage managers is
provided mainly in drama schools. Among
the best known are the Royal Academy of
Dramatic Art, the Central School of Speech
and Drama, the London Academy of Music
and Dramatic Art, and the Drama Centre (all
in London); the Bristol Old Vic School, the
Royal Scottish Academy of Music and Drama
(Glasgow) and the Manchester Polytechnic
School of Drama. Theatre design courses,
often based in art schools, are available for
people wanting to train as stage designers. A
number of universities, polytechnics and
other colleges offer degree courses in drama.
Amateur Theatre
There are several thousand amateur dramatic
societies throughout Britain. Their work is
encouraged by a number of organisations,
such as the Central Council for Amateur
Theatre, the National Drama Conference, the
Scottish Community Drama Association and
the Association of Ulster Drama Festivals. A
nationwide umbrella body, the Voluntary
Arts Network, has recently been established.
Amateur companies sometimes receive
financial support from local government,
regional arts boards and other bodies.

BRITAIN 1993: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
MUSIC, OPERA AND DANCE
A wide range of musical interests is catered
for in Britain, ranging from classical music
to rock and pop music, the latter being
extremely popular, especially among younger
people. Folk music, jazz, light music and
brass band music also have substantial
followings.
The first National Music Day was
held on 28 June 1992. This is intended
to become an annual event. Its aim is
to celebrate the enjoyment of music
by encouraging as many people as
possible to take part as performers or
listeners in a day of music-making
covering the widest possible range of
music and performance across
Britain.
Music
Orchestral and Choral
Seasons of orchestral and choral concerts are
promoted every year in many large towns
and cities. The principal concert halls in
central London are the Royal Festival Hall
in the South Bank Centre, next to which are
the Queen Elizabeth Hall and the Purcell
Room, which accommodate smaller-scale
performances; the Barbican Hall (part of the
Barbican Centre for Arts and Conferences);
the Royal Albert Hall; the Wigmore Hall, a
recital centre; and St John’s, Smith Square.
A major new concert hall, the Symphony
Hall, opened in Birmingham in 1991, while
plans are in progress to create a new opera
house in Edinburgh. A new 2,400-seat
international concert hall is to be built for
Manchester’s Halle Orchestra; the
Government is to contribute £22 million,
about half the expected cost.
The leading symphony orchestras are the
London Philharmonic, the London
Symphony, the Philharmonia, the Royal
Philharmonic, the BBC Symphony, the
Royal Liverpool Philharmonic, the Halle
(Manchester), the City of Birmingham
Symphony, the Bournemouth Symphony,
and the Ulster and the Royal Scottish
Orchestras. The BBC’s six orchestras
provide broadcast concerts which are often
open to the public. There are also chamber
orchestras such as the English Chamber
Orchestra, the Academy of St Martin-in-the-
Fields, the Bournemouth Sinfonietta, City of
London Sinfonia, the Northern Sinfonia
(Newcastle upon Tyne), and the Scottish
Chamber Orchestra. Specialised ensembles
include the Orchestra of the Age of
Enlightenment, the English Baroque Soloists,
the English Concert and the London
Classical Players. The London Sinfonietta
and the Birmingham Contemporary Music
Group specialise in performing contemporary
music.
British conductors such as Sir Colin
Davis, Sir Neville Marriner, Simon Rattle,
Andrew Davis, Jane Glover, Sian Edwards
and Jeffrey Tate reach a wide audience
through their recordings as well as by their
performances. The works of living composers
such as Sir Michael Tippett, Sir Peter
Maxwell Davies and Sir Harrison Birtwistle
enjoy international acclaim. Other well-
established composers include George
Benjamin, John Tavener, Oliver Knussen,
Colin Matthews, James MacMillan, Nigel
Osborne, Robert Saxton, Mark-Anthony
Turnage and Judith Weir. The Master of the
Queen’s Music, Malcolm Williamson, holds
an office within the Royal Household with
responsibility for organising and writing
music for state occasions. Percussionist
Evelyn Glennie and violinist Nigel Kennedy
are among solo performers currently enjoying
great acclaim.
The principal choral societies include the
Bach Choir, the Brighton Festival Chorus,
the Royal Choral Society, the Huddersfield
Choral Society, the Cardiff Polyphonic Choir,
the Edinburgh International Festival Chorus
and the Belfast Philharmonic Society.
Almost all the leading orchestras maintain
their own choral societies. The English
tradition of church singing is represented by
choirs such as those of King’s College
Chapel, Cambridge, and Christ Church
Cathedral, Oxford. There are many male-
voice choirs in Wales and in certain parts of
England.

PROMOTION OF THE ARTS
Pop and Rock Music
Every week many hundreds of hours of pop
and rock music are broadcast through BBC
and independent radio stations, while pop and
rock magazine programmes and occasional
live or recorded concerts on television further
promote pop and rock, which is by far the most
popular form of musical expression in Britain.
Among the characteristics of modern pop
and rock music are the diversity of styles, the
frequency with which new styles and stars
emerge, and the short lifespan of many
groups. Electric guitars and drums usually
provide the instrumental basis, but there has
been an increasing use of synthesisers, while
modern production techniques have widened
the range of music being released. In the
1960s and 1970s groups such as the Beatles,
the Rolling Stones, the Who, Led Zeppelin
and Pink Floyd achieved international success.
British groups continue to be popular
throughout the world and are often at the
forefront of new developments in music.
Some of the more recent groups include the
Cure, Iron Maiden, Right Said Fred, the Pet
Shop Boys and Wet Wet Wet. Well-known
performers include George Michael, Phil
Collins, Sting and Lisa Stansfield. In recent
years young black musicians have further
strengthened the development of popular music.
The pop and rock music industry
continues to contribute significantly to
Britain’s overseas earnings through the sale of
recordings, concert tours, and promotional
material including clothing and books. The
recording industry in Britain has an estimated
annual turnover of £1,000 million.
Jazz
Jazz has an enthusiastic following in Britain
and is played in numerous clubs and pubs.
British musicians such as Barbara Thompson,
Stan Tracey, John Surman, Andy Sheppard
and Courtney Pine have established strong
reputations throughout Europe. Festivals of
jazz music are held annually in Soho
(London), Edinburgh, Glasgow, Crawley
(West Sussex) and at a number of other
places. Jazz Services provides a national
touring network.
Jazz FM, Britain’s first radio station
devoted exclusively to jazz, was launched in
1990. It broadcasts both live and recorded
music 24 hours a day to listeners in the
London area.
Opera and Dance
Interest in opera has increased greatly in the
last ten years, while an estimated 6 million
people take part in dance, making it one of
Britain’s leading participatory activities, and
audiences are attracted to a widening range of
professional dance. Regular seasons of opera
and ballet are held at the Royal Opera House,
Covent Garden, London. The Royal Opera,
Royal Ballet and Birmingham Royal Ballet,
which rank among the world’s leading
companies, are supported by permanent
orchestras, as are English National Ballet and
Northern Ballet Theatre. Seasons of opera in
English are given by the English National
Opera at the London Coliseum. Scottish
Opera has regular seasons at the Theatre
Royal in Glasgow, and tours mainly in
Scotland and northern England. Welsh
National Opera presents seasons in Cardiff
and other cities. Opera North, based in
Leeds, tours primarily in the north of
England and Opera Factory stages
experimental work in opera and music
theatre. Opera 80 takes opera to towns
throughout England, playing in a wide range
of venues. Opera in Northern Ireland is
promoted by Opera Northern Ireland.
An opera season for which international
casts are specially assembled is held every
summer at Glyndebourne in East Sussex.
This is followed by an autumn tour by
Glyndebourne Touring Opera, often using
casts drawn from the chorus of the festival
season. Work on a new opera house to be
built on the same site at Glyndebourne,
costing £33 million, is due to start in late
1992 and to be completed in May 1994.
All the funding will come from private
sources.
Subsidised Dance Companies
Subsidised dance companies include: the
Birmingham (formerly Sadler’s Wells) Royal
403
BRITAIN 1993: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Ballet, which tours widely in Britain and
overseas; English National Ballet, which
divides its performances between London and
the regions; Northern Ballet Theatre, which
is based in Halifax and also tours, particularly
in the north of England; and Scottish Ballet,
based in Glasgow. Also included are Rambert
Dance (Britain’s oldest ballet company, which
re-formed in 1966 as a leading contemporary
dance company); London Contemporary
Dance Theatre, which provides regular
seasons in London besides touring
extensively; Adzido Pan African Dance
Ensemble; and The KOSH, which combines
dance, theatre and acrobatics. The Arts
Council also supports Dance Umbrella, an
organisation which promotes an annual
festival of contemporary dance. In addition,
the three Arts Councils and the regional arts
boards support individual artists and offer
project grants to several small groups.
Sir Kenneth Macmillan, David Bintley,
and Siobhan Davies are among the foremost
British choreographers, and Michael Clark
and Darcey Bussell among the leading
dancers.
Training
Professional training in music is given mainly
at colleges of music. The leading London
colleges are the Royal Academy of Music, the
Royal College of Music, the Guildhall School
of Music and Drama, and Trinity College of
Music. Outside London the main centres are
the Royal Scottish Academy of Music and
Drama in Glasgow, the Royal Northern
College of Music in Manchester, the Welsh
College of Music and Drama, Cardiff, and
the Birmingham Conservatoire. The National
Opera Studio provides advanced training
courses.
Professional training for dancers and
choreographers is also provided mainly by
specialist schools. Leading dance schools
include the Royal Ballet School, the Ballet
Rambert School and the London School of
Contemporary Dance which, with many
private schools, have helped in raising British
dance to its present standard. Dance is a
subject for degree studies at a number of
institutions, including the Laban Centre
(University of London), the University of
Surrey, Darlington College of the Arts and
Middlesex University.
Courses for students intending to work
with community groups are available at three
institutions. In 1991 the Royal Ballet
announced a scheme to widen access to ballet
training for children from a broader range of
backgrounds, including ethnic minorities.
National Dance Agencies
In order to strengthen support for
professional dance throughout the country,
six national dance agencies have been set up
in Birmingham, Leeds, Leicester, London,
Newcastle upon Tyne and Swindon. The
agencies, which receive Arts Council support,
offer classes and workshops, provide
information and advice, help to co-ordinate
activities, and commission dance artists to
create work.
Other Educational Schemes
The Arts Council runs Taped, a scheme to
finance dance videos for use in education,
while the Video Place provides a library of
videotape documentation of dance
performances for viewing by promoters,
choreographers, dancers, teachers and
students.
The Performing Arts and Technology
School, which opened in Croydon, Surrey, in
1991, offers studies in drama, music and
dance to pupils aged from 14 to 18, with the
emphasis on the application of technology to
the performing arts. The capital cost of £5-9
million is being shared between the
Government (60 per cent) and the British
phonographic industry (40 per cent).
Youth and Music, an organisation
affiliated to the international Jeunesses
Musicales, encourages attendance by young
people at opera, dance and concert
performances. Special performances of
orchestral music for children include the
Robert Mayer Concerts, held in London on
Saturday mornings. All dance companies in
receipt of funding from the Arts Council
provide dance workshops and education
activities. English National Ballet has a ballet
404
PROMOTION OF THE ARTS
designed for 4 to 8 year olds; Ludus Dance
Company, based in Lancaster, works mainly
with young people; and Scottish Ballet Steps
Out works in schools throughout Scotland.
Many children learn to play musical
instruments at school, and some take the
examinations of the Associated Board of the
Royal Schools of Music. Music is one of the
foundation subjects in the National
Curriculum in publicly maintained schools in
England and Wales. The National Youth
Orchestras of Great Britain, of Scotland and
of Wales and other youth orchestras have
established high standards. Nearly a third of
the players in the European Community
Youth Orchestra come from Britain. There is
also a National Youth Jazz Orchestra.
National Youth Music Theatre, which is
based in London, gives young people between
11 and 18 the opportunity to perform music
theatre under the guidance of professional
directors and choreographers. All the work
takes place in the school holidays.
The National Youth Dance Company and
National South Asian Dance Youth Company
provide opportunities for talented young
dancers to work with experienced
professionals and to create and perform dance
throughout the country.
FILMS
British films, actors, and the creative and
technical services supporting them are widely
acclaimed at international film festivals and
other events. British performers who enjoy
international reputations include Sir Dirk
Bogarde, Sean Connery, Michael Caine,
Anthony Hopkins, Kenneth Branagh, Jeremy
Irons, Dudley Moore, Michael York, Bob
Hoskins, Alan Rickman, Emma Thompson
and Greta Scacchi.
Besides feature films, including co¬
productions with other countries, the industry
produces films for television as well as
promotional, advertising, industrial, scientific,
educational and training films.
There are approximately 1,640 cinema
screens in Britain and estimated attendances
are currently running at about L7 million a
week. Seating capacity in cinemas increased
during the late 1980s to around 318,000 by
1991. This has been due almost entirely to
the increase in the number of multi-screen
cinema complexes. Cinemas with five or more
screens accounted for 31 per cent of all
screens in Britain in 1991, compared with
12 per cent in 1988.
Cinema admissions in 1991 totalled an
estimated 100-6 million—nearly 50 per cent
more than in 1984. The resurgence in
attendance figures can be attributed partly to
the rapid growth in the rental and sale of
video films, which has stimulated not only an
interest in films generally but also a wish to
see popular films in their original medium.
There has been a growth in recent years in
the number of grant-aided regional film
theatres and film societies offering alternative
programmes to those of the commercial
cinema chains.
Animation
The recent resurgence of interest in the
cartoon film in Britain is due in great part to
the pioneering work of British animators,
who have created 3D animation and
computer animation. Television has proved
an important source of production finance,
commissioning animated films for adult
audiences, and has fostered the work of Nick
Park, Peter Lord, David Sproxton, Tim
Burton and John Lasseter. Two British films,
Creature Comforts by Aardman Animations,
and Manipulation, directed by Daniel
Greaves, won Oscars in 1991 and 1992
respectively.
Government Support for the Film Industry
An annual government grant (almost £15
million for 1992-93) is made to the British
Film Institute and one of nearly £800,000 to
the Scottish Film Council and the Scottish
Film Production Fund. In 1990 the Govern¬
ment agreed to provide £5 million over three
years to help British film producers wishing
to enter European co-production.
In 1991 the British Film Commission was
launched, with government funding of £3-5
million over four years. The Commission
aims to attract film productions from overseas
by offering a service to assist film-makers.
405
BRITAIN 1993: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
British Screen Finance, a private sector
company with shareholders from the film and
television industries, provides a source of
finance for new film-makers with
commercially viable productions who have
difficulty in attracting funding. The company,
investing its own money together with
contributions from the Government, part-
finances the production of low- and medium-
budget films involving largely British talent.
The company also operates schemes to
encourage the early stages of film project
development and the production of short
films. In 1989 the Government agreed to
provide funding of £6 million over three
years from 1991.
British Film Institute
The development of film, video and
television as art forms is promoted by the
British Film Institute (BFI), founded in
1933, and in Scotland by the Scottish Film
Council. The Institute offers some direct
financial and technical help through its
Production Board to new and experienced
film-makers.
It runs the National Film Theatre in
London and the National Film Archive, and
has the world’s largest library of information
on film and television. The Institute holds
extensive international collections of books,
periodicals, scripts, stills and posters. Its
Education Department aims to enable as
many people as possible to discover new ways
of producing and enjoying film, video and
television.
The National Film Archive contains over
200,000 films and television programmes,
including newsreels, dating from 1895 to the
present. BFI South Bank comprises the
Museum of the Moving Image, which traces
the history of film and television, and the
National Film Theatre. The latter has three
cinemas showing films of historical, artistic or
technical interest, and is unique in offering
regular programmes unrestricted by
commercial considerations. In November each
year it hosts the London Film Festival, at
which some 250 new films from all over the
world are screened.
The British Film Institute has promoted,
and helps to fund, the development of some
40 regional film theatres, with around 50
screens; and is involved in establishing film
and television centres with a range of
activities and facilities in a number of major
cities. It also co-operates with the regional
arts boards and grant-aids their film
activities. In 1991 the Institute raised
almost £7 million—nearly half its income—
from its operations.
The Welsh Arts Council acts as the
Institute’s agent in Wales. In Scotland the
Scottish Film Council supports regional
film theatres, administers the Scottish Film
Archive, and promotes and provides
material for media education. Together with
the Scottish Arts Council, it has set up the
Scottish Film Production Fund, which
makes grants towards film production in
Scotland. The BFI is working with the
newly established Northern Ireland Film
Council. Grants in Northern Ireland are
made by the Arts Council of Northern
Ireland.
Children’s Film
The Children’s Film and Television
Foundation produces and distributes
entertainment films specially designed for
children. These are shown largely through
video and television.
The Children’s Film Unit, which has
received funding from the Children’s Film
and Television Foundation, was founded in
1981. The Unit makes feature films for
children and runs weekly workshops for
children on all aspects of film-making. The
unit caters for about 50 children at any
time and has produced 14 feature films.
Training in Film Production
The National Film and Television School is
financed jointly by the Government and by
the film, video and television industry. It
offers postgraduate and short course training
for directors, editors, camera operators,
animators and other specialists. The School
enrols about 30 full-time students a year
and about 500 on short course programmes.
In 1992-93 it is receiving a government
406
PROMOTION OF THE ARTS
grant of £1-85 million. The School is being
encouraged to reduce its reliance on
government support by increasing the level of
contributions from the industry it serves, as
well as its earned income.
Training in film production is also given at
the London International Film School, the
Royal College of Art, and at some universities
and other institutions of higher education.
Cinema Licensing and Film
Classification
Cinemas showing films to the public must be
licensed by local authorities, which have a
legal duty to prohibit the admission of
children under 16 to unsuitable films, and
may prevent the showing of any film. In
assessing the suitability of films the
authorities normally rely on the judgment of
an independent non-statutory body, the
British Board of Film Classification, to which
films offered to the public must be submitted.
The Board was set up on the initiative of the
cinema industry to ensure a proper standard
in films shown to the public. It does not use
any written code of censorship, but can
require cuts to be made before granting a
certificate; on rare occasions, it refuses a
certificate.
Films passed by the Board are put into one
of the following categories:
• U, meaning universal—suitable for all;
• PG, meaning parental guidance, in which
some scenes may be unsuitable for young
children;
• 12, 15 and 18, for people of not less than
12, 15 and 18 years of age respectively;
and
• Restricted 18, for restricted showing only
at segregated premises to which no one
under 18 is admitted—for example,
licensed cinema clubs.
Videos
The British Board of Film Classification is
also legally responsible for classifying videos.
The system of classification is similar to that
for films. It is an offence to supply
commercially a video which has not been
classified or to supply it in contravention of
its classification—for example, to sell or hire
a video classified 18 to a person under the
age of 18.
VISUAL ARTS
State support for the visual arts consists
largely of maintenance and purchase grants
for the national museums and galleries,
purchase grants for municipal museums and
galleries, and funding through local
authorities, the Museums and Galleries
Commission and the area museum councils
(see p 408). It also includes funding for living
artists channelled through the Arts Councils,
the Crafts Council and the regional arts
boards, and grants towards the cost of art
education. The Government encourages high
standards of industrial design and
craftsmanship through grants to the Design
Council.
All national museums and galleries are
financed chiefly from government funds.
They may levy entrance charges to their
permanent collections, special exhibitions and
outstations at their discretion. Government
policy is to give priority to the conservation
of the buildings and collections of the
national institutions rather than to increase
purchase grants for acquisitions. All the
national collections are managed by
independent trustees.
Museums and art galleries maintained by
local authorities, universities, independent
museums and private benefactions may
receive help in building up their collections
through annual government grants
administered by the Museums and Galleries
Commission (for England and Wales) and the
Scottish Museums Council. Financial and
practical assistance to both national and local
museums and galleries is also given by the
Arts Council and by trusts and voluntary
bodies, including the Calouste Gulbenkian
Foundation, the National Art Collections
Fund and the Contemporary Art Society.
Pre-eminent works of art accepted by the
Government in place of inheritance tax are
allocated to public galleries. Financial help
may be available from the National Heritage
407
BRITAIN 1993: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Memorial Fund (see p 396), which is being
allocated £5-5 million by the Department of
National Heritage in 1992-93. In recent years
the Fund has made important contributions
towards pictures bought by the Birmingham,
Leeds and Manchester City Art Galleries, and
by the national galleries and museums.
In co-operation with regional arts boards,
the Arts Council makes grants towards the
public display of the visual arts, especially
contemporary and experimental works, and
the publication of books and magazines. It
also encourages the commissioning of works
of art in public places. The South Bank Board
maintains a collection of contemporary British
art and organises touring exhibitions through¬
out the country on behalf of the Arts Council.
The Council supports a number of art and
photography galleries in London, including
the Hayward Gallery, Serpentine Gallery,
Photographers’ Gallery and Whitechapel Art
Gallery; and in the regions, the Arnolfmi in
Bristol and the Museum of Modern Art in
Oxford. It also provides support for artists
and photographers through purchasing and
commissioning fellowships and residencies.
Similar support is given by the Scottish Arts
Council to galleries in Scotland. The Welsh
and Northern Ireland Arts Councils have
galleries in Cardiff and Belfast respectively.
A number of modern British sculptors and
painters have international reputations, and
have received international prizes and
commissions for major works in foreign cities.
Among the best known are David Hockney,
Lucian Freud, Eduardo Paolozzi and
Elizabeth Frink.
Museums and Art Galleries
A major expansion in the number of museums
is taking place and many are introducing new
display techniques that attract increasing
numbers of visitors. About 100 million people
a year, across all social groups, attend some
2,500 museums and galleries open to the
public, which include the major national
collections and a wide variety of municipally
and independently or privately owned
institutions.
Government provision for the national
museums and galleries is £192 million in
1992-93. The Museums and Galleries
Improvement Fund, which is jointly financed
by the Government and the Wolfson Trusts,
is providing an annual budget of £4 million
over five years from 1991-92 for refurbishing
museums and galleries. The Fund is already
supporting over 100 projects at national and
other museums and galleries. Projects include
work in Glasgow, Merthyr Tydfil, Lisburn,
Newcastle upon Tyne, Liverpool, Bristol and
Portsmouth.
The Government takes advice on policy
matters from the Museums and Galleries
Commission. The Commission also promotes
co-operation between national and provincial
institutions. Nine area museum councils
supply technical services and advice on
conservation, display, documentation and
publicity.
The Government encourages the loan of
objects from national and provincial museums
and gallery collections so that works of art
can be seen by as wide a public as possible. It
provides funds for promoting the touring of
exhibitions and for facilitating the loan of
items between institutions.
The Museum Training Institute is
responsible for developing training standards
and programmes.
Museums Association
The independent Museums Association, to
which many museums and art galleries and
their staffs belong, and which has many
overseas members, facilitates exchange of
information and discussion of matters relating
to museums and galleries. It provides
training, seminars and research; its
publications include the monthly Museums
Journal.
National Collections
The national museums and art galleries,
many of which are located in London,
contain some of the world’s most
comprehensive collections of objects of
artistic, archaeological, scientific, historical
and general interest. They are the British
Museum (including the Museum of
Mankind), the Natural History Museum, the
408
PROMOTION OF THE ARTS
Victoria and Albert Museum (V&A), the
Science Museum, the National Gallery, the
Tate Gallery, the National Portrait Gallery,
the Imperial War Museum, the National
Army Museum, the Royal Air Force
Museum, the National Maritime Museum,
the Wallace Collection, the Geological
Museum and the National Museums and
Galleries on Merseyside. An extension to the
National Gallery, the Sainsbury Wing,
opened in 1991. A gift from the Sainsbury
family, it provides a venue for major
international touring exhibitions and other
events.
Some of the museums in London have
branches in the regions, examples being the
National Railway Museum (York) and the
National Museum of Photography, Film and
Television (Bradford), which are part of the
Science Museum. The Tate Gallery opened a
branch in Liverpool in 1988, and is planning
to open another in St Ives, Cornwall, while
the V&A plans to open a branch in Bradford.
A purpose-built museum to house much of
the Royal Armouries collection is planned to
open in Leeds’s Clarence Dock in 1996 and
the Imperial War Museum is to open a
branch in Hartlepool, Teesside.
Some of the national museums’ and
galleries’ acquisitions in 1991 include:
• Snettisham treasure trove: the
largest hoard of gold and silver
ever found in Britain—British
Museum;
• the Scott Johnson collection of
Japanese illustrated books and
albums—British Museum;
• Rain, by Howard Hodgkin—Tate
Gallery;
• The Lord Sandwich Papers—
National Maritime Museum; and
• Ulysses Shooting through the Ring,
by Francesco Primaticcio—
National Museums and Galleries
on Merseyside.
In Scotland the national collections are
held by the National Museums of Scotland
and the National Galleries of Scotland. The
National Museums of Scotland include the
Royal Museum of Scotland and the Scottish
United Services Museum, both in Edinburgh;
the Museum of Flight, near North Berwick;
the Scottish Agricultural Museum, at
Ingliston; and the Shambellie House Museum
of Costume, near Dumfries. A new Museum
of Scotland is to be built next to the Royal
Museum to house the National Museums’
Scottish collection. The National Galleries of
Scotland comprise the National Gallery of
Scotland, the Scottish National Portrait
Gallery and the Scottish National Gallery of
Modern Art.
The National Museum of Wales (where a
major expansion scheme is in progress), in
Cardiff, has a number of branches including
the Welsh Folk Museum at St Fagans; the
Industrial and Maritime Museum in Cardiff s
dockland; Amgueddfa’r Gogledd (the Slate
Museum) at Llanberis; and the Museum of
the Woollen Industry at Drefach Velindre.
Northern Ireland has two national museums:
the Ulster Museum in Belfast and the Ulster
Folk and Transport Museum in County
Down.
Other Collections
Other important collections in London
include the Royal Armouries in the Tower of
London, the Museum of London, Sir John
Soane’s Museum, the Courtauld collection
and the London Transport Museum. The
Queen’s Gallery in Buckingham Palace has
exhibitions of pictures from the extensive
royal collections.
Most cities and towns have museums
devoted to art, archaeology and natural
history, usually administered by the local
authorities but sometimes by local learned
societies or by individuals or trustees. Both
Oxford and Cambridge are rich in museums.
Many are associated with their universities,
such as the Ashmolean Museum in Oxford
(founded in 1683—the oldest in the world),
and the Fitzwilliam Museum in Cambridge.
Many private art collections in historic family
mansions, including those owned by the
National Trusts, are open to the public, while
an increasing number of open air museums
depict the regional life of an area or preserve
early industrial remains. These include the
409
BRITAIN 1993: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Weald and Downland Museum in West
Sussex, the North of England Open Air
Museum in Durham, and the Ironbridge
Gorge Museum in Shropshire. Skills of the
past are revived in a number of ‘living’
museums like the Gladstone Pottery Museum
near Stoke-on-Trent and the Quarry Bank
Mill at Styal in Cheshire.
Among the more recent museums are the
National Horseracing Museum at
Newmarket; the Jorvik Viking Centre, a
reconstruction of the Viking settlement in
York; a new maritime museum in
Portsmouth, housing the restored wreck of
the Mary Rose, the flagship of Henry VIII,
which sank in 1545 and was raised in 1982;
and Eureka, the first museum designed
specifically for children, which opened in
Halifax, West Yorkshire, in July 1992. The
Burrell Collection in Glasgow houses world-
famous tapestries, paintings and objets d’art.
The Design Museum, which opened in
London’s Docklands in 1990, houses exhibits
charting changes in design and technology.
Apart from their permanent collections, most
museums and galleries stage temporary
exhibitions on particular themes. There are
also a number of national art exhibiting
societies, the most famous being the Royal
Academy of Arts at Burlington House. The
Academy holds an annual Summer
Exhibition, where the works of hundreds of
professional and amateur artists can be seen,
and important exhibitions during the rest of
the year. The Royal Scottish Academy holds
annual exhibitions in Edinburgh. There are
also children’s exhibitions, including the
National Exhibition of Children’s Art.
Crafts
Government aid for the crafts, amounting to
^2-9 million in 1992-93, is administered in
England and Wales by the Crafts Council.
The Council supports craftsmen and women
by promoting public interest in their work,
and encouraging the creation and
conservation of articles of contemporary
craftsmanship. Grants are available to help
with setting up workshops and acquiring
equipment. The Council arranges exhibitions,
crafts fairs and seminars, and circulates
information. It also runs a gallery in London
and a crafts shop at the Victoria and Albert
Museum. Funding is given to the Welsh Arts
Council and the regional arts boards in
England for the support of crafts, and to
Contemporary Applied Art, a membership
organisation that holds exhibitions and sells
work through its London gallery.
New arrangements for the support of
crafts in Scotland came into effect in 1991. A
wide range of commercial services is now
provided by a company, Made in Scotland,
while training and business development
support is provided by two new government-
funded bodies, Scottish Enterprise and
Highlands and Islands Enterprise, each with a
network of Local Enterprise Companies led
by the private sector.
In 1991 Britain’s craft economy had an
estimated annual turnover of £200 million.
Training in Art and Design
Most practical education in art and design is
provided in colleges of art (among the best
known of which are the Slade School and the
Royal College of Art, both in London),
further education colleges and private art
schools. Degrees at postgraduate level are
awarded by the Royal College of Art. Art is
also taught at an advanced level at the four
Scottish Central (Art) Institutions.
Courses at universities and polytechnics
concentrate largely on academic disciplines
such as the history of art. The leading
institutions include the Courtauld and
Warburg Institutes of the University of
London and the Department of Classical Art
and Archaeology at University College,
London. Art is one of the foundation subjects
in the National Curriculum in publicly
maintained schools in England and Wales;
and the Society for Education through Art
encourages, among other activities, the
purchase by schools of original works of art
by organising an annual Pictures for Schools
exhibition.
The Open College of the Arts offers
correspondence courses in art and design,
painting, sculpture, textiles, photography and
creative writing to people wishing to study at
home.

PROMOTION OF THE ARTS
Export Control of Works of Art
London is a major centre for the international
art market, and sales of works of art take
place in the main auction houses (two of the
longest-established being Sotheby’s and
Christie’s), and through private dealers.
Certain items are covered by export control.
These are:
• works of art and collectors’ items over 50
years old and worth £20,000 or more
(£5,000 or more in the case of British
historical portraits);
• photographic material over 50 years old
and valued at £500 or more an item; and
• documents, manuscripts and archives
over 50 years old, irrespective of value.
A licence from the Department of National
Heritage is required before such items can be
exported. If the Department’s advisers
recommend withholding a licence, the matter
is referred to the Reviewing Committee on
the Export of Works of Art. If the Committee
considers a work to be of national importance
it can advise the Government to withhold the
export licence for a specified time to give a
public museum, art gallery, or private
collector an opportunity to buy at a fair price.
In 1991 the Committee published a review of
the present system of export control,
following which the Government decided
against listing important paintings and other
heritage objects to prevent them from being
exported.
With the completion of the European
single market in January 1993, there is
concern that the removal of customs barriers
for intra-community trade may facilitate the
illicit export of national treasures. Discussions
on methods of preventing this are in progress
among the member states of the Community.
LITERATURE AND LIBRARIES
A number of literary activities receive public
subsidy through the Arts Council. In 1990,
for example, the Council sponsored its first
international writers’ tour, and contributed to
an innovative television series on modern
poetry. It continues to foster an interest in
writing from diverse cultures through its
support for translations and black publishing.
There are free public libraries throughout
Britain, private libraries and several private
literary societies. Book reviews are featured in
the press and on television and radio, and
numerous periodicals concerned with
literature are published. Recognition of
outstanding literary merit is provided by a
number of awards, some of the most valuable
being the Booker, National Cash Register and
Whitbread prizes. Awards to encourage
young writers include those of the Somerset
Maugham Trust Fund and the E. C. Gregory
Trust Fund. Many British writers are
internationally recognised and in 1983 the
Nobel prize for literature was awarded to the
novelist Sir William Golding. Other well-
known living novelists include Sir Kingsley
Amis, Anthony Burgess, A.S. Byatt, Penelope
Lively and Fay Weldon. Distinguished
British poets include Ted Hughes, the Poet
Laureate; Geoffrey Hill; Tony Harrison;
James Berry; Gavin Ewart; and Elizabeth
Jennings.
Authors’ Copyright and Performers’
Protection
Original literary, dramatic, musical or artistic
works, films, sound recordings and broadcasts
are automatically protected in Britain. This
protection is given to foreign works under the
terms of international conventions. The
copyright owner has rights against
unauthorised reproduction, public
performance, broadcasting and issue to the
public of his or her work; and against dealing
in unauthorised copies. In most cases the
author is the first owner of the copyright,
and the term of copyright is the life of the
author and a period of 50 years after death
(50 years from the year of release for films
and sound recordings and 50 years from the
year of broadcast for broadcasts).
The Copyright, Designs and Patents Act
1988 reformed and restated copyright law and
introduced the concept of moral rights,
whereby authors have the right to be
identified on their works and to object to
derogatory treatment of them. The Act
introduced a statutory framework of civil
411
BRITAIN 1993: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
rights to protect performers against making
and trading in unauthorised recordings of live
performance, the term of protection for these
rights being 50 years from the year in which
the performance is given.
Literary and Philological Societies
Societies to promote literature include the
English Association and the Royal Society of
Literature. The leading society for studies in
the humanities is the British Academy for
the Promotion of Historical, Philosophical
and Philological Studies (the British
Academy).
Other specialist societies are the Early
English Text Society, the Bibliographical
Society and several societies devoted to
particular authors, the largest of which is the
Dickens Fellowship. Various societies, such as
the Poetry Society, sponsor poetry readings
and recitals.
Libraries
The British Library
The British Library, the national library of
Britain, is one of the world’s greatest libraries.
Its collections comprise over 18 million
items—monographs, manuscripts, maps,
newspapers, patents, stamps and recorded
sound. Publishers must deposit there a copy
of most items published or available in
Britain.
The National Bibliographic Service
processes material legally deposited at the
Library for inclusion in catalogues and
maintains a machine-readable database of
bibliographical records from which is derived
the British National Bibliography (a list of
new and forthcoming British books) and a
range of automated bibliographical services.
The Research and Development
Department is a major source of funding for
research and development in library and
information services.
The Library’s Document Supply Centre at
Boston Spa (West Yorkshire) is the national
centre for inter-library lending within Britain
and between Britain and countries overseas. It
supplies 3-5 million requests a year, mostly
from its own stock of 7 million documents.
In 1990 the Library set up the self-
supporting Centre for the Book, to promote
awareness of books and their role in British
life, past and present.
The Library’s new London headquarters
at St Pancras is being built at a cost of
million, and will be open to the public from
1994. It will provide reading rooms for most
of the Library’s London-based collections—
humanities, science, technology and industry—
and also specialist reading areas. The new
Library aims to offer greatly improved
services, including exhibition galleries, a
bookshop, a lecture theatre and a conference
centre.
Other Libraries
The National Libraries of Scotland and
Wales, the Bodleian Library of Oxford
University and the Cambridge University
Library can also claim copies of all new
British publications under legal deposit. The
first phase of a new building for the National
Library of Scotland was opened in 1989.
Costing j£1F5 million, it provides 49 km (30
miles) of storage shelving and accommodates
a map library, lending services and the
Scottish Science Library. Work on the
second stage began in 1991, for completion
in 1994.
Some of the national museums and
government departments have important
libraries.
• The Public Record Office in London and
in Kew, Surrey, houses the records of
the superior courts of law of England and
Wales and of most government
departments, as well as famous historical
documents. The Office has many millions
of documents, dating from the time of
the Norman Conquest to the present day.
Public records, with few exceptions, are
available for inspection by members of
the public 30 years after the end of the
year in which they were created.
• The Scottish Record Office in Edinburgh
and the Public Record Office of
Northern Ireland, Belfast, serve the same
purpose.
412
PROMOTION OF THE ARTS
Besides a number of great private
collections, such as that of the London
Library, there are the rich resources of the
learned societies and institutions. Examples
are the libraries of the Royal Institute of
International Affairs, the Royal Geographical
Society, the Royal Academy of Music, the
National Library for the Blind and the Book
Trust. The Poetry Library, owned by the
Arts Council, is a national collection of
twentieth century poetry written in or
translated into English.
University Libraries
The university libraries of Oxford and
Cambridge are unmatched by those of the
more recent foundations. However, the
combined library resources of the colleges and
institutions of the University of London total
9 million volumes, the John Rylands
University Library in Manchester contains
3 4 million volumes, Edinburgh 2 million,
Leeds L8 million, and Birmingham, Glasgow,
Liverpool and Aberdeen each have over 1
million volumes. Many universities have
important research collections in special
subjects; examples include the Barnes Medical
Library at Birmingham and the British
Library of Political and Economic Science at
the London School of Economics.
Special Libraries
Numerous associations and commercial and
industrial organisations run library and
information services. Although most are
intended primarily for use within the
organisation, many special libraries can be
used, by arrangement, by people interested in
the area covered, and the specialist
publications held are often available for inter-
library lending.
Public Libraries
Local authorities in Great Britain and
education and library boards in Northern
Ireland have a duty to provide a free lending
and reference library service in their areas,
and Britain’s network of libraries has a total
stock of about 156-7 million books. Public
libraries issue an average of ten books a year
for every person in Britain. Sixty per cent of
these are works of fiction for adults. Over
half of the total population are members of
public libraries. Some areas are served by
mobile libraries, and domiciliary services
cater for people unable to visit a library.
Many libraries have collections of compact
discs, records, audio- and video-cassettes, and
musical scores for loan to the public, while a
number also lend from collections of works of
art, which may be originals or reproductions.
Most libraries hold documents on local
history, and nearly all provide children’s
departments, while reference and information
sections and art, music, commercial and
technical departments meet the growing and
more specific demands in these fields. The
information role is one of increasing
importance for many libraries, and greater
use is being made of information technology,
including microcomputers and reference
databases.
The Government remains committed to
providing a free basic library service—the
borrowing and consultation of books and
other printed materials—but believes there is
scope for greater private sector involvement.
Under the Public Library Development
Incentive Scheme it makes available £250,000
a year to encourage new developments and
increase efficiency in public library services in
England. Priority is given to projects
involving collaboration with other libraries
and the private sector.
Public library authorities charge for some
services, such as research services and the
lending of non-printed materials, including
cassettes and records.
The Public Lending Right Scheme,
introduced in 1979, gives registered authors
the right to receive payment from a central
fund (totalling £4-75 million in 1992-93) for
the use of their books borrowed from public
libraries in Britain. Payment is made in
proportion to the number of times the
authors’ books are lent out.
The Government is advised on library and
information matters by four library and
information services councils or committees,
representing England, Wales, Scotland and
Northern Ireland.
413
BRITAIN 1993: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
A government review of the range of
services provided by public libraries in
England is in progress, while a consultation
paper on the feasibility of competitive
tendering for public library support services
has been issued. Support services include
running the network of service points in
branches, mobile libraries and for specialist
groups such as the housebound, and
maintaining specialist collections.
The Library Association
The Library Association is the principal
professional organisation for those engaged in
library and information services. Founded in
1877, the Association has 25,000 members
working in all kinds of libraries and
information units. It maintains a Register of
Chartered Librarians and publishes books,
pamphlets and an official journal.
The Library Association is the designated
authority for the recognition of qualifications
gained in other member states of the
European Community.
Historical Manuscripts
The Royal Commission on Historical
Manuscripts is the central investigatory and
advisory body on manuscripts, records and
archives other than the public records. It
maintains the National Register of Archives
and advises owners, custodians and
government, assists researchers and co¬
ordinates the activities of bodies working in
the field. It also publishes a series of Guides
to Sources for British History.
The National Manuscripts Conservation
Trust, established in 1989 with government
assistance of £300,000, provides grants to
record offices, libraries and other owners of
manuscripts and archives accessible to the
public. Matching amounts of money are
found from other sources, including the
beneficiaries.
Books
In 1991 British publishers issued over
67,700 separate titles, of which 48,300 were
new titles and the remainder reprints and
new editions. The British publishing
industry devotes much effort to developing
overseas markets, and in 1991 the value of
exports of British books amounted to £626
million. The industry is also noted for its
exploitation of new technological
developments, including electronic
publishing and the development of software
for educational and other purposes.
Mail order book clubs offering discounts
on monthly or quarterly offers of books to
members have made a significant
contribution to the number of books bought
by the British public.
Among the leading organisations
representing publishing and distribution
interests are the Publishers Association,
which has 170 members, representing over
350 separate publishing companies; and the
Booksellers’ Association, with 3,250
members. The Publishers Association,
through its associated body the Book
Development Council, promotes the export
of British books worldwide.
The British Council (see p 398)
publicises British books through its libraries
overseas, participation in international book
fairs and a programme of travelling
exhibitions. The Council also publishes a
monthly periodical, British Book News.
The Book Trust, whose membership
includes authors, publishers, booksellers,
librarians and readers, encourages an
interest in reading, especially among young
people, and arranges exhibitions throughout
Britain.
414
23 The Press
More daily newspapers, national and regional,
are sold for every person in Britain than in
most other developed countries. On an
average day two out of three people over the
age of 15 read a national morning newspaper;
about three out of four read a Sunday
newspaper.
Three out of four adults regularly read a
paid-for regional or local newspaper as well as
a free local paper. National papers have a
total circulation of 14 2 million on weekdays
and 16-2 million on Sundays, although the
total readership is considerably greater. There
are about 130 daily (Monday to Saturday) and
Sunday newspapers, over 2,000 weekly paid-
for and free newspapers (including business,
sporting and religious newspapers), and 7,000
periodical publications.
There is no state control or censorship of
the press, but it is subject to the general laws
on publication (see p 424). In 1991, following
recommendations in the Calcutt Report on
privacy and related matters (see p 423), the
Press Complaints Commission was set up by
the newspaper and periodicals industry in
what was seen as a final attempt to make self-
regulation of the press work properly. These
measures were prompted by growing criticism
of press standards, with allegations of
unjustified invasion of privacy and inaccurate
and biased reporting, among other abuses,
resulting in calls for government regulation of
the press.
The press caters for a variety of political
views, interests and levels of education.
Newspapers are almost always financially
independent of any political party. Where
they express pronounced views and show
obvious political leanings in their editorial
comments, these derive from proprietorial
and other non-party influences. Nevertheless,
during general election campaigns many
newspapers recommend their readers to vote
for a particular political party. Even
newspapers which adopt strong political
views in their editorial columns include
feature and other types of articles by authors
of a variety of political persuasions. In order
to preserve their character and traditions,
some newspapers and periodicals are
governed by trustee-type arrangements.
Others have management arrangements to
ensure their editors’ authority and
independence.
In recent years working practices
throughout the newspaper industry have
undergone profound changes in response to
the challenges posed by computer-based
technology and the need to contain costs.
Newsprint, about three-quarters of which is
imported, forms about a quarter of average
national newspaper costs; labour represents
over half. In addition to sales, many
newspapers and periodicals derive
considerable earnings from their advertising.
Total yearly spending of around £4,800
million on press advertising makes the press
by far the largest advertising medium in
Britain. Unlike most of its European
counterparts the British press receives no
subsidies and relatively fewr tax and postal
concessions.
In discussions on a ‘new world
information and communication order’
Britain has opposed measures designed to
increase governmental regulation of the media
or limit the free flow of information. At the
same time, it has reaffirmed its willingness to
support efforts to improve communications
systems in the developing world.
Newspaper Ownership
Ownership of the national, London and
regional daily newspapers is concentrated in
the hands of a number of large press

THE PRESS
publishing groups. The groups controlling the
national press are listed in Table 23.1. There
are also some 100 independent regional and
local newspaper publishers.
Although most enterprises are organised as
limited liability companies, individual and
partner proprietorship survives. The large
national newspaper and periodical publishers
are major corporations with interests ranging
over the whole field of publishing and
communications. Some have shares in
independent television and radio companies,
while others are involved in industrial and
commercial activities.
The law provides safeguards against the
risks inherent in undue concentration of the
means of communication. It is unlawful
without government consent to transfer a
newspaper or newspaper assets to a proprietor
whose newspapers have an average daily
circulation amounting, with that of the
newspaper to be taken over, to 500,000 or
more copies. Except in certain limited cases,
consent may be given only after the President
of the Board of Trade has referred the matter
to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission
and received its report.
Under the Broadcasting Act 1990 (see
p 426) no proprietor of a national newspaper
or local newspaper is allowed more than a 20
per cent interest in direct broadcasting by
satellite channels, independent television
Channels 3 and 5, and national and local
radio.
The National Press
Twelve morning daily papers and nine
Sunday papers (see Table 23.1) circulate
throughout most parts of Britain, and are
thus referred to as national newspapers.
Formerly they were produced in or near
Fleet Street in London with, in some cases,
northern editions being printed in
Manchester. All of the national papers have
now moved their editorial and printing
facilities to other parts of London (including
Docklands) or away from the capital
altogether; some use contract printing. Today
newspaper is printed both at Poyle
(Middlesex) and Manchester. The Independent
uses printing presses in Bradford,
Northampton and Portsmouth. Scottish
editions of The Sun, The Times, News of the
World and The Sunday Times are printed in
Glasgow.
In order to improve distribution and sales
overseas, editions of the Financial Times are
printed in Frankfurt, Roubaix (northern
France), New Jersey and Tokyo, while The
Guardian prints an international edition in
Frankfurt. The European, a weekly English-
language international newspaper, is printed
in Britain, France, Germany and Hungary.
Several newspapers have had very long
and distinguished histories. The Observer, for
example, first published in 1791, is the oldest
national Sunday newspaper in the world, and
The Times, one of the most influential
newspapers and Britain’s oldest daily national
newspaper, began publication in 1785.
National newspapers are often thought of
as either ‘quality’ or ‘popular’ papers on the
basis of differences in style and content. Five
dailies and four Sundays are usually
described as ‘quality’ newspapers. Quality
papers are directed at readers who want full
information on a wide range of public matters
and are prepared to spend a considerable
amount of time reading them. Popular
newspapers appeal to people wanting news of
a more entertaining character, presented in a
more concise form and with ample
illustrations. For the most part, quality
papers are broadsheet (large-sheet) in format
and popular papers tabloid (small-sheet).
Many newspapers are printed in colour
and a number produce colour magazines as
part of the Saturday or Sunday paper.
Several of the Sunday newspapers, and
some of the dailies on Saturday, publish
supplements with articles on travel, food and
wine, and other leisure topics.
The leading Scottish papers, The Scotsman
and the Herald, have considerable circulations
outside Scotland.
There is a growing market for news and
information in the electronic media, and
quality papers like the Financial Times
provide material for use on databases and
videotext services such as Prestel. The Times
supplies a news service to British Sky
Broadcasting (BSkyB), a direct satellite
broadcasting company under the same
ownership.
417
BRITAIN 1993: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Regional Newspapers
There are more than 100 morning, evening
and Sunday newspapers throughout Britain,
and nearly 1,600 weekly paid-for and free
distribution newspapers, publishing mainly
regional and local news. The morning
newspapers also cover national and
international affairs.
England
Of the morning papers the Yorkshire Post
(Leeds), the Northern Echo (Darlington) and
the Eastern Daily Press (Norwich), each has a
circulation of over 83,000, and two provincial
Sunday papers—the Sunday Sun (Newcastle
upon Tyne) and the Sunday Mercury
(Birmingham)—sell 117,800 and 151,900
copies respectively. Circulation figures of
evening papers start at about 10,000 and most
are in the 20,000 to 100,000 range. Those
with much larger sales include the Manchester
Evening News (241,300), Wolverhampton’s
Express and Star (228,000), the Birmingham
Evening Mail (203,500), and the Liverpool
Echo (184,000). Paid weekly papers have a
mainly local appeal and most have circulations
in the 5,000 to 60,000 range.
The weekly Berrow's Worcester Journal
claims to be the world’s oldest
newspaper in continuous circulation,
having been established in 1690.
London has one evening newspaper, the
Evening Standard, with a circulation of
528,700. It covers national and international
news as well as local affairs. A number of
evening newspapers are published in the
outer metropolitan area. Local weeklies
include papers for every district in Greater
London, often in the form of local editions of
an individual paper.
Wales
Wales has one daily morning newspaper, the
Western Mail, published in Cardiff, with a
circulation of 76,200 throughout Wales. In
north Wales the Daily Post, published in
Liverpool, gives wide coverage to events in
the area. Wales on Sunday, published in
Cardiff, has a circulation of 53,100. Evening
papers published in Wales are the South
Wales Echo, Cardiff; the South Wales Argus,
Newport; the South Wales Evening Post,
Swansea; and the Evening Leader, Wrexham.
Their circulation range is between 32,500 and
80,900. North Wales is also served by the
Liverpool Echo, and the Shropshire Star covers
parts of north and mid-Wales. There is also
coverage to a smaller extent by the
Manchester Evening News.
The weekly press (82 publications)
includes English-language papers, some of
which carry articles in Welsh; bilingual
papers; and Welsh-language papers. Welsh
community newspapers receive an annual
grant as part of the Government’s wider
financial support for the Welsh language.
Scotland
Scotland has six morning, six evening and
four Sunday newspapers. Local weekly
newspapers number 115. The daily morning
papers, with circulations of between 85,900
and 740,000, are The Scotsman (published in
Edinburgh); the Herald', the Daily Record
(sister paper of the Daily Mirror)', the Dundee
Courier and Advertiser, the Aberdeen Press and
Journal', the Scottish Daily Express (printed in
Manchester), and the Scottish edition of The
Sun. The daily evening papers have
circulations in the range of 10,400 to 164,330
and are the Evening News of Edinburgh,
Glasgow’s Evening Times, Dundee’s Evening
Telegraph, Aberdeen’s Evening Express, the
Paisley Daily Express and the Greenock
Telegraph.
The Sunday papers are the Sunday Mail,
the Sunday Post, the Scottish Sunday Express
(printed in Manchester) as well as a quality
broadsheet paper, Scotland on Sunday,
launched in 1988. The national Sunday
newspapers The Observer and The Sunday
Times carry Scottish supplements.
Northern Ireland
Northern Ireland has two morning
newspapers, one evening and three Sunday
papers, all published in Belfast, with
418
THE PRESS
circulations ranging from 20,000 to 134,000.
They are the News Letter (unionist), the Irish
News (nationalist), the evening Belfast
Telegraph, the Sunday News, Sunday Life and
Sunday World (Northern Ireland edition).
There are about 45 weeklies. Newspapers
from the Irish Republic, as well as the British
national press, are widely read in Northern
Ireland.
Free Distribution Newspapers
More than 750 free distribution newspapers,
mostly weekly and financed by advertising,
are published in Britain; over half are
produced by established newspaper
publishers. They have enjoyed rapid growth
in recent years and now have an estimated
total weekly circulation of about 37 million.
Ethnic Minority Publications
Over 60 newspapers and magazines in Britain
are produced by members of the ethnic
minorities. In the main these are published
weekly, fortnightly or monthly. Two Chinese
newspapers, Sing Tao and Wen Wei Po, the
Urdu Daily fang (see below) and the Arabic
Al-Arab, however, are dailies.
The Asian Times and Indiamail are English
language titles for people of Asian descent
and are published weekly; the Sikh Messenger
and Sikh Courier are both produced quarterly.
Afro-Caribbean newspapers include The
Weekly Gleaner, a local edition of the long-
established Jamaican Gleaner, and West Indian
Digest. The Voice and Caribbean Times, both
weeklies, are aimed at the black population in
general. The Weekly Journal, the first ‘quality’
broadsheet aimed at Britain’s black
community, was launched in April 1992.
Leading ethnic language newspapers in
Britain include the Urdu Daily Jang, an
offshoot of the largest circulation paper in
Pakistan, and the weekly Gujarat Samachar, a
Gujarati tabloid. Publications also appear in
Bengali (examples are the weeklies Jagoran
and Janomot)-, in Hindi (the weeklies Amar
Deep, Hind Samachar and Navin Weekly); and
in Punjabi (the weeklies Des Perdes and
Punjab Darpan and the monthlies Rachna and
Perdes an).
British provincial newspaper groups are
examining the possibility of printing special
editions for their local populations. In 1989
the Leicester Mercury started publication of a
daily Asian edition, incorporating news from
the South Asian sub-continent, while in
January 1992 The People produced the first
national newspaper especially for the Asian
community in Britain.
The Periodical Press
The 7,000 periodical publications are
classified as ‘consumer general interest’,
‘special interest’ and ‘business-to-business’.
There are also several hundred ‘house
magazines’ produced by industrial
undertakings, business houses or public
services for the benefit of their employees
and/or clients. Directories and similar
publications number more than 2,000. The
‘alternative’ press comprises a large number
of titles, many of them devoted to radical
politics, community matters, religion, the
occult, science or ecology.
Consumer general and specialist
periodicals comprise magazines for a wide
range of interests. These include women’s
magazines; publications for children; religious
periodicals; fiction magazines; magazines
dealing with sport, motoring, gardening,
teenage interests and pop music; hobbies;
humour; retirement; and computer
magazines. Also included are the publications
of learned societies, trade unions, regiments,
universities and other organisations.
The weekly periodicals with the highest
sales have traditionally been Radio Times and
TV Times, which carry full details of the
forthcoming week’s television and radio
programmes, including the satellite schedules.
The Radio Times/ TV Times listings duopoly
came to an end in early 1991, and the advent
of competition has led to a reduction in the
circulation figures of both magazines. In June
1992 the Radio Times had a circulation of
L6 million, the TV Times one of 11 million.
Rival publications include TV Quick and
What's on TV (L4 million). Of monthly
magazines, Reader’s Digest has the highest
circulation (L5 million).
Woman’s Weekly, Woman’s Own, Woman,
419
BRITAIN 1993: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Weekly News (which sells mainly in Scotland),
Woman's Realm, My Weekly and Me have
circulations in the 400,000 to 900,000 range.
In recent years several women’s magazines
from overseas have achieved large
circulations: Prima and Best, for instance,
each sell over 630,000 copies, while Bella and
Hello! are also widely read. Smash Hits, with
a circulation of 368,000, is a fortnightly
magazine dealing with pop music and teenage
lifestyles. Viz, a cartoon comic aimed at
young adults, sells 922,000 copies.
The leading journals of opinion include
The Economist, an independent conservative
publication covering a wider range of topics
than its title implies. The New Statesman and
Society reviews social issues, politics,
literature and the arts from an independent
socialist point of view, and the Spectator
covers similar subjects from an independent
conservative standpoint. Tribune represents
certain left-wing views within the Labour
Party.
New Scientist reports on science and
technology in terms that the non-specialist
reader can understand. Private Eye, a satirical
fortnightly, also covers public affairs. Weekly
‘listings’ magazines, including Time Out and
City Limits, provide details of cultural and
other events in London and other large cities.
Literary and political journals, and those
specialising in international and
Commonwealth affairs, appear monthly or
quarterly, and generally appeal to the more
academically oriented reader. Business,
scientific and professional journals, whose
publication ranges from twice weekly to
quarterly, are an important aspect of British
publishing and business communication,
many having a considerable circulation
overseas. There are about 4,600 publications
covering business and industrial affairs.
New Printing Technology
The heavy production costs of newspapers
and periodicals continue to encourage
publishers to look for ways of reducing these
costs, often by using advanced computer
systems to control editing and production
processes. The ‘front end’ or ‘single stroking’
system, for example, allows journalists or
advertising staff to input ‘copy’ directly into a
video terminal, and then to transform it
automatically into computer-set columns of
type. Although it is possible for these
columns to be assembled electronically on a
page-sized screen, turned into a full page,
and made automatically into a plate ready for
transfer to the printing press, at present very
few such systems are in operation. Most
involve the production of bromides from the
computer setting; these are then pasted up
into columns before being placed in a plate¬
making machine.
The most advanced systems present
opportunities for reorganisation which have
implications throughout a newspaper office
and may give rise to industrial relations
problems. Generally, and most recently in the
case of national newspapers, the introduction
of computerised systems has led to substantial
reductions in workforces, particularly, but not
solely, among print workers.
All the national newspapers use computer
technology, and its use in the provincial
press, which has generally led the way in
adopting new techniques, is widespread.
Journalists key articles directly into, and edit
them on, computer terminals; colour pictures
and graphics are entered into the same
system electronically. Where printing plants
are some distance from editorial offices, pages
are sent for printing by facsimile (fax)
machine from typesetter to print plant. Other
technological developments include the use of
full-colour printing, and a switch from
traditional letterpress printing to the web-
offset litho or plastic-plate processes.
News International, publisher of three
daily and two Sunday papers, has at its
London Docklands headquarters more than
500 computer terminals, one of the largest
systems installed at one time anywhere in the
world. The Financial Times opened a new
printing plant in Docklands in 1988 with
about 200 production workers, compared
with the 650 employed at its former printing
facility in the City of London. The new
Docklands plant of the Associated
Newspapers Group uses flexography, a
rubber-plate process. Other national papers
have also moved into new computer-based
printing plants outside Fleet Street.

THE PRESS
News Agencies
The principal news agencies in Britain are
Reuters, an international news organisation
registered in London, the Press Association
and Extel Financial.
Reuters
Reuters is a publicly owned company,
employing 10,335 full-time staff in 79
countries. It has 1,300 staff journalists and
photographers. The company serves
subscribers in 132 countries, including
financial institutions; commodities houses;
traders in currencies, equities and bonds;
major corporations; government agencies;
news agencies; newspapers; and radio and
television stations.
Reuters has developed the world’s most
extensive private leased communications
network to transmit its services. It provides
the media with general, political, economic,
financial and sports news, news pictures and
graphics, and television news. Services for
business clients comprise constantly updated
price information and news, historical
information, facilities for computerised
trading, and the supply of communications
and other equipment for financial dealing
rooms. Information is distributed through
video terminals and teleprinters. Reuters is
the major shareholder in Visnews, a television
news agency whose service reaches over 650
broadcasters in 84 countries.
The Press Association
The Press Association—the British and Irish
national news agency—is co-operatively
owned by the principal daily newspapers of
Britain outside London, and of the Irish
Republic. It offers national and regional
newspapers and broadcasters a comprehensive
range of home news—general and
parliamentary news, legal reports, and all
types of financial, commercial and sports
news. It also includes in its services to
regional papers the world news from Reuters
and Associated Press.
News is sent by satellite from London by
the Press Association, certain items being
available in Dataformat, as camera-ready
copy. Its ‘Newsfile’ operation provides
general news, sports and foreign news on
screen to non-media as well as media clients
by means of telephone and view data
terminals. The photographic department
offers newspapers and broadcasters a daily
service of pictures. The NewsFeatures service
supplies reports of local or special interest
and grants exclusive rights to syndicated
features. It also offers a dial-in graphics
facility, as well as extensive cuttings and
photograph libraries.
Extel Financial
Extel Financial supplies information and
services to financial and business
communities throughout the world. Based in
London, it has a network of offices in Europe
and the United States and direct
representation in Japan and South-East Asia.
Data is collected from all the world’s major
stock exchanges, companies and the
international press. The agency is a major
source of reference material on companies
and securities. It supplies a full range of data
products on international financial matters.
Up-to-the-minute business and company
news is made available by the agency’s
specialist financial news operation.
Other Agencies
The British press and broadcasting
organisations are also catered for by
Associated Press and United Press
International, which are British subsidiaries
of United States news agencies. A number of
other British, Commonwealth and foreign
agencies and news services have offices in
London, and there are minor agencies in
other cities. Syndication of features is not
as common in Britain as in some countries,
but a few agencies specialise in this type
of work.
Training for Journalism
The National Council for the Training of
Journalists (NCTJ), which represents the
principal regional press organisations, sets
421
BRITAIN 1993: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
and conducts examinations, and organises
short training courses for journalists.
The two main methods of entry into
newspaper journalism are selection for a one-
year NCTJ pre-entry course at a college of
further or higher education or direct
recruitment by a regional or local newspaper.
Both types of entrant take part in an
apprenticeship scheme consisting of ‘on-the-
job’ training. Block-release courses, preceded
by a period of distance learning, are provided
for those who have not attended a pre-entry
course. Similar courses exist for press
photographers.
The first undergraduate courses in
journalism in Britain started in late 1991 at
the London College of Printing, at City
University, London, and at the University of
Central Lancashire. Postgraduate diploma
courses in journalism are available at the
University of Wales College of Cardiff; City
University, London; the University of Central
Lancashire; and Strathclyde University/
Glasgow Polytechnic (jointly).
Courses for regional newspapers in such
subjects as newspaper sales, advertising,
industrial relations and management are
provided by the Newspaper Society Training
Service. Some newspaper publishers carry out
journalist training independently of the
NCTJ, awarding their own diplomas. New
national vocational qualifications based on
workplace performance are being developed in
regional newspaper journalism.
Specialist training courses for journalists
and editorial managers from developing
countries are offered by the Thomson
Foundation in Cardiff. The Foundation also
runs training courses in developing countries
and provides consultants to assist newspapers
and magazines in advertising, management,
circulation and the introduction and operation
of new technology. It runs an international
journalism training centre in collaboration
with Xinhua News Agency in Peking.
Through its charitable trust, the Reuter
Foundation, Reuters offers assistance to
overseas journalists to study and train in
Britain, as well as in other parts of Europe,
the United States and the developing world.
The Foundation awards fellowships to
journalists from developing nations to spend
up to one academic year at Oxford
University. It also runs shorter practical
training programmes in London for
journalists from eastern and central Europe;
these cover international news writing and
business news skills.
The Periodicals Training Council is the
official training organisation in periodical
publishing. It offers a range of short courses
covering management, editorial work,
advertisement sales and circulation sales. It
has special responsibility for editorial training
and administers an industry-wide editorial
training scheme for those already in
employment. The postgraduate courses in
journalism at the University of Wales College
of Cardiff and City University, London,
contain periodical journalism options, and the
London College of Printing provides
postgraduate courses and General Certificate
of Education Advanced level courses in
periodical journalism. Reed Business
Publishing, one of the largest publishing
companies, has a company training course for
suitable candidates from the general public on
a fee-paying basis.
Press Institutions
Employers’ organisations include the
Newspaper Publishers Association, whose
members publish national newspapers, and
the Newspaper Society, which represents
1,600 regional and local newspapers in
England, Wales and Northern Ireland. The
Scottish Daily Newspaper Society represents
the interests of daily and Sunday newspapers
in Scotland; the Scottish Newspaper
Publishers’ Association acts on behalf of the
owners of weekly newspapers in Scotland;
and Associated Northern Ireland Newspapers
is made up of proprietors of weekly
newspapers in Northern Ireland. The
membership of the Periodical Publishers
Association includes most independent
publishers of business, professional and
consumer journals.
Organisations representing journalists are
the National Union of Journalists, with over
30,000 members, and the Institute of
Journalists, with about 1,500 members. The
main printing union is the Graphical, Paper

THE PRESS
and Media Union, with a membership of
around 270,000.
The Guild of British Newspaper Editors is
the officially recognised professional body for
newspaper editors. It has approximately 350
members and aims to maintain the
professional status and independence of
editors, defend the freedom of the press, and
improve the education and training of
journalists. The British Association of
Industrial Editors is the professional
organisation for editors of house journals.
The Association of British Editors represents
the whole range of media, including radio,
television, newspapers and magazines.
The main aim of the Foreign Press
Association, formed in 1888, is to help the
correspondents of overseas newspapers in their
work by arranging press conferences, tours,
briefings, and other services and facilities.
Press Conduct
Readers’ representatives have been appointed
by most national papers to handle complaints.
They also help to guarantee standards of
accuracy, fairness and good behaviour on the
part of journalists.
In 1990 a report on privacy and related
matters by a government-appointed
independent committee, under the
chairmanship of Mr (now Sir) David Calcutt,
QC, recommended the formation of a non-
statutory Press Complaints Commission by
the newspaper industry in place of the Press
Council. (The Press Council was a voluntary
non-statutory body set up by the newspaper
industry in 1953 to safeguard press freedom
and ensure that the press conducted itself
responsibly.)
The 1990 Calcutt Report also proposed
creating three new criminal offences of
physical intrusion to obtain personal
information for publication and extending
reporting restrictions on criminal cases so that
the anonymity granted to rape victims would
apply also to victims of other sexual offences.
Press Complaints Commission
The Press Complaints Commission took over
from the Press Council in 1991. Its
membership is drawn from newspaper and
magazine editors as well as from people from
outside the industry. The Commission deals
with complaints by members of the public
about the contents and conduct of British
newspapers and magazines and advises editors
and journalists. It operates a comprehensive
code of practice agreed by editors governing
respect for privacy, opportunity to reply,
corrections, journalists’ behaviour, references
to race and religion, payments to criminals
for articles, and protection of confidential
sources. The Commission publishes monthly
reports of its findings.
The Government indicated that it would
review the effectiveness of press self¬
regulation once the new Press Complaints
Commission had been in operation for 18
months. Now that this period is over, the
Government has asked Sir David Calcutt to
undertake an assessment of how press self¬
regulation has worked in practice since the
committee reported.
Advertising Practice
Advertising in all non-broadcast media such
as newspapers, magazines, posters (and also
direct mail, sales promotions, cinema, and
management of lists and databases) is
regulated by the Advertising Standards
Authority, an independent body funded by a
levy on display advertising expenditure. The
Authority aims to promote and enforce the
highest standards of advertising in the
interests of the public through its supervision
of the British Code of Advertising Practice.
The basic principles of the Code are to
ensure that advertisements:
• are legal, decent, honest and truthful;
• are prepared with a sense of
responsibility to the consumer and
society; and
• conform to the principles of fair
competition as generally accepted in
business.
The Authority includes among its activities
monitoring advertisements to ensure their
compliance with the Code and investigating
complaints received directly from members of
the public and competitors.
423
BRITAIN 1993: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
The advertising industry has agreed to
abide by the Code and to back it up with
effective sanctions. Free and confidential pre¬
publication advice is offered to assist
publishers, agencies and advertisers. The
Authority’s main sanction is the
recommendation that advertisements
considered to be in breach of the Code should
not be published. This is normally sufficient
to ensure that an advertisement is withdrawn
or amended. The Authority also publishes
monthly reports on the results of its
investigations, naming the companies
involved.
The Authority is recognised by the Office
of Fair Trading as being the established
means of controlling non-broadcast
advertising. The Authority can refer
misleading advertisements to the Director
General of Fair Trading, who has the power
to seek an injunction to prevent their
publication.
The Press and the Law
The press generally has the same freedom as
the individual to comment on matters of
public interest. No specific press laws are in
operation, but certain statutes include sections
which apply to the press.
There are laws governing:
• the extent of newspaper ownership in
television and radio companies
(see p 417);
• the transfer of newspaper assets
(see p 417);
• restrictions on reporting certain types of
court proceedings and on publishing
material likely to stir up racial hatred;
and
• the right of press representatives to be
admitted to meetings of local authorities.
Publication of advertisement and
investment circulars is governed by laws
dealing with the publication of false or
misleading descriptions of goods and services
and with fraud. Advertisements for remedies
for certain diseases are covered by public
health legislation. Legal restrictions are
imposed on certain types of prize
competition; copyrights come under various
copyright laws.
Of particular relevance to the press are
laws on contempt of court, official secrets
and defamation. A newspaper may not
publish comments on the conduct of judicial
proceedings which are likely to prejudice the
reputation of the courts for fairness before or
during the actual proceedings, nor may it
publish before or during a trial anything
which might tend to influence the result. The
unauthorised acquisition and publication of
official information in such areas as defence
and international relations are offences under
the Official Secrets Acts 1911 to 1989 where
unauthorised disclosure would be harmful
(see below).
Most legal proceedings against the press
are libel actions brought by private
individuals. In such cases, the editor,
proprietor, publishers, printer and distributor
of the newspaper, as well as the author, may
all be held responsible.
There is a legal requirement to reproduce
‘the printer’s imprint’ (the printer’s name and
address) on all publications, including
newspapers. Publishers are legally obliged to
deposit copies of newspapers and other
publications at the British Library.
Defence Notices
Government officials and representatives of
the media form the Defence, Press and
Broadcasting Committee, which has agreed
that in some circumstances the publication of
certain categories of information might
endanger national security. Details of these
categories are contained in Defence Notices
(D Notices) circulated to the media, whose
members are asked to seek advice from the
Secretary of the Committee, a retired senior
military officer, before publishing information
in these areas. Compliance with any advice
offered by the Secretary is expected but there
is no legal force behind it and the final
decision on whether to publish rests with the
editor, producer or publisher concerned.
424
24 Television and Radio
Broadcasting in Britain has traditionally been
based on the principle that it is a public
service accountable to the people through
Parliament. While retaining the essential
public service element, it is now also
embracing the principles of competition and
choice.
Three public bodies—the British
Broadcasting Corporation (BBC), the
Independent Television Commission (ITC)
and the Radio Authority—have the main
responsibility for television and radio services
throughout Britain:
• the BBC broadcasts television and radio
programmes;
• the ITC licenses and regulates non-BBC
television services, including cable and
satellite services; and
• the Radio Authority licenses and
regulates all non-BBC radio services.
These authorities work to broad
requirements and objectives defined by
Parliament, but are otherwise independent in
the conduct of their day-to-day business.
The government department responsible
for overseeing the broadcasting system is the
Department of National Heritage, which was
set up in April 1992, taking over the
broadcasting responsibilities previously
exercised by the Home Office. The Secretary
of State for National Heritage is answerable
to Parliament on broad policy questions.
Television
Television viewing is by far Britain’s most
popular leisure pastime: 95 per cent of
households have a colour television set and 68
per cent have a video recorder. Average
viewing time for each person is around 24
hours a week.
At present there are four terrestrial
television channels, offering a mixture of
drama, light entertainment, films, sport,
children’s and religious programmes, news
and current affairs, documentaries and
educational programmes. The BBC provides
two complementary networks—BBC 1 and
BBC 2—which are financed almost
exclusively by licence fees. The ITC
regulates two television services: ITV and
Channel 4, which are expected to
complement each other and are largely
funded by advertising. (In Wales Sianel
Pedwar Cymru—S4C—broadcasts
programmes on the Welsh fourth channel.)
All four channels broadcast on 625 lines
UHF (ultra-high frequency). Over 99 per
cent of the population live within range of
transmission.
British television productions continue to
win many international awards, and in 1990
television companies received £138 million in
export earnings.
Radio
Practically every home has a radio set, and
the widespread ownership of portable sets
and car radios means that people can listen
to radio throughout the day. The BBC has
five national networks, which transmit all
types of music, news, current affairs, drama,
education, sport and a broad range of
feature programmes. The first national
commercial radio station, Classic FM, began
broadcasting in September 1992 and two
other national independent stations are
planned.
There are 39 BBC local radio stations
serving England and the Channel Islands, and
regional and community radio services in
Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. Some
425
BRITAIN 1993: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
140 independent local radio (ILR) services
are also available to local communities
throughout Britain. Further local stations are
planned. Stations supply a comprehensive
service of local news and information, music
and other entertainment, education, consumer
advice and coverage of local events. ‘Phone-
in’ programmes allowing listeners to express
their views on air are popular. About 90 per
cent of the population is within range of BBC
or ILR stations.
Broadcasting Complaints Commission
The Broadcasting Complaints Commission,
an independent statutory body, deals with
complaints of unfair treatment in broadcast
programmes and of unwarranted infringement
of privacy in programmes or in their
preparation. In 1991-92 it received 1,048
complaints. Details of complaints made and
decisions reached are published annually.
Government Approach to Broadcasting
During the last few years broadcasting in
Britain has seen radical changes. The
availability of more radio frequencies,
together with satellite, cable and microwave
transmissions, has made a greater number of
local, national and international services
possible. Moreover, the technical quality of
sound and pictures is improving. In response
to rapidly developing technology and rising
public demand for a wider choice of
programmes and services, the Government
introduced the Broadcasting Act 1990 with
the aim of making the regulatory framework
for broadcasting more flexible and efficient
and giving viewers and listeners access to a
broader range of services. At the same time
the Act aims to promote increased
competition and to maintain high standards
of taste and decency.
The 1990 Act takes full account of the
need for programme quality and diversity,
regional links, widespread ownership of
broadcasting companies and proper
geographical coverage, and makes provision
for ‘sharply focused statutory safeguards’
backed by enforcement sanctions, including
financial penalties.
Changes introduced by the Broadcasting
Act 1990
The Broadcasting Act 1990 overhauled the
regulation of independent television and radio
and allowed the introduction of additional
services.
In 1991 the Independent Broadcasting
Authority (IBA) was replaced by the
Independent Television Commission, the
Radio Authority and a new transmission
and engineering company (National
Transcommunications Limited—see below),
which is now wholly privately owned. At the
same time the Cable Authority, set up in
1984, was made part of the ITC.
The ITC and the Radio Authority issue
licences to commercial broadcasters and
enforce rules to ensure diversity of
ownership:
• The ITC awards major broadcasting
licences by competitive tender to the
highest bidders satisfying stipulated
quality tests.
• The Radio Authority awards national
radio licences by competitive tender to
the highest cash bidders. Local radio
licences are not allocated by competitive
tender; the success of licence applications
is in part determined by audience
demand and the extent to which
prospective stations would increase
variety.
Both organisations were initially able to
take out government loans, but are obliged to
repay these and to support themselves from
licence fees within three years. Although
regulation is light, rules are enforced so that
ownership remains widely spread and undue
concentrations and cross-media ownership are
kept in check.
The ITC has advertised a new national
independent television station, Channel 5,
and is considering the single bid received for
it. Three national commercial radio stations
are being established. Opportunities also exist
for launching hundreds of independent local
radio and television channels. Provision was
made in the Broadcasting Act for the former
IBA’s television and radio transmission
networks to be privatised. In 1991 the IBA
426
TELEVISION AND RADIO
networks and other facilities were transferred
to a new public company—National
Transcommunications Limited (NTL). NTL
has been sold for £70 million to a new
company formed for the purpose by Mercury
Asset Management. NTL transmits television
services for the independent television
companies, Channel 4, S4C, and radio
services for about 50 independent local radio
stations.
Programming Obligations
The Government recognises the importance
of public service broadcasting. Hence:
• the 1990 Act made no change to the
BBC’s ‘cornerstone’ public service role of
providing high-quality programming
throughout the full range of public tastes
and interests; the essential programming
remits of all BBC domestic services
remain unchanged.
• Channel 4—in addition to retaining
public service obligations—is, as before,
required to be innovative and distinctive,
and to cater for tastes and interests not
adequately met by ITV and its successor
Channel 3 (see p 430). Three of the four
current terrestrial television channels
have, therefore, the same basic
programming obligations as before the
passage of the Act.
• Licence-holders of the newr independent
television Channels 3 and 5 will need to
pass demanding quality tests. A ‘proper
proportion’ of programme material will
have to come from Britain and other
European countries. Between them,
Channels 3, 4 and 5 will need to cater
adequately for schools programmes. The
Act also requires those running television
services on the proposed Channel 3
service to provide sufficient time for
religious programmes.
• By 1993 both the BBC and commercial
television licensees will be required to
ensure that a minimum of 25 per cent of
their original programming comes from
independent producers. The system
whereby major sporting occasions (‘listed
events’), such as the Grand National
steeplechase and the Olympic Games, are
made generally available to television
audiences on the main terrestrial channels
is to be retained.
Programme Standards
Recognising that television and radio are
powerful media with the potential to offend,
exploit and cause harm, the Act contains
guarantees on programme standards which
are extended to all British-based broadcasters.
These guarantees cover taste, decency,
accuracy and balance. Under the 1990 Act
the Government can proscribe unacceptable
foreign satellite services receivable in Britain.
Anyone in Britain supporting such a service
can now be prosecuted for a criminal offence.
The Act also gives the Broadcasting
Standards Council a key role (see p 434).
Ownership Rules
In order to enjoy high standards and
diversity, the Government believes that it is
necessary to have ownership rules. The Act
establishes clearer and more extensive rules.
Controlling ownership from outside the
European Community is largely prohibited
and national newspapers are allowed relatively
small stakes in direct broadcasting by satellite
(DBS) channels (see p 432), Channels 3
and 5, and national and local radio.
The BBC
The constitution and finances of the BBC are
governed by a Royal Charter, which expires
in December 1996, and by a Licence and
Agreement. The Corporation’s board of 12
governors, including the chairman, vice-
chairman and national governors for
Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, is
appointed by the Queen on the advice of the
Government. The board of governors is
responsible for all aspects of broadcasting on
the BBC. The governors appoint the
Director-General, the Corporation’s chief
executive officer, who heads the board of
management, the body in charge of the daily
running of the services.
The BBC has a strong regional structure.
427
BRITAIN 1993: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
The three English regions—BBC North,
BBC Midlands & East and BBC South—and
the Scottish, Welsh and Northern Ireland
national regions make programmes for their
local audiences as well as contributing to the
national network. The National Broadcasting
Councils for Scotland, Wales and Northern
Ireland give advice on the policy and content
of television and radio programmes intended
mainly for reception in their areas. Local
radio councils representative of the local
community advise on the development and
operation of the BBC’s local radio stations.
Finance
The domestic services of the BBC are
financed principally from the sale of
television licences. Households with television
must buy an annual licence costing £80 for
colour and £26-50 for black and white. Over
19-6 million licences were current in April
1992; of these about 18-4 million were for
colour. More than two-thirds of expenditure
on domestic services relates to television.
Licence income is supplemented by profits
from trading activities, such as television
programme exports, sale of recordings and
publications connected with BBC
programmes, hire and sale of educational
films, film library sales, and exhibitions based
on programmes. The BBC meets the cost of
its local radio stations. BBC World Service
radio is financed by a grant-in-aid from the
Foreign & Commonwealth Office, while
BBC World Service television is self-funding.
The BBC has set up a subscription
television service, BBC SELECT,
providing a range of specialist
subscription services, transmitted
during the night. Services are ‘down¬
loaded’ onto video recorders fitted
with decoders. Emphasis is placed on
education, training and updating, and
the service will form part of the newly
created BBC Education Directorate.
The existing services are aimed
mainly at the corporate sector, but
services for the home user are
planned. Most services are provided by
outside companies.
In 1991 the BBC took over from the
Home Office responsibility for administering
the television licensing system. Since 1988
annual rises in the licence fee have been
linked to the rate of inflation; this is intended
further to improve the BBC’s efficiency and
encourage it to continue to develop
alternative sources of revenue. A review to
assess progress will be made before 1994. The
longer-term future funding of the BBC will
be considered as part of the Charter Review.
BBC Television
Apart from a break during the second world
war (1939^15) the BBC has made regular
television broadcasts since 1936. Together,
BBC 1 and BBC 2 transmit over 17,000
hours of programmes a year for national and
regional audiences.
Programmes for both networks are
produced in London; a third of all
programmes shown nationally are made in
the regions. Both the BBC and the
commercial television companies enter into
agreements with overseas television
corporations in order to make new
programmes economically.
Through co-ordinated planning of its two
services the BBC caters simultaneously for
people of different interests. Although both
services cover the w hole range of television
output:
• BBC 1 presents a w ide range of
programmes, including popular drama
and light entertainment, sport, news and
current affairs, major documentaries and
children’s programmes.
• BBC 2 presents music and the arts, new
talent and ideas, innovative docu¬
mentaries, sport, international fdms and
serious drama, and is a forum for debate.
BBC National Radio
The BBC’s five national radio stations are:
• BBC Radio 1, broadcasting rock and pop
music 24 hours a day;
• BBC Radio 2 (on FM only), transmitting
popular music and light entertainment,
also for 24 hours a day;
428
TELEVISION AND RADIO
• BBC Radio 3 (also on FM only),
broadcasting mainly classical music, but
also presenting jazz, drama, poetry, and
short stories and talks;
• BBC Radio 4, the main speech network,
providing the principal news and current
affairs service, together with drama,
comedy, documentaries and panel
games—it also carries parliamentary
coverage; and
• BBC Radio 5 (on medium wave only),
which is devoted chiefly to sport, educa¬
tion and programmes for young people.
Independent Broadcasting
Independent Television Commission
Like the Radio Authority and S4C, the ITC’s
constitution and finances are governed by the
Broadcasting Act 1990. The ITC is
responsible for licensing and regulating non-
BBC television services operating in or from
Britain. These include:
• ITV and its successor, Channel 3;
• Channel 4;
• the proposed Channel 5;
• cable and other local delivery services;
• independent teletext services; and
• domestic and non-domestic satellite
services available to viewers in Britain.
The ITC is advised by committees on
educational broadcasting, religious broad¬
casting, charitable appeals and advertising.
Viewer consultative councils also comment on
the commercial services’ programmes.
Until December 1992, when the present
ITV franchises (see below) end, the ITC will
continue to fulfil the IBA’s obligations
towards the ITV programme contracts. It will
be legally responsible for broadcasting
programmes shown on ITV, Channel 4 and
by DBS services.
From 1993, when the new Channel 3
licences begin, the ITC will not broadcast or
‘publish’ programmes. These responsibilities
will be passed to the new licensees. The
ITC will supervise with a ‘light touch’ in that
it will not be involved in detailed scheduling
of programmes. It has wider powers than the
IBA to enforce licence conditions and rules
designed to limit cross-media ownership and
excessive concentration of ownership (see
P 427).
ITV Programme Companies
At present 15 independent (ITV) companies
hold contracts to supply programmes in the
14 independent television geographical
regions. Two companies share the contract
for London, one providing programmes
during weekdays and the other at the
weekend. A contract for a national early
morning service, transmitted on the ITV
network, is held by an additional company.
The companies operate on a commercial
basis, deriving most of their revenue from the
sale of advertising time. The financial
resources, advertising revenue and
programme production of the companies vary
considerably, depending largely on the size of
population in the areas in which they operate.
Although newspapers may acquire an interest
in programme companies, there are
safeguards to ensure against concentration of
media ownership, thereby protecting the
public interest.
Each programme company plans the
content of the programmes to be broadcast in
its area. These are produced by the company
itself, or by other programme companies or
bought from elsewhere. The five largest
companies—two serving London and three
serving north-west England, the Midlands
and Yorkshire—supply more programmes for
broadcast elsewhere on the national network
than do the smaller ones.
A common news service is provided 24
hours a day by Independent Television News
(ITN).
ITV Programmes
The first regular ITV programmes began
in London in 1955. ITV programmes are
broadcast 24 hours a day in all parts of the
country. About one-third of the output
comprises informative programmes—news,
documentaries, and programmes on current
affairs, education and religion. The remainder
429
BRITAIN 1993: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
cover sport, comedy, drama, game shows,
films, and a range of other programmes with
popular appeal. Over half the programmes are
produced by the programme companies and
ITN.
Channel 3
Under the 1990 x\ct the ITV system will be
replaced by Channel 3 in January 1993. The
new channel will be made up of 15 regionally
based licensees of the ITC and an additional
ITC licensee providing a national breakfast¬
time programme. Licences for Channel 3
were awarded by the ITC in October 1991.
Twelve existing franchise holders and four
new companies were awarded licences.
Licences are awarded for a ten-year period
by competitive tender to the highest bidder
who has passed a quality threshold; in
exceptional cases a lower bid can be selected.
Such circumstances might include those
where an applicant is able to offer a
significantly better quality of service than that
offered by the highest bidder.
There are substantial safeguards for
quality programming. Licensees are required
to offer a diverse programme service and a
proportion of good-quality programmes, as
well as high-quality regional and national
news and current affairs programmes and
children’s and religious programmes. There is
also a requirement for district and regional
programming to be aimed at different areas
within regions. Channel 3 licensees will be
obliged to operate a national programme
network. Networking arrangements are to be
subject to government approval so that anti¬
competitive practices are avoided.
ITN has been appointed to supply a
service of national and international news to
Channel 3 for a ten-year period starting in
January 1993.
Channel 4 and S4C
Channel 4, currently a subsidiary of the ITC,
began broadcasting in 1982. It provides a
national television service throughout Britain,
except in Wales, which has a corresponding
service—Sianel Pedwar Cymru (S4C). It is
required to present programmes that are
complementary to those of ITV, appealing to
tastes and interests not normally catered for
by the original independent service.
Channel 4 must present a suitable
proportion of educational programmes and
encourage innovation and experiment. It
commissions programmes from the ITC
companies and independent producers and
buys programmes in the international market.
Channel 4 broadcasts for approximately 139
hours a week, about half of which are
devoted to informative programmes. At
present the service, including that in Wales,
is financed by annual subscriptions from the
ITV programme companies in return for
advertising time in fourth channel
programmes broadcast in their own regions.
In Wales programmes on the fourth
channel are run and controlled by S4C.
Under the Broadcasting Act 1990 S4C
became a broadcaster in its own right. Its
members are appointed by the Government.
S4C is required to see that a significant
proportion of programming, in practice 23
hours a week, is in the Welsh language and
that programmes broadcast between 18-30
and 22 00 hours are mainly in Welsh. At
other times S4C transmits national Channel 4
programmes.
Under the 1990 Act the distinctive remit
of Channel 4 and S4C has been strengthened
and the services are guaranteed by special
arrangements to protect revenue levels. From
January 1993:
• Channel 4 is to become a public
corporation, licensed and regulated by
the ITC, selling its own advertising time
and retaining the proceeds; and
• S4C will be financed by the Government
rather than by a levy from ITV.
Plans for Gaelic Television
The Gaelic Television Committee appointed
by the ITC has been set up, under the
Broadcasting Act 1990, to administer
government funds to finance the making of
television programmes in Gaelic. A fund of
£9-5 million has been created and
programmes thus financed will come on
screen from January 1993.
430
TELEVISION AND RADIO
Channel 5
A new national terrestrial television channel—
Channel 5—was advertised in April 1992.
The ten-year franchise will be awarded by
competitive tender subject to a quality
threshold. The new channel will have similar,
though less stringent, programming
requirements to Channel 3, although it will
not be required to show either regional or
local programmes. The coverage of the
service may be developed in stages, and the
licensee will be required to retune domestic
electronic equipment which suffers
interference from Channel 5 transmission.
The ITC received one bid, from Channel 5
Holdings Ltd. If the applicant’s plans pass
the quality threshold, the service is expected
to come on air in late 1994. Owing to limited
frequency availability Channel 5 will cover a
predicted maximum of 75 per cent of
households.
Local Television
The Broadcasting Act 1990 makes provision
for the further development of local television
services. Local delivery licences will be
awarded by competitive tender and there will
be no quality threshold. ITC licence-holders
will be able to supply national and local
television channels using both cable and
microwave transmission systems. Services
delivered could include Channel 5 in parts of
the country where it was not available on
UHF. Other services could be aimed at
communities such as ethnic minorities.
Radio Authority
The underlying principles of independent
local radio (ILR) are similar to those of ITV
(see p 429). The programme companies
operate under licence to the Radio Authority
and are financed mainly by advertising
revenue. Licences for existing operators will
expire between 1994 and 1996.
The Radio Authority took over
responsibility for independent radio from the
IBA in 1991. Like the ITC, it supervises with
a light touch. The Authority is required to
ensure that licensed services, taken as a
whole, are of a high quality and offer a range
of programmes calculated to appeal to a
variety of tastes and interests. Powers to
deter ‘pirate’ or illegal broadcasters have been
strengthened.
The Authority is allocating licences by
competitive tender for up to three national
commercial radio services. One of these must
be speech-based and another has to include a
large proportion of music that is not pop
music.
• The licence for the first independent
national radio service (INR1) was
awarded to Classic FM in 1991. The new
station, which broadcasts mainly popular
classical music, together with relevant
news and information, began operating in
September 1992.
• The licence for the second independent
national radio service (INR2) was
awarded in early 1992 to Independent
Music Radio. This station, which aims to
be on the air by early 1993, will play
broad-based rock music. The station will
reach about 85 per cent of the population.
• The licence for the third national service
(INR3), which must be speech-based,
will be advertised within the next two
years.
In the course of the 1990s more new
stations will come on the air, some of which
could be neighbourhood and community-
interest stations. Areas to be covered will
initially be those at present unserved or only
marginally served by ILR. Local audience
demand and the extent to which the service
could broaden the variety of local
programmes will affect local licence
allocation.
Some of the locations have been selected
with small-scale ‘community radio’ in mind.
As part of its brief to develop a wide range of
radio services, the Authority aims to establish
a number of stations which will be smaller in
size, and/or more specialist in their output,
than other commercial radio services. The
first to go on the air, in 1989, was Sunset
Radio, aimed at Manchester’s multi-cultural
population. Jazz FM became the first of the
new London music stations, starting up in
1990.
431
BRITAIN 1993: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Teletext
The BBC and independent television each
operate a teletext service, offering constantly
updated information on a variety of subjects,
including news, sport, travel, local weather
conditions and entertainment. The teletext
system allows the television signal to carry
additional information which can be selected
and displayed as ‘pages’ of text and graphics
on receivers equipped with the necessary
decoders. Both Ceefax, the BBC’s service,
and Oracle, the independent television’s
service, have a subtitling facility on certain
programmes for people with hearing
difficulties. Both services are available
whenever the transmitters are on the air.
Nearly 40 per cent of households in Britain
have teletext sets and over 7 million people
turn to the service daily: more than most
daily newspapers. The Broadcasting Act 1990
introduced a new regulatory system for
licensing spare capacity within the television
signal. This allows more varied use of spare
capacity—data transfer, for instance—but the
position of teletext on commercial television
is safeguarded.
At the end of 1991 the ITC advertised
three teletext licences—a single public service
licence for teletext on Channels 3 and 4 (and
S4C) and two separate licences for
commercial additional services to subscription
or closed user groups. It awarded the main
teletext licence to UK Teletext Ltd, which
will replace Oracle from 1 January 1993, and
awarded one of the commercial additional
service licences to the only bidder, Data
Broadcasting International. The proposed
Channels 3 and 5 will be obliged to offer a
subtitling service for at least 50 per cent of
their programmes by 1998, with further
increases after that.
Cable Services
Cable services are delivered to consumers by
means of underground cables and are
normally paid for by subscription. Until 1991
the cable industry was regulated by the Cable
Authority, which was responsible for issuing
licences, supervising programme services and
promoting cable development. These
responsibilities are now carried out by the
Cable Division of the ITC. At the time of
the handover of responsibilities in 1991, the
Authority had awarded 135 new broadband
(multichannel) cable franchises, varying in
size from 121,000 homes to nearly 500,000.
‘Broadband cable’, the cable systems
currently being designed and built, can carry
between 30 and 45 television channels,
including terrestrial broadcasts, satellite
television, and channels delivered by
videotape. Cable systems usually carry a local
channel. Interactive services such as home
shopping, home banking, security and alarm
services, electronic mail and remote meter
readings are also possible. Franchises have
already been granted covering areas which
include two-thirds of all homes and nearly all
urban areas in Britain, around 14-5 million
households in total. Regulation is as light as
possible to encourage the development of a
wide range of services and facilities, and
flexible enough to adapt to changing
technology. The ITC is continuing the Cable
Authority’s practice of awarding only one
broadband cable franchise in any given area
so that the new franchisee is protected from
direct competition in the early stages. At
present over L3 million homes are able to
receive broadband cable services and there
are nearly 270,000 subscribers. Following a
review of telecommunications policy, cable
operators are now allowed to provide
telephony services, a factor which has
increased the rate of take-up of services.
Licences are granted, on a non¬
competitive basis, to programme services
which are likely to meet consumer protection
standards and are run by suitably qualified
people.
Broadcasting by Satellite
Direct broadcasting by satellite, by which
television pictures are transmitted directly by
satellite into people’s homes, has been
available throughout Britain since 1989. The
signals from satellite broadcasting are
receivable using specially designed aerials or
‘dishes’ and associated reception equipment.
Several British-based satellite television
channels have been set up to supply
432
TELEVISION AND RADIO
programmes to cable operators in Britain and,
in many cases, throughout Europe. While
some offer general entertainment, others
concentrate on specific areas of interest, such
as sport, music and children’s programmes.
British Sky Broadcasting (BSkyB) carries
channels devoted to light entertainment,
news, feature films and sport, transmitted
from the Astra and Marcopolo satellites. Each
Astra satellite can transmit 16 channels,
simultaneously. Two satellites are operational
so far, with more planned, and provide about
18 channels in English. Other channels
broadcast sport, general entertainment for
women, and a service for children. MTV is a
pop video channel. The Marcopolo satellite
carries BSkyB broadcasts made under
contract to the ITC on the five DBS channels
allocated to Britain under international
agreement. BSkyB will cease broadcasts from
Marcopolo at the end of 1992.
Recent Developments
In February 1992 the BBC announced plans
to launch a 24-hour subscription news service
transmitted from the Astra satellite. Coverage
of domestic and overseas news and current
affairs would be linked to the BBC World
Service Television Channel (see p 436) to
create a low-cost service. Work on the new
service is expected to start in 1993.
BBC Enterprises and Thames TV, one of
the present independent programme
companies, intend to launch a joint
entertainment satellite channel—UK Gold—
on the Astra satellite. The service, which will
broadcast for 20 hours a day, is due to start
in November 1992. The service will be free
to all satellite viewers.
Educational Broadcasting
Both the BBC and independent television
broadcast educational programmes for schools
and continuing education programmes for
adults. Broadcasts to schools deal with most
subjects of the National Curriculum, while
education programmes for adults cover many
fields of learning and vocational training.
Supporting material, in the form of books,
pamphlets, filmstrips, computer software, and
audio and video cassettes, is available to
supplement the programmes.
Each year the BBC Open University
Production Centre produces around 350 radio
and audio programmes and 200 television and
video programmes made specially for
students of the Open University (see p 163).
The Centre also produces educational and
training video materials in collaboration with
external agencies such as the Department of
Trade and Industry and the Department for
Education.
The ITC has a duty to ensure that schools
programmes are presented on independent
television.
Advertising and Sponsorship
The BBC does not give publicity to any firm
or organised interest except when this is
necessary for providing effective and
informative programmes. It must not
broadcast any commercial advertisement or
any sponsored programme; it may, however,
cover sponsored sporting and artistic events.
Advertising and sponsorship are allowed
on independent television and radio subject
to controls. Codes of advertising standards
and programme sponsorship covering
commercial television and radio are operated
by the ITC and the Radio Authority.
Advertising
Advertisements are broadcast on independent
television and radio between programmes as
well as in breaks during programmes.
Advertisers are not allowed directly to
influence programme content or editorial
control. In television, food manufacturers and
retailers are the largest category of
advertisers.
Advertisements must be clearly
distinguishable and separate from
programmes. The time given to them must
not be so great as to detract from the value of
the programmes as a medium of information,
education or entertainment. Television
advertising is limited to an average of seven
minutes an hour throughout the day and
seven and a half minutes in the peak evening
viewing period. Advertising is prohibited in
433
BRI TAIN 1993: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
religious services and in broadcasts to
schools. Independent television’s teletext
service (see p 432) carries paginated
advertisements.
The ITC and the Radio Authority’s codes
governing standards and practice in
advertising give guidance on the types and
methods of advertisement which are
prohibited; these include political advertising,
advertisements for betting and—on television
—tobacco advertising. (Advertisements for
cigars and pipe tobacco are permitted on
radio.) At present, religious advertising is not
allowed on ITV, Channel 4 and some satellite
services. On other services it is allowed
provided it complies with the Radio
Authority’s code on religious advertising.
From 1993 Channels 3 and 4 will be allowed
to screen religious advertisements, subject to
the ITC codes.
Both the ITC and the Radio Authority
can prevent transmission of advertisements
which they consider misleading. The
Broadcasting Standards Council’s code of
practice (see below) covers advertisements.
Sponsorship
In Britain sponsorship is a relatively new way
of helping to finance commercial television
and radio programmes, although the practice
has long been established in other countries.
In return for their financial contribution,
sponsors receive a credit associating them
with a particular programme.
The ITC’s sponsorship code takes as its
guiding principle the safeguarding of
programme integrity. News and current
affairs programmes may not be sponsored. In
the case of other programmes, sponsorship is
not allowed where there might be a clash of
interests. References to sponsors or their
products have to be confined to the
beginning and end of a programme and
around commercial breaks; they must not
appear in the programme itself. All
commercial radio programmes other than
news bulletins can be sponsored.
Government Publicity
Government publicity material to support
non-political campaigns may be broadcast on
independent radio and television. This is paid
for on a normal commercial basis. Short
public service items, concerning health, safety
and welfare, are produced by the Central
Office of Information for free transmission by
the BBC and independent television and
radio.
Broadcasting Standards
The independence enjoyed by the
broadcasting authorities carries with it certain
obligations towards programmes and
programme content. Programmes must
display, as far as possible, a proper balance
and wide range of subject matter, impartiality
in matters of controversy and accuracy in
news coverage, and must not offend against
good taste. Broadcasters must also comply
with legislation relating to obscenity and
incitement to racial hatred.
The BBC and the other regulatory
authorities apply codes providing guidance
on violence and standards of taste and
decency in television programmes,
particularly during hours when children are
likely to be viewing.
Broadcasting Standards Council
The Broadcasting Standards Council was set
up by the Government to act as a focus for
public concern about the portrayal of violence
and sex, and about standards of taste and
decency. Its remit covers television and radio
programmes and broadcast advertisements. A
code of practice has been drawn up by the
Council on these matters. It monitors
programmes, examines complaints from the
public and undertakes research. In 1991-92
the Council received 2,662 complaints, of
which 1,130 fell within its remit. It has
already published the results of several public
attitude surveys.
Under the Broadcasting Act 1990 the
Council has been granted statutory powers
which require the codes of practice of the
BBC and other broadcasting regulatory
bodies to reflect the Council’s own code.
Programmes broadcast to Britain from abroad
are monitored by the Council.

TELEVISION AND RADIO
Parliamentary and Political
Broadcasting
The proceedings of both Houses of
Parliament may be broadcast on television
and radio, either live, or more usually in
recorded and edited form on news and
current affairs programmes.
The proceedings of the House of
Commons have been televised since 1989.
They are produced by an independent
company appointed by the House of
Commons, which makes television pictures
available to the BBC, ITN and other
approved broadcasters for use in news and
current affairs programmes. House of Lords
proceedings have been televised since 1985.
The BBC and the commercial services
provide time on radio and television for an
annual series of party political broadcasts.
Party election broadcasts are arranged
following the announcement of a general
election. In addition, the Government may
make ministerial broadcasts on radio and
television, with opposition parties also being
allotted broadcast time.
Audience Research
Both the BBC and the independent sector are
required to keep themselves informed on the
state of public opinion about the programmes
and advertising which they broadcast. This is
done through the continuous measurement of
the size and composition of audiences and
their opinions of programmes. For television,
this work is undertaken through BARB (the
Broadcasters’ Audience Research Board),
which is owned jointly by the BBC and the
Independent Television Association (the trade
association for the ITV companies). For
radio, joint research is now undertaken for
BBC radio and for commercial radio by
RAJAR (Radio Joint Audience Research).
Both the BBC and the independent sector
conduct regular surveys to gauge audience
opinion on television and radio services.
Public opinion is further assessed by the BBC
and ITC through the work of their advisory
committees, councils and panels. Regular
public meetings are also held to debate
services, and careful consideration is given to
correspondence and telephone calls from
listeners and viewers.
BBC World Service Radio
The BBC World Service broadcasts by radio
worldwide, using English and 37 other
languages, for 820 hours a week. The main
objectives are to give unbiased news, reflect
British opinion and project British life,
culture and developments in science and
industry. News bulletins, current affairs
programmes, political commentaries and
topical magazine programmes form the main
part of the output. These are supplemented
by a sports service, music, drama and general
entertainment. Regular listeners are estimated
to number 120 million.
The languages in which the World Service
broadcasts and the length of time each is on
the air are prescribed by the Government.
Otherwise the BBC has full responsibility and
is completely independent in determining the
content of news and other programmes.
There are broadcasts by radio for 24 hours
a day in English, supplemented at peak
listening times by programmes of special
interest to Africa, East Asia, South Asia,
Europe, the Caribbean and the Falkland
Islands.
BBC World Service news bulletins and
other programmes are re-broadcast by some
450 radio and cable stations in over 80
countries, which receive the programmes by
satellite. Two World Service departments
also specialise in supplying radio material for
re-broadcast. BBC Transcription sells
recordings to more than 100 countries, while
BBC Topical Tapes airmails some 250 tapes
of original programmes to subscribers in over
50 countries each week.
BBC English is the most extensive
language-teaching venture in the world.
English lessons are broadcast daily by radio
with explanations in some 30 languages,
including English, and re-broadcast by many
radio stations. BBC English television
programmes are also shown in more than 90
countries. A range of printed, audio and video
material accompanies these programmes.
Another part of the World Service, BBC
Monitoring, listens to and reports on foreign
435
BRITAIN 1993: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
broadcasts, providing a daily flow of
significant news and comment from overseas
to the BBC and the Government. This
information is also sold to the press, private
sector companies, academic staff and public
bodies.
BBC World Service Television
BBC World Service Television was set up in
1991 to establish a worldwide television
service. The BBC has generated its own
funding for this operation. The company at
present provides three services:
• a subscription channel in Europe, based
on a mixture of BBC 1 and BBC 2
programmes, news bulletins, and weather
and business reports. Viewers receive the
service by cable or direct to their homes,
using special decoders.
• a 24-hour news and information channel
which is available throughout Asia,
launched in November 1991. Funded by
advertising, the service is one of the
channels offered throughout Asia by the
commercial company STAR TV. The
channel is compiled by the BBC and
transmitted by satellite to the ground
station in Hong Kong, where advertising
is added by STAR TV before
distribution.
• a news and information channel in Africa,
launched in April 1992. The service is
available to viewers who have the
appropriate satellite reception equipment
and in countries where national
broadcasters make the service part of
their regular output.
COI Overseas Radio and Television
Services
The Central Office of Information (COI),
which provides publicity material and other
information services on behalf of government
departments and other public agencies,
produces radio programmes for overseas. A
wide range of recorded material is sent to
radio stations all over the world. COI
television services make available material
such as documentary and magazine
programmes for distribution to overseas
stations.
News Agencies
Visnews is the largest television news agency
in the world, supplying world news pictures
to over 650 broadcasters in 84 countries and
running a network of bureaux in major cities
throughout the world. Reuters is the majority
shareholder in the company. Worldwide
Television News, owned by ITN, the
American Broadcasting Corporation and
Channel 9 in Australia, supplies news and a
wide range of television services to some
1,000 broadcasters in 93 countries, as well
as to governments and international
corporations. Both agencies provide services
through the Eurovision network (see below)
and by satellite.
International Relations
European Agreements
In 1991 Britain implemented two important
European agreements on cross-border
broadcasting: the European Community
Directive on Broadcasting and the Council of
Europe Convention on Transfrontier
Television. Under these, countries have to
remove restrictions on the retransmission of
programmes originating from other
participating countries. They must also
ensure that their own broadcasters observe
certain minimum standards on advertising,
sponsorship, taste and decency and the
portrayal of sex and violence on television.
European Broadcasting Union
The BBC, the ITC (until the end of 1992,
when it ceases to be a broadcaster) and the
Radio Authority are members of the
European Broadcasting Union, which
manages Eurovision, the international
network of television news and programme
exchange. The Union is responsible for the
technical and administrative arrangements for
co-ordinating the exchange of programmes
and news over the Eurovision network and
intercontinental satellite links. It also
436
TELEVISION AND RADIO
maintains a technical monitoring station
where frequency measurements and other
observations on broadcasting stations are
carried out. The Union provides a forum
linking the major public services and national
broadcasters of Western Europe and other
parts of the world, and co-ordinates joint
operations in radio and television.
International Telecommunications Union
The BBC, ITC and Radio Authority
participate in the work of the International
Telecommunications Union, the United
Nations agency responsible for regulating and
controlling all international
telecommunications services, including radio
and television. It also allocates and registers
all radio frequencies, and promotes and
co-ordinates the international study of
technical problems in broadcasting.
Other International Bodies
The BBC, the ITC (until the end of 1992)
and the Radio Authority are associate
members of the Asia-Pacific Broadcasting
Union, and the BBC also belongs to the
Commonwealth Broadcasting Association,
whose members meet every two years to
discuss public service broadcasting issues.
Training
The BBC provides non-financial technical
assistance, particularly in training the staff of
overseas broadcasting organisations. The
Government finances overseas students on
broadcasting training courses at the BBC,
British Council and the Thomson Foundation
Television College, which sends lecturers, and
arranges courses, overseas.
Technical Developments
One of the most important recent
developments in television has been in news
coverage, where compact electronic cameras
have replaced film cameras, eliminating the
need for film processing and enabling
pictures to be transmitted directly to a studio
or recorded on video tape on location.
Other recent advances in television
broadcasting include:
• adoption of digital video tape recorders;
• increasing use of computer-aided digital
equipment for picture generation and
manipulation;
• use of portable satellite links to transmit
pictures from remote locations to studios;
and
• the introduction of stereo sound on the
NICAM 728 digital system, developed by
the BBC.
Both the BBC and the independent sector
are engaged in the further development of
digital techniques for studio applications and
inter-city links. In satellite broadcasting, the
MAC transmission format was developed by
IBA engineers, who went on to devise
refinements for the MAC system compatible
with widescreen television. The BBC and
IBA co-operated in the development of
teletext, and teletext sets in some 30
countries are based on the British system.
Both the BBC and the ITC are
undertaking a number of important areas of
long-term research. These include:
• the development of a 1,250-line wide¬
screen high definition television
(HDTV), which is being developed
under the EUREKA 95 group of
British and other European
manufacturers;
• enhancements to the PAL colour
television system;
• digital terrestrial audio and television
broadcasting; and
• data transmission studies.

25 Sport and Active
Recreation
The British invented and codified the rules of
many of the sports and games now played all
over the world, and today there is widespread
participation in and watching of sport in
Britain. British sportsmen and women
compete internationally in some 70 different
sports. Among their number in May 1992
were around 74 world champions in 23
sports. Large crowds attend occasions such as
the football and rugby league Challenge Cup
Finals at Wembley Stadium; international
rugby union matches at Twickenham,
Murrayfield (Edinburgh) and Cardiff Arms
Park; the Wimbledon lawn tennis
championships; the classic horse races; the
Open Golf Championship; the British motor
racing Grand Prix; and international cricket
matches.
Sport is a major industry in Britain: in
addition to the professional sportsmen and
women, some 467,000 people are employed in
the provision of sports clothing, publicity,
ground and club maintenance and other
activities connected with sport. In total an
estimated £9,750 million is spent on sport
annually in Britain.
ORGANISATION AND
ADMINISTRATION
Responsibility for government policy on
sport, active recreation and children’s play in
England has rested with the Secretary of
State for National Heritage since the creation
of the Department of National Heritage in
April 1992. The Secretaries of State for
Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland are
responsible for sport in their countries. In
Northern Ireland the Department of
Education makes direct grants towards the
capital cost of facilities to local authorities and
voluntary sports bodies.
Responsibility for the organisation and
promotion of sport is largely decentralised,
and many sport and recreation facilities are
provided by local authorities. The
Countryside Commission has specific
recreation responsibilities, and other bodies,
like the Forestry Commission, provide
recreational amenities in addition to their
main functions. The main mechanism by
which the Government directly channels
financial assistance to sport, however, is
through the Sports Councils. This ‘arm’s
length’ principle of funding safeguards the
long-established independence of sports
organisations in Britain.
The Secretary of State for National
Heritage co-ordinates policy on children’s
play in England. The Sports Council is
responsible for the National Children’s Play
and Recreation Unit. This provides local and
central government and other interested
organisations with advice on a range of
children’s play issues.
Sports Councils
There are four independent Sports Councils:
• the Sports Council—for general matters
affecting Great Britain and specifically
English matters;
• the Sports Council for Wales;
• the Scottish Sports Council; and
• the Sports Council for Northern Ireland.
These councils are allocating government
funds amounting to over £64 million in
1992-93. They make grants for sports
development, coaching and administration to
the governing bodies of sports and other
national organisations, and administer the
national sports centres (see p 439). Grants
and loans are also made to voluntary
organisations, local authorities and
438
SPORT AND ACTIVE RECREATION
commercial organisations, to help them
provide sports facilities. Facilities receiving
support include sports halls, indoor
swimming pools, intensive-use pitches, indoor
tennis halls and school facilities. The Indoor
Tennis Initiative is a major building
programme to increase the availability of
indoor tennis courts. It is sponsored by the
Sports Council and the tennis authorities.
British representatives at international
sports meetings are assisted by the Sports
Council, which encourages links with
international and overseas organisations. The
four Sports Councils are also concerned with
preserving and extending recreational and
sporting access to the countryside.
Ten Regional Councils for Sport and
Recreation in England, on each of which sport
and active recreation, and local authority
interests are represented, prepare regional
strategies and advise on investment in, and
the planning of, sporting and recreational
facilities and the promotion of sport.
The four Sports Councils are exploring
ways of attracting greater private sector
investment in sport (see p 444), including
greater use of incentive funding schemes,
whereby public money is used to generate
revenue from private sources.
Strategic Planning
Strategies for the development of sport have
been drawn up by the four Sports Councils.
The aims of these strategies are broadly:
• to ensure that all young people have the
opportunity to acquire basic sports skills
and to receive physical education
instruction;
• to ensure that everyone has the
opportunity to take part in sport and
active recreation of their choice;
• to ensure that everyone with the interest
and ability has the opportunity to
improve their standard of performance in
sport and fulfil their potential; and
• to ensure that everyone with the interest
and ability has the opportunity to reach
the highest standards of sporting
excellence.
Much of the Sports Council’s budget is
directed at increasing participation by the
general public. The Council is also
concentrating on raising participation rates
among inner city dwellers, people with
disabilities (see p 443) and other groups
experiencing difficulties in gaining access to
sporting opportunities. It works towards
improving coaching, sports science and sports
medicine as part of the drive to increase
standards of performance.
The Sports Council’s programme of
national demonstration projects was designed
to promote mass participation through the
establishment of new partnerships and the
development of new ways of working with
groups that are socially and recreationally
disadvantaged. Some 15 schemes have
featured in this programme. Many local
authorities have gone on to provide their own
schemes without Sports Council funding.
The lessons of these projects have been fed
into the work of over 1,500 sports
development officers employed in Britain.
‘Team Sport Scotland’, administered by
the Scottish Sports Council, aims to
encourage team sports by promoting links
between schools, sports clubs and other
interested organisations.
In 1991-92 the Sports Council provided a
grant of £700,000 to the National Coaching
Foundation to enable it to set up Champion
Coaching, a quality after-school coaching
scheme for those aged 11 to 14.
Sports Centres
The four Sports Councils run ten national
sports centres which provide world class
facilities for training and competition at the
highest level of sporting excellence. The
centres host formal squad events as well as
making their facilities available for casual
individual training for elite performers and
the local community.
Combined facilities for a number of sports
are available at three of the centres:
• Crystal Palace, in London, which has
major competition venues for athletics,
swimming and a variety of indoor sports;
• Lilleshall (Shropshire), which houses the
British Amateur Gymnastics Association
Gymnastics Centre; and
439
BRITAIN 1993: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
• Bisham Abbey (Berkshire), which houses
the Lawn Tennis Association tennis
school.
The other two are specialist centres: the
National Water Sports Centre at Holme
Pierrepont, Nottinghamshire, which caters for
rowing, canoeing and water-skiing; and the
Plas-y-Brenin National Centre for Mountain
Activities in north Wales.
The Sports Council for Wales runs the
Welsh Institute for Sport (formerly known as
the National Sports Centre for Wales) in
Cardiff and the National Watersports Centre
at Plas Menai in north Wales. The Scottish
Sports Council operates three national sports
training centres: Glenmore Lodge, near
Aviemore, for both winter and summer
outdoor pursuits; Inverclyde, at Largs, for
general sports; and a national water sports
training centre on the island of Great
Cumbrae, in the Firth of Clyde. The Sports
Council for Northern Ireland runs one
national facility, the Northern Ireland Centre
for Outdoor Activities at Tollymore, in
County Down.
National Coaching Foundation
The National Coaching Foundation was
established in 1983 to provide educational and
advisory services for coaches in all sports. Its
work complements and supports the coaching
development carried out by sports governing
bodies. There are 16 national coaching
centres delivering the Foundation’s services
to coaches.
Local Authorities
Local authorities are major providers of land
and large-scale facilities for community
recreation: their estimated gross annual
expenditure on sport and recreation amounts
to over £1,000 million in England alone. The
facilities include parks, lakes, playing fields,
sports halls, tennis courts, golf courses,
swimming pools, gymnasia and sports centres
catering for a wide range of activities. Local
authorities in England manage over 1,500
indoor centres, largely built in the last 20
years, as well as numerous outdoor amenities.
There has been a rapid growth in the
provision of artificial pitches, largely for
hockey. The number of leisure pools is also
rising quickly: these often have wave
machines, waterfalls, jacuzzis and other
leisure equipment.
Sports Governing Bodies
Individual sports are run by over 400
independent governing bodies, whose
functions usually include drawing up rules,
holding events, regulating membership,
selecting and training national teams and
promoting international links. There are also
organisations representing people who take
part in more informal physical recreation,
such as walking and cycling.
Central Council of Physical Recreation
The Central Council of Physical Recreation
(CCPR) is a representative body of non¬
governmental organisations for sport and
active recreation in England. It provides
advice and guidance to its members on a
range of advisory services. Similar bodies in
Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland are the
Scottish and Welsh Sports Associations and
the Northern Ireland Council of Physical
Recreation.
The CCPR represents the views of its
membership to the Sports Council, the main
source of its funding. The CCPR administers
the Community Sports Leaders Award
Scheme, which trains people to help run
sporting activities in clubs in their local
communities. In 1985 the CCPR set up the
Institute of Sports Sponsorship, comprising
some 80 major British companies which
sponsor sport, and in 1992 it set up the
Institute of Professional Sport, which will
endeavour to protect the welfare of
professional sportsmen and women.
British Olympic Association
The British Olympic Association, founded in
1905, is the national Olympic committee for
Britain. Its primary function is to organise
the participation of British teams in the
Olympic Games. The Association comprises
representatives of the 30 governing bodies of
440
SPORT AND ACTIVE RECREATION
those sports in the programme of the
Olympic Games (summer and winter). It
determines the size of British teams and sets
standards for selection, raises funds, makes all
arrangements and provides a headquarters
staff for the management of the teams. It also
makes important contributions in the fields of
coaching, drug testing and control, and sports
medicine. The Association’s British Olympic
Medical Centre supplies a medical back-up
service for competitors before and during the
Olympic Games.
In the 1992 Olympics in Barcelona,
Spain, Britain won 20 medals: five
gold, three silver and 12 bronze. Gold
medals were won in athletics (two),
rowing (two) and cycling.
In 1988 the British Olympic Association,
the Sports Council and the CCPR agreed to
form the British International Sports
Committee to advise the Government and
other bodies on international issues
concerning British sport, and to co-ordinate
the views and actions of representative sports
bodies in Britain.
British Sports Forum
The sports associations of Wales, Scotland
and Northern Ireland, the CCPR and the
British Olympic Association have recently
come together in the British Sports Forum.
The purpose of this body is to present the
united voice of the non-governmental sports
sector, both domestically and internationally.
National Playing Fields Association
The National Playing Fields Association is a
charity with a Royal Charter, whose purpose
is to promote the provision of recreation and
play facilities for all age groups. It aims to
ensure that there are adequate playing fields
and playspace. There are affiliated
associations in the English and Welsh
counties and independent organisations in
Scotland and Northern Ireland.
The Government has awarded a grant of
£500,000 to the Sports Council, in
conjunction with the Association and the
CCPR, to compile a register of recreational
land as part of a strategy to safeguard playing
fields.
Sports Clubs
Recreational facilities are provided by local
sports clubs. Some cater for indoor
recreation, but more common are those
providing sports grounds, particularly for
cricket, football, rugby, hockey, tennis and
golf. Estimates suggest that in 1989 there
were some 150,000 sports clubs in Britain,
with 6 5 million members. Many clubs linked
to business firms cater for sporting activities.
Commercial facilities include tenpin bowling
centres, ice and roller-skating rinks, squash
courts, golf courses and driving ranges,
curling rinks, riding stables, marinas and,
increasingly, fitness centres. In all the private
sector owns and runs some 500 major sports
facilities.
GOVERNMENT POLICIES
The Government has long recognised the
importance of physical recreation for the
health and general welfare of the community.
The social role which sport can play has
become more important at a time of rapid
change in work and leisure patterns. Success
in sport also strengthens Britain’s
international status and prestige, and fosters
national pride.
In December 1991 the Government
announced its policies and priorities in a major
policy statement, Sport and Active Recreation.
The aim is to encourage individuals to
participate from childhood through to
adulthood; to enable them to improve their
standards of performance; and to encourage
those with the potential to excel to do so.
Emphasis is placed on partnerships between
public and private authorities, agencies and
the voluntary sports sector. The policy
statement proposes a more effective structure
for sport in Britain. It also announced the
Business Sponsorship Scheme (see p 444).
Restructuring
As a result of the policy statement, the
441
BRITAIN 1993: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
administration of sport is being restructured,
and the Sports Council will be replaced by
two new bodies: a United Kingdom Sports
Commission and a Sports Council for
England.
The main functions of the United
Kingdom Sports Commission, which would
be funded by the Department of National
Heritage, would include:
• long-term strategic planning on sporting
issues affecting the whole of Britain;
• development and co-ordination of
initiatives to promote higher standards of
performance and excellence in sport at
national level;
• co-ordination of efforts to promote
participation in sport;
• international collaboration to further
British sporting and active recreation
interests overseas; and
• administration of grants or loans to
achieve these objectives.
The Sports Council for England would be
established on the lines of, and have similar
functions to, the other Sports Councils.
Competitive Tendering
The Government has instituted competitive
tendering for the management of local
authority sports and leisure facilities to make
them more cost-effective and responsive to
consumer demand. School and college
facilities are exempted from competition, and
councils retain controls over pricing,
admission and opening hours.
Olympic Bid by Manchester
The Government has announced its support
for Manchester’s bid for the Olympics for the
year 2000 and will commit some £55 million
to the bid. Some £53 million is being
allocated to the provision of facilities in
advance of the decision on the location of the
Games, due in September 1993. In addition,
the Government will provide £2 million to
support the bid, matching money being raised
by the private sector.
Major new facilities are planned for
Manchester, including:
• an Olympic stadium—the first
international stadium to be built in
Britain since 1923—with an initial seating
capacity of 60,000;
• an Olympic indoor arena, with an initial
seating capacity of 12,000; and
• a covered velodrome, the first in Britain.
OTHER SPORTING ISSUES
Participation
Levels of participation in sport have been
rising, due mainly to an increase in leisure
time and facilities, greater mobility and
improvements in living standards. A growing
awareness of the importance of regular
exercise for good health has also contributed
to this trend and is reflected in the upsurge
of interest in jogging, keep fit and dance-
related forms of exercise.
It has been estimated that 29 million
people over the age of 16 regularly take part
in sport or exercise, with men
outnumbering women. Walking, including
rambling and hiking, is by far the most
popular recreation, followed by swimming,
snooker/billiards/pool, keep fit/yoga/
aerobics, cycling, darts, golf, running,
weightlifting and football. Other widely
practised spare-time physical activities
include gardening and ‘do-it-yourself repair
and improvement work.
Women and Sport
A major priority in the 1980s was to narrow
the gap between men’s and women’s
participation in active sport and recreation.
During the 1990s the main emphasis is
focusing on encouraging women to adopt
leadership roles, such as coaches, officials and
administrators. A more positive attitude
towards physical fitness has led to growing
participation by women in sport. Women also
take part more in ‘physical contact’ sports,
such as football and rugby, which were
previously regarded as ‘unfeminine’. Sports
from which they had been excluded by
442
SPORT AND ACTIVE RECREATION
tradition, rather than on the grounds of
physical differences, are similarly increasing
in popularity among women: for instance,
larger numbers now play snooker and
billiards. Sports and physical activities
associated with fitness and healthy lifestyles
are particularly favoured by women, with
high rates of participation in swimming, keep
fit and aerobics.
Many sports have separate governing
bodies for women and competitive events are
normally organised in divisions for men and
women. One notable exception is
equestrianism, where women riders compete
on equal terms with men. Mixed events in
which men and women take part together are
traditional in sports such as tennis,
badminton and ice-skating.
Netball is the main sport played
predominantly by women. Girls at school
often participate in netball, tennis,
badminton, athletics, hockey, swimming and
gymnastics.
Sport for People with Disabilities
Opportunities exist for people with
disabilities to take part in a variety of
sporting activities. There are national
disability sports organisations representing
the main disability groups, but the trend is
increasingly towards sports-specific governing
bodies. For example, the Riding for the
Disabled Association caters for some 25,000
riders and the British Disabled Water Ski
Association offers training and competition to
a growing number of skiers.
The British Sports Association for the
Disabled aims to encourage and enable people
with disabilities to take part in sport and
active recreation at whichever level they
choose. Sports clubs for people with
disabilities throughout Britain are affiliated to
the Association. As well as offering advice to
local clubs and groups, the Association
arranges conferences, seminars and coaching
courses. The Scottish Sports Association for
the Disabled, the Federation of Sports
Associations for the Disabled (Wales) and the
Northern Ireland Committee on Sport for
Disabled People have similar co-ordinating
roles.
In the last few years greater emphasis has
been placed on making provision for people
with a mental handicap, this work being
co-ordinated by the United Kingdom
Sports Association for People with Mental
Handicap.
Competition
Britain has played an active part in
international sport for people with disabilities.
The British Paralympic Association, which
liaises closely with the British Olympic
Association, looks after the preparation and
training of paralympic and other international
teams. At the Paralympic Games in Barcelona
in 1992, the British team gained 40 gold, 47
silver and 41 bronze medals, finishing third
in the overall medals table.
Future Structure
In 1989 the Government published a report
on sport for people with disabilities. This
recommended that sport for disabled and
able-bodied people should be increasingly
integrated, with athletes with disabilities
being encouraged to participate in sporting
events either in direct competition with able-
bodied athletes or in parallel events. It also
recommended that governing bodies of sport
should increasingly assume responsibility for
all participants in their sport, whether able-
bodied or disabled. In 1991 the Government
provided extra money to the Sports Council
to help implement the recommendations.
The governing bodies of sport are
increasingly taking responsibility for both
able-bodied participants and those with
disabilities.
Sport in Education
All schools (except those solely for infants)
are expected to have a playing field or the
use of one, and most secondary schools have
a gymnasium. Some have other amenities
such as swimming pools, sports halls and
halls designed for dance and movement.
Physical education is a compulsory subject
for all pupils aged 5 to 16 in state-maintained
schools in England and Wales. Introduction
443
BRITAIN 1993: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
of the National Curriculum for physical
education will begin in late 1992. One of the
requirements is that, from the end of 1994,
all children should be able to swim 25 metres
before they leave primary school.
The Government’s policy statement in
December 1991 recorded a number of ways of
improving opportunities for young people to
participate in sport, particularly by
promoting partnerships between schools
and other organisations in the local
community. Early in 1993 the Government
intends to publish guidance on promoting
partnerships.
To achieve the maximum use of sports
facilities, greater community use is being
encouraged of sports halls and other facilities
owned by schools, colleges and institutions
such as football clubs. Legislation is planned
which would allow school governors to enter
into agreements for the joint management of
school premises in out-of-school hours.
Stronger links are being developed between
schools and the wider community to ensure
that children have access to the sports
amenities which clubs and associations can
make available outside school hours.
Sport and recreation facilities are available
at institutions of higher and further
education, some of which have departments
of physical education.
Televised Sport
Extensive coverage on television (over 3,000
hours on the four terrestrial channels in 1991)
has helped to generate interest in a growing
number of sports. Sports attracting the larger
television audiences include association
football, cricket, athletics, snooker and
boxing. The advent of direct broadcasting by
satellite and the greater availability of cable
are increasing televised coverage of sport
substantially. At present three satellite
channels are devoted to sport.
Important sporting occasions (‘listed
events’), such as the Grand National
steeplechase, the Olympic Games and cricket
Test matches involving England, have to be
made generally available to television
audiences. They may not be shown
exclusively on ‘pay-per-view’ television.
PRIVATE SPONSORSHIP
The importance for sport of financial
sponsorship from commercial organisations is
recognised by the Government and the
Sports Councils. It is estimated that private
sector investment in sports sponsorship
amounts to over £200 million a year and
involves more than 2,000 British companies.
Investment includes sponsorship of cricket
and football leagues, sporting events such as
horse races, and of individual performers.
Motor sport and football receive the largest
amounts of private sponsorship.
Sponsorship may take the form of
financing specific events, or of grants to
individual sports organisations or sportsmen
and women. The Sports Aid Foundation
raises and distributes funds from industry,
commerce and private sponsors in order to
assist the training of talented individuals.
Grants are awarded on the recommendation
of the governing bodies of sport. The
Scottish and Welsh Sports Aid
Foundations and the Ulster Sports and
Recreation Trust have similar functions. A
sponsorship advisory service is run by the
CCPR.
Successive governments have negotiated
voluntary agreements with the tobacco
industry to regulate tobacco companies’
sponsorship of sport, the last one having
come into force in 1987. This has the aim of
promoting responsible sponsorship activities
and imposes a ceiling on spending by
tobacco firms on sports sponsorship. It
prohibits sponsorship of events where a
majority of the participants are under 18
years of age or which are designed to
appeal mainly to spectators under 18. It
bans the depiction of any participants in a
sport in media advertising, and imposes strict
controls on siting of signs at televised events
and on the size of health warnings on these
signs.
Business Sponsorship Scheme
The Government intends to launch a
Business Sponsorship Scheme for Sport
which will be targeted at the ‘grass roots’ of
sport and active recreation to promote
444
SPORT AND ACTIVE RECREATION
partnership between sport and business at the
local level throughout Great Britain. Its
objectives will be to increase the amount
of business sponsorship in this area. Awards
will be given to the body running the event
or project concerned. The awards made will
match the money provided by the sponsor,
ranging from a minimum of £ 1,000 to a
maximum of £75,000. In England the
scheme will be administered by the
Institute of Sports Sponsorship and in
Scotland and Wales on a partnership basis
with the Scottish Sports Council and the
Sports Council for Wales. Northern
Ireland has its own sports sponsorship
incentive scheme, which is being reviewed
during 1992.
GAMBLING
Various forms of commercial betting and
gaming are permitted in Britain under strict
regulations. In 1991-92 the total money
staked, excluding gaming machines, was
estimated at £9,424 million.
Betting takes place mainly on horse or
greyhound racing, and on football matches,
usually through football pools. Racing bets
may be made at racecourses and greyhound
tracks, or through some 10,000 licensed off-
course betting offices, which take about
90 per cent of the money staked. A form of
pool betting—totalisator betting—is organised
on horse racecourses by the Horserace
Totalisator Board (the Tote). Bookmakers
and the Tote contribute a levy to the
Horserace Betting Levy Board, which
promotes the improvement of horse breeds,
advancement of veterinary science and better
horse racing.
Gaming includes the playing of casino and
card games, gaming machines and bingo.
There are 120 licensed casinos operating in
Britain, 20 of them in London, and about 960
licensed bingo clubs.
FOUNDATION FOR SPORT AND THE
ARTS
The Foundation for Sport and the Arts was
set up by the pools promoters in 1991 to
channel funds to benefit sport and the arts.
The pools promoters are providing the
Foundation with a minimum of £40 million a
year. A further £20 million a year is being
provided as a result of the reduction in pool
betting duty in the 1991 Budget. About £40
million a year is available for sport.
NATIONAL LOTTERY
In March 1992 the Government set out its
proposals for a new national lottery in a
White Paper, A National Lottery Raising
Money for Good Causes. The Government has
consulted about aspects of such a lottery,
including its nature and frequency, and the
effect on football pools and other forms of
gambling. Legislation is planned to introduce
the arrangements, and the lottery could be in
operation by 1994.
An independent National Lottery Board
would be established to organise the lottery
and distribute the proceeds and prizes.
Day-to-day running of the lottery would be
undertaken by private sector contractors.
Once fully operational, the National Lottery
could raise up to £1,000 million a year.
Sport (including major international
events), the arts, heritage and charities are
to be the main beneficiaries of the Lottery.
SAFETY AT SPORTS GROUNDS
Safety at sports grounds is governed by
legislation. The main instrument of control is
a safety certificate which is issued by the
relevant local authority. When determining
the conditions of a safety certificate, the local
authority is expected to comply with the
Guide to Safety at Sports Grounds. This was
revised in 1990 to include the relevant safety
recommendations of the ‘Taylor Report’ on
the Hillsborough stadium disaster in
Sheffield in 1989, when 95 spectators were
crushed to death. These recommendations
included:
• reducing density on terraces;
• better training of, and greater vigilance,
by all those responsible for controlling
and stewarding spectators; and
• painting of all emergency exit gates in
perimeter fences in distinctive colours.
445
BRITAIN 1993: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Football Grounds
In 1992 the Government reviewed its policy
requiring all football grounds to have seated
accommodation only. Clubs in the Premier
League and the First Division clubs in the
Football League are required to have all-seated
accommodation by August 1994. This
requirement has been relaxed for the Second
and Third Divisions of the Football League,
providing that the terracing is safe. In
Scotland Premier Division clubs must meet
the 1994 deadline, but First and Second
Division clubs may retain the use of standing
accommodation. By reducing the pool betting
duty (see below), the Government is making
available £100 million over five years to assist
clubs in making the necessary ground
improvements.
Football Licensing Authority
The Football Licensing Authority, established
under the Football Spectators Act 1989,
is responsible for assisting in the
implementation of the all-seating policy in
England and Wales, for ensuring that the
terracing is safe and for monitoring the way
in which local authorities carry out their
functions under the Safety of Sports Grounds
Act 1975.
The Football Trust
The Football Trust 1990 was established by
the pool promoters and replaced the Football
Grounds Improvement Trust and the earlier
Football Trust. Its income is over £32 million
a year and it is funded partly by the pool
promoters from their spotting-the-ball
competition and partly from a 2 5 per cent
reduction in pool betting duty to run for five
years, announced in the 1990 Budget. This
reduction was made on the understanding
that the money made available must be used
to assist football clubs and the national
stadiums to fund capital works for the
comfort and safety of spectators and, in
particular, all-seater stadiums in line with the
recommendations of the Taylor report.
Spotting-the-ball funds are used for safety
grants and projects such as closed-circuit
television, contributions to police and
stewarding costs at football grounds, and
community football projects.
Spectator Violence
Spectator violence associated with football
both in Britain and overseas has been a
subject of widespread concern, although there
are signs that in recent years government
policy and action have resulted in a decline in
violence. The Government has worked
closely with the police, football authorities
and the governments of other European
countries to implement measures to combat
the problem. The British Government has
also continued to press for the closest co¬
operation with the football authorities and the
police and their counterparts throughout
Europe. Within the Council of Europe,
Britain contributes to the work of the
Standing Committee on the European
Convention on Spectator Violence. Britain
was the first country to sign and ratify the
Convention. It has welcomed the
Committee’s recommendation urging tough
action against hooliganism, including
prosecution where appropriate.
Recognising the link between excessive
alcohol consumption and crowd disorder, the
Government introduced legislation in
Scotland in 1980 and in the rest of Britain in
1985 to establish controls on the sale and
possession of alcohol at football grounds and
on transport to and from grounds. Legislation
has made it an offence in England and Wales
to throw objects at football matches, run onto
the pitch without good reason and chant
indecent or racist slogans.
Courts in England and Wales have the
power to prohibit convicted football hooligans
from attending football matches. They also
have powers to impose restriction orders on
convicted football hooligans to prevent them
travelling abroad to attend specified matches.
Closed-circuit television has greatly assisted
the police in controlling crowds and is an
important evidence-gathering tool. The
National Criminal Intelligence Service
Football Unit co-ordinates police intelligence
about football hooligans and strengthens
liaison with overseas police forces.
446
SPOR T AND ACTIVE RECREATION
Drug Misuse
The problem of drug-taking in sport in order
to improve performance unfairly has been a
cause of concern to the Government, Sports
Councils and the governing bodies of sport.
Following a ministerial review, the Sports
Council introduced a new independent drug
testing regime in 1988. This provides for
random testing in and out of competition by
independent sampling officers, and the
publication of adverse findings. The Sports
Council provides financial support for the
British drug testing programme. It also funds
the International Olympic Committee (IOC)-
accredited laboratory at London University,
which carries out analysis and research into
methods of detection for new drugs that
unfairly aid performance.
Legislation is planned to create a new
criminal offence of providing anabolic
steroids to minors. Research is being
undertaken to establish the extent of the
problem of steroids.
International Co-operation
The Government and the Sports Council
have taken action against drug misuse at
international level. In 1990 the Council of
Europe developed an Anti-Doping
Convention to tackle the problem of drug
abuse in sport. This was a British initiative,
the main aims of which are to provide an
international framework within which
national anti-doping campaigns can work
effectively. The convention seeks to ensure
that grants are given only to those sports
bodies with anti-doping regulations.
Signatory states are encouraged to set up
doping-control laboratories meeting IOC
standards, and sports governing bodies are
urged to harmonise out-of-competition
testing and other anti-doping regulations with
those of the IOC. Testing at international
events and out-of-competition testing by
international sports bodies are also promoted
under the new agreement. Britain has already
implemented the provisions of this
agreement. The Government has also signed
anti-doping monitoring agreements with
Australia, Canada and Norway, which
provide for the mutual testing of athletes,
both in and out of competition.
OTHER ORGANISATIONS
CONCERNED WITH SPORT AND
RECREATION
Countryside Bodies
The Countryside Commission (for England),
the Countryside Council for Wales and
Scottish Natural Heritage are responsible for
conserving and improving the natural beauty
and amenity of the countryside, and for
encouraging the provision and improvement
of facilities for open-air recreation. The
Countryside Commission has launched a
series of policy initiatives aimed at increasing
people’s enjoyment of the countryside. These
focus on the maintenance and sign-posting of
public footpaths and other ‘rights of way’ and
the development of national routes for long¬
distance walking and riding. Rural
communities are encouraged to build up local
facilities which promote public enjoyment of
the countryside. These initiatives operate
alongside established policies for helping local
authorities and private bodies to provide
country parks, picnic sites and informal
recreation facilities.
In Northern Ireland the Ulster
Countryside Committee advises the
Department of the Environment on the
preservation of amenities and the designation
of ‘areas of outstanding natural beauty’.
British Waterways Board
The British Waterways Board is a publicly
owned body responsible for managing and
developing much of Great Britain’s inland
waterways. Many leisure and recreational
pursuits are enjoyed on waterways and
reservoirs and in waterside buildings; these
include angling and numerous types of sailing
and boating, and informal recreation such as
walking or industrial archaeology.
POPULAR SPORTS AND
RECREATIONS
Some of the major sports and recreations in
447
BRITAIN 1993: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Britain are described below. The increased
provision of sports centres has improved
opportunities for participating in indoor
sports such as basketball, volleyball, fencing,
judo, karate and other martial arts,
gymnastics, squash, table tennis and shooting.
Almost all outdoor sports have continued to
gain in popularity, including such ‘high-risk’
activities as rock-climbing and sub-aqua
diving. The number of people enjoying the
recreational amenities of the countryside,
rivers and coastline is also growing.
Sportsmen and women may be
professionals (paid players) or amateurs. Some
sports—like hockey and rowing—are amateur,
but in others the distinction between amateur
status and professional status is less strictly
defined, or does not exist.
Angling
One of the most popular countryside sports is
angling, and there are about 4 million anglers
in Britain. Many fish for salmon and trout,
particularly in the rivers and lochs of
Scotland and in Wales. In England and Wales
the most widely practised form of angling is
for coarse fish such as pike, perch, carp,
tench and bream. Separate organisations
represent game (salmon and trout), coarse and
sea fishing clubs in England, Wales, Scotland
and Northern Ireland.
The National Federation of Anglers in
England organises national championships for
coarse fishing and enters a team in the world
angling championships. England won the
world team event in 1987, 1988 and 1991 and
the individual title in 1989, 1990 and 1991.
Association Football
Association football is the largest spectator
sport and one of the most popular
participation sports. It is controlled by
separate football associations in England,
Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. In
England 340 clubs are affiliated to the
English Football Association (FA) and more
than 42,000 clubs directly through regional or
district associations. The FA, founded in 1863,
and the Football League, founded in 1888,
were both the first of their kind in the world.
In England and Wales a major change
occurred in August 1992 when an FA
Premier League, comprising 22 clubs, started.
The remaining 70 full-time professional clubs
play in three main divisions run by the
Football League. In Scotland there are three
divisions, with 38 clubs, which play in the
Scottish Football League. A number of the
leading clubs are considering forming a new
Super League in Scotland. In Northern
Ireland, 16 semi-professional clubs play in the
Irish Football League. During the season,
which lasts from August until May, over
2,000 English League matches are played;
total attendances reached over 20 million in
1991-92.
The annual competitions for the FA
Challenge Cup, the Coca Cola League Cup,
the Tennents Scottish Cup, the Skol Cup
(the Scottish League Cup), the Irish Cup and
the Welsh FA Cup are organised on a knock¬
out basis. The finals are played at Wembley
Stadium, London; at Hampden Park,
Glasgow; at Windsor Park, or the Oval,
Belfast; and at the National Stadium, Cardiff.
The Sports Councils have made grants
available to a number of clubs and local
authorities to enable them to modernise or
expand football facilities in areas of urban
deprivation. Grants for various improvements
such as all-weather pitches are also made
throughout Britain by the Football
Associations and the Football Trust.
Athletics
Amateur athletics is governed in Britain by the
British Athletic Federation, which is affiliated
to the International Amateur Athletic
Federation. International athletics and the
selection of British teams are the concern of
the British Athletic Federation, which also
administers coaching schemes. For the
Olympic Games and the world and European
championships one team represents Britain.
Athletics is attracting increasing numbers
of participants, both men and women, in part
because of the success of British competitors
and the wide coverage of athletics events on
television. The London Marathon, which
takes place every spring, draws leading
runners from a number of countries and is a
448
SPORT AND ACTIVE RECREATION
mass-participation event—more than 25,000
runners took part in 1992.
Many British athletes, especially middle-
distance runners, have enjoyed distinguished
reputations: in 1954, for example, Dr (now
Sir) Roger Bannister became the first man to
run a mile in under four minutes. More
recently, at the 1992 Olympic Games in
Barcelona British athletes won two gold
medals—Linford Christie (100 metres) and
Sally Gunnell (400 metres hurdles)—and four
bronze medals: Kriss Akabusi (400 metres
hurdles), Steve Backley (javelin) and the
men’s and women’s 4 x 400 metres relay
teams. In September 1992 Britons held world
records in a number of events, including the
800 metres (Sebastian Coe), the mile (Steve
Cram) and the javelin (Steve Backley).
Badminton
The sport of badminton takes its name from
the Duke of Beaufort’s country home,
Badminton House, where badminton was first
played in the nineteenth century. Badminton
is organised by the Badminton Association of
England and the Scottish, Welsh and Irish
(Ulster branch) Badminton Unions. There are
also English, Welsh and Scottish schools
badminton associations. Badminton is one of
the fastest growing sports—around 5 million
people play badminton in Britain and there
are over 5,000 clubs. In 1992 badminton
became a full Olympic sport and in 1993 the
world championships will be held at the
National Indoor Arena in Birmingham.
Basketball
Basketball is played, mainly indoors, by both
men and women. There are about 1,000
registered clubs. In all, over 500,000 people
participate and the sport’s popularity has been
increasing rapidly. The English Basket Ball
Association is the governing body of the sport
in England, and there are similar associations
in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland.
The leading clubs play in the National
Basketball Leagues, and the main events of
the year are the National Cup Finals and the
Carlsberg Basketball Championships, staged
in Sheffield and London.
Bowls
Bowls has been played in Britain since the
thirteenth century. The game of lawn bowls
is played on a flat green. In the Midlands,
the north of England and north Wales a
variation called crown green bowls is played,
so named because the centre of the green is
higher than its boundaries. Lawn and crown
green bowls are mainly summer games; in
winter indoor bowls takes place on synthetic
greens and is growing in popularity. Once
regarded as a pastime for the elderly, bowls is
increasingly enjoyed by adults of all ages.
About 4,000 lawn bowling clubs are
affiliated to the English, Scottish, Welsh and
Irish (Northern Ireland Region) Bowling
Associations, which, together with Women’s
Bowling Associations for the four countries,
play to the rules of the International Bowling
Board. Other associations, including the
English Bowling Federation, are not under
the Board’s control. The British Crown
Green Bowling Association is the governing
body of crown green bowls, and has 3,200
affiliated clubs.
At the world outdoor championships in
Worthing in 1992 Tony Allcock won the
singles gold and Scotland won the Leonard
Trophy (the team title), together with gold
medals in the pairs and the fours.
Boxing
Boxing in its modern form dates from 1865,
when the Marquess of Queensberry drew up
a set of rules eliminating much of the
brutality in prize-fighting and making skill
the basis of the sport. Boxing is both amateur
and professional, and in both strict medical
regulations are observed.
All amateur boxing in England, including
schoolboy, club, association and combined
services boxing (in the armed forces), is
controlled by the Amateur Boxing
Association. There are separate associations in
Scotland and Wales, and Northern Ireland
forms part of the Irish Boxing Association.
The associations organise amateur boxing
championships as well as training courses for
referees, coaches and others. Teams take part
in international meetings, including the
449
BRITAIN 1993: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Commonwealth and Olympic Games, and
European and World championships. Robin
Reid won a bronze medal in the light-
middleweight category at the 1992 Olympics.
Professional boxing is controlled by the
British Boxing Board of Control. The Board
appoints inspectors, medical officers and
representatives to ensure that regulations are
observed and to guard against overmatching
and exploitation. British boxing has a
distinguished record and at various times
British boxers have held European,
Commonwealth and world championship
titles. Britain has several World Boxing
Organisation champions including Chris
Eubank at super-middleweight and Patrick
Clinton (flyweight). Paul Hodkinson holds
the World Boxing Council featherweight
championship and Nigel Benn the super-
middleweight championship.
Chess
Chess is growing in popularity and there are
local chess clubs and leagues throughout
Britain—the game is widely played in schools
and colleges. Important domestic
competitions include the British
Championships (for all ages), the National
Club Championships, the County
Championships and the Leigh Grand Prix.
The Hastings Chess Congress, dating from
1895, is the world’s longest running annual
international chess tournament.
In 1992 Nigel Short became the first
British competitor to reach the world
chess candidates’ final; this will be held
in January 1993 and the winner wdll
then play the world chess champion.
The governing bodies are the British
Chess Federation (responsible for England
and for co-ordinating activity among the
home nations), the Scottish Chess Association
and the Welsh and Ulster Chess Unions.
Cricket
Cricket is among the most popular of
summer sports and is sometimes called the
English national game, having been played as
early as the 1550s. Among the many clubs
founded in the eighteenth century is the
Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC), which
continues to frame the rules of the game.
The MCC and the Test and County Cricket
Board (representing first-class cricket) are
based at Lord’s cricket ground in north
London, the administrative centre of the
world game. Men’s cricket in Britain is
governed by the Cricket Council, consisting
of representatives of the Test and County
Cricket Board, the National Cricket
Association (representing club and junior
cricket), the Minor County Cricket
Association, the Scottish Cricket Union, the
Irish Cricket Union and the MCC.
Cricket is played in schools, colleges and
universities, and in cities, towns and villages
amateur teams play weekly games from late
April to the end of September. Throughout
Britain there is a network of league cricket.
The main competition in professional
cricket is the Britannic Assurance County
Championship, played by 18 county teams.
Recently, matches have been a mixture of
three-day and four-day games, but from 1993
the competition w ill consist only of four-day
matches. There are also three one-day
competitions—the Benson and Hedges Cup,
the National Westminster Trophy, and the
Sunday League. Some of the best supported
games are the annual series of five-day
Cornhill Insurance Test matches played
between England and a touring team from
Australia (touring in 1993), India, New
Zealand, Pakistan, Sri Lanka or the West
Indies. A team representing England usually
tours one or more of these countries in the
British winter. Texaco Trophy one-day
international games also attract large crowds.
A World Cup competition takes place every
four years, and England were runners-up to
Pakistan in the 1992 final.
Cricket is also played by women and girls,
the governing body being the Women’s
Cricket Association, founded in 1926.
Women’s cricket clubs have regular local
fixtures, usually played at weekends, and may
participate in the national league and club
knock-out competitions. There are regular
county matches as well as an area
championship and a territorial competition.
450
SPORT AND ACTIVE RECREATION
Test match series and a World Cup
competition are played, with both major and
minor cricketing nations taking part.
Curling
The ice sport of curling originated in
Scotland, where it is now played by men and
women almost exclusively on purpose-built
rinks indoors. The governing body of the
sport in Scotland is the Royal Caledonian
Curling Club, which was formed in 1838; it
has over 21,000 members. Curling is played in
24 other countries, including England and
Wales. European and World championship
competitions take place annually, and it was a
demonstration sport at the 1992 Winter
Olympics.
Cycling
There has been a resurgence of interest in
cycling, both as a means of transport and as a
sport and recreation, and this has led central
and local government to make greater
provision for cycling. Activities include road
and track racing, cycle speedway, time-
trialling, cyclo-cross, mountain biking, touring
and bicycle moto-cross.
The British Cycling Federation is the
governing body for cycling as a sport, with
over 900 affiliated clubs. The Cyclists’
Touring Club has 40,000 members and is the
governing body for recreational and amenity
cycling and represents cyclists’ interests in
general. The Scottish Cyclists Union controls
the sport in Scotland.
Chris Boardman won a gold medal in the
1992 Olympics in the 4,000 metres individual
pursuit, and in August 1992 broke the world
record for 5,000 metres; on both occasions he
was riding the innovative Lotus superbike.
Equestrianism
Equestrian activities include recreational
riding, show jumping and carriage driving.
The arts of riding and driving are promoted
by the British Horse Society, which is
concerned with the welfare of horses, road
safety, riding rights of way and training. It
runs the British Equestrian Centre at
Stoneleigh in Warwickshire. With some
57,000 members, the Society is the parent
body of the Pony Club and the Riding Club
movements, which hold rallies, meetings and
competitions culminating in annual national
championships. Leading horse trials,
comprising dressage, cross-country and show
jumping, are held every year at Badminton
(Avon), Windsor (Berkshire), Gatcombe Park
(Gloucestershire), Bramham (West Yorkshire),
Burghley (Lincolnshire), Blair Castle
(Tayside) and Blenheim Palace (Oxfordshire).
Show jumping is regulated and promoted
by the British Show Jumping Association,
which has over 17,000 members and 2,800
shows affiliated to it. The major show
jumping events each year include the Royal
International Horse Show at Hickstead (West
Sussex); the Horse of the Year Show at
Wembley in London; and the Nations Cup
and Derby meetings at Hickstead.
The authority responsible for equestrian
competitions (other than racing) at
international and Olympic level is the British
Equestrian Federation, which co-ordinates
the activities of the British Horse Society and
the British Show Jumping Association.
British equestrian teams have a good record
in international competitions. At the World
Equestrian Games held in Stockholm in 1990
Great Britain gained six medals: one gold,
four silver and one bronze.
Field Sports
British field sports include hunting (on
horseback and on foot), fishing, shooting,
stalking, falconry and coursing. Fox hunting
on horseback with a pack of hounds is the
most popular British hunting sport.
Game shooting as an organised sport
probably originated in the late eighteenth
century, and takes place in many parts of
Britain. Game consists of grouse, black-game,
ptarmigan, partridge and pheasant. These
species are protected by law during a close
season, when they are allowed to breed on
numerous estates supervised by gamekeepers.
It is necessary to have a licence to kill game
and a certificate issued by the police to own a
shot-gun.
The British Field Sports Society looks
451
BRITAIN 1993: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
after the interests of all field sports. Public
opposition to field sports is considerable and
is organised through bodies such as the
League Against Cruel Sports.
Golf
Golf originated in Scotland, where for
centuries it has carried the title of the Royal
and Ancient Game. The oldest golf club in
the world is the Honourable Company of
Edinburgh Golfers. The Royal and Ancient
Golf Club, the ruling authority of the sport
for most of the world, is situated at St
Andrews on the east coast of Scotland. Golf
is played throughout Britain and there are
golf courses near most towns, a few of them
owned by local authorities; there are about
1,900 golf courses in Britain.
The main event of the British golfing year
is the Open Championship, one of the
world’s leading tournaments. Other important
events include the Walker Cup and Curtis
Cup matches for amateurs, played between
Great Britain and Ireland and the United
States, and the Ryder Cup match for
professionals, played between Europe and the
United States. Among the leading British
professional players are Nick Faldo and Ian
Woosnam, both of whom have won a number
of major tournaments and have recently been
ranked number one in the world.
Greyhound Racing
The racing of greyhounds after a mechanical
hare, one of Britain’s most popular spectator
sports, takes place at 36 major tracks.
Meetings are usually held three times a week
at each track, with at least ten races a
meeting. The rules for the sport are drawn
up by the National Greyhound Racing Club,
the sport’s judicial and administrative body.
The representative body is the British
Greyhound Racing Board.
There about 50 mainly small tracks which
operate independently. Like the major tracks,
they are licensed by local authorities.
Gymnastics
Gymnastics is divided into four main
disciplines: artistic gymnastics, rhythmic
gymnastics, sports acrobatics and general
gymnastics. Both men and women compete in
artistic gymnastics, although the apparatus
used differs. Men use the floor, pommel
horse, rings, vault, parallel bars and
horizontal bar, while women exercise on the
vault, asymmetric bars, beam and floor.
Rhythmic gymnastics is for women only and
consists of routines performed to music with
ribbon, balls, clubs, hoop and rope. Sports
acrobatics is gymnastics with people rather
than apparatus. General gymnastics is non¬
competitive and is available to all age groups
and to people with special needs.
In recent years the sport has increased in
popularity, particularly among schoolchildren,
and there are now about 1,000 clubs with
some 73,000 club members and a further
10,000 individual members of the British
Amateur Gymnastics Association. The
Association is the national governing body,
with the Welsh, Scottish and Northern
Ireland Amateur Gymnastics Associations
being affiliated to it.
Highland Games
Scottish Highland Games are events at which
sports such as dancing and piping
competitions take place and attract large
numbers of spectators from all over the world.
The main sports include tossing the caber,
putting the weight and throwing the hammer.
Among better-known Highland Games are the
annual Braemar Gathering, the Argyllshire and
Cowal Gatherings and a meeting at Aboyne.
Hockey (Field and Indoor)
Variants of hockey have been played in
Britain for at least five centuries. The
modern game was started in the nineteenth
century by the Hockey Association (of
England), which was founded in 1886 and
acts as the governing body for men’s hockey.
Parallel associations serve in Scotland, Wales
and Ireland. Throughout England there are
some 830 men’s hockey clubs, many with
junior sections. Large numbers of schools
also play the game; 500 are affiliated to the
Hockey Association. Cup competitions and
452
SPORT AND ACTIVE RECREATION
leagues exist at national, divisional or district,
and club levels both indoors (six-a-side) and
outdoors, and there are regular international
matches.
The controlling body of women’s hockey
in England is the All England Women’s
Hockey Association (founded in 1895), to
which are affiliated some 950 clubs and about
2,000 schools; separate associations regulate
the sport in Scotland, Wales and Ireland.
League, county, club and school
championships for both outdoor and indoor
hockey are played annually in England. The
first international women’s hockey match
took place in 1896. Regular international
matches are played.
Men’s and women’s hockey are Olympic
sports; at the 1988 Games the British men’s
team won a gold medal and in 1992 the
women’s team won a bronze medal.
Horse Racing
Horse racing takes two forms—flat racing
(throughout the year) and steeplechasing and
hurdle racing (normally from August to early
June). The Derby, run at Epsom, is the
outstanding event in the flat racing calendar.
Other classic races are: the Two Thousand
Guineas and the One Thousand Guineas,
both run at Newmarket; the Oaks (Epsom);
and the St Leger (Doncaster). The most
important steeplechase and hurdle race
meeting is the National Hunt Festival
Meeting held at Cheltenham in March. The
Grand National, run at Aintree, near
Liverpool, is the world’s best-known
steeplechase and dates from 1837.
Racing takes place on most days,
normally excluding Sundays,
throughout the year. The first Sunday
race meeting was held at Doncaster in
July 1992.
About 14,000 horses are in training.
British thoroughbreds continue to be a source
of the world’s best bloodstock
The Jockey Club administers all horse
racing in Britain. Its rules are the basis of turf
procedure and it also licenses racecourses. A
new British Horseracing Board is proposed to
be set up from 1 January 1993, which will
take over responsibility for race planning,
racecourse policy, the racing administration
budget and consultation with the industry.
Ice Skating
Ice skating became popular in Britain in the
late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries
and takes three main forms: ice dancing,
figure skating and speed-skating. The
governing body is the National Skating
Association of Great Britain, founded in
1879. Participation in ice skating is
concentrated among the under-25s. There are
over 70 ice rinks in Britain. British couples
have won the world ice dance championship
17 times.
Judo
Judo, an individual combat sport derived
from the ancient Japanese art of ju-jitsu, is
growing rapidly in popularity in Britain, as a
sport and general fitness training method and
self-defence technique. Men and women take
part in judo at all levels. More than 900 judo
clubs are registered with the British Judo
Association, which is the official governing
body of the sport throughout Britain.
At the 1992 Olympics the British judo
team won four medals: two silver—Ray
Stevens (half-heavyweight) and Nicola
Fairbrother (lightweight)—and two bronze—
Kate Howey (middleweight) and Sharon
Rendle (half-lightweight). Other recent
leading British exponents of the sport include
Karen Briggs, Sharon Lee, Densign White,
Elvis Gordon and Diane Bell.
Keep Fit/Aerobics
Various forms of movement and fitness
activities are practised in Britain that include
elements of eurhythmies, dance and aerobic
exercise. The different organisations have
varying emphases, but all are designed to
develop greater physical and mental well¬
being. The Keep Fit Association, formed in
1956, receives funding from the Sports
Council to promote physical fitness and a
positive attitude to health in England. Its
453
BRITAIN 1993: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
national certificated training scheme for keep
fit teachers is recognised by local education
authorities throughout Britain. Autonomous
associations serve Scotland, Wales and
Northern Ireland.
There are recognised governing bodies in
other activities. In addition, there are large
numbers of participants in circuit and weight
training and informal fitness activities.
Martial Arts
A broad range of martial arts, mainly derived
from Japan, the People’s Republic of China,
Taiwan, Hong Kong and Korea, has been
introduced into Britain during the twentieth
century. There are recognised governing
bodies responsible for their own activities in
karate, aikido, Chinese martial arts, kendo,
taekwondo and tang soo do. A review of
martial arts organisations was undertaken by
the Sports Council in 1990. As a result, an
Advisory Group on Martial Arts was
established to provide a forum for discussing
martial arts issues.
Motor and Motor Cycle Sports
Motor racing and rallying, and motor cycle
racing, are popular spectator sports in Britain.
The governing body for four-wheeled motor
sport is the RAC (Royal Automobile Club)
Motor Sports Association. The Association
issues licences for a variety of motoring
competitions and organises the Lombard
RAC Rally, an event in the contest for the
World Rally Championship, and the British
Grand Prix, held at the Silverstone racing
circuit as part of the Formula One World
Motor Racing Championship.
British car constructors including Lotus,
McLaren and Williams have enjoyed
outstanding successes in Grand Prix racing,
and Britain has had seven world champion
motor racing drivers. In 1992 Nigel Mansell
won the world title. By September 1992 he
had won nine of the season’s races, bringing
his career wins in Formula One to 30, the
most recorded by a British driver.
Other popular types of motor sport
include autocross, drag racing and karting.
Motor cycle sport, governed by the Auto-
Cycle Union in England and Wales and the
Scottish Auto-Cycle Union and Motor Cycle
Union of Ireland (in Northern Ireland),
caters for all forms of competition on two or
four wheels, from trials to Grand Prix road
racing. The major events of the year are the
Isle of Man TT races, the British Road Race
Grand Prix, the Ulster Grand Prix and other
world championship events for trials, moto-
cross, speedway and track racing. The Auto-
Cycle Union provides off-road training by
approved instructors for riders of all ages.
Mountaineering
All forms of mountaineering, which includes
hill-walking and rock-climbing, are growing
in popularity. There are around 100,000
rock-climbers and 700,000 hill-walkers, whose
representative body is the British
Mountaineering Council; separate bodies
serve Scotland and Ireland.
Britain can claim to have invented the
sports of rock-climbing and alpine-climbing.
The first recorded rock-climbs in Britain
were made more than 100 years ago, and the
Alpine Club, founded in 1857 and based in
London, is the oldest mountaineering club in
the world. British mountaineers have played a
leading role in the exploration of the world’s
great mountain ranges. The best-known is
Chris Bonington, who has climbed Everest
and led many successful expeditions
throughout the world.
Two national centres for mountain
activities are run by the Sports Councils: one
at Plas-y-Brenin in north Wales and the other
at Glenmore Lodge, near Aviemore, in
Scotland. Popular areas for rock-climbing are
south-west England, the Peak District of
Derbyshire, the Lake District in north-west
England, Wales and the Highlands of
Scotland. The Northern Ireland Centre for
Outdoor Activities at Tollymore provides a
focal point for those using the mountains and
hills of the province.
Netball
Netball was introduced into England in 1895.
It was first developed in the United States as
an outdoor exercise. More than 60,000 adults
454
SPORT AND ACTIVE RECREATION
play netball regularly in England and a
further 1 million participants come from
schools. The sport is played almost
exclusively by women and girls both indoors
and outdoors.
The All England Netball Association,
formed in 1926, is the governing body in
England. The English Schools’ Netball
Association is responsible for the sport in
schools. Scotland, Wales and Northern
Ireland have their own governing bodies.
Rowing
Rowing is taught in many schools, colleges
and rowing clubs throughout Britain. The
governing body of the sport in England is the
Amateur Rowing Association; similar bodies
regulate the sport in Scotland, Wales and
Northern Ireland. There are about 500
rowing clubs, and each year over 300 regattas
and head races are held in England, Wales,
Scotland and Northern Ireland under
Association rules.
The University Boat Race, between eight-
oared crews from Oxford and Cambridge, has
been rowed on the Thames almost every
spring since 1836. The Head of the River
Race, also on the Thames, is the largest
assembly of racing craft in the world, with
more than 420 eights racing in procession. At
the Henley Regatta in Oxfordshire, founded
in 1839, crews from all over the world
compete each July in various kinds of race
over a straight course of 1 mile 550 yards
(about 21 km).
At the 1992 Olympics Steven Redgrave
and Matthew Pinsent won the coxless
pairs, and Gregory Searle, Jonathan
Searle and Garry Herbert (cox) the
coxed pairs.
The National Water Sports Centre at
Holme Pierrepont, near Nottingham (see
p 440), has a rowing course of Olympic
2,000-metre standard, as does Strathclyde
Park in west-central Scotland.
Rugby Football
Rugby football takes its name from Rugby
School, in Warwickshire, where it is believed
to have originated in 1823. Since 1895 the
game has been played according to two
different codes: rugby union (a 15-a-side
game) is played by amateurs and rugby
league (a 13-a-side game) by professionals as
well as amateurs.
Rugby union is played under the auspices
of the Rugby Football Union in England and
parallel bodies in Wales, Scotland and
Ireland. Important domestic competitions
include the divisional and county
championships in England; the league and
national club knock-out competitions in
England and Wales; and the National League
and Inter-District Championships in
Scotland. The Five Nations Tournament
between England, Scotland, Wales, Ireland
and France is contested each year, and
overseas tours are undertaken by the
national sides and by the British Lions,
a team representing Great Britain and
Ireland.
Teams from 16 countries competed for the
first world cup competition in 1987. In the
second world cup staged in Britain, Ireland
and France in October and November 1991
England finished runners-up to Australia.
Seven-a-side rugby union has a strong
following. Tournaments include the
Middlesex Sevens, which is held every year
at Twickenham.
Rugby league is played mainly in the
north of England. The governing body of the
professional game is the Rugby Football
League, which sends touring teams
representing Great Britain to Australia, New
Zealand and Papua New Guinea; annual
matches are also played against France. A
team comprising Welsh-born players who
have turned professional also plays regular
international fixtures. The Challenge Cup
Final, the major club match of the season, is
played at Wembley Stadium in London.
The amateur game is governed by the
British Amateur Rugby League Association.
Matches between England and France are
held each year and tours are arranged to
Australia and New Zealand. A national league
consisting of ten leading clubs was formed in
1986, and a second division came into
existence in 1989.

Sailing
Sailing has always been popular in Britain,
and the Royal Yachting Association, the
governing body for the sport, has about
70,000 members and 1,500 clubs and classes.
Sailing in dinghies, motor yachts,
windsurfers, powerboats and cruisers takes
place at clubs throughout Britain. At the 1992
Olympics Robert Cruikshank, Lawrence
Smith and Simon Stewart won a bronze
medal in the soling class.
Skiing
Skiing takes place in Scotland from
December to May and also at several English
locations when there is sufficient snow. The
five established winter sports areas in
Scotland are Cairngorm, Glencoe, Glenshee,
the Lecht and Aonach Mor, all of which have
a full range of ski-lifts, prepared ski runs and
professional instructors.
There are over 150 artificial or dry ski-
slopes located throughout Great Britain,
which are in regular use. They are used
extensively by clubs and schools as well as by
skiers preparing for a holiday; over a third of
British skiers learned to ski on these dry ski
slopes. Britain has nearly 300 ski clubs, with
a membership of over 50,000. It is estimated
that L5 million people take part in the sport.
The governing body of the sport is the
British Ski Federation, and there are separate
national councils for England, Scotland,
Wales and Northern Ireland.
Snooker and Billiards
The character of the present game of
billiards was established in Britain at the end
of the seventeenth century. Snooker, a more
varied game invented by the British in India
in 1875, has greatly increased in popularity
and become a major spectator sport as a
result of heavy television coverage of the
professional tournaments. It is estimated that
between 7 and 8 million people now play the
game. British players have an outstanding
record in snooker and have dominated the
major professional championships. The main
tournament is the annual Embassy World
Professional Championship, held in
Sheffield. In 1992 Stephen Hendry was
world champion, for the second time. Other
British winners since 1980 have been Steve
Davis (on six occasions), John Parrott, Joe
Johnson, Dennis Taylor and Alex Higgins.
Mike Russell won the World Professional
Billiards Championship in 1991.
The controlling body for the non¬
professional game is the Billiards and
Snooker Control Council, which holds the
copyright of the rules. The World
Professional Billiards and Snooker
Association is responsible for professional
players, and organises professional events.
A growing number of women play
snooker and billiards. Their representative
body is the World Ladies Billiards and
Snooker Association, with around 250
members. A women’s world snooker
championship is played every year in
London, being won in 1991 for the fifth
time by Allison Fisher. The World Masters
event, staged in Birmingham, embraces
men’s and women’s singles and doubles as
well as mixed doubles. The Embassy World
Professional Championship was opened to
women in 1992.
Squash Rackets
Squash rackets originated at Harrow School
in the 1850s. Separate governing bodies are
responsible for the sport in England, Wales,
Scotland and Ireland. The governing body
in England is the Squash Rackets
Association, formed in 1989.
Squash enjoyed a period of very rapid
growth during the 1970s and remains a
popular sport. There are 9,100 squash
courts in England, and the estimated
number of players in Britain is 2 4 million.
The main tournament is the British Open
Championship.
Sub-Aqua
Underwater activities include wreck and reef
exploration, underwater photography,
marine life study and nautical archaeology.
The British Sub-Aqua Club is the
governing body for all underwater
456
SPORT AND ACTIVE RECREATION
techniques. It promotes safe diving, training,
science and sport. The Club is the largest of
its kind in the world, with over 46,000
members and more than 1,250 branches in
Britain and overseas.
Swimming
Swimming is enjoyed by millions of people in
Britain, many of whom learn to swim at
public baths, schools or swimming clubs.
Instruction and coaching are provided by
qualified teachers who hold certificates
awarded by the Amateur Swimming
Association, to which nearly 2,000 clubs are
affiliated. Northern Ireland forms part of the
Irish Amateur Swimming Association. The
Associations control swimming, diving,
synchronised swimming and water polo
championships and competitions.
For major international competitions, such
as the Olympic Games and the World and
European Championships, England, Scotland
and Wales compete together as one team
under the auspices of the Amateur Swimming
Federation of Great Britain. At the 1992
Olympics Nick Gillingham won a bronze
medal in the 200 metres breaststroke.
Table Tennis
The origins of table tennis are uncertain, but
it developed in Britain from around the
middle of the nineteenth century, becoming
an Olympic sport in 1988. In addition to
being one of the most popular indoor sports
for young people, it is played by a broad age
range of adults, with men outnumbering
women. Requiring relatively simple and
inexpensive equipment, table tennis is
played in schools, youth clubs and private
clubs.
The governing body for men’s and
women’s table tennis in England is the
English Table Tennis Association, to which
some 4,500 clubs are affiliated. There are
separate governing bodies in Scotland, Wales
and Northern Ireland.
Tennis
The modern game of tennis originated in
England in 1872 and the first championships
were played at Wimbledon in 1877. The
controlling body in Great Britain, the Lawn
Tennis Association, was founded in 1888;
Northern Ireland forms part of the Irish
Lawn Tennis Association.
The main event of the year is the annual
Wimbledon fortnight, one of the four tennis
‘grand slam’ tournaments. This draws large
crowds, with the ground at the All England
Club accommodating around 30,000
spectators. Prize money totalled ^4-4 million
in 1992. There are also national and county
championships and national competitions for
boys’ and girls’ schools. Short tennis is often
played by children under 10.
Tenpin Bowling
Tenpin bowling is played at nearly 200
indoor bowling centres throughout Britain.
More than 25,000 people belong to the
sport’s governing body, the British Tenpin
Bowling Association.
Volleyball
Volleyball was established in Britain in the
1950s, having first been played in the United
States at the end of the nineteenth century.
The number of registered players in Britain
grew substantially in the 1980s, with men at
first far outnumbering women; today, of the
total of 25,000 registered players, about
11,000 are women. Volleyball is popular
among schoolchildren and university and
college students. Mini-volley is a version of
the game adapted for children under 13.
Although volleyball can be played outdoors, it
is normally played in indoor sports halls.
The English Volleyball Association, the
Scottish Volleyball Association, the Welsh
Volleyball Association, and the Northern
Ireland Volleyball Association act as the
sport’s governing bodies.

BRITAIN 1993
AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
This is the 44th edition of the invaluable Britain Handbook, compiled
each year by the Central Office of Information with the co-operation
of government departments, agencies and many other authoritative
organisations. Comprehensive, succinct and accurate, it presents the latest
facts and figures on most aspects of British life. Britain 1993 describes the
workings of government and many other major institutions; the various
sectors of the economy; and social, environmental and cultural matters —
as well as British achievements in many fields. Extensive coverage is
given to recent major policy developments in, for example, the National
Health Service and education.
