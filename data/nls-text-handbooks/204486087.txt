INTRODUCTION
Britain : an official handbook, 1959, is the tenth in the series prepared
and extensively revised each year by the Reference Division of the Central Office
of Information with the co-operation of other Government Departments and of
many national organisations.
The Handbook, which is the mainstay of the reference facilities provided by the
British Information Services in many countries, was at first only available overseas
in a limited free edition. In 1954 it was placed on sale throughout the world and
has become widely known as an established work of reference.
Britain : AN official handbook, 1959, which covers events up to Sep¬
tember 1958, gives, like its predecessors, a factual account of the administration and
the national economy of the United Kingdom and of the part played by the
Government in the life of the community, thus presenting a continuing picture of
the pattern of life in Britain and a record of recent developments.
The Handbook does not claim to be comprehensive, nor does it attempt to cover
Britain’s participation in Commonwealth or world affairs. The factual and statis¬
tical information it contains is compiled from official and other authoritative sources,
and, while most sections of the book relate to the United Kingdom as a whole,
facts and figures for England, Wales, Scotland, and Northern Ireland are also
given separately when these are available.
Readers who require more detailed information on the United Kingdom should
consult the Annual Abstract of Statistics and the Monthly Digest of Statistics,
issued by the Central Statistical Office, and standard works of reference and
Government publications, some of which are listed in the bibliography at the end
of the Handbook. Readers are also asked to note that the Central Office of Informa¬
tion reference documents listed in the bibliography as free and marked with an
asterisk are available free of charge only at United Kingdom Information Offices
overseas; they can, however, be obtained in the United Kingdom from the
Reference Division, Central Office of Information, on payment of a small charge.

I. THE BRITISH ISLES
THE PHYSICAL BACKGROUND
The British Isles form a group lying off the north-west coast of Europe with a
total area of about 121,600 square miles. The largest islands are Great Britain
proper (comprising the greater parts of England, Wales and Scotland) and Ireland
(comprising Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland). Off the southern coast
of England is the Isle of Wight and off the extreme south-west are the Isles of
Scilly; off North Wales is Anglesey. Western Scotland is fringed by numerous
islands and to the far north are the important groups of the Orkneys and Shetlands.
All these form administrative counties or parts of counties of the mainland, but the
Isle of Man in the heart of the Irish Sea and the Channel Islands between Great
Britain and France have a large measure of administrative autonomy and are not
part of England, Wales or Scotland.
England (excluding the county of Monmouth on the Welsh border), has a total
area (including inland water) of 50,327 square miles and is divided into 40 geo¬
graphical or 49 administrative counties; Wales (including Monmouth), with a total
area of 8,017 square miles, has 13 counties, Scotland, including its 186 inhabited
islands, has a total area of 30,411 square miles and is divided into 33 counties.
Northern Ireland, consisting of six counties, has a total area of 5,459 square miles.
Together, these countries constitute the United Kingdom of Great Britain and
Northern Ireland with a total area of 94,214 square miles. The total land area of
the United Kingdom (excluding inland water) is 93,018 square miles: England,
50,051; Wales and Monmouthshire, 7,966; Scotland, 29,795; and Northern Ireland,
5,206 square miles.
Care must be taken when studying British statistics to note whether they refer
to England as defined above, to England and Wales (considered together for many
administrative and other purposes), to Great Britain, which comprises England,
Wales and Scotland, or to the United Kingdom as a whole. The position is further
complicated by the fact that the county of Monmouth is sometimes included with
England. United Kingdom statistics and other data sometimes include the Isle of
Man, 227 square miles, and the Channel Islands, 75 square miles, which are
strictly not part of the United Kingdom, but are dependencies of the Crown. Since
southern Ireland became an independent republic, official statistics do not normally
refer to the British Isles as a whole.
The latitude of 50° North just cuts across the southernmost part of the British
mainland (the Lizard Peninsula) and latitude 6o° North passes through the
Shetland Islands. The northernmost point of the Scottish mainland, Dunnet Head,
is in latitude 58° 40'. The prime meridian of o° passes through the old Observatory
of Greenwich (London), while the easternmost point of England reaches nearly
1 45/ East and the westernmost point of Ireland is approximately io° 30' West.
It is thus rather under 600 miles in a straight line from the south coast of Britain
to the extreme north and rather over 300 miles across in the widest part. Owing to
the numerous bays and inlets no point in the British Isles is as much as 75 miles
from tidal water.
The seas surrounding the British Isles are everywhere shallow—usually less than
50 fathoms (300 feet)—because the islands lie on the continental shelf. To the
1
2
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
north-west along the edge of the shelf the sea floor plunges abruptly from 600 feet
to 3,000. These shallow waters are important because they provide excellent fishing
grounds as well as breeding grounds for the fish. The North Atlantic Current, the
drift of warm water which reaches the islands from across the Atlantic, spreads out
over the shelf and its ameliorating effect on the air is thus magnified. The effect
of tidal movement is also increased by the shallowness of the water.
Geology and Topography
Despite their small area, the British Isles contain rocks of all the main geological
periods. In Great Britain the newer rocks, which are less resistant to weather, and
have thus been worn down to form low land, lie to the south and east, and the
island can therefore be divided roughly into two main regions, Lowland Britain and
Highland Britain.
In Lowland Britain the newer and softer rocks of southern and eastern England
have been eroded into a rich plain, more often rolling than flat and rising to chalk
and limestone hills, but hardly ever reaching a thousand feet above sea level. The
boundaries of this region run roughly from the mouth of the Tyne in the north-east
of England to the mouth of the Exe in the south-west.
Highland Britain comprises the whole of Scotland, the Lake District in north¬
west England, the broad central upland known as the Pennines, almost the whole
of Wales, and the south-western peninsula of England coinciding approximately
with Devon and Cornwall. Highland Britain contains all the mountainous parts1 of
Great Britain and extensive uplands lying above the thousand foot contour. This
high ground, however, is not continuous but is interspersed with valleys and plains.
Geologically the mountains and hills consist mainly of outcrops of very old rocks
(archaean and palaeozoic), while the top strata in the valleys and plains are mainly
more recent (carboniferous age) and similar to those in the northern and western
parts of Lowland Britain.
These carboniferous strata are rich in minerals and include the coal measures
which have been the foundation of Britain’s industrial expansion. The outcrops
and shallow seams of coal which have now largely been exhausted were found on
the edge of the plains and up the valleys leading to the high land. Most of the
present deep coal workings underlie the fertile lowlands.
Towards the end of Britain’s long geological history, when the ancestors of
present-day man had already settled in the country, came the great Ice Age, and
at one period or another during this time the whole of Britain north of a line join¬
ing the Thames and the Bristol Channel was covered by ice caps and ice sheets.
The ice naturally accumulated on the higher ground and swept from the mountains
of Scotland, northern England and Wales any loose rock or soil which had previously
been formed, so that when the ice eventually disappeared the hills stood out as
barren rocky areas, while a thick mantle of glacial debris—boulders, boulder-clay,
sands and gravels—lay distributed widely over the lower ground. The ice had
blocked up previous drainage channels and left large lakes, which have since
gradually dried up, leaving deposits of sand, silt and mud, often affording soils of
great fertility.
In Ireland, where the solid rocks are covered deeply by the debris left by the
ice sheets, the great central plain has large boggy areas, due to interruption of the
previous natural drainage. The mountains and hill masses of Ireland are irregularly
1 The highest peaks are: in Scotland, Ben Nevis, 4,406 feet; in Wales, Snowdon, 3,560
feet; and in England, Scafell Pike (in the Lake District, Cumberland), 3,210 feet. The
highest peak in Northern Ireland is Slieve Donard, 2,796 feet.

disposed round the fringes of the island, and in the higher parts the moorland cover
resembles that of the higher parts of Highland Britain.
Because of the complex geology and the varied relief which results, Britain has
not only very attractive and contrasting scenery within short distances but a charac¬
teristic, ever different, coastline. The ancient rocks of Highland Britain often reach
the coast in towering cliffs; elsewhere the sea may penetrate in deep lochs, as along
much of the west coast of Scotland. Bold outstanding headlands are notable features
in other parts of the varied coastline: the granite cliffs of Land’s End; the limestone
masses or forbidding slates of the Pembrokeshire coast in South Wales; the red
sandstone of St. Bees Head on the Cumberland coast; and the vertically jointed
lavas of Skye and the island of Staffa in the Inner Hebrides. Even around Lowland
Britain there are striking contrasts. In some parts the soft, white limestone—the
chalk—gives rise to the world-famous white cliffs of Dover or the Needles off the
Isle of Wight; while other parts of the south and south-east coastline have beaches
of sand or shingle. The eastern coast of England between the Humber and the
Thames estuary is for the most part low-lying, and for hundreds of years some
stretches of it have been protected against the sea by embankments. These have
occasionally been breached, as in the flood disaster of January 1953, which was
caused by the abnormal concurrence of violent gales and exceptionally high tides.
The marked tidal movement around the British Isles sweeps away much of the
sand and mud brought down by the rivers and makes the estuaries of the short
British rivers1 valuable as natural havens. In times past every little cove round the
rocky coasts afforded shelter to a fishing village from the waves of the North Sea or
the giant rollers of the Atlantic.
Climate
Britain enjoys a temperate and equable climate. It lies in middle latitudes to
the north-west of the great continental land mass of Eurasia, but as the prevailing
winds are south-westerly the climate is largely determined by that of the eastern
Atlantic, although occasionally during the winter months easterly winds may bring
a cold, dry, continental type of weather which, once established, may persist for
many days or even weeks. The weather from day to day is controlled mainly by a
succession of depressions from the Atlantic which, moving in a generally easterly
or north-easterly direction, pass over or near the British Isles. During the summer
months the Azores high pressure system extends its influence north-eastwards
towards north-west Europe, and the depressions take a more northerly course, often
passing entirely to the north of the British Isles.
Winds. In Britain, south-westerly winds are the most frequent, and those from
the south-east and east the least; easterly winds occur about half as often as south¬
westerly ones. In hilly country, wind direction may differ markedly from the
general direction owing to local conditions. Winds are generally stronger in the
north than in the south of the British Isles, stronger on the coasts than inland, and
stronger in the west than in the east. The strongest winds usually occur in the
winter; the average speed at 50 feet at Kew Observatory, on the western outskirts
of London, varies from about 10-3 m.p.h. in January and February to a minimum
in August of 7-5 m.p.h. The stormiest region of the British Isles is along the north¬
west coast with about 40 gales a year; south-east England is the least stormy, with
gales occurring on about 18 days a year inland and on some 25 days on the Channel
coast.
1 The longest rivers in England—the Severn and the Thames—-are only 210 and 200
miles long respectively.

Temperature. At stations near sea level the mean annual temperature ranges from
47° F. in the Hebrides to 520 F. in the extreme south-west of England; it is slightly
lower in the eastern part of the country in the same latitude. The mean monthly
temperature in the extreme north, at Lerwick (Shetlands), ranges from 390 F.
during the winter (December, January and February) to 530 F. during the summer
(June, July and August): the corresponding figures for Jersey (Channel Islands),
in the extreme south, are 430 F. and 63° F. The average range of temperature
between winter and summer varies from 150 F. to 230 F., being greatest at inland
stations in the eastern part of the country. During a normal summer, the tempera¬
ture occasionally rises above 8o° F. in the south, but temperatures of 90° F. and
above are infrequent. Extreme minimum temperatures depend to a large extent on
the environment, but 20° F. may occur on a still, clear winter’s night, io° F. is rare,
and o° F. or below has been recorded only during exceptionally severe periods
during the winter.
Rainfall. The British Isles as a whole have an annual rainfall of over 40 inches,
while England alone has about 34 inches. The geographical distribution of annual
rainfall is largely governed by topography and exposure to the Atlantic, the
mountainous areas of the west and north having far more rain than the plains of the
south and east. Between 150 and 200 inches of rain fall on the summits of Snowdon
and Ben Nevis during the average year, whereas some places in the south-east of
England record less than 20 inches. Rain is fairly well distributed throughout the
year, but, on the average, March to June are the driest months and October to
January the wettest, the former period of four months having about 60 per cent of
the rainfall of the latter. A period of as long as three weeks without rain is ex¬
ceptional, and is confined to limited areas.
Sunshine. The distribution of sunshine over the British Isles shows a general
decrease from south to north, a decrease from the coast inland, and a decrease with
altitude. During May, June and July—the months of longest daylight—the mean
daily duration of sunshine varies from five and a half hours in western Scotland to
seven and a half hours in the extreme south-east of England; during the months of
shortest daylight—November, December and January—sunshine is at a minimum,
with an average of 0-5 hours a day in the Highlands of Scotland and in the Peak
District (Derbyshire) and 2-0 hours a day on the south coast of England.
Soil and Vegetation
Many parts of the surface of Highland Britain have only thin, poor soils, with
the result that large stretches of moorland are found over the Highlands of Scotland,
the Pennines, the Lake District, the mountains of Wales and in parts of north-east
and south-west England. In most areas the farmer has cultivated only the valley
lands and the plains where soils are deeper and richer; villages and towns are often
separated by uplands with few if any habitations.
With the exception of a few patches of poor soil or rocky land, almost the whole
of Lowland Britain has been cultivated, and farmland stretches over the whole area
except where interrupted by urban and industrial settlements. Elaborate land
drainage systems have been developed through the centuries to bring under cultiva¬
tion the fertile soil of the low-lying Fenland of Lincolnshire and other nearby areas
in East Anglia.
With its mild climate and varied soils, Britain has a diverse pattern of natural
vegetation. When the islands were first settled, oak woodland doubtless covered the
greater part of the lowland, giving place to extensive marshlands, thin forests of
Scots pine on higher or sandy ground and perhaps some open moorland. In the
6
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
course of the centuries nearly all the forests have been cleared so that forest and
woodland now occupy only about 6 per cent of the surface of the country. Midland
Britain appears to be well wooded because of the numerous hedgerows and isolated
trees. The greatest density of woodland occurs in the north and east of Scotland,
in some parts of south-east England and in Monmouthshire on the Welsh border!
The principal kinds of trees are oak, beech, ash and elm and, in Scotland, pine and
birch.
There are various types of wild vegetation, including the natural flora of woods,
fens and marshes, foreshores and cliffs, chalk downs and the higher levels of moun¬
tains; the most widespread is that of the hilly moorland country, which consists
mainly of heather, grasses, gorse and bracken, with cotton grass in the wetter parts.
Most of Britain, however, is agricultural land, of which about a third is arable and
the rest pasture and meadow, a varied semi-natural vegetation composed of
indigenous grasses and flowering plants.
Farming land is divided into fields by hedges or stone walls and, especially in
the mixed farms which cover most of the country, presents a pattern of contrasting
colour. The cool temperate climate of Britain and the even distribution of rainfall
ensure a long growing season; streams rarely dry up, and grassland is green
throughout the year and studded with wrild flowers from spring to autumn; there
is scarcely a month in which some flowers may not be found in hedgerows and
sheltered woodland glades.
Fauna
i he fauna of the British Isles is in general similar to that of north-western
Europe. Some of the larger mammals, including the wolf, the bear, the boar and
the Irish elk, have become extinct; but red deer, protected for sporting reasons,
flourish in the Scottish Highlands and on Exmoor in Devon and Somerset, roe
deer are found in Scotland and in the wooded areas of southern England, and fallow
deer (which are not indigenous) have been introduced into parks. The badger, a
nocturnal animal, is rarely seen; there are foxes in most rural areas, and otters are
found along many rivers and streams. Seals are fairly common around much of the
coast. Smaller mammals include mice, rats, voles, shrews, hedgehogs, moles,
squirrels (the imported grey ousting the native red), hares, rabbits (a serious
farming pest before the recent outbreak of myxomatosis), weasels and stoats.
There are about 430 species of birds, including many song-birds. About 230
species are resident and the rest are regular visitors to Britain. The chaffinch and
the blackbird are probably the most numerous birds and are widely and evenly
distributed, but sparrows usually predominate near houses, and huge flocks of
starlings, which gather at certain seasons, may congregate in London and other
large towns. In general, the number of small birds has been on the increase for
several decades owing to their success in adapting themselves to a man-made
environment and also to their more considerate treatment by the public. The
number of large birds, on the other hand, has tended to decline except for those
specially preserved for sporting purposes, such as the pheasant, the partridge, and
the red grouse which is found only on the moors of Highland Britain.
The drainage and reclamation of marsh lands have diminished the natural
habitat of duck, geese and other aquatic birds. Such birds, however, now frequent
reservoirs, gravel pits and sewage farms in addition to the nature reserves and bird
sanctuaries which the Government, endowed with new powers, is establishing on
an increasing scale.
Reptiles are few; besides some small lizards, including the snake-like slow-worm,
there are two snakes, the poisonous (though not deadly) adder and the grass-snake!

THE BRITISH ISLES 7
The principal amphibians are frogs, toads and a few species of newt. River and
lake fish include salmon, trout, sea-trout, perch, roach, dace, grayling and pike.
There are more than 21,000 different kinds of insects, most of them small, in the
British Isles. Among the largest are the rare swallowtail butterfly (3 to 4 inches)
and the stag beetle (2^ inches). The insect fauna in Britain is less varied than that
of continental Europe. Many kinds which can withstand the severe cold of Scandi¬
navia, for example, seem unable to survive the frequent weather changes character¬
istic of the British winter. With modern methods of pest control, serious insect
damage to crops or timber is exceptional, and diseases commonly spread by insect
vectors are virtually unknown in Britain.
THE DEMOGRAPHIC BACKGROUND
The people who now inhabit the British Isles are descended mainly from the
people who inhabited them nearly nine centuries ago. The last of a long succession
of invaders and colonisers from Scandinavia and the continent of Europe were the
Normans, a branch of the Norsemen or Scandinavian Vikings who, after settling
in northern France, intermarrying with the French, and assimilating the French
language and customs, crossed to England and conquered it in 1066.
It is neither possible nor suitable to attempt in this chapter to estimate the rela¬
tive importance of various early peoples—pre-Celts, Celts, Romans, Anglo-Saxons
and the Norsemen, including the Danes—in the ancestry of the present English,
Scots, Welsh and Irish. It is significant, however, that over most of England and
the Lowlands of Scotland the language which soon came to predominate was
English, mainly a marriage of Anglo-Saxon and Norman-French, while the use of
Celtic languages persisted in Wales, Cornwall, the Isle of Man, the Highlands of
Scotland and in Ireland.
The available records do not permit of any precise estimates of the size of popula¬
tion or of the extent or direction of population movement until the beginning of
the nineteenth century. It is believed that at the end of the eleventh century the
population of Great Britain was of the order of two million, while at the end of the
seventeenth century a reasonable contemporary estimate put the population of
England and Wales at 5% million and the population of Scotland at about one
million. The main factor in this gradual growth of population was a slow natural
increase, the rate of which was retarded in Britain, as in all countries before the
development of medical science, by high death rates and particularly by very high
infant and maternal mortality. Immigration from the continent of Europe, e.g., of
Flemish weavers, was an influence at certain times.
From the beginning of the nineteenth century, information about the British
people—their number, sex, age, geographical distribution, births, deaths, marriages,
occupations, language and family structure—is relatively plentiful and reliable.
Most of it is derived from two main sources: the periodic census of population
which gives a national snapshot at a particular moment of time, and the regular
flow of statistical information based on statutory registration of births, marriages
and deaths.
The Census
Censuses of the people of Great Britain were taken regularly every ten years from
1801 to 1931. There was no census between 1931 and 1951, but a count of the
population by age and sex was a by-product of the national registration which was
instituted at the outbreak of the second world war in September 1939.

BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Censuses were taken on 8th April, 1951, by the appropriate authorities in the
United Kingdom, the islands of the British seas and the Republic of Ireland.1 This
was the first simultaneous population count covering all these areas since the
censuses of 1911. The co-operation of the Republic of Ireland in arranging a
simultaneous census was of particular value, owing to the considerable sea and
land traffic and the movement of population between that country and the United
Kingdom. Nearly all the reports based on these censuses have now been published.
The short demographic account of the United Kingdom given in this chapter is
based mainly on census reports and on the regular returns of births, marriages and
deaths, though some use has been made of other special investigations, including
the Reports of the Royal Commission on Population.2
Total Population
The enumerated population of the United Kingdom at the censuses taken on
8th April, 1951, was, to the nearest thousand, 50,225,000, excluding 158,000 persons
in the Isle of Man and the Channel Islands, which are not strictly parts of the
United Kingdom.
The population had increased by about 2-|- million since mid-1939, by about
4 million since 1931, by about 6 million since 1921 and by about 43 million—-or
about sevenfold—since 1700. The main causes of this increase were a progressive
reduction in death rates and a continuance of high birth rates into the beginning
of the twentieth century. The population is still increasing, though relatively slowly,
and at mid-1957 the home (de facto) population of the United Kingdom (i.e. those
people actually in the United Kingdom at that time) was estimated at 51,455,000.
The population density of the United Kingdom is one of the highest in the
world. It was approximately 533 persons per square mile at the time of the 1951
censuses, and had risen to 546 persons per square mile at mid-1957.
Birth and Death Rates. During the nineteenth century the annual birth rate was
usually about 35 per thousand of the population. The annual death rate was just
over 20 per thousand. Both birth and death rates fell over the last 30 years of the
century, but the natural increase of the population changed but little. It rose from
12 per thousand in 1851 to 15 per thousand in 1881, and fell to 11 per thousand in
1901.
These fertile years, with their comparatively high death rates in all age groups,
produced a population of low average age. At each successive census the population
of any age group exceeded the corresponding figure at the preceding census, while
the short expectation of life further reduced the ratio of older to younger persons.
When, therefore, death rates in all age groups fell by an average of about 33 per
cent, as they did between 1880 and 1910, the result was first a very low general death
rate which helped to maintain the population increase in spite of a fall in the birth
rate, and, secondly, a gradual increase in the average age of the population.
After the first world war the birth rate fell to less than half the nineteenth-century
rate. Even so, the population continued to increase slowly, though its average age
rose more rapidly (see diagram p. 11).

General Registry Office, Edinburgh; the General Register Division of the Ministry of
Finance of the Government of Northern Ireland; the Governments of the Isle of Man, of
Jersey and of Guernsey and its associated islands; and the Central Statistical Office of the
Republic of Ireland.

March 1949.

EXPECTATION OF LIFE AT BIRTH
Owing to the changing age composition, the general death rate has remained
nearly stationary at around 12 per thousand of the population though death rates
have continued to fall heavily in every age group, particularly among pre-school
children, school children, and adults in their thirties and forties, with a consequent
lengthening of the expectation of life from about 50 years at birth in 1900 to 1910
to about 70 years at birth in 1954 to 1956. From 1933 onwards the birth rate
steadied itself and thereafter rose slowly up to the outbreak of the second world
war, after which all orderly movement was interrupted by the disturbed conditions
of the war years. The 1947 birth rate (207 per thousand of the population) was
the highest since 1921, but the 1948, 1949, 1950 and 1951 birth rates were pro¬
gressively lower, though higher than pre-war. From 1951 to 1956, the birth rate
remained fairly steady and slightly higher than before the war, at about 15J to
16 per thousand of the population; in 1957, it was 16-3 per thousand (see
diagrams above).
Mortality Causes. The causes of the decline in mortality include better nutrition,
rising standards of living, the advance of medical science, the growth of medical
JO BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
facilities, improved health measures, better working conditions, education in per¬
sonal hygiene, public and private schemes to make the health services generally
available, and the smaller size of the family, which has reduced the strain on mothers
and enabled them to take greater care of their children.
Mortality from acute infectious diseases and from tuberculosis and infant an
maternal mortality have declined very sharply. Mortality from the main acute
infectious diseases of childhood is less than one-hundredth and mortality from
tuberculosis is less than one-thirtieth of the rate prevailing in the mid-nineteenth
century. Infant mortality has fallen by about 70 per cent since 1900. Between
1934 and 1942 maternal mortality was nearly halved, and is now only about one-
sixth of the 1934 rate. The reported mortality from many of the chronic diseases
of middle and old age, such as cancer of the lung and coronary thrombosis, has risen
during the twentieth century, and this rise, though exaggerated by the improvement
in diagnosis, is at least partly real. Medicine has not yet discovered effective
measures to combat some of these diseases, and improvement in positive health
does not always bring increased immunity or resistance to them.
Fertility Trends. The fall in birth rates in the latter part of the nineteenth and
the early part of the twentieth centuries was due mainly to a decline in the number
of children born per married couple (the average size of the family), caused by the
spread of deliberate family limitation. Couples married a hundred years ago pro¬
duced on the average rather more than six liveborn children. The decline seems to
have set in with those married in the eighteen-sixties, and continued steadily until,
with the couples married in the late nineteen-twenties, the average family size had
been reduced to between 2'2 and 21. The decline then stopped, and the figure has
remained stable in spite of the disturbance of the war years; the latest data suggest
a slight increase.
The generation of girls born about 1840, and married mostly between 20 and
30 years later, had about 40 per cent more children than were needed to replace
the original generation. Those born at the beginning of the present century had
only about 70 per cent of the number of children needed for replacement. Since
then the figure has been rising again and may reach full replacement with the
generations born during the second world war. But the rise has been due more to
the increased proportion of children surviving to adult life and of women getting
married than to the small increase in family size.
At first the decline in family size was most marked among the professional and
salaried classes. Among couples married between 1900 and 1930 the families of
manual workers were about 40 per cent larger than those of non-manual workers,
but this class difference appears to have been diminishing. The decline in family
size has been slower in Scotland and Northern Ireland than in England and Wales.
Migration. Since the beginning of the nineteenth century, net migration has been
markedly outward. About 25 million persons born in the British Isles are estimated
to have gone overseas in this period to settle in the United States and Common¬
wealth countries. On the other hand large numbers of Europeans, mainly Russians,
Poles, Germans and Hungarians, have entered the British Isles during the last
80 years. The net loss by migration since 1871 from the present area of the United
Kingdom is about 3J million. During the inter-censal period i93I—51 the net
balance of migration to and from the United Kingdom was inward for the first time
in the past century. The net gain to the United Kingdom from civilian migration
was about half a million, a net gain of three-quarters of a million to England and
Wales being offset by net losses from Scotland and Northern Ireland. This net gain
was the balance of a large outward movement mainly of British subjects emigrating,
THE BRITISH ISLES
II
mostly since i945> Canada, Australia, New Zealand and South Africa, and
a larger inward movement mainly of aliens from Europe, many of whom were
refugees seeking sanctuary in Britain. Taking only the period 1946-51 the balance
of migration by sea (figures for air transport are not available) was outward owing
to the high net outflow (some 65,000 a year) of British citizens to Commonwealth
countries overseas. In 1952 this net outflow reached a peak of 87,000, but it was
subsequently reduced, chiefly owing to increased immigration into Britain from
other parts of the Commonwealth, particularly the West Indies, and the net balance
of migration to and from all countries for the years 1952 to 1956 was certainly
small. In the fourth quarter of 1956 and the first half of 1957, however, there was a
marked increase in emigration to Canada. In 1957, total migratory movement
both into and out of Britain is estimated to have been very high, probably over
200,000 each way, with a slight outward balance.
Age Distribution. The first effect of the fall in the birth rate was to reduce the
number of children, and therefore the ratio of dependent population to working
PERCENTAGE CHANGE IN POPULATION SINCE 1901
BY AGE GROUP

— 50-1
12
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
population. This ratio was at a minimum in the 1930s. Since then the continuous
fall in death rates and the low inter-war birth rates have been increasing the propor¬
tion of elderly people, and thus reducing the proportion of the working population
to the total population. The small age groups born between the wars have been
coming to maturity. The size of the age groups reaching retirement age increases
yearly, as these groups were born during a period of rapidly expanding population.
The continuing fall of death rates in all age groups has still further increased the
number of old persons. Moreover, the higher birth rates since 1942 have arrested
the compensating fall in the number of dependent children and have thus reduced
the ratio of working to dependent population.
At mid-1957 the age distribution of the United Kingdom was estimated as
follows:
23 '2 per cent
65-3 per cent
11-5 per cent
Under 15
15 to 64
65 and over . .
During the present decade an unusually large proportion of the population of
the United Kingdom (about 15 per cent) is between 40 and 50 years of age.
Assuming that mortality rates continue to fall, and disregarding migration, it can
therefore be shown that:
(1) over the next 15 years the population of working age will increase slowly;
(2) the number of old people (over 65) will increase over the next 30 years by
about 2! million.
Sex Ratio. Total live births of boys currently exceed those of girls by about 6 per
cent, but owing to the higher infant mortality rate among boys, and the higher male
death rates in all age groups, women have for the past 100 years outnumbered men
from adolescence onwards and in the total population. Their predominance in¬
creases with age and is now over 60 per cent among persons over 70 years of age.
The fall in mortality has affected the sex ratio by increasing the proportion of old
persons in both sexes, which has made female predominance in those age groups a
weightier factor in the sex ratio of the population as a whole. At the same time
there has been a slight rise in the proportion of boys among children under 15 years
of age, and the ages at which males outnumber females extend beyond adolescence
to about 24 years.
The proportion of females to males in the total population has not varied greatly,
however, as these two effects have counterbalanced each other. At present there are
between seven and eight per cent more females than males.
Regional Distribution and Trends
The distribution of the population of the British Isles by country and major
administrative region as enumerated at the 1951 censuses, at certain previous
censuses back to 1841, and as estimated at mid-1957, is shown in Tables 1 and 2.
The populations of England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland and of each
of the principal regions of England were in every case greater in 1957 than in 1951
and in 1951 than in 1931, whereas in the period 1921-31 the populations of Wales,
Scotland and Northern Ireland had declined. Between 1931 and 1951> the greatest
increases were in the eastern, southern, midland and south-western regions of
England, and in Northern Ireland. The smallest increase was in Wales. Since 1951
the main increases have been in the eastern, southern and north midland regions of
England.

I4 BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
The population of the United Kingdom taken as a whole is predominantly urban
and suburban. During the nineteenth century, when the labour demands of newly
developing industry drew great numbers from the countryside to the towns, the
urban element continuously and rapidly outgrew the rural element. At the end of
the nineteenth century, 75 per cent of the British population was living within the
boundaries of urban administrative areas and the large conurbation^ was already
the dominant type of British community. By 1911, the economic and social limits of
these conurbations extended far beyond the administrative boundaries of the cities
which formed their core, owing to the building of outer suburbs which linked up
neighbouring towns. Since 1921, nearly 40 per cent of the population has lived in
the seven great conurbations whose centres are the cities of London, Manchester
(South East Lancashire), Birmingham and Wolverhampton (West Midlands),
Glasgow (Central Clydeside), Leeds and Bradford (West Yorkshire), Liverpool
(Merseyside), and Newcastle upon Tyne (see Table 2, pp. IS"16)-
During the twentieth century, the general character of urbanisation changed, the
later increases in urban areas being relatively much smaller and much more due to
the natural growth of the towns than to the influx of population from rural areas.
Moreover, two new and decided trends became apparent: first, the outer rings of
conurbations and the suburbs of large cities began to increase in population much
more rapidly than the large cities themselves; secondly, there was a considerable
migration, particularly of young adults, to the expanding new light industries and
suburban residential areas springing up in and around London and Birmingham.
This movement was intensified by the heavy unemployment of the inter-war years
which affected with particular severity the textile and heavy engineering industries
of Scotland, Northern England and South Wales.
The combined effect of these two trends was that the outer rings of the London
and Birmingham conurbations increased most in population, while the remoter
country areas and some industrial towns of Scotland, Wales and Northern England
declined. In urban areas in England and Wales, the medium-sized towns of between
50,000 and 100,000 inhabitants increased most rapidly, while the populations of
very large and very small towns tended to decline.
The second world war halted suburban building and for a time reduced the
population of conurbations and large cities, but by the end of the war many people
had returned to the neighbourhood of their pre-war homes. At the 1951 Census
many large cities and towns had larger populations than in 1939, but the popula¬
tions of others, notably London, were reduced. The decrease in the County of
London was about two-thirds of a million, and in spite of an increase in the popu¬
lation of the outer ring, the population of Greater London,1 2 8,348,023, was 380,000
less than in 1939. Since 1951, this decline has continued, while the populations of
many urban and rural areas surrounding Greater London have continued to increase
very rapidly. . .
Table 2 shows the distribution of the population by urban and rural districts
and the populations of the standard administrative regions, of the seven major
conurbations and of 16 large cities, some of which are the principal cities included
in the conurbations.

Middlesex and parts of the counties of Surrey, Hertfordshire, Essex and Kent.

Language
In England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland, English is the language pre¬
dominantly spoken. In Wales, however, Welsh, a form of British Celtic, is the first
language of most of the population in some of the central and northern counties
and was spoken by 29 per cent of the population at the time of the 1951 census.
In Scotland, nearly 100,000 persons, mainly in Ross and Cromarty, Inverness,
Argyll, and Lanark, speak the Scottish form of Gaelic,1 while a few families in
Northern Ireland speak the Irish form of Gaelic. The Manx and Cornish varieties
of Celtic are no longer effectively living languages, although, in the Isle of Man,
Manx is spoken by a few people, and is used in addition to English for certain
official pronouncements.
French is still the official language of Jersey, but in Guernsey English is now
used for almost all official proceedings. English is spoken throughout the Channel
Islands, although a Norman Trench, patois is still also spoken there by some people.
Social Patterns
A general summary of trends in social organisation, similar in scope to the fore¬
going summary of population trends, is not practicable. It may be useful, however,
to review some of the evidence relating to the structure of British households and
the extent and use of leisure in Britain in order to provide a background to the
information given in later chapters on such matters as town planning, housing, and
transport.
Number and Composition of Households
In Great Britain, as in other countries, most people live as members of private
households (usually families). Less than 5 per cent of the population was enumer¬
ated by the censuses of 1911, 1921, 1931 and 1951 in institutions such as hotels,
schools, and hospitals.
1 Most of the islands off the west coast of Scotland where Gaelic is spoken are included
in the counties of Ross and Cromarty, Inverness, and Argyll.
THE BRITISH ISLES
17
In 1911 there were about nine million private households1 in Great Britain. By
I95I> according to the censuses of England and Wales, and of Scotland, there were
about 142 million households, an increase of about 60 per cent. This expansion,
so much more rapid than the 19 per cent increase in the total population for the
same period, was, in fact, of the same order as the increases in the numbers of
persons over 24 years old and of married persons. In other words, the increasing
age of the population meant more but smaller families. The average size of house¬
hold in Great Britain fell from 4-5 persons in 1911 to 3-2 in 1951. In England and
Wales the number of persons living in households of one or two persons almost
trebled between 1911 and I951 • At the end of this period such households constituted
about 40 per cent of private households and comprised about 20 per cent of the
population in private households. About two-thirds of the persons living alone in
1951 were 60 years of age or over, while in 43 per cent of families of two persons, the
head of the household was 60 or over.
It has been difficult to increase the number of separate dwelling-places (houses
or flats) sufficiently rapidly to overtake the increasing number of private house¬
holds, and this difficulty was aggravated by the suspension of house-building and
the destruction of property during the second world war. There were in 1951 only
some 13 7 million structurally separate dwelling-places in Great Britain, and about
2 million households shared a home. It is unofficially estimated that about three-
quarters of all dwellings in Great Britain are terraced or semi-detached houses
(usually of 4 to 6 dwelling-rooms including bedrooms) while the remaining quarter
consists of detached houses and flats in approximately equal numbers. In 1951, the
proportion of flats was greatly above average in Scotland (estimated at about 60 per
cent) and considerably above average in London (estimated at 17 per cent).
Of the 14-I million private households in Great Britain in 1951, n| million were
estimated according to the 1951 Census One Per Cent Sample Tables (based on an
analysis of a representative one per cent sample of census returns in Great Britain)
to be of the simplest type, comprising married couples or widowed persons with
their childien, if any, or persons living alone. More specifically, they comprised
3 ’2 million married couples with no children, 900,000 widowed persons living
alone, 6 9 million married couples or widowed persons with children of any age,
600,000 single persons living alone. Over a third of all married couples living alone
were 60 years old or over; less than a quarter of the married couples under 40 years
of age in these simplest types of household had no children; and the majority of the
single persons living alone were over 40 years old.
Only 2 million households contained persons less closely related to the head than
parent or brother or sister, or contained non-relatives. In nearly half of these
households, a second family—a married couple or a woman with children—was
living with the first family, usually the parents. Of the remaining 1 -i million house¬
holds which contained some unrelated or distantly related persons (numbering
1 ’24 million), 300,000 households consisted of only two persons.
Over 8 million households (57 per cent of all households) were estimated in the
1951 Census Sample Tables to be without children under 16, while another 3-1
million contained only one child.
It was estimated that in 1951 there were 180,000 households in Great Britain
employing a total of 205,000 resident domestic servants, of whom 178,000 were in
England and Wales. This compares with an estimate of 706,800 resident domestic
servants in England and Wales in 1931.
1 Counting persons living alone as one-person households.
!§ BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Over half of the resident domestic servants in 1951 worked in small households
(of not more than three persons including the servant), while more than a quarter
were acting as the sole servant and household companion to one person of over
40 years of age. Already in 1951, a large proportion of resident domestic servants—
and possibly the majority of those working for families with children—were girls
from Ireland or from continental Europe, many of whom were attracted by the
opportunity to see Britain or to learn English. Since i95I 2> the number of girls
from overseas coming to take resident domestic posts has increased.
In the years since 1951, considerable changes in the numbers, size and com¬
position of households may have taken place. No firm information on trends is
available but, in view of the extent of housebuilding and the continued increase in
the number of old people it is likely that the average size of households has
continued to decrease.
The small average size of households does not imply that wider family and kin¬
ship ties are without strength and social significance. Indeed, a recent study1 has
stressed the importance of the mutual help of relatives and neighbours in the long-
established and balanced communities living in the more crowded parts of East
London. The survey, which also covered a suburban area of Greater London, noted
the dangers of weakening such ties when households are moved out to more
congenial suburban surroundings.
Work and Leisure
The great majority of British males over 15 years of age are in full-time gainful
employment, and the majority of females are either housewives or in full-time
gainful employment. In many cases housewives also undertake part-time or even
full-time employment.
Agreed hours of full-time work for the majority of occupations are usually about
44 hours a week, with some variation on each side. Actual weekly hours worked by
men average a little longer owing to overtime working, and actual hours worked by
women and girls average a little less. In addition, the journey to and from work is
often long. The 1951 census showed that three-quarters of the million and a third
persons working in central London lived outside it and that many travelled in
from the fringes of Greater London and some from farther away. A sample survey
of travel in Greater London, made in 1954, showed that 89 per cent of workers in
Greater London made regular journeys to work and that 56 per cent used public
transport. The average time taken by such persons was 39 minutes each way,
though for workers in central London it was 47 minutes each way.
There is also often a long journey for housewives to the main shopping centre
in both urban and rural areas. According to a sample survey made in 1946 it
averaged about 18 minutes each way, and in many rural areas took much longer.
In most areas there are, of course, a few shops much closer at hand.
According to a sample survey made in i947> only 6 per cent of housewives
employed any paid help, and only 1 per cent- had a resident servant. Such surveys
confirm, what would in any case be readily deduced from everyday experience, that
housewives have less leisure and considerably fewer periods of continuous leisure
of over one hour than other persons in Britain, in spite of the growth of the habit of
eating some meals away from home and the spread of labour-saving devices for the
1 Family and Kinship in East London, by Michael Young and Peter Willmott, published
by Routledge in 1957.

holds employing servants made in the 1951 Census Sample Tables (see p. 17).

home. (Three households in every five now have a vacuum cleaner, one in four a
washing machine and slightly less than one in ten a refrigerator.)
Compared with earlier generations, however, most people today have more
leisure. In many industries and services, hours of work are usually arranged to
give a five-day week, and most employees are entitled to two weeks’ continuous
holiday a year in addition to the statutory public holidays. About half the population
take at least a week’s holiday away from home every year, mostly in July and
August. Some two-thirds of these spend their holiday by the sea in Britain. A
relatively small but rapidly increasing number of holiday-makers go abroad: three
million in 1957, including about i-i million to the Channel Islands and to the
Republic of Ireland; in the same year, 1,180,430 overseas tourists came to visit
Britain.
At least a quarter of the adult population is interested in playing or going to
watch outdoor sports.1 Sporting interests are becoming increasingly varied but
Association football and cricket are still the most popular sports. In England alone
about 20,000 football clubs—mainly amateur clubs—are affiliated to the English
Football Association, excluding the numerous clubs in the armed forces, univer¬
sities and schools. Some 650,000 youths and men play in weekly football matches
during the winter months; spectators at professional football matches number
between one and two million weekly. Cricket is played by children, youths and men
of every walk of life, especially in England. Attendance at first-class cricket matches
is much smaller than at professional football matches, but the ‘Test’ matches with
the cricket teams of other Commonwealth countries are of nation-wide interest.
Cricket is less popular in Scotland, where golf has pride of place. Race meetings
throughout the country draw large crowds, while many other sporting events, for
instance, rugby football matches in the winter months and, in the summer, tennis
tournaments, especially the annual lawn tennis championships at Wimbledon, have
their smaller but devoted public. Amateur athletic associations flourish throughout
the country, and every form of outdoor pursuit from swimming, hiking, cycling and
motoring2 to hunting, shooting and fishing has an enthusiastic following, though
many sports, such as sailing, gliding, and rock-climbing, are practised only by
relatively few keen amateurs. Climatic and physical conditions in Britain afford
few opportunities for ski-ing and mountaineering, but numbers of people go abroad
regularly for these pursuits.
The spread of television has added a vast new audience of indoor spectators to
the crowds who go to watch sporting events and great national occasions. By mid-
rather more than half the families in Britain (and a somewhat higher proportion
of the large families) had a television set; viewers are fairly evenly distributed
among all sections of the population, irrespective of income or occupation. The
number of television licences is still increasing rapidly; from mid-1953 to mid-1958
the number more than trebled, to over eight million.
Rising standards of living and, in particular, the widely distributed ownership of
television sets and motor vehicles have affected leisure habits in many ways, both
good and bad, and have provided new and varied opportunities for recreation and
A social survey of Derby made in 1953 showed that half the adult population in that
town, including two-thirds of the men, were at least occasional spectators of sporting
events, and that over one-fifth, including over half those under 25 years of age, actually
participated, most of them regularly.
2 There were some 71 million licensed motor vehicles in the summer of 1957, of which
over 4 million were private cars and nearly million were motor cycles (including motor
scooters). Many cars and some motor cycles, however, are used partly, if not primarily,
for business purposes.

BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
entertainment. One result has been a marked fall in attendances at cinemas and, to
a lesser extent at football matches, formerly the main entertainments of large sections
of the community. The cinema remains, however, the most popular form of indoor
entertainment outside the home. Most young adults and school children go to the
cinema, and probably at least half of them go as often as once a week.
Attendances at theatres are much smaller, though most people visit them
occasionally. There are only some 500 theatres in the country compared with
some 4,200 cinemas. Nevertheless, there is an enthusiastic and growing public
not only for plays but for ballet, opera and concerts.
Dancing, mainly ballroom dancing, is popular, especially with those under
twenty-five years of age, and it is thought that about five million people go dancing
every week. There have been estimated to be some 450 regular dance halls in the
United Kingdom which open three times a week or more and employ a manager,
and between 4,000 and 5,000 recognised schools of ballroom dancing. Public dances
are also often held in other halls, while many of the clubs and societies which
abound in Britain hold dances from time to time in their own or hired premises.
Clubs and societies, which may be primarily social or devoted to some particular
purpose, range from small informal groups to great national and internationa
organisations with branches throughout the country. Organisations of national
importance in social life and in the promotion of social gatherings include, in
addition to those connected with religious denominations, the Working Men’s
Clubs and Institutes, the Townswomen’s Guilds and the Women’s Institutes.
There are some 3,^0 clubs, with over two million members (mainly but not entirely
men), affiliated to the Working Men’s Club and Institute Union. These clubs
are primarily social and recreational, though they also arrange lectures and classes.
Some 2,000 Townswomen’s Guilds, with a total membership of about 200,000
are affiliated to the National Union of Townswomen’s Guilds. The Guilds are
both educational and social in purpose, and they co-operate in many public
welfare activities. The declared objective of the National Federation of Women’s
Institutes is to improve rural life and amenities; the Institutes make an important
contribution to rural life by providing meeting places for countrywomen and by
organising social gatherings. There are in villages throughout England and Wales
some 8,400 Institutes with over 455,000 members, while in Scotland and Northern
Ireland there are Women’s Rural Institutes with similar aims and interests.
In spite of the growth of social clubs, one traditional social rendezvous, the
public house, has maintained and even increased its popularity both in towns and
in villages, although there has been a marked decrease in drunkenness and in
consumption of alcohol per head since the nineteenth century. The public house
now attracts a very wide circle of casual customers (both men and women) as well
as many ‘regulars’, who meet for a drink and a chat, and perhaps to play some
traditional public house game or to watch television. A recent, and in some ways
rival, feature of urban life, especially in Uondon and other large cities, is the coffee
bar. A characteristic of many of these coffee bars, which stay open until late at
night and are popular as a rendezvous for young people, is their modern decoi.
On the other hand many people, especially the married and the elderly, spend
much of their leisure at home—reading, listening to the radio or gramophone,
viewing television, looking after pets1 and pursuing hobbies. Hobbies are, of course,
innumerable in their variety, but many are practical and contribute to the improve¬
ment of the home. About four out of five families do most of their own decorating,
1 There are some four million dogs in Britain, over six million cats and eight or nine
million pet birds (mainly budgerigars and canaries).

while the sales of hand-tools and the rapidly increasing sales of small power-tools
testify to the extent and range of home carpentry and joinery. Even in the towns
many houses have some garden, and the standard of both towTn and country gardens
is high.
A number of people, young and old, find their main free-time interest in some
form of sustained group activity connected, for example, with the churches, trade
unionism, politics, social welfare and reform, or with cultural pursuits, especially
amateur dramatics and music-making (see the Arts section of Chapter VII). People
with such interests are, of course, in a minority,1 but they constitute an important
and characteristic feature of British life and, indeed, an essential ingredient in the
working of British democracy.
1 The figures from the Derby Survey showed that eight per cent of adults in that town
belonged to intellectual or cultural clubs or societies, eleven per cent were members of some
political party, thirteen per cent went to church every week (9 out of 10 homes had a Bible)
and three per cent held some church office.
II. GOVERNMENT AND
ADMINISTRATION
GENERAL SURVEY
The United Kingdom is a monarchical state, whose origins go back to the ninth
century when all England was unified under a Saxon king. Wales and Ireland
became part of the kingdom before the end of the thirteenth century, and the
English and Scottish thrones were dynastically united in the person of James l and
VI in 1603. In 1707, the Treaty for the Union of England and Scotland provided
that the two countries ‘should be forever united into one kingdom’, and one Parlia¬
ment (the Parliament of Great Britain) became the supreme authority in both
countries. In 1801, the authority of this Parliament was extended to the whole of
the United Kingdom by a provision of the Act for the Union of Great Britain and
Ireland, 1800, which joined the Irish Parliament to the Parliament of Great Britain.
In 1922, the United Kingdom was diminished by the separation of the 26 counties
of Southern Ireland (now the Republic of Ireland). Meantime, the Government o
Ireland Act, 1920, had enacted a constitution for Northern Ireland which per¬
petuated Northern Ireland representation in the United Kingdom Parliament as
the supreme authority and, at the same time, provided that country with its own
legislature and executive, to deal with domestic affairs. _
Fundamental policies on major issues are adopted for the whole of the United
Kingdom; methods of government, however, are flexible and adapted to inaiviaual
needs. Thus, there is a considerable devolution in the administration of Welsh
affairs under a Cabinet Minister (who is Minister for Welsh Affairs) assisted by a
Minister of State, who spends most of his time in Wales. Scotland has its own
system of law, its own courts, its own established church, its own educational
system and its own Government Departments which are under the direction of tne
Secretary of State for Scotland, who is a leading member of the United Kingdom
Government. The Northern Ireland Government Departments are responsible to
the Northern Ireland Parliament. The Channel Islands and the Isle of Man
(which are Crown dependencies, not part of the United Kingdom) have their own
legislative assemblies and systems of local administration and of law, and their
own courts. At the same time, they have a special relationship with the United
Kingdom because of their proximity to the mainland and the antiquity of their
connection with the Crown. They are treated as part of the mainland for purposes
of trade and postal communication and are ‘territories for whose international
relations Her Majesty’s Government is responsible’. They are also formally subject
to the United Kingdom Parliament.
The United Kingdom is thus a multi-national nation; it is also one of the member
nations of the Commonwealth, all of which (except the republics of India and
Pakistan and the Federation of Malaya) owe allegiance to the Crown. India, Pakistan
and Malaya accept the Queen as the symbol of the free association of the member
nations and, as such, as the head of the Commonwealth.
Each member nation of the Commonwealth has its own separate constitution,
governed by different laws and customs, and subject to different powers of change.
The United Kingdom constitution is formed partly by statute, partly by common

law and partly by precepts and practices, known as conventions, which are not
part of the law of the land in that violation of them may lead to proceedings in a
court of law, but which are nevertheless indispensable to the machinery of govern¬
ment. The rules of the constitution have never been codified, and can be changed
at any time by the passing of an Act of Parliament or by the general acceptance of
a new convention.
The three organs of government in the United Kingdom constitution are readily
distinguishable, although their functions often intermingle and overlap. They are:
(1) the Legislature, which consists of the Queen in Parliament, and is the
supreme authority in the realm;
(2) the Executive, which consists of the Cabinet and other Ministers of the
Crown, who are responsible for initiating and directing national policy;
Government Departments, most of them under the control of Ministers’
and all staffed by civil servants, who are responsible for administration at
the national level; local authorities, who administer and manage many
services at the local level; and statutory boards, which are severally respon¬
sible for the operation of particular nationalised industries or public services,
and which may be subject to ministerial control in varying degrees; and
(3) the Judiciary, which determines common law and interprets statutes, and
is independent of both the legislature and the executive.
This chapter will describe these organs of government in some detail in order to
show how the constitution of the United Kingdom works.
THE MONARCHY
The monarchy is the most ancient secular institution in the United Kingdom.
Its continuity has been broken only once in over a thousand years; and in spite of
interruptions in the direct line of succession, the hereditary principle upon which
it was founded has never been abandoned. Queen Elizabeth II is a descendant of
the Saxon king, Egbert, who united all England in the year 829.
The royal title in the United Kingdom is, according to the Royal Titles Act,
1953 • Elizabeth the Second, by the Grace of God of the United Kingdom of Great
Britain and Northern Ireland and of Her other Realms and Territories Queen, Head
of the Commonwealth, Defender of the Faith’. The form of the royal title is Varied
for the other member nations of the Commonwealth which owe allegiance to the
Crown, to suit the particular circumstances of each.
The seat of the monarchy is in the United Kingdom. In the other member
nations of the Commonwealth which owe allegiance to the Crown, the Queen is
represented by a Governor-General appointed by the Crown on the advice of the
ministers of the country concerned. The functions of the Governor-General are to
fill the role of ceremonial head of the State and to exercise the prerogative powers
of the Crown in public administration according to the constitutional practice
obtaining in the country to which he is accredited. As the Queen’s representative,
the Governor-General is wholly independent of the United Kingdom Government;
he is often a national of the country in which he holds office. In the United Kingdom
dependencies the Queen is represented by Governors-General, Governors, High
Commissioners or Residents, who are appointed by the Crown, but who have, in
addition, varying executive and legislative powers, and are responsible to the United
Kingdom Government for the good government of the countries concerned. In the
Channel Islands, and in the Isle of Man, the Queen is represented by a Lieutenant-
Governor.

GOVERNMENT AND ADMINISTRATION 25
Both the permanence of the monarchy, and its divisibility, have been ascribed
to the fact that the United Kingdom has no rigid constitutional code. Principles
and practice are both alterable, and the rules of the constitution can be adapted to
changing conditions without serious disturbance to existing organs and forms.
Succession
The title to the Crown derives from the Act of Settlement, 1701, which laid it
down that ‘the Crown . . . shall remain and continue to the said most excellent
Princess Sophia1 and the heirs of her body being Protestants’. Subsequent Succes¬
sion to the Crown Acts have confirmed this declaration; and although succession is
not bound to continue in its present line, it cannot now be altered (under a provision
of the Statute of Westminster, 1931) except by common consent of the member
nations of the Commonwealth which owe allegiance to the Crown.
The inheritance of the Crown is governed by rules of descent, which provide that
the sons of the Sovereign are in Order of Succession to the Throne according to
their seniority, or, if there are no sons, the daughters in order of seniority. When a
daughter succeeds, she becomes Queen-Regnant, and powers of the Crown are
vested in her as fully and effectively as though she were a king. By convention, the
consort of a king takes the rank and style of her husband; but the converse does not
aPPly> and the constitution has never attached any special rank or privileges to the
husband of the Queen-Regnant.
Accession
There is no interregnum between the death of one Sovereign and the accession of
another. Immediately on the death of his or her predecessor the new Sovereign is
proclaimed at an Accession Council to which all members of the Privy Council are
summoned. The Lords Spiritual and Temporal, the Lord Mayor, Aldermen and
other leading citizens of the City of London, and the High Commissioners in
London of the member nations of the Commonwealth are also invited to attend.
Coronation
The coronation of the Sovereign follows the accession after an interval which
may last for a year or more. The ceremony, which has frequently been modified
in detail to bring it into conformity with the customs of the time, has remained
much the same in substance for nearly a thousand years. The service used at the
coronation of Queen Elizabeth II in 1953 was derived from that used at the
coronation of King Edgar at Bath in the year 973.
The coronation service is held at Westminster Abbey in the presence of repre¬
sentatives of the peers, the Commons and all the great public interests in the United
Kingdom, of the Prime Ministers and leading members of the other Common¬
wealth countries, and of representatives of foreign States.
Acts of Government
The Queen is the personification of the State. In law, she is the head of the
executive, an integral part of the legislature, the head of the judiciary in England
and Wales, Northern Ireland, and Scotland, the commander-in-chief of all the
armed forces of the Crown and the temporal head of the established Church of
England. In practice, as a result of a long evolutionary process, during which many
restrictions on the Royal Prerogative have been imposed, these powers have changed
from being the weapon of the monarchy to being the means of giving effect to the
1 The Electress of Hanover, grand-daughter of James I.
26 BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
public will. Today, the Queen acts only on the advice of her ministers which she
cannot constitutionally ignore. She reigns, but she does not rule. The United King¬
dom is governed by Her Majesty’s Government in the name of the Queen.
Within this framework, and in spite of the fact that the trend of legislation during
the past hundred years has been to assign powers directly to ministers without any
necessity for royal intervention, there are still important acts of government which
require the participation of the Queen.
The Queen summons, prorogues and dissolves Parliament; she opens the new
session with a speech from the throne; and she must give Royal Assent before a Bill
which has passed all its stages in both Houses of Parliament becomes a legal enact¬
ment. The Queen is ‘the fountain of justice’, and in spite of the fact that the
judiciary is now completely independent of the executive, all jurisdictions of the
courts are either indirectly or immediately derived from the Crown . As the foun¬
tain of honour’, the Queen confers peerages, knighthoods and other honours,1 and
she makes appointments to all important State offices, including those of judges,
officers in the armed forces, governors, and diplomats, and to all leading positions
in the established Church of England. The Queen’s consent and approval are
required before a minister can take up office or a Cabinet be formed. In the realm
of international affairs, by virtue of her pre-eminence as head of the State, the
Queen has the prerogative power to conclude treaties, to cede or accept territory,
to declare war and to make peace.
Other prerogative powers of the Crown relate to the creation of corporations by
Royal Charter; the construction and supervision of harbours; the guardianship of
infants and persons of unsound mind; the administration of charities; coinage, the
grant of franchises, e.g., markets, ferries and fisheries; the right to treasure trove;
and the sole right of printing or licensing others to print the Bible, the Book of
Common Prayer and State papers.
There is clear ministerial responsibility for all these acts of government, as is
shown in the three ways in which the royal will can be constitutionally expressed:
by Order in Council made ‘by and with the advice of the Privy Council’; by
Order, Commission or Warrant signed personally with the Queen s initials and
generally bearing the signature of one or more responsible ministers; or by Pro¬
clamation, Writs, Letters Patent, or other documents under the Great Seal affixed
by the Lord Chancellor in obedience to a Royal Warrant countersigned by a
minister.
Ministerial responsibility for the exercise of powers by the Crown does not
detract from the importance of the participation of the Sovereign in the smooth
working of government; for although the Queen has no personal authority and
must show complete impartiality in every field, she must be informed and con¬
sulted on every aspect of the national life to the widest possible extent. The Queen
holds meetings of the Privy Council, gives audiences to her ministers and other
holders of office at home and overseas, receives accounts of Cabinet decisions, reads
dispatches and signs innumerable State papers.
Such is the significance attached to these royal functions that provision has been
made by Acts of Parliament for a Regent to be appointed to fulfil them if the
Sovereign is totally incapacitated, or if the Heir Apparent or the Heir Presumptive
is under the age of eighteen on accession to the throne. The latest of these Acts
1 Most honours are conferred by the Sovereign on the advice of the Prime Minister; a
few i e the Order of Merit, the Royal Victorian Order, the Most Noble Order of the
Garter, and the Most Noble and Most Ancient Order of the Thistle, are conferred by the
Sovereign personally.
GOVERNMENT AND ADMINISTRATION 27
the Regency Act, 1953 laid down that the first potential Regent should be the
Duke of Edinburgh and thereafter the Princess Margaret and then those in
succession to the throne who are of age. In the event of the Sovereign’s partial
incapacity or absence abroad, provision is made for the appointment of Counsellors
of State to carry out those of the royal functions which are delegated to them.
Ceremonial
Ceremonial has always been associated with the kings and queens of the British
Isles, and in spite of the changes that have taken place with the altered outlook of
both the Sovereign and the people, certain customs and usages are the same today
as they were many centuries ago. Royal marriages, the birth of royal children and
royal funerals are still marked by ancient ceremonial, although to a lesser degree
than in former days; and the birthday of the Sovereign, formerly the occasion of
many royal and public functions, is today officially celebrated early in June by
Trooping the Colour on the Horse Guards Parade. State banquets still take place
when a foreign monarch or head of State pays a visit to the United Kingdom;
investitures are still held at Buckingham Palace; and Royal processions continue
to grace such social occasions as the Ascot Race Meeting, known as Royal Ascot,
and to add significance to the opening of Parliament, when the Queen drives in
state from Buckingham Palace.
The Sovereign is the leader of society by order of general precedence dating from
the fourteenth century and sustained until the present day by royal ordinances,
ancient usage, established custom and the public will. The Queen’s presence at
the inauguration of scientific, artistic, industrial, and charitable works of national
importance ensures nation-wide interest and support.
PARLIAMENT
The supreme legislative authority in the United Kingdom is the Queen in
Parliament, that is to say the Queen and the two Houses of Parliament—the House
of Lords and the House of Commons—which together represent all the elements
in the nation.
I he three sections of ‘Parliament’ in this sense are outwardly separate: they are
constituted on entirely different principles; they do different work in different
places and they meet only on occasions of great symbolic significance such as the
Coronation or the opening of Parliament by the Queen in person, when the
Commons are summoned by the Queen to the House of Lords. As a law-making
organ of State, however, Parliament is a corporate body and cannot legislate with¬
out the concurrence of all its parts, except in the case of measures passed under
the Parliament Acts, 1911 and 1949.
The Parliament at Westminster is representative of all the countries of the United
Kingdom; it can legislate for all the British Islands; for the United Kingdom; for
Great Britain; for England and Wales separately, or for Scotland alone. It is not,
however, the only legislature, for the Northern Ireland Parliament has power to
legislate in certain spheres, and within the British Islands the ancient legislatures
of the two Channel Island Bailiwicks (the States) and of the Isle of Man (the
Tynwald) both legislate on domestic matters.1 Nevertheless, the Parliament at
1 The legislatures of the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man consist of the Queen, the
Privy Council and the local assemblies. It is the duty of the Home Secretary, as the
member of the Privy Council primarily concerned with island affairs, to scrutinise each
legislative measure before it becomes law.
28 BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Westminster retains supreme authority, and within practical limits there is nothing
that it cannot legally do. Tt • j tt-
By the passing of the Parliament Act, 1911 > the normal life of the United King¬
dom Parliament was fixed at five years (although it may be and often is dissolved
in less than that time); and since one Parliament cannot bind its successor (for
otherwise the succeeding Parliament would not be sovereign or supreme), each
assembly has a period of time of up to five years during which it may legislate
exactly as it chooses. During its life, it can make or unmake any law; it can destroy
by statute the most firmly established convention of the constitution; it can legalise
past illegalities and thus reverse the decisions of the courts; and it even has power
to prolong its own life by legislative means beyond the normal period of five years
without consulting the electorate.
In law, therefore, the supremacy of Parliament is absolute. In practice, Parliament
does not attempt to exert its supremacy in this way. In the first place, pressure of
business in recent decades has resulted in a large and increasing amount of delega¬
tion of legislative authority to ministers, and of specific powers to local authorities
and to public corporations of various kinds. Powers delegated in this way could,
of course, be withdrawn by Parliament, but existing demands on parliamentary
time make such a development extremely unlikely. Secondly, the system of party
government in the United Kingdom effectively discourages Parliament from acting
in too arbitrary a fashion; any parliamentary majority which abused its powers
would almost certainly suffer severely at the hands of the electors.
The Meeting of Parliament
A ‘Parliament’, in the sense of a parliamentary period, begins and ends with a
proclamation made by the Sovereign on the advice of the Privy Council. Such a
proclamation on the one hand dissolves an existing Parliament and, on the other,
orders the issue of writs for the election of a new one and appoints the day and
place of its meeting.
Formerly the death of a Sovereign involved the dissolution of Parliament, since
Parliament meets on the personal summons of the monarch. However, since the
passing of the Representation of the People Act, 1867, made the duration of Parlia¬
ment independent of the demise of the Crown, both Houses stand adjourned only
until their members have taken the Oath of Allegiance to the new Sovereign, which
occurs immediately after the Accession Council has made the order for Proclamation.
The time between the meeting of a Parliament and its prorogation or dissolution
is called a session. Parliament is usually prorogued by a commission under the Great
Seal, which appoints the day and place of its meeting in a new session. The date so
appointed may be brought forward or deferred by a subsequent proclamation. The
effect of a prorogation is at once to terminate all business until Parliament is sum¬
moned again, when any measures not yet passed must be re-introduced, unless it
has been decided that they are to be abandoned.
During the session, either House may adjourn itself on its own motion to such
date as it pleases. An adjournment does not affect uncompleted business. A re¬
assembly of the House can be accelerated either by proclamation or by virtue of
powers specially conferred by each House on its Speaker.
The average length of a session is about 160 sitting days, divided by custom into
the following periods: one from November until Christmas lasting about 3° sitting
days, one from January to Easter of about 50 sitting days, one from Easter until
Whitsun of about 30 sitting days, and one from Whitsun until the end of July
lasting about 40 sitting days. In addition, in recent years, the session has usually
GOVERNMENT AND ADMINISTRATION

concluded with a short period of about 10 sitting days in October, after the long
summer recess.
The House of Lords
The House of Lords consists of over 800 peers, as follows: (1) princes of the
royal blood (who nowadays take no active part in proceedings), (2) 26 spiritual
peers (the two archbishops and 24 senior bishops of the Church of England), (3)
all hereditary peers (other than minors and those who have not proved their right
to a writ of summons) of England, Great Britain, and the United Kingdom,1
(4) 16 hereditary peers of Scotland elected from their own number for each Parlia¬
ment in accordance with the provisions of the Treaty of Union, 1707, (5) two
representative peers of Ireland elected for life,2 (6) nine Lords of Appeal in
Ordinary appointed to perform the judicial duties of the House and holding their
seats therein for life, and (7) a number of life peers (including life peeresses)
created (under the provisions of the Life Peerages Act, 1958) to bring into the
House persons of eminence and authority who may not wish to accept a hereditary
peerage.
Temporal peerages (both hereditary and life) are conferred as a mark of distinc¬
tion by the Sovereign on the advice of the Prime Minister. Hereditary peerages,
with the exception of the Scottish and Irish peerages, carry with them, for men over
21 years of age, a right to a seat in the House of Lords, but, according to Standing
Orders promulgated by the House on 16th June, 1958, holders are asked, at
the beginning of each Parliament, whether they will attend the sittings of the House
as often as they reasonably can or whether they desire to be relieved of the obligation
of attendance. If they do so desire, they are required to apply for leave of absence,
either for the duration of the Parliament or for a shorter period, during which they
are not expected to attend the House. This system helps to ensure that there is a
known working body of peers, actively and continuously carrying out the parlia¬
mentary functions of the Lords.
Peers in constant attendance at the House of Lords are generally persons of
considerable experience, many of whom are elder statesmen and others who have
spent their lives in public service. They receive no salary for their work in the
House of Lords; but they are entitled to travelling expenses from their homes to
the Palace of Westminster (provided they attend at least one third of the number
of sittings), and (with the exception of the Lord Chancellor, the Lord Chairman
of Committees and any member in receipt of a salary as the holder of a ministerial
office) they may claim payment for expenses incurred for the purpose of attendance
at the House, except for judicial sittings, within a maximum of three guineas a day.
The House of Lords is presided over by the Lord Chancellor, who is the Speaker
of the House. The permanent officers include the Clerk of the Parliaments, who is
charged with keeping the records of proceedings and judgments and who pro¬
nounces the words of assent to Bills; the Gentleman Usher of the Black Rod, who
enforces the orders of the House; and the Serjeant-at-Arms, who attends the Lord
Chancellor.
The House of Commons
The House of Commons is a popular assembly elected by an almost universal
adult suffrage and containing members from all sections of the community
1 Peerages created between 1707 (the Treaty for the Union of England and Scotland) and
1800 are peerages of Great Britain; those created since the Act for the Union of Great
Britain and Ireland, 1800, are peerages of the United Kingdom.
“ By the Act for the Union of Great Britain and Ireland, 1800, the Irish peers were
entitled to elect 28 representatives, but since 1922 no new peers have been elected.
30 BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
regardless of income or occupation. There are at present 630 members of the House
of Commons (511 for England, 36 for Wales, 71 for Scotland, 12 for Northern
Ireland). , .
Members of the House of Commons, who receive a salary for their parliamentary
work, hold their seats during the life of a Parliament. They are elected either at a
General Election, which takes place after a Parliament has been dissolved and a new
one summoned by the Sovereign, or at a by-election, which is held when a vacancy
occurs in the House as a result of the death or resignation of a member or as a
result of the elevation of a member of the House of Commons to the House of
The chief parliamentary officer of the House of Commons is the Speaker, who is
elected by the members as president of the House immediately after a new Parlia¬
ment is formed. Other parliamentary officers of the blouse are the Chairman of
Ways and Means, and the Deputy-Chairman, who may act as Deputy Speaker;
both these officers are elected by the House. In addition, there are the party officials,
i.e. the Government and Opposition Whips. Non-parliamentary or permanent
officers of the House, i.e. those who are not members of Parliament, include the
Clerk of the House of Commons, who is charged with such matters as keeping the
records, endorsing Bills and signing Orders; the Serjeant-at-Arms, who attends
the Speaker in the House; and the Chaplain to the Speaker.
Parliamentary Electoral System
For electoral purposes, the United Kingdom is divided into constituencies, each
of which returns one member to Parliament. In order that the people shall at all
times be equitably represented by this means, permanent Boundary Commissions
for England, Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland (established in 1944) keep con¬
stituencies constantly under review and submit periodic reports, either recommend¬
ing some alteration in boundaries if, for instance, movement of the population has
made this necessary, or recommending no change. Changes in the boundaries of
constituencies which came into effect for the 1955 General Election increased the
number of seats in the House of Commons from 625 to 630.
The law relating to parliamentary elections is contained in three consolidating
statutes, the most important of which is the Representation of the People Act, 1949,
which repeals and re-enacts in a single statute previous legislation relating to the
franchise, the conduct of elections and corrupt and illegal electoral practices. 1 he
other Acts are the House of Commons (Redistribution of Seats) Act, i949> an<^
Election Commissioners Act, 1949- Under the provisions of these Acts, election to
the House of Commons is decided by secret ballot in which all United Kingdom
citizens (except members of the House of Lords) and all citizens of the Common¬
wealth and of the Republic of Ireland who are resident in the United Kingdom
are entitled to vote, provided that they are 21 years old or over, and unless they
suffer any legal incapacity to vote. A register containing the names of all electors is
prepared and published yearly by registration officers, who, in England and Wales,
are usually the clerks of local councils, and in Scotland are the lands valuation
assessors. Electors normally vote in person at polling stations specially established
for the purpose, although Service voters, i.e. members of the armed forces, Crown
servants of the United Kingdom employed overseas, and the wives of such persons
if resident overseas with their husbands, may vote by proxy. Voting by post, or in
certain cases by proxy, may also be allowed if the voter cannot attend in person for
such reasons as illness or the nature of his work. All entitled to vote may stand for
election, except undischarged bankrupts, clergymen of the established Churches of
England and Scotland, of the Church of Ireland and of the Roman Catholic Church,

and persons disqualified under the House of Commons Disqualification Act, 1957,
i.e. persons who are holders of public offices or members of public services listed
in the Act.
Parliamentary Privilege
Both Houses of Parliament enjoy certain privileges and immunities designed to
protect them from unnecessary obstruction in carrying out their duties. These
privileges apply collectively to both Houses and individually to each member.
In the House of Commons, the Speaker formally claims from the Crown for the
Commons ‘their ancient and undoubted rights and privileges’ at the beginning of
each Parliament. These include freedom from arrest in civil proceedings for a
period of forty days before to forty days after a session of Parliament; freedom of
speech in debate; and the right of access to the Crown, which is a collective
privilege of the House. Further privileges include the right to control its own
proceedings (so that it has been able, when the public interest so required, to debate
in secret); the right to pronounce upon legal disqualifications for membership and
to declare a seat vacant on such grounds; and the right to punish those who commit
a breach of its privileges.
The privileges of the House of Lords are: freedom from civil arrest for peers as
for members of the House of Commons; freedom of speech in debate; freedom of
access to the Sovereign for each peer individually; and the right to commit for con¬
tempt. These privileges are not formally claimed by the Speaker as in the House
of Commons; they exist independently without grant.
The Party System
The party system has existed in one form or another since the seventeenth cen¬
tury, and has now become an essential element in the working of the constitution.
The present system is based upon the existence of organised political parties,
each laying rival policies before the electorate. Whenever there is a General Election,
these parties may all put up candidates for election; independent candidates may
also stand.1 The electorate then indicates, by its choice of candidate at the poll on
election day, which of the opposing policies it would like to see put into effect.
The party which wins the majority of seats (although not necessarily the majority
of votes) at a General Election, or which is able to command a majority of sup¬
porters in the House of Commons, forms the Government. By tradition, the leader
of the majority party is appointed as Prime Minister by the Sovereign, usually on
the formal advice of the retiring Prime Minister; and its most outstanding members
in the House of Lords and the House of Commons receive ministerial appointments
on the advice of the Prime Minister. The largest minority party becomes the official
Opposition with its own leader and its own council of discussion or ‘shadow
Cabinet’; while the members of any other parties or any Independents who have
been elected may support the Government or the Opposition according to their
party’s or their own view of the policy being debated at any given time.
In the General Election which took place on the 26th May, 1955, 76-8 per cent
of the electorate voted, compared with 76-1 per cent in 1945, 84 per cent in 1950,
and 82-6 per cent in 1951. The number of votes cast for the principal parties is
shown in Table 3.
1 In the General Election of May 1955, the choice was between Labour and Conservative
in most constituencies. Liberal candidates numbered no. In a few constituencies, two of
the parties agreed to support the same candidate. The number of candidates representing
other political parties was very small.

in 90 years that a Government in office had been returned with an increased majority. Sinn
Fein candidates headed the poll in two Northern Ireland constituencies, but as they were
serving sentences of penal servitude (for taking part in an armed raid on an army barracks
in 1954) they were legally incapable of becoming members of Parliament. Ulster Unionist
candidates now represent both constituencies. , , , • ,
By August 1958, as a result of by-elections held since 1955. the Labour party had gained
four seats—three from the Conservative party and one from the Liberal party, and the
Liberals had gained one seat from the Conservatives. Therefore, at that date, Conservatives
and their supporters held 342 seats, Labour 281, and the Liberals 6, and the Government
majority (excluding the Speaker) was 55 over all other parties.
The effectiveness of the party system in Parliament rests to a considerable extent
upon the fact that Government and Opposition alike are carried on by agreement.
that is to say, the minority agrees that the majority must govern and, therefore,
accepts its decisions; and the majority agrees that the minority should criticise and,
therefore, sets time aside for that criticism to be heard. As far as is compatible with
effective government, the Prime Minister meets the convenience of the Leader of
GOVERNMENT AND ADMINISTRATION
33
the Opposition and the Leader of the Opposition meets the convenience of the
Prime Minister. Through the respective Whips there is a measure of agreement on
the subjects to be debated and on the time to be allowed; sometimes even on the
information to be provided and the proposed line of attack. In this way, Parliament
has a chance of hearing a full discussion on policy from every point of view.
Outside Parliament, party control is exercised by the national and local organisa¬
tions ; inside Parliament, it is exercised by the Whips, who in addition to their other
functions are expected to maintain the voting strength of their parties. For the
Government, this work is done by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasury,
the Junior Lords of the Treasury, and the political officers of the Household—
the Treasurer, the Comptroller and the Vice-Chamberlain. The Opposition Whips
have no official position and are not paid from public funds, but their parliamentary
duties are the same.
The Functions of Parliament
The main functions of Parliament today are (i) to make laws regulating the life
of the community, (2) to take formal action, cast in legislative form, to make avail¬
able finance for the needs of the community and to appropriate the funds necessary
for the services of the State, and (3) to criticise and control the Government. By
custom, Parliament is also consulted before the ratification of certain international
treaties and agreements, in spite of the fact that the making of treaties is a Royal
Prerogative exercised on the advice of the Government which, strictly speaking,
is under no obligation to obtain parliamentary approval at all. In practice, there
are two types of agreement about which Parliament is consulted; treaties which
could not be implemented without legislation; and treaties of such political impor¬
tance that the Government feels obliged to arrange a debate on the matter before
becoming committed. In the case of other treaties requiring ratification, it is
customary to presume parliamentary acquiescence unless disapproval is expressed
within 21 days from the date on which the treaty was laid before Parliament.
Parliamentary Procedure
Parliamentary procedure1 is based on forms and rules, many of which date back
to the beginning of the sixteenth century and even earlier.
Each House has its own Standing Orders, but the system of debate is much the
same in the two Houses, except that in the House of Commons the Speaker has a
much greater measure of control. In the House of Lords, the office of Speaker could
be held by a commoner, since the Woolsack on which the Lord Chancellor sits as
Speaker is technically outside the precincts of the House. In fact, the holder of the
office is always created a peer, but the office carries with it no inherent authority
to check or curtail debate. Such matters are decided by the general sense of the
House and not by rulings of its Speaker.
In the Commons, the Speaker has the prime duty of controlling debate. It is his
responsibility to see that parliamentary time is used to the best possible advantage
and, therefore, although he must carefully guard against abuse of procedure or any
infringement of minority rights, he has power to limit unreasonable obstruction and
his rulings on points of order cannot be challenged at the time. It is the duty of the
Speaker to allow or disallow a closure motion (i.e. a motion to curtail or end
1 The growth of parliamentary business that has characterised the post-war decade has
led to a demand for a further review of House of Commons procedure. This has been
met by the appointment of a Select Committee to consider the procedure in the public
business of the House and to report what alterations, if any, are desirable for its more
efficient dispatch.
34 BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
discussion so that the matter may be put to the vote) and generally to enforce the
rules of debate of the House. In cases of grave and continuous disorder, he may
even adjourn the House or suspend the sitting.
Voting in the House of Commons is carried out under the direction of the
Speaker, and it is his duty to pronounce the final result. If an equal number of
votes is cast, the Speaker must give the decisive vote; he does this (if possible) in
such a way as to avoid change and leave the question to be debated on another
occasion. .
The Speaker has the responsibility of deciding whether a Bill is a Money Bill
(i.e. a Bill dealing only with national taxation and finance, which comes within the
terms of the Parliament Act, 191 x); and who, in case of doubt, is the Leader of the
Opposition. He is also responsible for such extraneous matters as the decision
whether a prima facie case has been made against persons accused of breach of
privilege; the issue of warrants for elections to fill vacancies in the House; and the
appointment of the chairmen of the Standing Committees.
All proceedings of either House (except secret sessions) are public, and a verba¬
tim record is published daily in the official reports, Parliamentary Debates {Hansard).
Parliamentary Committees
A committee of the whole House is the House itself, presided over by a chairman
instead of the Speaker, appointed to consider Bills in detail, clause by clause, and
also (in the House of Commons) the resolutions authorising the expenditure of
public money. The Committees of Supply and Ways and Means are committees
of the whole House which mainly discharge the financial duties of the House of
Commons concerning the grant of public money and the levying of taxation.
There are two other main kinds of parliamentary committee, both of which exist
to a varying degree to relieve their parent House of some of its more specialised
and complex work. They are:
(1) standing committees, which are appointed by the House of Commons as
necessary, for the consideration of Bills and other business committed to
them. With the exception of the Scottish Standing and Grand Committees
(which deal with Public Bills and other matters relating to Scotland) each
standing committee consists of twenty members nominated by the Com¬
mittee of Selection (a body of eleven members drawn from the three main
parties in the House at the beginning of each session) and up to thirty
additional members; in all cases the parties are represented in proportion
to their numbers in the Blouse. The procedure of a standing committee is
generally similar to that of a committee of the whole House, and
(2) select committees, including joint select committees of both Houses, which
are appointed to inquire into and report to the House on special matters,
e.g., the Select Committees on Public Accounts, on Estimates, on Statutory
Instruments, and on the nationalised industries.
Various other committees exist to deal with Private Bill legislation. There are
also a number of unofficial committees, consisting either of one party or of members
of all parties, such as study groups concerning themselves with particular issues,
e.g., the Parliamentary and Scientific Committee; and parliamentary party com¬
mittees, e.g., the Labour Policy Committee, and the Conservative and Unionist
1 The Scottish Standing Committee consists of thirty members for Scottish con¬
stituencies with up to twenty added members, and the Scottish Grand Committee contains
all the members for the Scottish constituencies, together with between ten and htteen
others.

Members Committee, popularly known as the 1922 Committee—a committee of
Conservative members of Parliament, who are neither ministers nor, as a rule,
ex-ministers.
Legislation
Legislation can be initiated from either side of the House; but no Bill involving
taxation or the spending of public money can proceed very far unless the Govern¬
ment agrees to introduce a ‘financial resolution’ to cover it. This naturally gives
the Government the exclusive right of legislating over a wide field and, as a result,
most Public Bills are brought forward in this way. Members can, however, still
introduce Bills on their own initiative, and certain days in each session are expressly
set aside for this purpose. In addition, persons and bodies outside Parliament can
introduce Private Bills1 which relate solely to matters of individual, corporate or
local interest.
Bills may be introduced in either House, unless they deal with finance or repre¬
sentation, when they are always introduced in the Commons. As a rule, however,'
Bills likely to raise political controversy are introduced in the Commons, while
legislation of an intricate but non-controversial nature is frequently introduced and
fully discussed in the Lords before being sent to the Commons, who can then deal
with it more speedily.
The process of passing a Public Bill is basically the same in the House of Lords
as in the House of Commons. The Bill receives a formal First Reading on introduc¬
tion ; it is then printed; and after a period of time (which varies between one and
several weeks depending on the nature of the Bill) it may be given a Second Reading
as the result of a debate on its general merits or principles. It is then referred for
detailed examination (in the Commons) either to a standing committee or, if the
House so decides, to the whole House sitting in committee; and, in the Lords, to
a committee of the whole House. When the committee stage is finished, the Bill is
reported to the House, and a further stage takes place during which the committee’s
amendments may be altered, additional amendments may be suggested and incor¬
porated, and, if necessary, the Bill may be recommitted to committee. Finally,
it is submitted for a Third Reading and, if passed, it is sent on from the Commons
to the Lords or from the Lords to the Commons (depending on its place of origin),
where it enters on the same course again. Any amendments which the second
House makes to the Bill must be agreed to by the first House, or a compromise
reached, before the Bill becomes law.
An exception to this procedure is made in the case of some financial Bills, such as
the Finance Bill, which authorises annual taxation and amends existing taxation,
and the Appropriation Bill, which authorises expenditure on the Supply Services
from the Consolidated Fund. As a general rule, these Bills must be introduced in
the House of Commons upon Resolutions in a Committee of the whole House and
they may be initiated only by a Minister of the Crown.
All Bills which have passed through their various parliamentary stages are sent
to the Sovereign for Royal Assent, which is now usually given by commission.
The Sovereign’s right of veto has not been exercised since the early eighteenth
century.
The majority of Bills introduced in the House of Lords pass through the Com¬
mons without difficulty because of their non-controversial nature; and they are
1 Such Bills are founded on petitions to Parliament, and promoters must give notice
of their intention to all persons and bodies whose interests may be affected by their
proposals. The committee stage is quasi-judicial and provision is made for counsel to
represent supporters and opposers of the Bill.
g6 BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
then returned to the Lords to be brought forward for Royal Assent. However,
should any Lords Bill be unacceptable to the Commons, it would never reach the
Statute Book, for no debating time would be allotted to it at any rate until a new
Government came into power, when it might be revived. The Lords, on the other
hand, are unlikely to be able to prevent a Bill passed in the Commons from becom¬
ing law. In the normal course of events, they either accept a Bill from the Commons
and return it unchanged; or they revise and improve it by amendments and return
it for the consideration of members of the other House, who frequently agree to the
amendments made. They cannot require the Commons to agree to amendments;
nor can they delay a Bill indefinitely. They have no powers in respect of Money
Bills; and since the passing of the Parliament Act, 1949, any other Bill which has
been passed by the House of Commons in two successive sessions may be presented
for Royal Assent without the consent of the Lords, provided that a year has elapsed
between the date of the Second Reading of the Bill in the Commons and the date
on which it is finally passed in that House. These limitations to the powers of the
Lords are based on the belief that the chief value of the Upper House, which is a
non-elected assembly, lies not in thwarting the elected House, but in bringing the
wide experience of its members into the legislative process. Proceedings in the
House of Lords give time for further reflection, and often elicit new points of view.
Delegated Legislation
Delegated legislation, which is legislation not by Act of Parliament but by Orders
in Council, Orders, Warrants, Regulations and Rules, has been part of the parlia¬
mentary system for at least six hundred years. One of the earliest recorded examples
is to be found in a statute of 1337 which laid down that no wool should be exported
from England ‘till the King and his Council do otherwise provide . Parliament,
however, made but sparing use of its power to delegate legislation (except during
a period of social, political and economic change in the second half of the fifteenth
and most of the sixteenth centuries) until the end of the nineteenth century, when
a changing conception of the part to be played by the State in the life of the com¬
munity made inroads upon parliamentary time and thus caused the system to be
adopted on a more extensive scale. With the ever-increasing scope of Government
activity in domestic affairs during the past fifty years, pressure on parliamentary
time has become even more acute; as a result, the system of delegated legislation
has become generally accepted, and there are at present few Acts of Parliament
which do not contain provisions for its use.
The advantages of the system of delegated legislation, which empowers ministers
and other authorities to regulate administrative details after a Bill has become an
Act, are said1 to be: (1) that it shortens and clarifies Bills before Parliament, thus
enabling Parliament to deal with a greater volume of business and to give fuller
attention to matters of policy and principle which are its primary concern; (2) that
it encourages flexibility, for administrative details can be worked out as and when
the necessity arises ‘with greater care and minuteness, and with better adaptation
to local and other special circumstances than they possibly can be during the
passage of a Bill through Parliament’; (3) that it is invaluable in an emergency, for
it is ‘the means by which the legislature can dispense with its own deliberative
procedure and arm the executive with power to take immediate action’; and (4)
that it provides a speedy, convenient and accurate means of giving effect to the
policy of Parliament.

GOVERNMENT AND ADMINISTRATION
37
In order to minimise the risk—inherent in the system—that delegated legislative
powers might supersede or weaken parliamentary government, such powers are
normally delegated to the Queen in Council or to authorities directly responsible to
Parliament, i.e. to Ministers of the Crown, to Government Departments for which
ministers are responsible, or to organisations whose legislation is subject to con¬
firmation or approval by ministers who thereby become responsible to Parliament
for it. Moreover the Acts of Parliament, by which particular powers are delegated,
frequently provide for some measure of parliamentary control over legislation made
in the exercise of these powers. There are cases in which an instrument1 must be
approved by Parliament or the House of Commons before it can have permanent
operation (‘affirmative resolution procedure’); others in which Parliament or the
House of Commons may secure the annulment of an instrument by a resolution
passed within a certain number of days of the instrument being laid before it
(‘negative resolution procedure’); and others again in which drafts of proposed
instruments must be laid before Parliament or the House of Commons before they
are made and are then subject either to affirmative or negative resolution procedure.
The resolution, in the case of an instrument to be annulled after it has been made,
takes the form of an Address to Her Majesty that the instrument be annulled (after
which the instrument may be annulled by Order in Council). The House of
Commons is aided in its supervision of delegated legislation by the reports of its
Select Committee on Statutory Instruments, which always indicate the unusual or
unexpected use of a statutory power.
As a further safeguard, the principal Act generally defines the precise limits of
delegated legislative power; and if these limits are surpassed, the courts can be
moved to declare that the action taken is ultra vires. Certain Acts also require direct
consultation with organisations which will be affected by delegated legislation before
such legislation is made.
Parliamentary Control
Parliament’s function of controlling the Government in power is exercised in the
final analysis by the power of the House of Commons to pass a resolution of
‘no confidence’ in the Government, or to reject a proposal which the Government
considers so vital to its policy that it has made it a ‘matter of confidence’, and thus
to force the Government to resign.
The financial control necessary to ensure that money shall be spent only with the
authority of Parliament and for the purposes authorised by Parliament is described
in Chapter XII, Finance, pp. 405-8. Methods of general control are provided by:
(1) the institution of Question Time, which is a daily hour of parliamentary
time during which members may question any minister on matters for
which that minister is responsible, thus focusing the attention of the public
on the day-to-day processes of government;
(2) the practice whereby the consideration of the Estimates in Committee of
Supply has ceased to be a consideration of the financial requirements of
the Government and has become an occasion, initiated by the Opposition,
for the examination of some aspect of the Government’s administrative
policy which has been included in the Estimates;
1 Almost all delegated legislation of the central Government is enacted by means of
‘statutory instruments’, made in accordance with the provisions of the Statutory Instru¬
ments Act, 1946, which repealed and replaced the Rules Publication Act, 1893. Instruments
of delegated legislation made under the Act of 1893 were known as ‘statutory rules and
orders’ (‘S.R. & O.’).
38

(3) the practice of bringing on a debate later in the same day by moving the
adjournment of the House, which is permitted only if the matter is deemed
by the Speaker to be definite, urgent, of public importance, and to be the
responsibility of the Government, and if 40 members rise in their places
to support it, or 10 members rise and the House grants leave on a division;
(4) the right of members to raise any matter on the motion for the adjournment
of either House at the end of each day’s sitting; and
(5) the power referred to in the preceding section to confirm or annul statutory
instruments.
In addition, Government policy and action are fully discussed in the important
debates which take place during the proceedings at the opening of Parliament and
in the motion for the adjournment of the House before a recess.
Parliament and the Public
The public’s interest in the work of Parliament is shown by the queues which
form outside the House of Commons for admission to the public gallery, by the
growth in the circulation of the daily official report {Hansard) which has increased
to nearly five times the pre-war figure, and by the large radio audience which listens
to two regular BBC programmes: Today in Parliament, a fifteen-minute summary
of the day’s proceedings in both Houses, broadcast each evening when Parliament
is sitting; and The Week in Westminster, a radio commentary on each week’s work,
given by members from various political parties in turn.
The major news agencies and national newspapers have special parliamentary
correspondents to report on parliamentary activities. The Hansard Society for
Parliamentary Government, an unofficial non-party educational society, was
founded in 1944 to promote interest in parliamentary affairs.
The Northern Ireland Parliament
The Parliament of Northern Ireland consists of the Sovereign, a Senate and a
House of Commons. The Sovereign is represented in Northern Ireland by a
Governor, who summons, prorogues and dissolves Parliament in Her Majesty’s
name; the Senate is composed of two ex officio Senators (the Lord Mayor of Belfast
and the Mayor of Londonderry) together with 24 Senators elected by the House of
Commons according to the principle of proportional representation; and the House
of Commons consists of 52 members, elected by a system of parliamentary franchise
similar to that which operates in Great Britain. The House, unless sooner dissolved,
continues in existence for a period of five years.
The Northern Ireland Parliament has power to make laws for the peace, order
and good government of Northern Ireland in relation to all matters except those
especially reserved to the Parliament of the United Kingdom, i.e. the Crown or
succession to the Crown; foreign relations; defence; the postal services; the judi¬
ciary; customs and excise; income and profits taxes; coinage; standards of weights
and measures; trade marks; submarine cables; wireless telegraphy; aerial naviga¬
tion; and lighthouses, buoys and beacons. The Northern Ireland Parliament is also
prohibited from making laws which would interfere with religious freedom, and
from taking property without compensation.
In consequence of these reservations, provision was made in the Government
of Ireland Act, 1920, for the continued representation of the Northern Ireland con¬
stituencies in the House of Commons of the United Kingdom; by virtue of this
provision, 12 members are returned to Westminster.
GOVERNMENT AND ADMINISTRATION
39
THE PRIVY COUNCIL
Until the eighteenth century, the Sovereign in Council or the Privy Council was
the chief source of executive power in the State. As the system of Cabinet govern¬
ment developed, however, the Privy Council declined in importance; many of its
powers were transferred to the Cabinet, and much of its work was handed over to
newly created Government Departments. The present-day Privy Council exists
mainly to give effect to policy decisions made elsewhere.
Apart from Cabinet Ministers, who must be Privy Counsellors and are sworn of
the Council on first assuming office, membership of the Privy Council (which is
retained for life) is accorded by the Sovereign on the recommendation of the Prime
Minister as an honour to persons who have reached eminence in some branch of
public affairs in any country of the Commonwealth. At the beginning of 1958 there
were just under 300 Privy Counsellors.
Procedure and Functions
The Privy Council is convened by the Clerk of the Council and presided over
by the Sovereign or, in the absence of the Sovereign, by the Lord President.1 At
meetings where the Sovereign is present, three Privy Counsellors form a quorum,
but, as a rule, not fewer than four are summoned to attend. The whole Privy Council
is called together only on the death of the Sovereign or when the Sovereign
announces his or her intention to marry.
The Privy Council is responsible for the making of Orders in Council, of which
there are two kinds differing fundamentally in constitutional principle: those made
in virtue of the Royal Prerogative as, for example, when approving the draft of
royal instructions to Colonial Governors; and those which are authorised by Act of
Parliament and are a form of delegated legislation. Members of the Privy Council
attending meetings at which Orders in Council are made do not thereby become
personally responsible for the policy upon which the Orders are based; this rests
with the ministers in whose Departments the draft Orders were framed, whether
they are present at the meeting or not. Certain Orders in Council must be published
in the London Gazette, which is an official periodical published by the authority of
the Government.
The Privy Council also advises the Crown on the issue of Royal Proclamations,
some of the most important of which relate to prerogative acts (such as summoning,
or dissolving Parliament) which are of the same validity as Acts of Parliament.
Committees of the Privy Council
There are a number of Privy Council committees (presided over by the Lord
President), whose meetings differ from the meetings of the full Council in that the
Sovereign cannot constitutionally be present. These committees, which have
advisory functions, may be prerogative, such as the committee which deals with
legislative matters submitted by the legislatures of the Channel Islands and the
Isle of Man for ratification by Order in Council, and the committees for medical
research, scientific and industrial research, agricultural research, and nature con¬
servation; or they may be provided for by statute as are those for the universities
of Oxford and Cambridge and for the Scottish universities, and that which deals
with applications for the grant of charters to municipal corporations.
1 Since 1660, the office of Lord President has been a political appointment held by a
member of the party in power, who is usually a leading member of the Cabinet. In
addition to his duties in the Privy Council, the Lord President is free to undertake duties
of a general kind.
D
40
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
The administrative work of the Privy Council committees is carried out in the
Privy Council Office under the control of the Lord President of the Council. Parts
of the work relating to research are undertaken by the Office of the Lord President
of the Council, since he is responsible to Parliament for the Department of Scientific
and Industrial Research, the Medical Research Council, the Agricultural Research
Council, and the Nature Conservancy, and has a general oversight of scientific
matters.
Judicial Committee
The Judicial Committee of the Privy Council is the final court of appeal on
certain legal issues arising in Australia and New Zealand and their dependencies,
in Ceylon, Ghana, and the Federation of Malaya, and in the United Kingdom
dependent territories. Its appellate jurisdiction derives from the principle of
English common law which recognises ‘the right of all the King’s subjects to appeal
for redress to the Sovereign in Council’ if they believe that the courts of law have
failed to do them justice.
Appeals come to it in limited categories of cases where a right of appeal has been
specially created, e.g., by Statute, Order in Council or Letters Patent, or by
special leave of the Sovereign in Council on the advice of the Judicial Committee.
Appeals are heard by a board of three or five drawn from the committee, depending
on the significance of the case, the quorum being three. Invitations to sit on the
board are issued by the Lord Chancellor, who thus determines which members of
the committee shall hear particular appeals. In practice, boards are generally
selected from the Law Lords of the United Kingdom—the Lord Chancellor,
ex-Lord Chancellors and Lords of Appeal in Ordinary—although Lords Justices of
Appeal and other members of the Privy Council who have held high judicial office
are also asked to sit when business is heavy. Chief Justices and certain judges from
other Commonwealth countries have usually been sworn of the Privy Council and
may be invited to sit on the committee’s boards.
HER MAJESTY’S GOVERNMENT
Her Majesty’s Government is the body of ministers charged for the time being
with the administration of national affairs.
Composition
The composition of the Government is subject to variation from time to time,
both in the number of ministers and in the titles of some offices. The usual minis¬
terial offices may be classified under the following heads:
1. The Prime Minister, who is the recognised head of the Government but
has no Department.
2. Departmental Ministers, some of whom are known as Secretaries of State.
There are at present seven Secretaries of State—for the Home Department,
Foreign Affairs, Scotland, Commonwealth Relations, Colonies, War, and
Air. The more recently created posts usually have the formal title of
‘Minister’; and there are Ministers of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food;
Defence; Education; Health; Housing and Local Government (also for
Welsh Affairs); Labour and National Sendee; Pensions and National
Insurance; Power; Supply; Transport and Civil Aviation; and Works. A
few of the older posts have special titles: the Chancellor of the Exchequer
GOVERNMENT AND ADMINISTRATION
41
(who is responsible for the Treasury and for a number of other financial
and central Departments); the President of the Board of Trade; the First
Lord of the Admiralty; and the Postmaster General.
3. Non-Departmental Ministers, or ministers who are the holders of various
traditional offices, including the Lord President of the Council, the Lord
Privy Seal, the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster,1 the Paymaster-
General and, at present, a Minister without Portfolio.These ministers have
few or no departmental duties and are thus available to perform any special
functions entrusted to them.
4. The Lord Chancellor and the Law Officers. The Lord Chancellor has a
Department, but is in a somewhat special position as a Minister of the
Crown who is also head of the judiciary in England and Wales. The four
Law Officers of the Crown are: for England and Wales, the Attorney-
General and the Solicitor-General; for Scotland, the Lord Advocate and
the Solicitor-General for Scotland.
5. Ministers of State, who are deputy ministers in Departments where the
work is particularly heavy and complex, or when it involves frequent
travelling overseas. There are now two Ministers of State in the Foreign
Office, one in the Colonial Office, and one at the Board of Trade. In
addition, the Secretary of State for Scotland is assisted at ministerial level
by a Minister of State, and there is a Minister of State for Welsh Affairs.
6. Junior Ministers, who generally have the title of Parliamentary Secretary
or, where the senior minister is a Secretary of State, Parliamentary Under¬
secretary of State. The primary function of most junior ministers is to
relieve their senior ministers of some of their burden by taking part in
parliamentary debates and answering parliamentary questions, and by
assisting in their departmental duties. The Parliamentary Secretary to the
Treasury and the Junior Lords of the Treasury are in a different category
as Government Whips.
The Prime Minister is appointed by the Crown, and all senior ministers are
appointed by the Crown on the recommendation of the Prime Minister.
The majority of ministers are members of the House of Commons, since the
approval of that House is necessary for the general policy (and frequently for the
specific proposals) of the Government. There must, however, always be some
ministers in the House of Lords, partly because the Ministers of the Crown Act,
IQ37) limits the number of ministers who may sit in the Commons while receiving
salaries from the Crown, and also because every Government must be assured of
spokesmen of standing to expound and justify its intentions and its actions to the
House of Lords.
The Prime Minister
The head of the Government became known as the Prime Minister during the
eighteenth century. The Prime Minister’s unique position of authority derives
from his status as leader of the majority party in Parliament and from his power to
submit his own choice of ministers to the Sovereign and to obtain their resignation
or dismissal individually. In modern times, the Prime Minister always holds the

the Chancellor.
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
42
additional office of First Lord Commissioner of the Treasury, and may also hold
another portfolio. At the present time, he is the minister responsible for atomic
energy.
It is the duty of the Prime Minister to inform the Sovereign of the general
business of the Government; to preside over the Cabinet; and to exercise a general
supervision over Departments, settling departmental differences and approving
important departmental decisions where reference to the Cabinet is not required.
The Prime Minister speaks for the Government in the House of Commons on the
most important topics and answers questions on its general administration in that
House.
The Prime Minister’s other responsibilities include making recommendations
for the appointment of Church of England archbishops, bishops and other senior
clergy and incumbents of Crown livings, as well as for appointments to high judicial
and civil offices such as that of the Lord Chief Justice and certain other judges,
Lord Lieutenants of counties,1 Regius Professors in certain universities and trustees
of certain national museums. He also makes recommendations for the award of
most civil honours and distinctions.
The Cabinet
The Cabinet is a conventional organ of government composed of a number of
ministers selected by the Prime Minister. Membership is not fixed, although the
holders of certain important ministerial offices are always included; the number of
members is now usually less than twenty.
The origins of the Cabinet can be traced back to informal conferences between
the Sovereign and his or her leading ministers held in the seventeenth century
independently of the Privy Council. After the Sovereign’s withdrawal from an
active role in politics in the eighteenth century, and the development of organised
political parties stimulated by successive extensions of the franchise from 1832
onwards, the Cabinet assumed its modern form.
The Cabinet is designed to formulate general policy, to bring about co-operation
between the different forces of the State without interfering with their legal inde¬
pendence, and to exercise general control. Its functions, as defined in the Report
of the Machinery of Government Committee (Haldane Committee), 1918, Cd. 9230,
are: the final determination of the policy to be submitted to Parliament; the
supreme control of the national executive in accordance with the policy agreed by
Parliament; and the continuous co-ordination and delimitation of the authority of
the several Departments of State. It has no legal authority, however, since its
decisions are valid by convention and not by law.
In determining Government policy, whether in the form of proposed legislation
for the consideration of Parliament or otherwise, the Cabinet is able to take into
account the widest possible range of interests in the country as a whole, by means
of an elaborate machinery of consultation, both formal and informal. For the
investigation of matters considered to be of the greatest importance, and where
time is not of the essence, the procedure frequently adopted is the appointment, by
Royal Warrant, of a Royal Commission, whose members are selected on grounds
of their wide experience and diverse knowledge of the subject matter covered by
its terms of reference. A Royal Commission formulates recommendations in the
light of written and oral evidence from many interested organisations and individuals
and submits a report containing recommendations, which the Government may

GOVERNMENT AND ADMINISTRATION
43
accept in whole or in part, or upon which it may decide to take no further action
or to delay action until a later date.
Cabinet Meetings
The Cabinet meets in private and its proceedings are strictly confidential. Its
members are bound by their oath as Privy Counsellors not to disclose any informa¬
tion. The Official Secrets Acts forbid the publication of Cabinet as well as of other
State papers, and a resigning minister desiring to make a statement involving dis¬
closure of Cabinet discussions must first obtain the permission of the Sovereign
through the Prime Minister. The theoretical reason for this secrecy is that a Cabinet
decision is advice to the Sovereign, whose consent is necessary before it is made
public. From a practical point of view, secrecy is essential in the interests of unpre¬
judiced debate, which can take place only if there is no risk of publicity for every
statement made and every point conceded.
In normal times, the Cabinet meets for a few hours once or twice a week during
parliamentary sittings, and rather less frequently when Parliament is not sitting.
Additional meetings may be called by the Prime Minister at any time if a matter
urgently requiring discussion should arise. During Cabinet meetings, decisions are
reached on major issues of Government policy, and the Cabinet settles any matters
which cannot be disposed of at lower levels.
In the performance of its functions, the Cabinet makes considerable use of a
committee system which originated in the nineteenth century and has been devel¬
oped to keep pace with government business during the past fifty years. The
system involves the reference of any issue either to a standing Cabinet committee
or to an ad hoc committee composed of the ministers primarily concerned, which
considers the matter in detail and either disposes of it or reports upon it to the full
Cabinet with recommendations for action. Ministers not in the Cabinet are called
to attend Cabinet meetings when matters affecting their Departments are under
discussion; they may also be members of Cabinet committees.
Detailed accounts of Cabinet meetings are not prepared; only the substance of
documents submitted, together with a summary of the arguments and the conclu¬
sions, are recorded; and even these records have a strictly limited circulation.
Responsibility for the keeping of records lies with the Secretariat of the Cabinet,
known as the Cabinet Office.
Ministerial Responsibility
Ministerial responsibility means both the collective responsibility which ministers
share for the policy and actions of the Government and the individual responsibility
of ministers to Parliament for the work of their Departments.
The doctrine of collective responsibility, which was fully accepted by the middle
of the nineteenth century, imposes upon ministers the obligation to act not as
individuals but (in the interests of stability of government) as a united group. It
does not require every Cabinet minister to be present at every Cabinet meeting;
and the obligations of individual ministers may be passive rather than active when
the decision to be taken does not relate to their spheres of administrative responsi¬
bility. At the same time, every minister should be fully informed of the subject of
discussion beforehand, so that if he has any objections he may voice them at the
meeting. He may not repudiate, either in Parliament or in his constituency, policies
which have received Cabinet approval, nor may he adopt policies which have not
been agreed with other Departments (including the Treasury) which may be con¬
cerned. He must be prepared to vote with the Government on all issues, and
where necessary to speak in support or defence of its policy. Any minister who feels
44 BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
himself unable to agree or to compromise with the view of the majority of his
colleagues in Parliament or elsewhere must resign. If he does not resign, he is held
to be responsible, and cannot afterwards reject criticism on the ground that he did
not personally agree with the policy adopted.
The doctrine of collective responsibility also means that the Cabinet is bound to
offer unanimous advice to the Sovereign, even when its members do not hold
identical views on a given subject.
The individual responsibility of a minister for the work of his Department means
that, as political head of that Department, he is answerable for all its acts and
omissions and must bear the consequences of any defect of administration, any
injustice to an individual or any aspect of policy which may be criticised in Parlia¬
ment, whether he is personally responsible or not.
Since the majority of ministers are members of the House of Commons, they are
available to answer questions and to defend themselves against criticism in person.
Ministers who are in the House of Lords must be represented in the Commons by
political subordinates qualified to speak on their behalf, i.e. by their Parliamentary
Secretaries and Under-Secretaries. Responsibility, however, cannot be delegated
and remains with the senior minister concerned.
Ministers are expected to take all decisions relating to their spheres of administra¬
tion, unless these are of such political importance that in their opinion Cabinet
sanction is required. . . . .
If any departmental decision brings a minister under fire of criticism in Parlia¬
ment he may be upheld by the Cabinet, which will then treat the matter as one of
confidence in itself; or he may be disowned, when he alone will be liable to lose
office. . j ur
Ministerial responsibility is an effective way of bringing government under public
control, for the knowledge that any departmental action may be reported to and
examined in Parliament discourages the taking of arbitrary and ill-considered
decisions.
GOVERNMENT DEPARTMENTS
Government Departments are organs of Government used to give effect to
Government policy when Parliament has passed the necessary legislation. They
may and frequently do work with and through local authorities, statutory boards,
and many Government-sponsored organisations which, while not forming part of
Government Departments, are under varying degrees of Government control.
A change of Government does not generally affect the number or functions of
Government Departments, although a radical change in policy may be accompanied
by a corresponding change in the Departments concerned. The widening scope of
Government activity has, however, led to the formation of a substantial number of
new Departments in the past half-century. A few have existed for over 200 years.
The work of some Departments, e.g., the Post Office and the Customs and Excise
Department, covers the United Kingdom as a whole. Other Departments cover
Great Britain (England and Wales, and Scotland, but not Northern Ireland), e.g.,
the Ministry of Labour and National Service; others cover England and Wales
only, e.g., the Ministry of Health, and there are similar but separate Departments
for Scotland and Northern Ireland. Some Departments, e.g., the Ministry of
Education, make special arrangements for Welsh affairs.
Departments differ in size and in the number, type and complexity of their
functions, and some have regional and local offices. Most Departments have a
minister of their own in control; a very few have no minister responsible to
GOVERNMENT AND ADMINISTRATION
45
Parliament, e.g., the Exchequer and Audit Department under the Comptroller
and Auditor General, who is an officer of Parliament and not of the Government;
and some are in charge of ministers who have other duties. For instance, Treasury
ministers are responsible for the administration of a number of Departments,
including H.M. Stationery Office, the Central Office of Information, the Treasury
Solicitor’s Department, the Departments of the Government Actuary and of the
Government Chemist, the Royal Mint, the National Debt Office, the Public Works
Loan Board, the National Savings Committee and certain museums and art
galleries.
This section provides an outline of the principal functions of the main Govern¬
ment Departments. Since much of their work is interconnected, they are not
grouped according to the subjects with which they deal, but are arranged in
alphabetical order, except for the Cabinet Office and the Treasury (which, in view
of their central position, are placed first) and the Scottish and Northern Ireland
Departments, which are grouped at the end of the section. Further information on
the work undertaken by the various Departments is given in later sections of this
handbook under the relevant subject headings.
The Cabinet Office
The Cabinet Office, or Secretariat of the Cabinet, was introduced as an emer¬
gency institution during the first world war and has grown into an organ of great
importance in the co-ordination of policy at the highest level. The Secretariat is
responsible for the keeping of Cabinet records, for providing information and
advice to ministers, and for issuing directives or promulgating decisions of the
Cabinet or the Prime Minister to the Departments concerned. It has a military side
and a civil side. There is also a Central Statistical Office which is charged with the
collection, analysis and presentation of statistics relating to the national economy.
The Treasury
Nominally the heads of the Treasury are the Lords Commissioners: the First
Lord of the Treasury (who is now invariably the Prime Minister), the Chancellor
of the Exchequer and five Junior Lords. In practice, the Lords Commissioners
never meet as a Board and their responsibilities are carried by the Chancellor of
the Exchequer assisted by two junior ministers, the Financial Secretary and the
Economic Secretary. There is also a Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasury who
is the Chief Government Whip in the House of Commons.
The functions of the Treasury fall under four main headings: finance (sub¬
divided into home finance and overseas finance), control of expenditure, general
Civil Service establishment matters, and co-ordination of economic policy. Home
finance includes taxation policy (though executive responsibility for the collection
of revenue lies with the Board of Inland Revenue and the Department of Customs
and Excise), the provision of funds for the day-to-day needs of the public services,
currency and banking, and the management of the national debt. Overseas financial
questions have formed a greatly increased part of the Treasury’s work since the
second world war because of the post-war emphasis on the problem of the balance
of payments.
Control of expenditure is a matter partly for Parliament, partly for the Treasury,
and partly for the Departments themselves. Treasury control arises very largely out
of parliamentary control and the scrutiny of detailed annual estimates for the greater
part of Government expenditure. The Treasury’s responsibility in general Civil
Service questions has developed gradually out of the control of expenditure.
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
46
The co-ordination of economic policy is a function which the Treasury has
acquired since the end of the second world war. It arose from the acceptance by
successive Governments since the war of responsibility for maintaining full
employment, and the need to safeguard the balance of payments by ensuring that
economic resources are directed to essential ends.
Attached to the Treasury is the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel, in which
Government Bills are prepared for introduction into Parliament.
The Admiralty
The Admiralty Act of 1690 appointed Lords Commissioners to the Board of
Admiralty to execute the office of Lord High Admiral. The responsibilities of the
Board of Admiralty are, briefly, to build, direct, maintain and administer the Royal
Navy within the framework of the Government’s naval defence policy. The present
Board comprises ten members (three ministerial, six naval and one civil servant).
The First Lord (a member of the Government) is supreme and the other members
of the Board are responsible to him for specific duties. The Board is served by
three groups of Departments: (1) the Divisions of Naval Staff, responsible for
advising on general and technical policy, strategy, tactics, operational planning, the
disposition of the Fleet, methods of naval warfare, and material requirements;
(2) the Departments, responsible for advising on personnel and material policy,
for providing the men (and their training), the ships (including their weapons
and equipment) and supplies, for the general organisation and administration of
associated naval establishments at home and abroad, and for stating (to the Ministry
of Supply) naval aircraft requirements; and (3) the Secretariat Branches, which
co-ordinate business on behalf of the Board, provide advice on precedent and on
general Government policy, ensure financial regularity and receive, pay and account
for all money administered by the Department.
The Admiralty has responsibilities for the merchant shipbuilding and repair
industry, including advice on the Government’s economic policy in the industry.
Much of the research work undertaken to meet naval requirements has additional
civil applications. The Admiralty administers the Royal Observatory, the Nautical
Almanac Office and the National Institute of Oceanography.
The Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food
The Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food was established by Order in
Council in April 1955 and assumed the responsibilities previously discharged by
the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries and the Ministry of Food.
The Ministry has a general responsibility for food supplies, both home produced
and imported, for food manufacture, distribution and storage and for the conduct
of the National Food Survey. Its economic appraisements range from the annual
review of farm prices to assessments of food and agricultural imports in relation
to the country’s balance of payments.
The Department is responsible generally for the efficiency of the agricultural,
horticultural and fishing industries in England and Wales, and for the operational
control of epidemic diseases of animals and of plant diseases and pests throughout
Great Britain. This involves supervision of County Agricultural Executive Com¬
mittees, which act locally as the Minister’s agents; the administration of schemes
to improve the quality of livestock and agricultural produce, to control or eradicate
animal and plant diseases, to control pests, and to facilitate production on marginal
land; the provision of market intelligence and of technical advice on all aspects of
food production; responsibility for agricultural education, for such matters as land
drainage, the enforcement of agricultural wages awards, safety, health and welfare.
GOVERNMENT AND ADMINISTRATION
47
labour supply, and for fishery research. With other Government Departments, the
Ministry is concerned with the improvements of such rural services as housing,
farm buildings, water supplies and electricity, with the supply of machinery,
fertilisers and seeds, and with land use. The Department is also concerned with the
purchase and sale of land by the Minister and with general land management
questions.
The Department administers, in England and Wales, the guarantees to farmers
under the Agriculture Acts of 1947 and 1957; in this connection it operates de¬
ficiency payments schemes for fatstock and for the main cereal crops. It is also
generally responsible for schemes for milk, eggs, potatoes and wool operated
through producers’ marketing boards.
The Department is concerned with the interests and development of every branch
of the fishing industry in England and Wales, including the processing and
distributive trades.
The Ministry has primary responsibility for administering part of the food and
drugs legislation, in particular that part dealing with the composition of food and
with labelling and advertising. It is responsible for food research, for matters
concerning slaughterhouses and the inspection of meat, and for enforcing legislation
relating to the quality and cleanliness of milk.
The Ministry maintains relations with other Commonwealth and foreign
countries interested in the United Kingdom as a market for their food exports, and
is responsible for schemes such as the Commonwealth Sugar Agreement, which is
operated through the Sugar Board. It contributes to the work of a number of
international bodies, including the Food and Agriculture Organisation of the
United Nations, the Organisation for European Economic Co-operation, the
Economic Commission for Europe, and, for food defence planning purposes, the
North Atlantic Treaty Organisation.
The Ministry is also responsible for the administration of the Royal Botanic
Gardens, Kew.
Ordnance Survey Department. The control of the Ordnance Survey Department
was transferred from the War Office to the Office of Works as the importance of
its civil work outstripped that of the military purposes for which it had been
founded in 1791. It is now administered by the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries
and Food. The Department carries out land registry surveys, and produces a wide
range of maps for the Admiralty, War Office, Air Ministry, and Geological Survey.
The Air Ministry
The Air Council was established in 1918 under the presidency of the Secretary
of State for Air to provide for the growing importance of aircraft in warfare by
taking over responsibility for the administrative control of the Royal Air Force.
The functions of the Air Ministry include strategic planning; the manning of the
Royal Air Force and its reserves and auxiliaries; the organisation of flying, technical
and general training; the acquisition of lands required for air force purposes; and
the supervision of the finance and contracts of the Royal Air Force.
The Meteorological Office, which became part of the Air Ministry in 1920, pro¬
vides meteorological services for the general public, Government Departments, the
armed forces, shipping and civil aviation. It organises meteorological observations
in the United Kingdom and at certain stations overseas and undertakes the collec¬
tion, publication and distribution of meteorological information from all parts of
the world. It also undertakes meteorological and climatological research.
48 BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
The Colonial Office
The Colonial Office deals with the affairs of the great majority of the non-self-
governing countries of the Commonwealth. At the head of the Colonial Office is
the Secretary of State for the Colonies, who is the Minister responsible to Parlia¬
ment for the general administration of those territories. The main functions of the
Colonial Office are to convey to Colonial Governments the views and wishes of
Her Majesty’s Government on broad matters of policy; to see that the interests of
Colonial Governments and peoples are safeguarded and promoted; to provide,
through its staff of professional advisers and with the help of advisory committees
composed of men and women eminent in many fields, guidance to Colonial
Governments on a wide range of matters; and to undertake expert services of many
kinds, including the allocation of money for development purposes under the
Colonial Development and Welfare Acts and the provision of administrative and
professional staff for the Overseas Civil Service. Other functions of the Colonial
Office include the care of Colonial students in the United Kingdom, the British
Council acting as agent in providing for their general welfare.
The Colonial Office does not directly administer the non-self-governing terri¬
tories with which it deals. Each of these has its own administration and an increasing
measure of autonomy.
Her Majesty's Overseas Civil Service. Members of this Service are employed in
the public services of Colonial Overseas Territories and are paid by the Govern¬
ment of the territory in which they serve. The Service merges the former adminis¬
trative and professional branches of the Colonial Service. Its members are eligible
for employment in any post which the Secretary of State for the Colonies is
requested or authorised to fill, and may also be considered, as opportunity offers,
for any post in Commonwealth or foreign territories for which the United Kingdom
Government may be invited to recommend candidates. Recruitment into this
Service is undertaken in the United Kingdom and other Commonwealth countries
when suitably qualified local candidates are not available for appointment to the
territorial public service.
The Crown Agents for Oversea Governments and Administration, while not a
Government Department, are appointed by the Secretary of State for the Colonies
to act as commercial and financial agents in the United Kingdom for the Govern¬
ments of the territories for which he is responsible. They also act by special
arrangement for other Governments and bodies.
The Commonwealth Relations Office
The Commonwealth Relations Office is the Department through which the
United Kingdom Government mainly conducts its relations with the Governments
-of the other Members of the Commonwealth (Canada, Australia, New Zealand,
the Union of South Africa, India, Pakistan, Ceylon, Ghana and the Federation of
Malaya), the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland and the self-governing Colony
of Southern Rhodesia. The Irish Republic, although no longer a Member of the
Commonwealth, is not treated as a foreign country and the relations of the United
Kingdom Government with the Irish Republic are conducted by the Secretary of
State for Commonwealth Relations. The responsibility for the administration of
the South African High Commission Territories (Basutoland, the Bechuanaland
Protectorate and Swaziland) also rests on the Commonwealth Secretary.
Through the Commonwealth Relations Office, consultation and exchange of
information takes place with the Governments of the other Members of the
Commonwealth on all subjects of mutual interest—foreign affairs, defence co¬
operation, economic and other matters.
GOVERNMENT AND ADMINISTRATION
49
The Commonwealth Relations Office (formerly known, since its establishment
in 1925 as a separate Department of State, as the Dominions Office) acquired its
present title in July 1947. In the following month the India Office was abolished,
and the conduct of relations with the newly established Governments of India and
Pakistan also became the responsibility of the Commonwealth Relations Office.
Since then, as other countries have become Members of the Commonwealth—
Ceylon (February 1948), Ghana (March 1957) and the Federation of Malaya
(August 1957)—so the responsibility for the conduct of relations with their Govern¬
ments has been transferred to the Commonwealth Relations Office.
The Customs and Excise Department
Commissioners to collect the Customs and the Excise revenues were first
appointed by the Long Parliament in 1643 (although after the Restoration the
older method of collection through private contractors was revived for a time).
The two branches of the Revenue remained distinct until 1909, when they were
amalgamated under Commissioners of Customs and Excise. The primary work of
the Customs and Excise Department is to collect and administer the duties of
Customs and Excise imposed from time to time in the annual Finance Acts or by
other legislation, and to advise the Chancellor of the Exchequer on any matters
connected with them. The Department is also responsible for preventing and
detecting evasion of the Revenue laws, including smuggling and illicit distillation.
In addition to its revenue work, the Department undertakes a wide range of
non-revenue agency work for other Departments, e.g., the enforcement of prohibi¬
tions and restrictions on the importation and exportation of certain classes of goods,
exchange currency control, and the compilation of United Kingdom overseas trade
statistics from Customs import and export documents.
The Ministry of Defence
The Ministry of Defence was formally constituted in January 1947 following the
passing of the Ministry of Defence Act, 1946. The Act charges the Minister with
responsibility for ‘the formulation and general application of a unified policy
relating to the armed forces of the Crown as a whole and their requirements’. He
carries out this responsibility in accordance with general defence policy laid down
by the Cabinet.
In addition to its main function of co-ordinating the policies and requirements of
the three armed Services, the Ministry is responsible for the administration of the
Joint Intelligence Bureau, the Imperial Defence College, the Joint Services Staff
College and Amphibious Warfare Headquarters.
The Ministry of Education
The Ministry of Education was established in 1944 to take over the powers and
duties previously exercised by the Board of Education (1899-1944) in regard to
the promotion of the education of the people of England and Wales and of the
progressive development of institutions devoted to that purpose. The Ministry
exercises this function in co-operation with the local education authorities—the
councils of the counties and of the county boroughs—whose duty it is to secure
the provision in their areas of adequate facilities for all forms of education. On
professional matters, contact with the local education authorities is maintained
through Her Majesty’s Inspectorate of Schools, organised in regional divisions
throughout England and Wales for its work of inspection, liaison and advice. A
separate Welsh Department of the Ministry deals with education in Wales.
The Ministry is concerned with the development of primary, secondary and
further education, including vocational education and education for leisure and
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
50
the social and physical training of young people. It deals with the supply, training
and superannuation of teachers; the building of new schools and other institutions \
the school health service; the special educational treatment of handicapped children;
and the provision of school meals and milk. It is responsible for the award of State
scholarships and other awards for university students; for the administration of the
Victoria and Albert Museum and the Science Museum, London; and for the
maintenance of educational relations with other countries of the Commonwealth,
with foreign countries, and with the United Nations Educational, Scientific and
Cultural Organisation.
The Commonwealth Institute. The Institute was founded, as the Imperial Institute,
in 1893. Its work is now directed by a Board of Governors, some of whom are
appointed by the Minister of Education and others by the Governments of the
member nations of the Commonwealth. The Institute houses permanent exhibi¬
tions of the peoples and products of the Commonwealth, shows films on Common¬
wealth subjects, and does much educational work in co-operation with the schools.
It also arranges lectures and conferences and has study and recreational accommo¬
dation for Commonwealth students. The Institute is financially dependent on an
endowment fund and on grants from the United Kingdom and other Common¬
wealth Governments.
The Foreign Office
The Foreign Office, which is the headquarters of Her Majesty’s Foreign Service,1
first became a separate Department of State in 1782. The Minister in charge of
the Foreign Office, and responsible to Parliament for the conduct of foreign affairs
and for the direction and operation of the Foreign Service, is styled Her Majesty’s
Principal Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.
The Foreign Office acts as a channel of communication between the Government
of the United Kingdom and the Governments of foreign States, either through the
representatives of foreign States in the United Kingdom or through Her Majesty’s
representatives abroad, for the discussion and negotiation of all matters falling
within the field of international relations, including the drawing up of international
treaties and agreements. It also provides the means by which the United Kingdom
Government is represented in the United Nations and on other international bodies
and is kept informed of developments in foreign countries; by which British sub¬
jects and interests abroad are protected and trade promoted; and by which British
policy is explained to the Governments and peoples of foreign countries. The
questions dealt with by the Foreign Office are primarily of a political nature, but
they also include many other matters such as questions of nationality, the issue and
renewal of passports, and the immunities and privileges of foreign diplomatic
representatives.
The Forestry Commission
The Forestry Commission, which was established by the Forestry Act, I9i9> was
empowered, under the Forestry Acts, 1919-47, to promote the interests of forestry,
the development of afforestation, and the production and supply of timber in
Great Britain; the Forestry Act, 1951, places responsibility on the Forestry Com¬
missioners for the maintenance of reserves of growing trees, through a system of
licensing of felling.
The Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food is responsible for forest policy
in England and Wales, and the Secretary of State for Scotland in Scotland.
1 See pp. 64-65.
GOVERNMENT AND ADMINISTRATION 51
The General Register Office
The General Register Office is responsible under the Registrar General for the
regulation of civil marriages and for the administration of civil registration in
England and Wales, for the preparation of statistics and reports relating to popula¬
tion, fertility, births, marriages, adoptions, diseases and deaths, and for making
arrangements for the periodic census of the population.
The Ministry of Health
The Ministry of Health was created in 1919 to take over the powers and duties
previously attaching to the Local Government Board (established in 1871) and the
National Health Insurance Commission (formed in 1912). In 1920, it also assumed
the responsibilities in connection with mental illness formerly attached to the
Home Office.
Twice since 1944 there has been a transfer of some of the Ministry’s main
responsibilities to newly created Departments—in 1945 those in respect of national
health insurance and contributory pensions to the Ministry of National Insurance
(now the Ministry of Pensions and National Insurance), and in 1951 those in respect
of housing, water and sewerage services, and the supervision of local government to
the Ministry of Local Government and Planning (now the Ministry of Housing and
Local Government).
On the other hand, in i953> when the Ministry of Pensions was merged with the
Ministry of National Insurance, the Ministry of Health became responsible for the
medical and surgical treatment of war pensioners, including war pensioners in the
Channel Islands and the Isle of Man and those residing in the Republic of Ireland,
and, in 1955, the Ministry assumed responsibilities regarding food hygiene and
welfare foods which had previously been carried out by the Ministry of Food.
The main function of the Ministry of Health is the administration of the National
Health Service in England and Wales under the National Health Service Acts. The
Ministry is also responsible in England and Wales for supervising the work of local
authorities under certain sections of the Public Health Acts and their services for
the care of the aged, infirm, blind, deaf and dumb and other handicapped persons
under the National Assistance Act, 1948.
The exercise of the Ministry’s functions in Wales has been delegated to the
Welsh Board of Health, the members of which are appointed by the Minister of
Health.
The Home Office
The Home Office was created in 1782. Its head is the Secretary of State for the
Home Department (the Home Secretary), who is the principal Secretary of State
and is entrusted with all the responsibilities of national administration which have
not been especially assigned by law or convention to the remaining Secretaries of
State or Ministers. The Home Secretary is also the channel of communication
between the Sovereign and his or her subjects, and between the United Kingdom
Government and the Governments of Northern Ireland, the Channel Islands and
the Isle of Man.
The chief matters with which the Home Office deals are: the maintenance of law
and order; the efficiency of the police service; the treatment of offenders, including
juvenile offenders; the efficacy of the probation service; the organisation of magis¬
trates’ courts; legislation on criminal justice; the efficiency of the fire service; the
care of children by local authorities and voluntary organisations; the regulation of
the employment of children and young persons; the control and naturalisation of
aliens; the law relating to parliamentary and local government elections; public
safety and public well-being; and preparations for civil defence.
$2 BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Particular matters for which the Home Office is responsible, both in connection
with its general functions and otherwise, include: receiving and submitting
Addresses and Petitions to the Sovereign and preparing Presentations to Parlia¬
ment; preparing patents of nobility for peers and formal proceedings for t e
bestowal of honours; advising the Crown on the exercise of the Prerogative of
Mercy; sanctioning byelaws made by local authorities in so far as they relate to
‘law and order’ and ‘good governance’; granting licences to experiment with
animals; ordering the exhumation and removal of bodies; supervising the control
of explosives, firearms and dangerous drugs; and administering the State Manage¬
ment Scheme for control of the liquor trade in the Carlisle district.
The Ministry of Housing and Local Government
The Ministry of Housing and Local Government was constituted in January
1951, under the title of Ministry of Local Government and Planning, to take over
the housing and local government functions of the Ministry of Health and the
planning functions of the Ministry of Town and Country Planning (i943 S1)-
was renamed the Ministry of Housing and Local Government in November 1951.
It is the Department generally responsible for local government, and, in this capa¬
city, it is responsible for sanctioning loans for most purposes for which local
authorities require to borrow money, and for acting as the main link between local
authorities and the central Government.
The Ministry exercises powers in regard to housing, water, sewerage and other
services administered by local authorities in England and Wales. In regard to these
services, the position, broadly, is that the Minister is responsible to Parliament
(1) for securing (by the aid of grants or other means and so far as intervention by
the central Government is necessary) that the duties laid upon local authorities by
Parliament are effectively performed; (2) for encouraging the exercise of powers
given to local authorities in regard to services for which they are responsible, either
by grants paid out of national funds or otherwise; and (3) for inquiring into diffi¬
culties and complaints concerning any local authority services which may be
brought to the Minister’s notice.
As the central Housing Authority under the Housing Act, 1936, the Minister
supervises the administration of the housing statutes and the national housing pro¬
gramme ; and his officers keep in close touch with the local authorities in England
and Wales. Local authority proposals for dealing with slum clearance are also
submitted to the Minister. ... , r • j
The town and country planning work of the Ministry includes the framing and
execution of the national policy on the use and development of land for the purpose
of achieving the best use of land in the public interest. The responsibilities of the
Minister include confirmation of the acquisition and disposal of land by local
authorities; and the payment of grants, for planning purposes, in certain cases of
acquisition, clearing and compensation. The Minister also has responsibilities in
connection with the establishment and work of the Development Corporations of
the New Towns, and with the National Parks Commission.
The Minister of Housing and Local Government is also the Minister for Welsh
Affairs.
The Central Office of Information
The Central Office of Information was established in 1946 as the successor to the
war-time Ministry of Information. It is a common service agency for producing,
and advising on, information and publicity material and for supplying general
publicity services required by Government Departments. It produces and distributes
GOVERNMENT AND ADMINISTRATION
53
books, pamphlets, magazines, films (including films for television), exhibitions,
photographs and other visual material for the home and overseas ministerial
Departments. It conducts all Government display press and poster advertising
except that of the National Savings Committee, carries out social surveys, and
distributes departmental press notices to the Press, the BBC and the television
companies. For the overseas Departments, it supplies British information posts
with a daily service of topical information, comment and official news for local
circulation and with a comprehensive reference service, and arranges tours for
official visitors from overseas to enable them to see various aspects of life in Britain.
Administratively, the Central Office is responsible to Treasury IVIinisters, while
the Ministers whose Departments it serves are responsible for the policy expressed
in its work.
The Board of Inland Revenue
The Board of Inland Revenue administers the laws relating to income tax and
surtax, profits tax, stamp duty, estate duty, and certain other direct taxes of lesser
importance, and advises the Chancellor of the Exchequer on any matters connected
with them. The Board is also responsible for the valuation of real property for
various purposes such as compensation for compulsory purchase, local rates in
England and Wales, and estate duty.
The Ministry of Labour and National Service
The Ministry of Labour was created in 1916 and took over certain duties of the
Board of Trade. In 1939, when the Ministry became responsible for manpower,
both for the armed forces and for industry, its name was changed to the Ministry
of Labour and National Service. One of its principal functions is the administra¬
tion of the Employment and Training Act, 1948, and provision of facilities and
services for the purposes of assisting persons to select, fit themselves for, obtain
and retain employment suitable to their age and capacity, of assisting employers to
obtain suitable employees, and generally for the purpose of promoting employment
in accordance with the requirements of the community. Its services include the
operation of (1) a national system of Employment Exchanges, (2) a Technical and
Scientific Register, (3) Nursing Appointments Offices and (4) Government schemes
for vocational training.
The Ministry also has responsibility for manpower policy and co-operates with
other Government Departments on matters of general employment policy, includ¬
ing the distribution of industry and the maintenance of a high and stable level of
employment. Among its functions in this connection are the registration, medical
examination and calling-up of men for National Service and the resettlement in
civil employment of men released from National Service or the Regular Forces.
In the field of employment and training, the Ministry is concerned with the
central administration of a comprehensive Youth Employment Service provided
locally either by the local education authority or by the Ministry’s local office, and
the provision of a Disablement Resettlement Service with, where necessary, indus¬
trial rehabilitation and vocational training, to enable disabled persons to secure
employment.
The Ministry provides an important service in dealing with questions concerning
the safety, health and welfare of industrial workers in factories and certain other
premises, ff he provisions of the Factories Acts and associated legislation are
enforced by H.M. Inspectors of Factories. Another service is the collection and
publication of labour statistics, including statistics of manpower, employment and
unemployment, wage rates, earnings, hours of labour, retail prices, household
S4 BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
expenditure, industrial disputes, employers and employees organisations and
industrial accidents and diseases.
The Ministry assists in the promotion of good industrial relations, having
statutory powers which reinforce and supplement the voluntary arrangements
within industry, and it actively encourages the development of good personnel
management and of joint consultation in industry.
Responsibility for the relations of H.M. Government with the International
Labour Organisation rests with the Ministry, which is also concerned with labour
policy in the international field, with overseas questions concerning labour and
employment and with the employment of foreign workers in Great Britain.
Besides these principal functions, the Ministry undertakes agency work for other
Government Departments in connection with National Insurance, National
Assistance, repayment of income tax to unemployed persons, and the issue of
passports.
The Law Officers’ Department
The Law Officers of the Crown for England and Wales (the Attorney-General
and the Solicitor-General) are the legal advisers to the Crown and to all Govern¬
ment Departments and appear in Court on their behalf in cases of importance.
In such cases the Law Officers are assisted by Junior Counsel to the Treasury.
The appointments, which are made from among the more distinguished members
of the English Bar, are generally, though not invariably, political, and the office
holders change with the Government.
The Attorney-General has a number of important functions in regard to the
administration of justice and he has wide powers in connection with the enforce-
uignt of the criminal law. The Director of Public Prosecutions acts under his
superintendence and is subject to his directions. The Attorney-General is the
senior Law Officer, but the Solicitor-General, as his deputy, acts for him in all
cases where he is authorised or required to do so.
The Lord Chancellor’s Department
The Chancellorship is a legislative, judicial and executive office held by an
eminent ex-member of the Bench or of the Bar; it always carries Cabinet rank in
peace time.
In addition to his functions as Speaker of the House of Lords and Custodian of
the Great Seal, the Lord Chancellor is in charge of more than 20 different offices
and branches which are mainly concerned with legal practice and procedure. He
controls the machinery of the courts of law both through his patronage and through
administrative powers conferred by the Judicature Act, i925> anc^ other Acts; he
advises the Crown on many appointments to the judiciary in England and Wales;
and he is the minister responsible for the Judge Advocate General s Department.
This Department advises the War Office and the Air Ministry on all legal matters
arising out of the administration of military law, and, where necessary, reviews the
proceedings of army and air force courts martial.1 The Lord Chancellor is also a
member of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council and exercises ecclesiastical
patronage. Under the Tribunals and Inquiries Act, I95^> he appoints the chairmen
of certain administrative tribunals in England and Wales, and (with the Secretary
of State for Scotland) the members of the Council on Tribunals. The Land Registry,
which is responsible for maintaining a State register of title to land,2 and the Public

but elsewhere registration is voluntary.
GOVERNMENT AND ADMINISTRATION
55
Trustee Office, which may act as the executor or administrator of the estate of a
deceased person or as a trustee under a will or settlement, are both administered
under the Lord Chancellor.
The National Assistance Board
The National Assistance Board, responsible to Parliament through the Minister
of Pensions and National Insurance, administers the State service of financial
assistance to persons in need and unable to maintain themselves, and the non¬
contributory pension scheme under the Old Age Pensions Act, 1936. The Board
is also responsible for assessing the means of persons applying for legal aid.
The Paymaster-General’s Department
The Paymaster-General’s Department acts as chief paying agent for Government
Departments other than the Revenue Departments. The majority of payments are
made through banks (to whose accounts the necessary transfers are made at the
Bank of England), but cash payments can be made and the payment of pensions,
mainly comprising those to retired teachers, officers of the Civil Service and the
National Health Service and members of the armed forces, and in certain cases
to their widows, is an important feature of the work of the Department.
The Ministry of Pensions and National Insurance
In 1953 the Ministry of Pensions (established in 1917) and the Ministry of
National Insurance (established in 1944) were amalgamated.
The Ministry of Pensions and National Insurance is responsible (1) for the social
security services established since the second world war by the Family Allowances
Acts, the National Insurance Acts and the National Insurance (Industrial Injuries)
Acts, and for reciprocal social security arrangements with other countries, and
(2) for the award and payment of war pensions and allowances for disablement and
death due to service in the armed forces of the Crown or in the Home Guard (now
disbanded), or due to war injuries sustained by naval auxiliaries, merchant seamen,
civil defence personnel and civilians in the second world war, and for the welfare of
pensioners and their dependants and war orphans. In addition to these responsi¬
bilities for war pensioners in the United Kingdom and in the Irish Republic, the
Ministry is responsible for the administration of war pensions and for the medical
treatment of war disablement of United Kingdom pensioners living in Northern
Ireland and, through its various agencies, in other countries overseas. The Ministry
maintains an office in Ottawa to serve pensioners in North America.
The Post Office
The Post Office was set up in the seventeenth century to take over the responsi¬
bility for carrying letters, which was previously attached to the Crown. The
minister at its head is the Postmaster General, and its work is now mainly concerned
with the operation of the inland postal, telegraph and telephone services and, in
co-operation with other countries and interests, of the overseas postal and telecom¬
munications sendees. It also undertakes certain banking functions, including the
operation of the Post Office Savings Bank, the sale of premium savings bonds and
the issue of money orders, and it acts as an agent for many other Government
Departments in the collection of revenue (e.g., by the sale of broadcast receiving
and other licences and by the sale of stamps for National Insurance contributions)
and the payment of grants and allowances, such as National Insurance payments,
retirement and certain other pensions and family allowances.
E

The Postmaster General is the minister responsible to Parliament for broad
questions of national policy concerning sound and television broadcasting services.
The Post Office provides many line facilities for the British Broadcasting Corpora¬
tion and the Independent Television Authority.
The Engineering Department of the Post Office carries out a considerable
volume of scientific research and technical development relating to telephone,
telegraph and radio systems and the mechanisation of the postal services.
The Ministry of Power
The Ministry of Power was established in I942 (as the Ministry of Fuel and
Power) when it absorbed the former Mines and Petroleum Departments of the
Board of Trade and the Board’s functions in relation to gas and electricity. It was
made permanent by the Ministry of Fuel and Power Act, i945> the title being
changed to Ministry of Power by Order in Council in January 1957.
Since 1942, the Ministry has had the general duty of ensuring the effective and
co-ordinated development of fuel and power supplies in Great Britain, and of
promoting economy and efficiency in their distribution and consumption. The
business of producing and distributing gas and electricity and of producing coal is
operated by the boards of the three nationalised industries, whose members are
responsible to the Minister on policy issues. The distribution of coal and coke,
however, is carried out largely by private concerns. The Ministry is also responsible
for Government relations with the petroleum industry. In January i957> the
Ministry assumed the functions in relation to iron and steel previously exercised
by the Board of Trade and, at the same time, was made specifically responsible
for the use of atomic energy as a source of industrial power.
The Acts and Regulations governing the safety and health of workers in and
about coal mines, metalliferous mines and quarries are administered by the Safety
and Health Division of the Ministry, which includes the Inspectorate of Mines.
The Ministry is responsible for the general co-ordination of fuel research, and the
Chief Scientist’s Division itself conducts or arranges for scientific research on
specific projects and on matters affecting safety and health in mines and quarries.
The Department of Scientific and Industrial Research
The Department of Scientific and Industrial Research was set up as a Depart¬
ment of the Privy Council in 1916. It accounts for its own Vote in the Estimates and
is responsible to Parliament through the Lord President of the Council.
The work of the Department covers research (except defence research) in all
branches of natural science except medicine and atomic energy, and in all industries
except agriculture, fishery and forestry. Its primary functions are to undertake
research in the national interest for the benefit of the community and to meet the
requirements of other Departments; to encourage research and the application of
scientific knowledge in industry; and to encourage fundamental research at uni¬
versities and elsewhere, and the maintenance of an adequate supply of trained
research workers for laboratories of all kinds.
The Stationery Office
Her Majesty’s Stationery Office was established in 1786. It is the Government’s
central organisation for the supply of desk stationery, office equipment, office
machinery, printed matter, published books and periodicals for British Govern¬
ment Departments at home and abroad. It also undertakes printing, duplicating,
addressing and distributing services for other Departments. The Stationery Office
is the Government publisher and is responsible for the sale of Government
GOVERNMENT AND ADMINISTRATION
57
publications, including Acts of Parliament. The ministerial head of the Stationery
Office is the Chancellor of the Exchequer, and questions pertaining to the Depart¬
ment asked in the House of Commons are normally answered by the Financial
Secretary to the Treasury.
The Ministry of Supply
The present Ministry of Supply was formed in 1946 by the amalgamation of the
war-time Ministries of Supply and of Aircraft Production.
The primary functions of the Ministry are to furnish supplies, which include
complete atomic weapons, to the armed forces; to undertake research on, and the
design and development of, equipment for these forces, principally for the Army
and Royal Air Force, but including aircraft, vehicles, some guns and ammunition
and other equipment for the Royal Navy. Other functions of the Ministry are to
carry out the primary Government responsibility in the field of electronics and in
the light metals industry, and to undertake research on, and development and pro¬
duction of, certain classes of equipment for civil use, e.g., civil aircraft and industrial
gas turbines.
The Ministry controls the Royal Ordnance factories and those experimental,
storage and other establishments which are owned by the Department; it is
responsible for the administration of such matters as labour supply, labour manage¬
ment, welfare, housing and transport in connection with these organisations.
The Board of Trade
The Board of Trade was formally constituted as a Committee of the Privy
Council by an Order in Council of 1786, which still provides the constitutional
basis for the Board. Since 1867, the President has been the only eflfective member
of this Committee and his authority is, in practice, similar to that of a Secretary of
State or other Minister of Cabinet rank; he is now assisted by a Minister of State,
who is specially concerned with overseas trade.
The Board has a general responsibility in respect of the United Kingdom’s
commerce, industry and overseas trade, including commercial relations with other
countries, import and export trade, the protective tariff, industrial development
and consumer protection. It is also responsible for (1) the promotion of exports,
(2) statistics of trade and industry (both at home and abroad) including the Cen¬
suses of Production and Distribution, and (3) the administration of certain regu-
lati\ c legislation, for example, in relation to patents, registered designs, copyright,
trade marks, weights and measures, merchandise marks, companies, bankruptcy,
insurance, distribution of industry, films, and enemy property.
In addition, the Board exercises central responsibility for all industries which
are not specifically allocated to be the concern of other Departments. In this
respect it provides on the one hand, both a channel of communication with, and
a point of contact for, the industries with which it is specifically concerned, and on
the other hand a focal point at which knowledge about those industries and their
problems is accumulated, analysed, and used as a basis for advising ministers and
other Departments. The main industries which fall outside the scope of the Board’s
specific concern are food, agriculture and fisheries, building and quarrying, iron
and steel, shipbuilding, fuel and power and transport.
The Ministry of Transport and Civil Aviation
In 1953 the Ministry of Transport and the Ministry of Civil Aviation were
amalgamated. This amalgamation was foreshadowed in November 1951, from
58
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
which time the two offices of Minister of Transport and Minister of Civil Aviation
were held by the same minister.
The Ministry of Transport, established in 1919 ‘for the purpose of improving
the means of, and the facilities for, locomotion and transport’, assumed also, in
1941, the responsibility for merchant shipping formerly exercised by the Mercantile
Marine Department of the Board of Trade.
The Ministry of Civil Aviation was established in 1945 to organise, carry out
and encourage measures for the development of civil aviation, for the promotion
of air safety and efficiency, and for research on air navigation.
The powers and duties of the Ministry of Transport and Civil Aviation relate to
inland transport, shipping and civil aviation. Under inland transport, it is concerned
with railways; inland waterways; roads, bridges and ferries, and the vehicles they
carry. The Ministry is the highway authority for trunk roads. The Ministry’s
shipping responsibilities include harbours, docks, piers and river conservancy,
national and international shipping policy; ships, their masters, officers and men,
safety of life at sea; navigation (including pilotage, lighthouses, and other aids to
safety in navigation); wreck and salvage; and the Coastguard Service. The Ministry
is also responsible for providing and operating troopships.
In civil aviation matters, the Minister may give general directions to the publicly
owned airline corporations on matters affecting the national interest. He also
approves associate arrangements between airline corporations and independent air
transport companies for the operation of scheduled services. The general civil
aviation responsibilities of the Ministry include: the regulation of civil flying; air
safety; the provision, administration and equipment of State-controlled aerodromes
and other ground services; the negotiation of international air transport agreements,
the registration of aircraft; and the licensing of aircrew and aircraft maintenance
personnel.
The War Office
The office of Secretary of State for War was established in 1854. In 1904 the
Army Council was constituted on the model of the Board of Admiralty, with the
Secretary of State as president and a membership of both military and civi
PCThe War Office is responsible for the administrative control of the Army, includ¬
ing appointments, promotions, postings and payment. Its functions include the
planning of operations and training; the collection and sifting of military informa¬
tion; the framing of policy on the composition, weapons and equipment of the
Army; the determination of financial and labour policy connected with the Army,
and the supervision of War Office civilian staffs both at home and abroad.
The Ministry of Works
The Ministry of Works, previously known as His Majesty s Office of Works,
was established under its present title in 1943- Its main functions are: the provision
of office accommodation for Government Departments (including public buildings
overseas), and of many other types of accommodation required by civil and Service
Departments; the design, purchase, supply and maintenance of furniture an
equipment for Government Departments and certain other bodies, and their
supplies of fuel, household articles and stores; the administration of the Ancient
Monuments Acts and the maintenance of those ancient monuments and historic
buildings which are in the Ministry’s charge; the making of grants, on the advice
of the Historic Buildings Councils, towards the maintenance of historic buildings
of outstanding interest; the maintenance of royal palaces and certain official
GOVERNMENT AND ADMINISTRATION
59
residences; the building, engineering and supplies services for certain State
ceremonial occasions; the management and maintenance of the royal parks and
certain other open spaces.
The Ministry also has responsibilities for the efficiency and welfare of the build¬
ing, civil engineering and building materials industries, including: maintenance
of a list of all building and civil engineering firms and collection of statistical
returns; oversight of the production of building materials and fitments; consulta¬
tion with the industries at national and regional level; encouragement of apprentice¬
ship and training in the building and electrical contracting industries; review of
building research and development work to meet the industry’s requirements and
to ensure that results of research are made available to the industry.
SCOTLAND
The first Secretary for Scotland was appointed in 1885 in recognition of the fact
that Scotland required a separate system of administration from that of England
and Wales. Forty years later, his powers and duties were transferred to a Secretary
of State, appointed by the Secretaries of State Act, 1926.
The Secretary of State is assisted at ministerial level by a Minister of State and
three Parliamentary Under-Secretaries of State. There are also two Scottish Law
Officers. The Secretary of State’s functions are discharged by four main adminis¬
trative Departments of equal status, each under a Secretary responsible to the
Secretary of State for the discharge of the duties of the Department. The day-to-day
administration of the Departments is conducted in Edinburgh, but each Depart¬
ment has representatives in London for liaison and parliamentary duties. This
London office is generally known as the Scottish Office, a term also used to describe
all Scottish administration responsible to the Secretary of State.
The four main Scottish Departments are the Scottish Home Department, the
Department of Health for Scotland, the Scottish Education Department, and the
Department of Agriculture for Scotland. The Scottish ministers are advised and
assisted (particularly in relation to questions where more than one of the Depart¬
ments is concerned or which fall outside the province of any of them) by the Per¬
manent Under-Secretary of State, Scottish Office, who is free from departmental
duties.
The Scottish Home Department
The Scottish Home Department was set up in 1939 to take over the work that
had been undertaken previously by the Secretary of State’s Office, and by the
Fishery Board for Scotland and the Prisons Department for Scotland.
In the field of law and order, the Department is concerned with the police,
probation and remand home services, criminal justice, legal aid and the services
needed by the courts; and it is directly responsible for the administration of prisons
and borstal institutions.
The Department is the central Department in Scotland for the fire service and
civil defence; for the children’s service; for highways administration, including
road safety matters (except in so far as they relate to the construction and use of
vehicles); and for legislation concerijing shops, theatres, cinemas and licensed
premises. Licensed premises in districts in which State management of the liquor
trade is in operation (State Management Districts) are directly maintained by the
Home Department.
The Department has general duties in connection with the structure and finance
of local authorities, including valuation and rating and the administration of the
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
6o
Exchequer equalisation grants; and it is responsible for the oversight and protec¬
tion of the Scottish inshore, deep-sea and freshwater fisheries. It is also closely con¬
cerned, in co-operation with the Board of Trade and other United Kingdom
Departments, with Scottish economic development, including the provision of
electric power and the rehabilitation of the Highlands generally.
The Department of Health for Scotland
The Department of Health for Scotland is responsible for the general supervision
of the National Health Service in Scotland; for the central administration of the
Housing (Scotland) Acts; for the supervision of the house-building programme and
for the distribution of grants to local authorities for housing purposes; for the
control, under the Town and Country Planning (Scotland) Acts, of the use of land,
and for the establishment of new towns under the New Towns Act.
The Department is also responsible for supervising the administration of various
environmental services, including services connected with water supplies, sewerage
and clean air; for welfare services, e.g., the care of the aged and handicapped
persons; and for the medical and surgical treatment of war pensioners in Scotland
(including hospital services, and the supply and repair of artificial limbs, surgical
appliances and invalid chairs).
The Scottish Education Department
The Scottish Education Department is responsible for supervising the adminis¬
tration of the Education (Scotland) Acts, for guiding the development of public
education in Scotland in all its forms, for supervising the training of teachers, for
issuing teachers’ certificates and administering the Teachers’ Superannuation
Scheme, for controlling the distribution of Exchequer grants in aid of educational
expenditure, for conducting the annual examination for the Scottish Leaving
Certificate, and for exercising general supervision over approved schools, and over
the administration of the Royal Scottish Museum.
The Department of Agriculture for Scotland
The Department of Agriculture for Scotland is the successor of the Board of
Agriculture, which was established in 1912. Its broad function is to assist, encourage
and improve home food production. It has a general responsibility for all Govern¬
ment measures for the promotion and development of farming in Scotland, and in
most cases the Department itself administers them. They include: guaranteed
prices for the major farm products, fixed in association with the other Agricultural
Departments in the United Kingdom; the provision of grants and subsidies and
other services in connection with food production; the application of measures for
controlling injurious animals and birds and infestations in stored food; the manage¬
ment of the extensive agricultural property owned by the Secretary of State; the
use and improvement of land and the improvement of farm stock and crops; the
economics of the industry; the instructional, advisory and research services pro¬
vided by the three agricultural colleges and eight research institutes in Scotland;
measures to promote animal health; the regulation of agricultural wages; and the
application to the agricultural industry of safety, health and welfare measures.
Other Departments
In addition to the main Departments, there are a number of other Scottish
Departments, all of which work in varying degrees under the direction of the
Secretary of State. Such Departments include the Department of the Registrar-
General for Scotland (the General Registry Office); the Scottish Record Office;
GOVERNMENT AND ADMINISTRATION
6l
the Department of the Registers of Scotland; and the Scottish Information Office,
which undertakes information services on behalf of the Secretary of State for
Scotland, the Scottish Departments and, in some degree, for Great Britain Depart¬
ments in Scotland, and acts also as the agent in Scotland of the Central Office of
Information. There are also Scottish branches of the Great Britain and United
Kingdom Departments under the direction of Controllers, who are responsible for
ensuring that the execution in Scotland of the policy and procedure of their
Departments is in accordance with Scottish conditions and needs.
Legal Departments
The Law Officers for Scotland are the Lord Advocate and the Solicitor-General.
The Lord Advocate is in administrative control of two Departments: The Lord
Advocate's Department, which is responsible for drafting Scottish legislation,
providing legal advice on Scottish questions for other Departments, and assisting
the Scottish Law Officers in certain of their legal duties; and The Crown Office,
which exercises the powers of the Lord Advocate in relation to criminal proceedings.
NORTHERN IRELAND
There are a number of separate Departments for Northern Ireland, which are
controlled by the Northern Ireland Parliament. Most of these have functions in
Northern Ireland analogous to those performed for England and Wales by similar
Departments—the Northern Ireland Ministries of Home Affairs, Education and
Agriculture; the Northern Ireland Assistance Board; and the Exchequer and Audit
Department for Northern Ireland. Other Northern Ireland Departments cover
activities which in Great Britain are divided between several Departments. These
Northern Ireland Departments include the Ministries of Finance, Commerce,
Health and Local Government, and Labour and National Insurance.
The Ministry of Finance
In addition to acting as Treasury to the Government of Northern Ireland, the
Ministry of Finance is responsible for administrative work in connection with the
erection and maintenance of public works and buildings; for Government valuation
and survey; for land registry, the registry of deeds, and certain duties in connection
with land purchase; for the work of the Registrar-General; for the control of
Government publications; for the control and administration of charitable dona¬
tions and bequests; for the control of borrowings; for the collection of death duty,
entertainments duty (cinemas) and other transferred excise duties; and for the
administration of the Ulster savings movement.
Attached to the Department is the Office of the Parliamentary Draftsmen, in
which Government Bills are prepared for introduction into Parliament.
The Ministry of Commerce
In addition to its commercial intelligence work, and its work in connection with
industrial production and the development of new, and the expansion of existing,
industries, the Department is responsible for the business of the Government in
relation to electricity and gas undertakings; roads and bridges and inland public
transport; railways; harbours and inland waterways; fisheries; the development of
the tourist traffic; the regulation and inspection of mines and quarries; mineral
development; scientific development; weights and measures; the registration of
companies and trade unions; and the administration of the Assurance Companies
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
62
Acts and the Industrial Assurance (Northern Ireland) Act, 1924. The Ministry
also performs functions delegated by the United Kingdom Ministry of Power
relating to the distribution and prices of coal and other solid fuels.
The Ministry of Health and Local Government
The Ministry is responsible for the general supervision of the Health Services
in Northern Ireland, which are broadly similar to the National Health Service in
Great Britain. The Ministry also exercises functions under the Housing Acts
(Northern Ireland), supervising the house-building programmes of, and distribut¬
ing grants to, local housing authorities and the Northern Ireland Housing Trust.
Various other functions of local authorities, including planning, public health,
water and sewerage services, welfare services and local authority services generally
are supervised by the Ministry, many of these services attracting specific grants-in-
aid. In addition, the Ministry controls the issue of central financial aid to local
authorities.
The Ministry of Labour and National Insurance
The Ministry is responsible for the administration of the Factories Acts and
other legislation connected with industrial health and welfare; for the administration
of the Wages Councils Act; for the promotion in industry of joint machinery for
negotiation and for assistance in the prevention and settlement of industrial
disputes; for the administration of local employment offices and training centres
and the machinery for dealing with employment questions of all kinds under the
Employment and Training Act and Disabled Persons (Employment) Act, for the
administration of the National Insurance Act and the National Insurance (In¬
dustrial Injuries) Act, and of the Family Allowances Act; and for carrying out
certain statutory functions in connection with the National Assistance Scheme in
conjunction with the National Assistance Board for Northern Ireland.
THE CIVIL SERVICE
A civil servant in Britain is a servant of the Crown (not being the holder of a
political or judicial office), who is employed in a civil capacity and whose remunera¬
tion is found wholly and directly out of moneys voted by Parliament. The number
of civil servants under this definition amounts to more than a million, for it includes
some 385,2001 Government industrial employees in such establishments as Royal
Ordnance factories and Admiralty dockyards. The term Civil Service is, however,
generally used only to cover ‘non-industrial’ members of the staffs of the various
Government Departments in the United Kingdom, or working overseas either in
the Foreign Service or for other Government Departments such as the Common¬
wealth Relations Office. At 1st April, 1958, the total number of non-industrial civil
servants employed in all Departments, at home and overseas, was 630,674 > nearly
one-third of this total are women.
Although the civil servant is legally a servant of the Crown, in practice he serves
the minister in charge of the Department in which he works, by advising in the
formulation of policy and by carrying out policy decisions once they have been
taken. From time to time the minister may change, but the civil servant remains
to serve his successor. In Britain changes of government do not involve changes in
departmental staff; this continuity makes for administrative stability.
1 Part-time staffs are included in these, and subsequent, figures two part-time officers
being reckoned as equivalent to one whole-time officer.
GOVERNMENT AND ADMINISTRATION
63
Development of the Modern Civil Service
The Civil Service in its present form is a product of the past hundred years.
Before then, Departments were free to choose their own staffs, qualifying standards
were unknown, there was no central supervision, and political jobbery was rife.
Measures of reform instigated during the nineteenth century included the sub¬
stitution of open competition for the practice of obtaining Civil Service appoint¬
ments by favour or purchase, and the establishment of an independent body, known
as the Civil Service Commission, to organise recruitment to the service. The great
expansion in State planning which has taken place during the last fifty years, and
the consequent expansion in the numbers of civil servants and the scope of their
duties, have led to further reorganisation. During the last few decades, recruitment
competitions have been adapted to a developing educational system; co-ordination
between the various Departments has been improved; and the search for increased
efficiency in the conduct of public business has been the task of many Government-
appointed commissions and committees of inquiry. As a result, civil servants,
though they remain employees of their Departments, are today members of an
integrated service with common conditions of employment and common traditions
and standards of conduct which belong not to individual Departments but to the
Civil Service as a whole.
Departmental Organisation
The responsibility for the policy and activities of each Department lies with the
minister, who is answerable to Parliament for what the civil servants in the
Department say and do.
The internal organisation of Departments is a matter for each Department to
decide and it varies according to the volume and nature of the work involved.
There are, however, features common to most Departments: for example, the
minister of a major Department is likely to have at the head of his officials a
Permanent Secretary (known as the Permanent Under-Secretary of State in those
Departments where the minister is a Secretary of State) who is also Accounting
Officer and must appear periodically before the Public Accounts Committee; one
or more Deputy Secretaries; and a varying number of Under-Secretaries and
Assistant Secretaries. In addition, major Departments usually have a Principal
Finance Officer and a Principal Establishments and Organisation Officer. A number
of Establishment Divisions have their own Organisation and Methods (or ‘O & M’)
branch, the members of which act in an advisory capacity as ‘efficiency experts’.
Many Departments also have their own legal advisers or solicitors, and their own
Information Division. The use (wholly or in part) of the standard classes and grades
of civil servants, which are described on p. 64, is common to most Departments.
Control of the Service
The measure of uniformity in the Civil Service has largely resulted from the
fact that the Treasury exercises general control. One of the two joint Permanent
Secretaries to the Treasury is the official head of the Home Civil Service and the
principal adviser of the Prime Minister on matters affecting the Civil Service as
a whole, and in particular on appointments to senior posts in the Service. The
Treasury is also responsible for the salaries and conditions of employment of civil
servants; it controls total numbers of staff and the creation of higher posts, main¬
tains a central Organisation and Methods Division which serves all Departments
which do not maintain an Organisation and Methods branch of their own, deals
with general questions relating to training after entry into the Civil Service, and
64 BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
takes the lead on questions concerning the number of Departments and the
distribution of functions.
Classes and Grades
The engagement and position of all civil servants are covered by regulation,
agreement and traditional practice—every civil servant being assured of a definite
status depending upon the post which he is called upon to fill. There are four main
classes of civil servants, each class containing a series of grades. The classes are:
1. The Administrative Class, which is responsible for advising ministers on
’ policy, for dealing with any difficulties which may arise in carrying out
existing policy, and for forecasting the probable effects of new measures
and regulations. This relatively small class, which in April 1958 numbered
2,544, is recruited largely from university graduates.
2. The Executive Class (numbering some 67,300 in April 1958), which is
responsible for the day-to-day conduct of Government business, including
the higher work of supply and accounts, within the framework of estab¬
lished policy. Members of this class may, after entry, train for specialist
work such as that of auditor, actuary or statistician.
3. The Clerical Class (the largest of the main classes, comprising about 181,100
officers including clerical assistants), which undertakes all the usual clerical
work involved in running departmental business, e.g., the preparation of
accounts and the keeping of records, the handling of particular claims in
accordance with known rules, and the summarising and annotation of docu¬
ments for the assistance of senior officers.
4. The Typing Class (about 26,500 members), which consists of shorthand
typists, copy typists and learner typists.
Among other classes are: the Professional, Scientific and Technical Classes, which
consist of some 72,100 civil servants with the necessary qualifications (e.g., doctors,
lawyers, engineers and research workers) for carrying out the wide range of
specialised duties which are now discharged by the Government; the Inspectorate,
which numbers about 2,620; the Ancillary Technical Class, which includes machine
and duplicator operators, prison officers, forest workers and others, and numbers
some 41,500; the Messengerial Class which, in addition to messengers, includes
paper keepers, office cleaners and similar workers (in all some 35,600); and the
Minor and Manipulative Class (with some 200,000 members) which consists entirely
of post office workers, e.g., postmen, postal and telegraph officers, telephonists and
telegraphists, and their immediate supervisors.
The Foreign Service
Her Majesty’s Foreign Service is a separate self-contained service of the Crown,
formed in 1943 as a result of the amalgamation of the Foreign Office and the
Diplomatic Service with the Consular and Commercial-Diplomatic Services. It
provides an interchangeable staff for service both at home and at United Kingdom
diplomatic missions and consular posts abroad and, in 1958, it numbered some
2,520 established members.
The classes of the Foreign Service have their own nomenclature: Branch A
corresponds roughly to the Administrative Class of the Home Civil Service; Branch
B to the Executive and Clerical Classes; and Branch C to the Typing Class.
Branch D, of which there is no direct equivalent in the Home Civil Service, carries
out security and guard duties at Foreign Service posts abroad. Members of
GOVERNMENT AND ADMINISTRATION
65
Branches A, B and C may be employed on any type of Foreign Service work—
diplomatic, consular, commercial and ‘information’. In addition, various specialists
and advisers who are seconded from the fighting Services and from home Govern¬
ment Departments (e.g., those concerned with financial, commercial or labour
matters) are attached to many overseas posts. At many posts abroad, some of the
staff are locally engaged on a ‘temporary’ basis, i.e. they do not normally qualify
for pensions.
Recruitment of Staff
The recruitment of all permanent civil servants is in the hands of the Civil
Service Commission which, in the selection of entrants, is independent of both
ministerial and parliamentary control; its members are appointed by the Crown
on the advice of the Government. The normal method of entry is by open com¬
petition, conducted in accordance with regulations approved by the Treasury and
consisting of written examinations or interviews, or both. The main points of entry
into the four main classes of the Home Civil Service are planned to correspond to
definite levels in the British educational system, and it is the Commission’s duty
to study the requirements of the Civil Service in the light of the education provided
by the schools and universities.
In addition to holding examinations and conducting interviews, the Commission
is responsible for issuing a certificate of qualification in respect of each successful
candidate, for placing new entrants in Departments for which their qualifications
are appropriate, and for watching the careers of those it has selected in order to
ensure that current methods of recruitment are successful and up to date.
Temporary civil servants, who do not qualify for pensions, but are eligible for
gratuities, are normally recruited by the Department concerned, either directly or
with the help of the Ministry of Labour and National Service. No qualifying
examinations are required for entrance on a temporary basis to general service.
Training after Entry
Each of the larger Government Departments has a training officer and a number
of instructors, who organise both general and technical courses where necessary.
Types of courses vary from Department to Department, but nearly all have
systematic instruction of recruits in all classes. There are also ‘refresher’ courses
for more experienced staff covering technical subjects or broader subjects such as
management and supervision.
Methods of training include discussion groups, case studies, role playing, in¬
structional films and educational visits to enable civil servants to study the working
of appropriate outside bodies. In addition, officers in the early years of their service
may be transferred from branch to branch and, more rarely, from Department to
Department, in order that they may gain as wide an experience as possible of Civil
Service activities. Special leave schemes enable a few senior officers, each year, to
travel abroad or to undertake research at United Kingdom universities.
Civil Service training is co-ordinated by the Training and Education Division
of the Treasury, which runs central courses for members of the administrative,
professional and scientific classes at different stages of their careers. In addition,
the Division trains departmental instructors and other special groups, such as
superintendents of typists, and secretaries.
Promotion
A period of probation (lasting from one to two years according to grade, with
extensions in certain instances) is the rule for all new entrants to the permanent
56 BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Civil Service. Promotions from grade to grade are made by Departments; those
from class to class partly through centrally conducted competitions (open only to
serving members of specified civil service classes), and partly by Departments
themselves. All promotions to the Administrative Class from other classes require
Treasury approval. Promotions to most of the highest positions in the Civil Service,
i.e. Permanent Secretary, Deputy Secretary, Principal Establishments Officer and
Principal Finance Officer, must be approved by the Prime Minister; he is advised
in these matters by the Joint Permanent Secretary to the Treasury, who is the
official head of the Home Civil Service.
Conditions of Service
Machinery for negotiation on conditions of service affecting the Civil Service as
a whole is provided by the National Whitley Council,1 which is composed jointly of
official and staff representatives. Negotiating machinery for separate sections of the
Service is provided through the various staff associations, which civil servants are
encouraged to join (e.g., the Civil Service Clerical Association, the Union of Post
Office Workers, the Society of Civil Servants, the Institution of Professional Civil
Servants, and the Association of First Division Civil Servants), and through depart¬
mental Whitley Councils1 (of which there are about 75).
In general, the civil servant receives a salary which is intended to compare
reasonably with that paid for similar work outside the Service, and he normally
receives annual increments up to the maximum of the scale of the grade to which
he belongs. In addition, although a civil servant holds office at the pleasure of the
Crown and may therefore be dismissed at any time, in practice he enjoys a con¬
siderable measure of security of tenure. Thus every permanent civil servant may
reasonably expect a full career in the public service, and a pension on retirement—
though this, again, is not a legal right.
Civil servants are generally ‘conditioned’ to a given number of hours of attend¬
ance a week. Overtime is paid to members of most of the lower salary groups if
they work longer than their ‘conditioned’ hours. The standard working week in
the Service is 42 hours in London and 44 hours in the provinces. Annual leave
varies according to the grade up to a maximum of six weeks, i.e. 30 working days,
a year. Sick leave on full pay, less any National Insurance benefit received, may be
granted to established civil servants for up to six months in any twelve months,
and on reduced pay up to a maximum of one year’s sick leave in any four years.
Political and Private Activities
Officially, the position and functions of a civil servant remain the same which¬
ever political party is in power; and it is his duty to serve the Government of the
day irrespective of his own political opinion. The extent to which a civil servant,
as a private individual, is free to participate in political activities varies according
to grade. For this purpose civil servants are divided into three groups: (1) the
unrestricted, which includes all industrial staff, Post Office clerks, postmen,
cleaners, messengers, and similar workers, who are free to engage in all kinds of
national and local political activities, although, if intending to stand for Parliament,
they should resign before nomination day, since a serving civil servant cannot sit
in the House of Commons; (2) the intermediate, which includes typists, clerical
1 Whitley Councils are representative bodies for negotiation and joint consultation
between managements and staffs; the councils are named after Mr. J. H. Whitley, former
Speaker of the House of Commons and chairman of a committee which investigated
industrial unrest from 1916 to 1919.
GOVERNMENT AND ADMINISTRATION 67
assistants, clerical officers, and analogous grades, who are free to engage in all
political activities, except parliamentary candidature, subject to certain conditions
and with the permission of their Departments; and (3) the restricted, which
includes all civil servants not in the other two groups. This last group is barred
from taking part in national political activities, but may seek permission to engage
in local political activities, subject to certain conditions.
Civil servants of every grade may, of course, exercise the right of all citizens to
register their private political opinions on appropriate occasions, e.g., at a general
election or at local authority elections.
Normally the Government is not concerned with the private political views of
its servants. There are, however, duties where secrecy is so vitally important to State
security that the State is not justified in employing any one to carry them out whose
reliability is in doubt, and therefore no one who is known to be a member of, or
actively associated with, the Communist Party or with Fascist organisations is
employed in connection with such work. In general, however, every civil servant
may engage in such private activities as he wishes, provided that such activities do
not in any way conflict with his official duties, nor with the provisions of the Official
Secrets Acts of 1911 and 1920 and the Prevention of Corruption Act of 1906. A
civil servant must not, however, use his official position to further his private
interests; and he is therefore subject to restrictions in matters of commerce and
business from which the ordinary citizen is free, e.g., he may not hold private
interests in public contracts; and he may not use official information in writing,
broadcasting or lecturing without the express approval of his Department. Above
all, a civil servant is expected to conform to the high standards of integrity which
characterise the Service to which he belongs.
LOCAL GOVERNMENT
Local government has been defined as government by elected local bodies charged
with administrative and executive duties in matters concerning the inhabitants of a
particular district or place and vested with powers to make byelaws for their
guidance.
Government on a local basis has been part of the administrative system of the
United Kingdom for many centuries. It has existed in England continuously since
Saxon times. In its present shape, however, it dates back only to the later nine¬
teenth century, when the conception of local government by popularly elected
councils received statutory recognition.
The first 40 years of the present century witnessed a sharp increase in, and
expansion of, environmental and social services, and a corresponding increase in the
responsibilities of local authorities upon whom the greater part of the management
of these services devolved. Legislation passed in the post-war period has made
some further changes; on the one hand the powers of local authorities relating to
the provision of hospitals, gas and electricity supplies and (in England and Wales)
valuation for rating purposes have been transferred to statutory boards or to Govern¬
ment Departments, while on the other, local authorities (mainly the councils of
counties and county boroughs in England and Wales and of counties and large
burghs in Scotland) have been charged with certain additional or new responsi¬
bilities in connection with the health services, care of children, town and country
planning, care of the aged and a number of other welfare services. The latest Acts
—the Local Government Act, 1958, and the Local Government and Miscellaneous
Financial Provisions (Scotland) Act, 1958—have made changes in the local govern¬
ment financial system of Great Britain to give greater independence to local
68
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
authorities in the spending of money in their own areas. The Local Government
Act has also provided for some devolution of responsibility for county services to
the councils of some of the larger county districts, and has established machinery
for the review and alteration of local government areas and authorities in England
(outside Greater London) and Wales.
Relationship between Central and Local Government
As the supreme authority in the United Kingdom, Parliament controls local
authorities through Acts of Parliament, which require or permit elected local
councils to implement policies prescribed and defined in those Acts. The scope of
local government is limited by the same means; no council may go beyond the
bounds fixed for its activities by an Act of Parliament.
Legislation is supported by departmental supervision: Parliament makes certain
ministers responsible for securing the efficient functioning of local government
services. Departmental supervision is exercised by means of inspections, inquiries,
examinations of statistics, authorisation of loans, the issue of advisory circulars and
statutory instruments, the approval of byelaws, and the administration of Govern¬
ment grants. The Ministry of Housing and Local Government is the main link
between local authorities and the central Government in England and Wales; in
Scotland the Scottish Home Department is generally responsible for local govern¬
ment; and in Northern Ireland the Ministry of Health and Local Government.
Principal Types of Local Authority
For purposes of local government, England and Wales and Northern Ireland are
divided into county boroughs and administrative counties. Administrative counties
are further divided into three types of county district: municipal or non-county
boroughs; urban districts; and rural districts, which are themselves sub-divided
into parishes (except in Northern Ireland). Each of these divisions is administered
by a different kind of local council, as follows:
England and Wales1
county councils (61) rural district councils (474)2
county borough councils (83) parish councils (some 7,500) or
non-county borough councils (318) parish meetings (some 3,300)'
urban district councils (563)
Northern Ireland
county councils (6) urban district councils (25)
county borough councils (2) town commissioners (1)
borough councils (9) rural district councils (31)
Scotland
The local authorities in Scotland are:
county councils (33, of which two pairs are combined for certain purposes)
town councils (198, consisting of: the authorities for counties of cities, 4; other
large burghs, 20; and small burghs, 174)
district councils (199; two counties are not divided into districts).
1 Excluding the county of London.
2 Including the Isles of Scilly.
GOVERNMENT AND ADMINISTRATION 69
There are, in addition, the local authorities for London, which are unlike those
in the rest of the United Kingdom. They are:
the London County Council
the Corporation of the City of London
metropolitan borough councils (28).
Constitution of Councils
Local councils comprise a number of elected councillors (and, in some cases,
aldermen elected by the councillors), presided over by a chairman who has varied
ceremonial and civic duties to perform in addition to his work on the council.
In most boroughs of England and Wales and Northern Ireland the chairman is
the Mayor; in the City of London and certain important boroughs, the Lord
Mayor; in the Scottish counties, the Convenor; and in the burghs, the Provost or
Lord Provost.
Local Government Commissions
Two Local Government Commissions have been established to review the
general county and county borough pattern in England (outside the Greater
London area) and Wales respectively, and, in special review areas (Tyneside, West
Yorkshire, South East Lancashire, Merseyside and the West Midlands) the district
pattern and the distribution of functions as well. The Commissions are required
to make recommendations for such changes in the pattern as may appear to them
desirable after investigating the circumstances of local government in each area
under review, and after consulting with the relevant local authorities and other
interested bodies and persons. The final proposals of the Commissions will be given
effect by ministerial order, with or without modification.
The present system and the working of local government in the Greater London
area are being examined by a Royal Commission set up by Royal Warrant in
November 1957 to recommend whether any, and if so what, changes in the local
government structure and the distribution of local government functions in the
area, or any part of it, would secure more effective and convenient local government.
Functions and Services
It is the primary duty of every local authority to provide and administer such
environmental and social services as it may be required to provide and administer
by an Act of Parliament. It may provide additional services under the permissive
powers of a general Act or under powers granted to it by Adoptive Acts or by
local or Private Bill legislation.
The responsibilities of local authorities depend upon the type of council. In
England (outside the County of London) and Wales and Northern Ireland, for
example, county borough councils are all-purpose authorities, while both county
councils and county district councils have particular functions allotted to them,
which they exercise independently to a considerable extent, although there is a
certain degree of delegation from county councils to county district councils
especially in the fields of planning and, in England and Wales, in the education,
health and welfare services.
The broad principle underlying the distribution of powers and duties between
the London County Council (LCC) and the metropolitan borough councils is that
all those powers and duties which require uniformity of action throughout the
whole of London are administered by the LCC, while those that can be locally
managed are vested in the borough councils. The City Corporation exercises, in
?o
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
the City of London, the general powers administered and duties performed by the
metropolitan borough councils, and also a number of functions which, in the rest of
London, devolve on the LCC. It is not, however, an all-purpose authority, since
certain services in the City, e.g., education, are administered by the LCC.
In Scotland, the town councils of the counties of cities are all-purpose authori¬
ties; elsewhere the county councils exercise very many local government functions.
In large burghs, they administer education, valuation for rating, and, in some cases,
the police service, all other functions being exercised by the town councils. In
small burghs, county councils undertake a number of important functions, but
housing and some other services are administered by the town councils. The
smallest authorities (the parish councils or parish meetings in England and Wales
and the district councils in Scotland) have a few functions which they may exercise
of right.
The services provided by the councils are generally classified under three heads—
environmental, protective and personal.
Environmental Services are services designed to secure and improve the
citizens’ surroundings. The majority are public health and sanitary services
administered in England and Wales either by the county, county district, or
parish councils (in London by the metropolitan borough councils) in Northern
Ireland by the county and county borough councils, and in Scotland by the
county and town councils, e.g., the inspection and abatement of nuisances,
drainage, sewerage, street cleansing, refuse collection and disposal, the super¬
vision of water supplies, measures for ensuring food hygiene, measures for
preventing the pollution of air, rodent control, and the provision of baths and
washhouses. There are also the services for bridge and highway construction
and maintenance, for street lighting, public safety on the highways, and the
provision of amenities such as parks and recreation grounds, which are
generally administered by the same authorities and also, in part, by district
councils in Scotland. Town and country planning is done in England and Wales
by the county councils, except where it is delegated to county district councils,
and in Scotland by county councils and the town councils of large burghs.
County borough councils, as all-purpose authorities, normally provide and
administer all their own environmental services.
Protective Services include the fire service, the civil defence service and the
police. The fire service is administered throughout England and Wales by the
county borough councils and the county councils, or by joint authorities (or
joint committees) set up by those councils if they amalgamate; and in Scotland,
by the county councils and the town councils of most of the large burghs or
by joint boards. The county and county borough councils, together with a few
county district councils and, in London, the metropolitan borough councils
and the City Corporation, are responsible for organising the local divisions of
the Civil Defence Corps. The police service is administered by Standing Joint
Committees in the counties of England and Wales, by Watch Committees in
the county boroughs, or by committees consisting of representatives of the
constituent authorities in the case of combined police authorities. In London,
the City Corporation has jurisdiction over the police force in its area, while
the Home Secretary controls the Metropolitan Police Force. The police
authorities in Scotland are the county councils, the town councils of large
burghs, or joint committees for combined forces.
Personal Services are services mainly designed to promote the well-being of
individuals. The type of authority concerned depends on the nature of the
GOVERNMENT AND ADMINISTRATION
71
services, which range from health services, education, and housing to the pro¬
vision of entertainments. The services concerned primarily with health and
welfare include the provision of ante-natal, post-natal and child welfare clinics
and some residential and day nurseries; the supervision of midwives; the
provision of health visitors and home nursing services; measures for the pre¬
vention of illness and the after-care of physically or mentally sick persons; the
provision of domestic help where necessary; the ambulance service; the
provision of facilities for vaccination and immunisation against certain
infectious diseases; and the services for the permanently disabled or handi¬
capped, for the aged and infirm and for children deprived of a normal home
life. Education and culture are promoted by the establishment and main¬
tenance of various types of schools; by the provision of adult education
centres, and art and technical colleges; by the award of grants and scholarships
to students of all kinds; and by the provision of libraries, art galleries and
museums.
There are also some trading services, e.g., passenger transport, water supply,
and harbour, dock and pier services.
Local Authority Elections
The normal term of office of a councillor elected to any form of local government
is three years; aldermen hold office for six years. In some local authority areas the
whole council retires every third year and another is elected immediately; in other
areas elections are held annually, when one-third of the councillors retire. Procedure
at local government elections is governed by rules laid down in the Representation
of the People Act, 1949.
Any person (including a member of the House of Lords) is entitled to vote at a
local government election provided that he or she is 21 years of age or over and a
British subject, or a citizen of the Irish Republic, and is registered as a local govern¬
ment elector for the area for which the election is held. In Great Britain, a person
qualifies for registration as a local government elector if on the qualifying date for
the register (which is compiled annually) he or she is resident in the area or occupies
as owner or tenant any rateable land or premises in the area of a yearly value of not
less than £10. In Northern Ireland, in order to qualify for registration as a local
government elector, a person must have been born in Northern Ireland, or,
alternatively, have resided continuously in the United Kingdom for seven years
immediately prior to the qualifying date and must have either a resident occupier’s
qualification, or a general occupier’s qualification.
Voting takes place at polling stations arranged by the council concerned, under
the supervision of a presiding officer specially appointed for the purpose. The
procedure governing voting methods in Great Britain is similar to that followed at
Parliamentary elections, although facilities for postal voting are more restricted.
Every candidate for election stands either as a representative of one of the
national political parties, or as a member of an association representing some local
interest, or as an Independent. Each must be nominated by two electors, as
proposer and seconder; and in England and Wales (except in elections for metro¬
politan borough councils, rural district councils and parish councils) eight other
electors for the area must assent to the nomination. In Scotland, county and district
council candidates require proposers but no assenters, town council candidates a
proposer and five assenters. A candidate for election as a councillor must be of
British nationality and over 21 years of age and must either (1) be registered as a
local government elector in the register of electors for the area for which he seeks
election, or (2) have resided within that area during the whole of the twelve months
F
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
72
preceding the election (or within 3 miles in the case of parish councils), or (3) in
England and Wales, own freehold or leasehold land in the area. Candidates are also
subject to a number of statutory disqualifications designed to ensure that unsuitable
persons do not offer themselves for election. -
Procedure at local government elections in Northern Ireland is governed by
electoral regulations made by the Ministry of Home Affairs for Northern Ireland.
These regulations are similar to those which apply in Great Britain, though differ¬
ing in certain particulars; for example, the town clerk or the clerk to the council is
the returning officer for all elections to the authority; there is no postal voting and
the only persons who may vote by proxy are Service voters.
In parliamentary elections, the contest is normally between several candidates
for one seat. In local government elections there are usually a good many seats to
be filled, and nearly all county boroughs, non-county boroughs and metropolitan
boroughs in England and Wales and the larger burghs in Scotland are divided into
wards. Except in metropolitan boroughs, the number of councillors for each ward
must be three or a multiple of three. All other local authority areas, except the ad¬
ministrative counties, may be divided into wards or they may be left as single units,
depending on their size. The administrative counties are split up in accordance with
orders made by the Home Secretary or the Secretary of State for Scotland, into
electoral divisions which return members to the county council. The London
County Council is organised in three-member divisions, which are the same as the
parliamentary constituencies in its area.
Internal Organisation of Local Authorities
Local authorities are free to a very considerable extent to make their own internal
arrangements and to choose the means and methods by which they will discharge
their responsibilities. Questions of policy and principle are usually decided by the
whole council, which appoints committees to carry out the detailed administration
of its various services. The more important of the committees of the larger author¬
ities divide their work among sub-committees, which stand to the parent committee
in a relation similar to that of the main committees to the whole council. The
execution of the policy decided upon by the council and the committees rests with
salaried officers and employees, whose number may vary from about half a dozen
in a small rural district to several thousand in the large counties and in the larger
county boroughs.
Apart from one or two minor provisions regarding the representation of specialists
on committees and the length of time certain members may hold office, committees
of councils are remarkably free from legal restrictions; even those known as
‘statutory’ committees are constituted according to individual requirements and
not according to any set pattern laid down. For purposes of classification, however,
they may be divided into two kinds: ordinary committees and joint committees.
Ordinary committees may be further divided into statutory committees, the
appointment of which is compulsory under an Act of Parliament; standing com¬
mittees, which are appointed in accordance with the standing orders of the council
on a permanent basis according to the extent of the council’s business; and special
committees, which a council may set up for a limited period to deal with a particular
problem that once solved is unlikely to recur.
Joint committees or joint boards consist of representatives of more than one
authority. They are usually established for services that can be more effectively
administered over a wider area than that controlled by a single council, e.g., town
and country planning, water supplies and the police service.
GOVERNMENT AND ADMINISTRATION
73
Committees of a local authority may be advisory or executive; their powers and
duties are usually laid down in the appointing council’s standing orders or, in the
case of a county or large burgh in Scotland, in the council’s administrative scheme.
A council is free to delegate all its powers to committees except its powers in con¬
nection with raising loans, levying rates or issuing precepts, which are legally
reserved to the council as a whole.
Officers and Employees
About 1-2 million persons (including teachers, transport staff and building
workers) are employed in local government service in Great Britain. Certain posts,
e.g., the clerk, the treasurer, and the medical officer of health, are compulsory in
almost all councils, but, apart from these, councils are free to fill such other posts
as they deem necessary for carrying out their work. Choice of personnel is also left
to a great extent to the individual council; in theory a few appointments of chief
officers are subject to some central control, but in practice, the nominee of the
council is nearly always accepted.
Officers are normally of three kinds: heads of departments or chief officers,
whose duties are mainly of an administrative and managerial kind; subordinate
officers employed in a professional, clerical or technical capacity; and manual
workers who are employed to do the actual physical work for which the council is
responsible. As a rule, senior staff appointments are made at the instance of the
committee or committees particularly concerned; while most junior appointments
are made by heads of departments, who are also responsible for engaging the manual
labour required. Appointments and engagements are always made in conformity
with a set establishment, and committees are informed of any appointments which
they have not made themselves.
Rates of pay and conditions of service for local authority staff are within the
jurisdiction of the employing council (except where the proposed salary of an
officer requires the approval of a Government Department, as in the case of the
clerk of a county council in England and Wales). They are based on recommenda¬
tions made by the Whitley Councils,1 of which there are several, including the
National Joint Council for Local Authorities’ Administrative, Professional, Techni¬
cal and Clerical Services, the National Joint Industrial Council for Local Authori¬
ties’ Non-Trading Services (Manual Workers), the National Joint Council for
County Council Roadmen, and, in Scotland, the Joint Negotiating Committee for
Chief Officials of Local Authorities (Scotland) and the Joint Industrial Councils
for Local Authority Services. In England and Wales, conditions of service and
salary scales for senior local government officers are determined by special
negotiating machinery.
All local government officers are expected to maintain a high standard of conduct:
as public servants they ‘must not only be honest in fact, but must be beyond the
reach of the suspicion of dishonesty’.
Local Government Finance
Total local authority expenditure on current and capital account amounts annually
to over £1,500 million. Income derives from Government grants (paid in Northern
Ireland by the Government of Northern Ireland), from local rates, from loans, from
trading receipts, rents, fees and other miscellaneous sources.
Government grants, which provide over 30 per cent of income, will, from 1st
April, 1959, be mainly in the form of general grants paid to the county and county

borough councils in England and Wales by the Minister of Housing and Local
Government and to the county and town councils in Scotland by the Secretary of
State for Scotland in respect of education, town planning, fire services, child care,
road safety, traffic control, physical training and recreation, and a few other services.
The total sum of the general grants will be allocated each year and fixed in advance
for a period of two or more years. In fixing the total amount, the Government is
required to take into consideration the current rate of expenditure on the services
concerned, the probable fluctuation in the demand for those services, the need for
developing services, and the extent to which, having regard to the general economic
condition of the country, it is reasonable to develop them.
Other Government grants are: percentage grants, of which the two principal
remaining examples are those for the police service and highways; unit grants,
e.g., housing subsidies; rate deficiency grants (Exchequer equalisation grants in
Scotland), which are contributions to the general revenues of the poorer local
authorities; and assigned revenues, which are the proceeds of certain national
taxes handed over to local authorities, e.g., dog, game and gun licences and the
licence fees for hawkers, pawnbrokers, money-lenders and refreshment houses.
Rates, which are a form of local taxation paid by the occupiers of land and
buildings in a local authority area as contributions to the cost of local services,
provide over a quarter of the total income of local authorities. They are levied by
a poundage on the rateable value of property, which in England and Wales is
equivalent to the rent which the property might reasonably be expected to com¬
mand if let from year to year, with the tenant bearing the rates and the cost of
insurance and repairs. There are certain statutory reliefs from rate liability, notably
for agricultural land and buildings, which are entirely exempt, and for industrial
and freight transport premises, which since 1929 have been rated at 25 per cent
of the net annual value.1
Valuation is undertaken by the valuation officers of the Board of Inland Revenue;
appeals may be made to local valuation courts, each consisting of three members
of an independent local valuation panel, and thereafter to the Lands Tribunal.
In Scotland, valuation has hitherto been based primarily on the annual rent actually
payable; valuation on a basis similar to that in England and Wales will come into
force in 1961. Valuation is carried out by assessors appointed by the councils of
counties and counties of cities. Appeals lie to the valuation appeal committee of
each valuation area and thereafter to the Lands Valuation Appeal Court of the
Court of Session. A Scottish Valuation Advisory Council has been established by
the Secretary of State for Scotland.
The responsibility for levying and collecting the rates in England and Wales lies
with the councils of county boroughs and county districts; in London, with the
City Corporation and the metropolitan borough councils. County councils finance
themselves by issuing a precept on the county districts (in London the metropolitan
borough councils and the City Corporation) for the sums of money required;
while parishes are financed by rates levied by the appropriate rural district council
on property within the parish as an addition to the general rates. Rates in Scotland
are levied by the town councils in burghs and by county councils elsewhere; to
cover their expenditure, district councils issue a requisition each year to the county
council; a town council has to meet an annual requisition from the county council
in respect of the burgh’s share of the expenditure on functions exercised by the
county council throughout the county, including the burgh. In Northern Ireland,
county councils are responsible for making, levying and collecting the rates, except
1 From April 1959, the proportion will be increased to 50 per cent.
GOVERNMENT AND ADMINISTRATION 75
in such parts of the county as fall within the jurisdiction of the county borough,
borough, or urban district councils.
Loans may be raised by all types of local authority for financing capital expendi¬
ture, subject to the consent of the Minister of Housing and Local Government or
the Secretary of State for Scotland, who are guided by the recommendations of the
Government Department responsible for the service for which the capital is
required. Borrowing powers for specific purposes are sometimes included among
the provisions of local Acts, while the London County Council seeks parliamentary
sanction every year to raise the money it needs for capital expenditure.
Loans may be raised by issuing stock upon the Stock Exchange, by internal
borrowing, by private mortgage, or from the Public Works Loan Board, which is
financed by the Exchequer.
Internal control of finance is exercised on behalf of the council concerned by a
finance committee, whose function is to keep the financial policy of the council
under constant review. External control is carried out by means of an annual
audit, which in the case of all councils in England and Wales (except for certain
general accounts in about two-thirds of the borough councils) is operated by
district auditors appointed by the Ministry of Housing and Local Government.
Borough councils must use the services of the district auditor for accounts which
relate to education, national assistance, children, local health services, coast pro¬
tection, motor tax, rate collection, police, fire, civil defence and town and country'
planning, but they may and sometimes do employ a professional firm of auditors
to do other work. In Scotland, all accounts are audited by a professional auditor
appointed by the Secretary of State for Scotland and paid by the council.
THE LAW
The maintenance of public order in the United Kingdom is effected, generally
speaking, by two agencies—the judiciary and the police. Both are concerned in
different ways with the obedience of the citizen to the law.
Law is said to be based on the concepts of order and compulsion. In the legal
sense, it has been defined as any rule which will be enforced by the courts; as it
applies to a country, it is usually understood as the set of rules by which the
citizens of that country will expect to regulate their conduct in relation to their
fellow citizens and to the State.
There is no written code of law in the United Kingdom. The question whether
a particular rule is recognised as law is determined, where possible, by consideration
of the authorities: statutes, common law, and the opinions of legal writers of
established reputation (although these are not law until accepted as such by the
courts). If none of these authorities exists, the judge uses a process of analogy:
that is to say, he bases his decision in a case on its similarity to a previous case in
which judgment has already been given.
Common law originated in the customs of the realm, and has been built up by the
decisions of the courts. A supplementary system of law, known as ‘equity’, came
into being during the Middle Ages to temper justice with mercy where conscience
was opposed to the rigours of the law and to provide and enforce more effective
protection for existing legal rights, and later hardened into a separate body of legal
rules. In 1873, the courts of equity were fused with the courts of common law, so
that all courts now apply both systems, but where they conflict, equity prevails.
Statute law includes Acts of Parliament and delegated or subordinate legislation
made under powers conferred by Parliament.
The Treaty of Union between England and Scotland in 1707 included the
provision that Scotland should retain its own system of law, and differences in law
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
76
and legal procedure between Scotland and the rest of the United Kingdom remain.
The Scottish common law, unlike its English counterpart, has, in general, preferred
broad principles to strict adherence to judicial precedent, and has often adopted and
adapted ideas from other legal codes; and there are separate Scottish statutes in
many fields of legislation. Nevertheless, the very close links that have been forged
between England and Scotland since 1707, and the steady increase in the number of
Acts of Parliament that apply uniformly throughout the United Kingdom, have
narrowed the gap between the legal systems of the two countries until the points of
similarity have become as numerous as the differences, and there is now a consider¬
able volume of law common to both countries, generally known as ‘British’ law.
The leading branches of the law in the United Kingdom, as in most other
countries, are civil law and criminal law. The purpose of civil law is to uphold
private rights, and to redress private wrongs which do not involve moral guilt.
Criminal law deals with wrongs considered injurious to the community, and
consequently punishable by the State.
Criminal Justice
English law provides that if anyone is arrested or detained otherwise than upon
lawful grounds,1 the writ of Habeas Corpus may be invoked to set him free, and he
may sue the person who detained him for false imprisonment. The writ of Habeas
Corpus may be granted by a Divisional Court of the Queen’s Bench Division or by
any judge of the High Court against the person who detains the prisoner, and this
person must then appear before the court on the day named to show cause for the
detention; if he can show no cause, the prisoner must be released forthwith.
Lawful arrest may be either by warrant (which must contain a statement of the
specific offence with which the accused is charged) or, in certain cases, without
warrant, when the police officer making the arrest must have sufficient evidence to
lay before a court of law, should he be called upon to make a prima facie case. An
arrested person must be charged at once and (unless granted bail by a senior police
officer) brought without delay before a magistrates’ court sitting in public. It is a
basic principle of the legal system that every accused person must be presumed
innocent until his guilt has been proved by the prosecution, and it has been laid
down that, in the conduct of a criminal case, the prosecution shall neither have, nor
appear to have, any advantage over the defence. Therefore, no prisoner can be
compelled to answer the questions of the police before trial; but if he is prepared to
do so, he must be warned that anything that he says may be taken down and given
in evidence at his trial.2 Private interrogation before an examining magistrate prior
to public trial forms no part of English criminal proceedings.
Prisoners awaiting trial either before a magistrates’ court or before a higher
court may, at the discretion of the court, be released on bail—that is to say, they
may be temporarily discharged subject to their entering into a recognisance, with
or without sureties, for a reasonable sum of money, to appear in court at the time
appointed for the trial.
Any person accused of a crime may be assisted at his trial by a professional
lawyer. If he cannot afford to pay for legal representation he may be granted legal

where a person of proved capacity to pay refuses to do so); by order of a court of law or of
either House of Parliament, upon the ground of contempt; detention of persons found to
be insane or mentally defective; detention of children by their parents or guardians.

once a police officer has made up his mind to prefer a charge against the person, he must
warn him in similar terms.
GOVERNMENT AND ADMINISTRATION

aid; this is at the discretion of the court, except in the case of a person charged
with murder, who must be granted legal aid if his means are insufficient. During
his trial, the accused person or defendant has the right to hear and subsequently
to cross-examine all the witnesses for the prosecution, to call witnesses on his own
account, and to address the court. He may also give evidence in his own defence,
although he cannot be compelled so to do. Once acquitted no accused person can
ever again be charged with that particular offence in any court of law.
There are certain differences in the Scottish system, but the protection of persons
against unlawful detention and the facilities for accused persons to defend them¬
selves are similar.
The Jury System
Generally speaking, all the more serious crimes, i.e. crimes known as indictable
offences because a formal written accusation or ‘indictment’ is required for their
prosecution, must be tried in a superior court before a jury. In English law,
however, certain specified indictable offences may be dealt with instead at a
magistrates’ court if the defendant consents. Conversely a criminal case which
would ordinarily be dealt with in a magistrates’ court must usually be heard before
a jury if the offence is punishable by more than three months’ imprisonment and
the defendant elects to be so tried.
A jury consists of twelve persons duly summoned in pursuance of a precept
from the court. Most property owners and ratepayers (men and women alike) are
liable to be summoned for jury service if they are British subjects and are between
the ages of 21 and 60, unless they are disqualified as, for example, having been
convicted of an infamous crime. Members of certain professions are, however,
exempt from service, and no person can be summoned to serve on any jury more
than once in any one year unless all the jurors on the list have already been sum¬
moned to serve during that same year.
In trials by jury it is, broadly speaking, the duty of the judge to determine
questions of law, including questions as to the admissibility of the evidence, and
for the jury to decide questions of fact. In criminal cases, therefore, the jury has
to decide whether the accused has been proved guilty by the evidence placed
before it; if it finds the defendant guilty, sentence is passed by the judge. The
judge sums up the evidence for the benefit of the jury, but never accompanies the
jury when it retires to consider its verdict. The verdict of a jury must be unanimous;
if its members are unable to reach agreement, the case must be retried before a
new jury. Members of the jury are completely independent of both the judiciary
and the executive. Moreover, although both the prosecution and the defence have
the right, before the trial opens, to object to any member of the jury on the ground
of his lack of impartiality, once members have been sworn in they are free from
interference of any kind, even if, as sometimes happens, they bring in a verdict in
apparent contradiction to the summing up of the judge. It is an offence to assault,
threaten or attempt to corrupt a juryman either before or during a trial.
Procedure under Scottish law differs from the foregoing in a number of important
respects; notably, the verdict may be by a bare majority of the jury (which in
Scotland consists of fifteen persons in criminal cases and twelve in civil cases) and,
in addition to ‘guilty’ or ‘not guilty’, may also be given as ‘not proven’; this last
verdict (which does not exist in English law) involves acquittal in the same way as
‘not guilty’.
In England and Wales, either party may insist on trial by jury in civil courts in
cases involving claims for defamation, malicious prosecution, false imprisonment,
seduction, breach of promise to marry, or fraud; other civil cases are tried by jury
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
?8
only if the court, in its discretion, so orders on the application of one or both
parties to the dispute. Where there is no jury, the trial is by judge alone. In the trial
of a civil action, the jury is responsible for deciding questions of fact (as in the trial
of criminal cases) and also the amount of damages to be awarded to the injured party.
The procedure in civil cases in Scottish courts again differs in some respects.
At certain inquests at coroners’ courts in England and Wales a jury is required
to be present to return a verdict on how, when and where a deceased person died.
The jury in this instance consists of not fewer than seven and not more than eleven
jurors. A jury is also required at an inquest held by a coroner to decide whether
objects of gold or silver found in the ground are ‘ treasure trove’.
Law of Evidence
Evidence in the legal sense is all the legal means, exclusive of mere argument,
which tend to prove or disprove any matter of fact, the truth of which is submitted
to judicial investigation. The law relating to it is, in general, the same in criminal
and in civil trials; but, because of the peculiar nature of a criminal trial—the
gravity of the issue, the extent to which the public interest is involved and the
penalty to which the prisoner may be subjected—some of the rules, as they relate
to the proof of the case against the prisoner, are applied with greater rigour and
severity in the course of criminal than in the course of civil proceedings. Thus,
hearsay evidence (oral or written statements made by persons not called as wit¬
nesses) is not as a rule admitted; and although the uncorroborated evidence of one
witness is, as a matter of English law, sufficient, a conviction solely on the evidence
of an accomplice (or accomplices) is, in practice, never allowed, unless the judge
has warned the jury of the dangers of convicting without corroboration. In Scotland,
apart from a few statutory exceptions, no person may be convicted unless there is
evidence of at least two witnesses, or corroboration of one witness by facts and
circumstances which clearly implicate the accused person in the crime.
Evidence of admissions of guilt by an accused person before trial are accepted
in a criminal trial only subject to certain strict conditions designed to ensure that
the prisoner has fully understood that his confession may be used in evidence, and
that it is a voluntary confession, not obtained from the prisoner either by fear of
prejudice or hope of advantage. The previous history of the prisoner may only be
used against him if he has either expressly set up his own virtuous character as
an argument for his innocence, or attacked a witness or the prosecutor, or given
evidence against a co-defendant, in which case, should he choose to give evidence
himself, he may be asked questions about his own previous convictions, provided
that they are relevant and not too remote in time.
THE COURTS
The courts that apply the law in the United King'dom are broadly speaking
divided into civil and criminal courts, although no hard and fast line can be drawn,
since the distinction is a comparatively modern one. Quite a number of civil cases
are, in fact, heard in criminal courts; while occasionally a criminal case may be
heard in what is primarily a civil court.
Civil Courts in England and Wales
The more important of the civil courts in England and Wales are:
County Courts
County courts are so arranged that there is no part of the country more than a
reasonable distance from one of them. These courts may be regarded as popular
tribunals’; nearly three-quarters of a million cases are entered in them every year,
GOVERNMENT AND ADMINISTRATION
79
although comparatively few ever reach the stage of trial, many being settled out of
court. County courts are presided over by a paid judge, who usually sits alone,
although he may sit with a jury. There are sixty-nine county court judges now in
office.
Most of the county courts (of which there are over 400) do not sit continuously,
so that one judge can preside over several courts. If pressure of business is so great,
however, as to cause delays in the administration of justice in any district, the Lord
Chancellor may, on representations made to him by the judge of the district,
appoint a person (who must previously have held office as a judge or have been a
barrister of at least seven years’ standing) to act for the judge at any sitting of the
court.
The general jurisdiction of the county court covers all common law actions,
provided that the amount claimed does not exceed £400, although some claims
where the personal reputation of the plaintiff is involved, e.g., for libel, can only
be tried there in exceptional circumstances. Actions which may involve awards in
excess of this sum may be transferred to the High Court by order of the presiding
judge on application by the plaintiff. Cases which fall under the specific jurisdic¬
tion of the county courts, e.g., those connected with agricultural holdings, rent
restrictions, hire purchase agreements and other matters governed by statute or
ministerial order, are tried irrespective of the amount involved.
In addition to the ordinary county courts, there are still a few local courts with
somewhat similar jurisdiction. Most of these are survivals from the medieval
borough courts, and have little or no work to do at the present time, but the
Liverpool Court of Passage, the Salford Hundred Court and the Mayor’s and City
of London Court are still comparatively well used.
The High Court of Justice
The High Court of Justice forms part of the Supreme Court of Judicature. The
Supreme Court of Judicature largely took its present form in 1873. It is composed
of the High Court and the Court of Appeal.
The High Court sits in three divisions: the Queen’s Bench Division, the
Chancery Division, and the Probate, Divorce and Admiralty Division. These
divisions derive from the old courts of the same names which existed before 1873,
and cases are distributed between them as tradition and convenience dictate.
The Queen’s Bench Division is staffed by the Lord Chief Justice and 24 puisne
judges, i.e. judges without special office of their own. These judges are mainly
concerned with ordinary civil actions, e.g., debt cases, actions for damages, revenue
cases, insurance cases and commercial cases; but they also hear criminal cases at
assizes.
The Chancery Division is officially headed by the Lord Chancellor; but most of
the work is done by seven puisne judges who remain in London all the time. The
jurisdiction of the Chancery Division derives from the equity system, and its work
covers actions for the administration of the estates of deceased persons, partnership
actions, actions connected with trusts and mortgages, some tax cases, the care of
infants’ estates, and company and bankruptcy matters.
The Probate, Divorce and Admiralty Division deals, as its name implies, with
the proof of wills; with Admiralty and shipping cases; and with divorce cases, many
of which are heard (at present) either before judges or before specially appointed
commissioners—often county court judges.
Appellate Courts
There are two appellate courts in civil law actions—the Court of Appeal, which
is part of the Supreme Court of Judicature, and the House of Lords.
8o
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
There are several ex officio members of the Court of Appeal, but its effective
head is a judge called the Master of the Rolls, who is assisted by eight Lords
Justices of Appeal. Appeals lie to the Court of Appeal from the county courts, the
Mayor’s and City of London Court and the civil side of the High Court. The
Court of Appeal generally sits in two or three divisions, with three judges to a
division. . r r j
From the Court of Appeal, a further appeal is possible to the House of Lords,
with the leave of the House of Lords or of the Court of Appeal. Such appeals are
usually heard by five of the nine Lords of Appeal in Ordinary, who are paid pro¬
fessional judges with peerages for life. In addition, the Lord Chancellor and any
peers who have held ‘high judicial office’ are entitled to sit. The House of Lords
is the supreme court of appeal in civil cases in the whole of the United Kingdom.
Civil Courts in Scotland
Sheriff Courts
Sheriff courts in their civil capacity correspond roughly to county courts in
England and Wales, but they have a wider jurisdiction unlimited by the value of
the case. Scotland is divided into 12 sheriffdoms, each provided with a sheriff and
a number of sheriffs-substitute. The work of the sheriff court is normally done by
a sheriff-substitute, against whose judgment an appeal may be made to the sheriff
or directly to the Court of Session.
Minor civil matters (actions not exceeding £$ in value) may be tried by justices
of the peace.
The Court of Session
The Court of Session is the supreme civil court in Scotland. It was established in
1532 and consists at present of 15 judges. The court is divided into two parts the
Inner House, which is mainly an appeal court, and the Outer House, a court of
first instance, where, inter alia, all actions for divorce are taken. The Inner House
is divided into two divisions of equal status, each consisting of four judges, the
First Division being presided over by the Lord President, and the Second Division
by the Lord Justice Clerk. From the Inner House, an appeal may lie to the House
of Lords.
The Scottish Land Court
This is a special court in Scotland for dealing with certain agricultural matters.
The court is presided over by a legal chairman, who has the rank and dignity of a
judge of the Court of Session.
Criminal Courts in England and Wales
The criminal courts in England and Wales include:
Petty Sessional or Magistrates’ Courts
Magistrates’ courts are courts of summary jurisdiction where persons accused
of all kinds of minor offences and a large number of the less serious indictable
offences may be tried without a jury. These courts are also used for committal
proceedings, i.e. the public conduct, by magistrates, of preliminary inquiries into
indictable offences to determine whether or not an accused person should be
committed for trial in a higher court. Over 97 per cent of all persons convicted are
convicted at magistrates’ courts.
The majority of magistrates’ courts consist of not fewer than two and not more
than seven unpaid ‘lay’ magistrates or justices of the peace, who are appointed, in
GOVERNMENT AND ADMINISTRATION
8l
each county and for each borough which has its own commission of the peace, by
the Lord Chancellor, who is advised as to a county by the Lord Lieutenant1 with
the assistance of an advisory committee, and as to boroughs by separate advisory
committees. There are also a few persons who are authorised by statute to act as
justices, by virtue of holding some other public office, e.g., mayors of county and
non-county boroughs and chairmen of county councils.
In central London, most of the courts consist of a paid metropolitan magistrate
sitting alone; some of the larger towns also have stipendiary (paid) magistrates.
Juvenile Courts in England and Wales are specially constituted magistrates’
courts which deal with young people under 17 years of age who are charged with
any offence except homicide, or are brought before the courts as being in need of
care or protection or beyond control, or as persistent truants. Juvenile courts also
deal with most applications for the adoption of children.
Outside the London magistrates’ courts area, the justices for each petty sessional
division elect from their number a panel of justices specially qualified to deal with
juvenile cases. The panel for the London area is appointed by the Home Secretary.
A juvenile court consists of not more than three justices drawn from the panel
and must, except in special circumstances, include a man and a woman. A juvenile
court must sit either in a different room or building from that in which other courts
are sitting, or on a different day. Only persons within certain specified categories are
admitted and only limited publicity is allowed.
Domestic Proceedings are also tried by not more than three justices, of whom one
should be a man and one a woman. The hearing of domestic proceedings is
separated from other business and, as in juvenile courts, the public is excluded.
Courts of Quarter Sessions
There are two different kinds of quarter sessions—county sessions and borough
sessions; both are normally held four times a year, although, when necessary,
additional sittings may be held.
Each of the 63 courts of county quarter sessions is presided over by a legally
qualified chairman or deputy chairman, who may or may not draw a salary, sitting
with a number of the magistrates of the county. In London, Lancashire and
Middlesex, where the courts have continuous sittings, the chairman and deputy
chairman normally preside alone. In the 93 boroughs, which hold separate quarter
sessions, most of the courts, which do not sit continuously, are presided over by a
Recorder (usually a part-time judicial officer), who is a salaried barrister, as sole
judge. Trial by jury applies at both borough and county sessions.
The jurisdiction of quarter sessions covers all but the most serious indictable
offences, but the courts are debarred from trying any crime that carries the death
sentence or (subject to certain exceptions) imprisonment for life.
Assizes
Courts of assize are branches of the High Court of Justice. They are held in the
county towns and in certain big cities three times a year, a Queen’s Bench judge
or a Commissioner of Assize (who may be a barrister commissioned to act as a
judge) presiding. The assize judges work on circuits covering England and Wales,
and travel from one county town to another in the course of their duties. They can
try any indictable offence committed in the county.
1 See footnote p. 42.
g2 BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
At the winter and summer assizes, civil business as well as criminal may be
taken, but except in a few large towns the autumn assize is confined to criminal
cases.
Crown Courts
Crown courts are new courts established at Liverpool and Manchester by the
Criminal Justice Administration Act, 1956, to act as courts of assize in and for the
West Derby Division of Lancashire and the Salford Division of Lancashire. They
also act as courts of quarter sessions for the cities of Liverpool and Manchester.
The Crown courts are presided over by the Recorders of Liverpool and Man¬
chester, who are whole-time judicial officers.
The Central Criminal Court
The Central Criminal Court at the Old Bailey acts as the court of assize for the
criminal business of London, Middlesex and parts of the home counties. The
judges include: a judge chosen, in rotation, from the Queen’s Bench Division for
each monthly session of the court; the Recorder of London; the Common Serjeant;
and two additional judges of the Mayor’s and City of London Court.
Criminal Appeals
Appeals may be made direct from the magistrates’ court to the High Court on a
point of law; but the more usual kind of appeal is the appeal of a convicted person
against his conviction or his sentence. Appeals of this kind from a magistrates
court are heard in the counties by the Appeal Committee of Quarter Sessions,
consisting of between three and twelve magistrates, and in the boroughs by the
Recorder; in neither case is a jury required.
Appeals against convictions or sentences by quarter sessions, assizes or Crown
courts go to the Court of Criminal Appeal Appeals on questions of law may be
brought as of right, but on other grounds only by leave.
The Court of Criminal Appeal consists of the Lord Chief Justice and a number
of Queen’s Bench judges; three in session is the usual number.
A further appeal from the Court of Criminal Appeal to the House of Lords on a
point of law can be brought if the Attorney-General grants a certificate affirming
that the appeal is of ‘exceptional public importance and that it is desirable in the
public interest that a further appeal should be brought’. Appeals of this kind are
very rare.
Criminal Courts in Scotland
Criminal prosecutions in Scotland are mainly dealt with in the sheriff court
sitting under summary procedure, i.e. the sheriff without a jury. Minor offences
are tried under summary procedure in police courts in burghs and in justice of the
peace courts in counties. Any summary court may sit as a juvenile court when
hearing charges involving only persons under 17 years of age and, in some areas,
there are specially constituted juvenile courts. The sheriff court also sits under
solemn procedure, i.e. the sheriff with a jury, to hear the more serious cases
prosecuted on indictment. _
The most serious cases are taken under solemn procedure in the High Court of
Justiciary, which is the supreme criminal court of first instance. It consists of the
Lord Justice General (who is also the Lord President of the Court of Session),
the Lord Justice Clerk and thirteen Lords Commissioner of Justiciary who are also
judges of the Court of Session. The seat of the court is in Edinburgh, but the
judges go on circuit to preside at trials in other towns. The High Court of Justiciary
GOVERNMENT AND ADMINISTRATION
83
is also the appeal court from the summary courts and, sitting as a court of criminal
appeal, hears appeals in indictment cases. Appeals are heard by three or more
judges; there is no further appeal to the House of Lords.
Courts in Northern Ireland
Both civil and criminal courts in Northern Ireland are similar to those in England
and Wales with some minor modifications to suit a smaller community. The main
difference is that all petty sessional cases are dealt with by resident magistrates, who
correspond to the stipendiary magistrates of England and Wales. The inferior
courts, that is to say the courts where the less serious cases are tried, are adminis¬
tered by the Parliament of Northern Ireland; the administration of the superior
courts has been reserved to the Parliament of the United Kingdom.
Coroners’ Courts
Where a person appears to have died a violent or unnatural death, or a sudden
death of which the cause is unknown, or in certain other circumstances, the death
must be reported to a coroner (who may be a barrister, a solicitor, or a medical
practitioner of not less than five years’ standing, appointed by a county or a county
borough council), within whose jurisdiction the body is lying. When a death is
reported to a coroner, he inquires how, when, and where the deceased died. A
coroner may hold an inquest in court for this purpose, and he must hold an inquest
if he has reasonable cause to believe that the deceased has died a violent or unnatural
death or has died in prison or in circumstances for which an Act of Parliament
provides that an inquest must be held. A jury must be summoned if there is reason
to suspect that the deceased came by his death by murder, manslaughter, or
infanticide, or from an accident arising out of the use of a vehicle on the public
highway, or in certain other special circumstances. If the jury returns a verdict of
murder, manslaughter or infanticide by a particular person, the coroner commits
that person for trial at assizes. If the death is merely a sudden death of which the
cause is unknown, the coroner need not hold an inquest but may order a post¬
mortem examination to ascertain the cause of death.
The discovery of gold or silver objects hidden in the soil or in buildings must be
reported to a coroner, if the original owner cannot be traced. The coroner then
holds an inquest with a jury to inquire whether the objects are ‘treasure trove’ and
who was the finder thereof. If it is decided that the objects are treasure trove, then,
though the law is that treasure trove vests in the Crown, the declared finder will
either receive them back or be paid their full market value.
In Scotland, the office of coroner does not exist. The Procurator Fiscal inquires
privately into all sudden and suspicious deaths in his district and may report the
results of his inquiries to the Crown Agent in order that Crown Counsel may
consider what proceedings, if any, are required.
Ecclesiastical Courts
The established Church of England has its own ecclesiastical courts, which
constitute a graduated hierarchy. They include the Court of the Archdeacon, the
Consistory Court of the bishop of each diocese and the provincial courts of the
archbishops of Canterbury and of York.
The ecclesiastical courts, which are still courts in the full sense of the word, have
jurisdiction only in matters of purely ecclesiastical concern, such as questions of
doctrine and ritual, ordination, consecration, and the celebration of divine service.1

Administrative Tribunals
A number of administrative tribunals exist in various parts of the United King¬
dom for the exercise of special judicial functions; broadly speaking they fall into
three groups:
(1) those which deal with a class of dispute in which a Government Depart¬
ment or public authority is interested, e.g., Local Valuation Courts (rating),
General and Special Commissioners of Inland Revenue (income tax), and
Pensions Appeal Tribunals;
(2) those which deal with a class of dispute where specialised knowledge or
experience on the part of the tribunal is required, e.g., the Lands Tribunal
(assessment of values of interest in land), and Rent Tribunals (assessment
of fair rents for furnished premises);
(3) those which enforce professional discipline, e.g., the General Medical
Council (doctors), and the Disciplinary Committee of the Law Society
(solicitors).
Appeals from certain of these tribunals lie to the appropriate minister (if there is
one) or, on a point of law, to the superior courts of England and Wales, Scotland
or Northern Ireland, as the case may be.
A number of recommendations, based on the need for ensuring that adminis¬
trative tribunals are conducted in accordance with the same principles of fairness,
openness and impartiality as characterise the ordinary courts of law, were made by
the Committee on Administrative Tribunals and Enquiries, appointed by the
Government in 1957. The majority of these recommendations were incorporated
into the Tribunals and Inquiries Act, 1958, which provides for the establishment of
an advisory Council on Tribunals to exercise general supervision1 and to report on
particular matters. The members of the Council are appointed jointly by the Lord
Chancellor and the Secretary of State for Scotland; matters peculiar to Scotland
are dealt with by the Scottish Committee of the Council.
Military Courts
The jurisdiction of military courts or courts-martial is exclusively over persons
subject to military law, and appeals lie to the Courts-Martial Appeal Court, set up
by the Courts-Martial (Appeals) Act, 1951. The powers of courts-martial are
limited to those conferred on them by statute, and if these powers are exceeded,
the person injured has his remedy in the High Court.
THE JUDICIARY
The judiciary of the United Kingdom is independent. That is to say, it is free
to administer the law under the protection of the law without fear or favour. All
judges, from those of the House of Lords and the superior courts to the lay
magistrates or justices of the peace, must not only be, but must appear to be, com¬
pletely impartial, for it is of fundamental importance that ‘justice should not only
be done, but should manifestly and undoubtedly be seen to be done •
The courts of the United Kingdom are the Queen’s courts in that all jurisdic¬
tion of the courts is either indirectly or immediately derived from the Crown , but
since the end of the seventeenth century it has been established that the executive
cannot disturb or delay the course of common justice, attempt to force the judges
1 Excluding supervision of the professional disciplinary tribunals, with which the
ordinary public are not concerned.
GOVERNMENT AND ADMINISTRATION 85
to act otherwise than impartially, or use the prerogative powers of the Crown to
create courts to administer any system of law other than common law.
The independence of the judiciary vis-'a-vis the legislature is likewise strictly
observed. Originally laid down by the Act of Settlement, 1701, the law governing
the matter was re-enacted in the Supreme Court of Judicature (Consolidation) Act,
1925, which provides that all judges of the High Court and the Court of Appeal,
with the exception of the Lord Chancellor (who is a member of the Cabinet), shall
hold their offices during good behaviour, subject to a power of removal by the
Sovereign on an address presented by both Houses of Parliament. During the
centuries that have passed since 1701, only one such address has been moved
(against a judge convicted of misappropriation of funds, in 1830); and it can be
stated with confidence that Parliament would never use this means to attempt to
interfere with judicial independence. Similarly, although no court in the United
Kingdom would ever question the validity of an Act of Parliament which had been
duly passed by both Houses of Parliament and legally promulgated and published
by the proper authority, it might, through its interpretation of the statute, come to
a decision contrary to the policy of the Government which introduced the Act. In
such a case, it would be open to the Government to persuade Parliament to clarify
or amend the statute, or to pass a new Act. It would not be open to it to penalise
the judge or to try to influence the court in any other way.
Administration of the Judicial System
There is no Minister of Justice in the United Kingdom. The central responsi¬
bility for the administration of the judicial system in England and Wales lies partly
with the Lord Chancellor and partly with the Home Secretary. The Prime Minister
is also concerned in that he is responsible for recommending to the Crown the
appointment of the Lords Justices of Appeal and that of the Lords of Appeal in
Ordinary.
Apart from the appointment of the Lords Justices of Appeal, Crown appoint¬
ments to the High Court bench are made on the recommendation of the Lord
Chancellor, who appoints justices of the peace and is also responsible for recom¬
mending to the Crown the appointment of county court judges (except in Lan¬
cashire where they are nominated by the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster),
Recorders of boroughs and metropolitan and stipendiary magistrates. The admini¬
strative business of the Supreme Court of Judicature and the appointment of court
officials is partly in the hands of the Lord Chancellor and partly in the hands of
the appropriate judges. The Lord Chancellor is a member of the Rule Committee
which makes the rules of the Supreme Court; he also appoints the County Court
Rule Committee and has power to alter or to disallow the rules made by it. In
addition, responsibility for initiating proposals for legal reform, save in the field
of criminal law, lies with the Lord Chancellor, who is advised in this matter by
the Law Reform Committee and the Private International Law Committee, both
established in 1952.
The Home Secretary is responsible for approving appointments of clerks to
justices throughout England and Wales, and for the general administration of
magistrates’ courts, except in relation to their judicial functions in which they can
be controlled only by the Queen’s Bench Division of the High Court. The local
responsibility for the administration of magistrates’ courts lies with the magistrates’
courts committees, of which there is one for each county and county borough.
In Scotland, the Prime Minister makes recommendations for the appointment of
the Lord President and Lord Justice General and also of the Lord Justice Clerk.
Power of submission for appointment of all other judges lies with the Secretary
g6 BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
of State for Scotland on the nomination of the Lord Advocate (see also p. 61). The
High Court of Justiciary and the Court of Session are administered by the Clerk of
the Justiciary and his staff and the Principal Clerk of Session and his staff respec¬
tively. Powers of appointment and removal of justices of the peace, formerly held by
the Lord Chancellor, were transferred in 1955 to the Secretary of State for Scotland,
who is also responsible for the staffing and general organisation of the sheriff courts.
THE LEGAL PROFESSION
The legal profession of England and Wales is strictly divided into two classes of
lawyers—barristers and solicitors. The distinction, which is due mainly to historical
causes, is found also in Northern Ireland, Scotland and certain other parts of the
Commonwealth.
No hard and fast line can be drawn between the work of the solicitor and the
work of the barrister, since there are many barristers who do little advocacy, and
there are solicitors who do little else, and who have made considerable reputations
for themselves in the courts in which they are permitted to appear. In general
however, it may be said that solicitors are professional men who undertake legal
business for lay clients; while barristers advise on legal problems submitted
through solicitors, and conduct legal proceedings in the higher courts.
A barrister is required to have reached an accepted educational standard, to have
passed the legal examinations conducted by the Council of Legal Education and to
have become a member of one of the four Inns of Court—Gray’s Inn, Lincoln s
Inn, the Middle Temple and the Inner Temple. A barrister with a substantial
junior practice may apply to the Lord Chancellor for a patent appointing him
Queen’s Counsel—a proceeding that is known as ‘taking silk’. The highest appoint¬
ments in the legal profession, including those of Attorney-General, Solicitor-
General, and other Law Officers of the Crown,1 are usually, though not necessarily,
made from among barristers who have become Queen’s Counsel. The professional
conduct of a barrister is subject to the scrutiny of the General Council of the Bar;
but disciplinary powers are vested exclusively in the Benchers of the Inns of Court.
A prospective solicitor must be considered suitable by the appropriate Com¬
mittee of the Law Society, the professional organisation of solicitors, and he must
enter into ‘Articles of Clerkship’ with a practising solicitor of not less than five
years’ standing before he can begin his professional career. The term of articles
lasts for three or five years, depending upon the educational qualifications of the
student. An articled clerk must pass the necessary examinations held by the Law
Society and, unless he has been a barrister or is a law graduate of a university,
he is generally required to attend a course of studies at a recognised law school.
Once a solicitor is qualified, he may also become a member of the Law Society.
In Scotland, the conditions for admission as, and the standing of, advocates and
solicitors are much the same as those applying in the case of barristers and solicitors
in England and Wales.
LEGAL AID
Schemes for free legal assistance to persons of slender means and resources have
existed for centuries in some courts, to a limited extent in England and Wales and
to a somewhat greater extent in Scotland. The schemes were revised in 1949 when
the Legal Aid and Advice Act and the Legal Aid and Solicitors (Scotland) Act
1 A brief account of the functions of the Law Officers of the Crown in England and
Wales is given on p. 54.
GOVERNMENT AND ADMINISTRATION
87
received Royal Assent. These Acts were introduced to improve and extend the
existing arrangements in civil proceedings so that no one would be financially unable
to prosecute a just and reasonable claim or to defend a legal right, and to make the
facilities already available in criminal proceedings more easily accessible to those
who needed them. The Acts also provided that solicitors and barristers acting for
persons receiving legal aid should no longer be required to act gratuitously in civil
cases, but should be remunerated for their services from public funds.
The Acts, and in particular the provisions relating to free legal advice, as distinct
from assistance in the conduct of litigation, are not yet fully in operation. A legal
advice scheme, published by the Law Society in July 1958, is being considered by
the Government.
Legal Aid in Civil Cases
Legal aid in civil cases is now available to persons whose income, computed in
accordance with rules applied by the National Assistance Board, does not exceed
£420 a year, and whose capital, as so computed, does not, save in exceptional
circumstances, exceed £500. Where an assisted person can afford to make a con¬
tribution to the costs of his case, he is required, as a condition of receiving legal
aid, to pay an amount which is settled with due regard to his financial resources.
In England and Wales, legal aid in civil cases is already available in connection
with proceedings in the High Court, in the Court of Appeal, in county courts and
in certain local courts of similar standing. Eventually the scheme will cover repre¬
sentation in courts of all types, from magistrates’ courts up to the House of Lords.
The scheme is operated through the Law Society under the general guidance of
the Lord Chancellor. The cost is met from a Legal Aid Fund, drawn from three
sources: contributions from assisted persons; costs recovered from opposite parties
in litigation; and a grant from the Exchequer.
For the purposes of the scheme, England and Wales are divided into twelve areas.
In each area a committee of solicitors and barristers, known as an area committee,
is responsible for the administration of the scheme. These committees are re¬
sponsible for setting up legal aid centres to which anyone seeking legal aid may
apply. Committees hear the facts, and if they consider that there is a privia facie
case they give it their support. The person who wishes to bring the action is then
allowed to select from a panel a solicitor and, if necessary, a barrister, to conduct
his case. Certain types of action, including breach of promise to marry, and libel
and slander, are excluded from the scheme.
In Scotland, the legal aid scheme is administered by the Law Society of Scotland
through a supervisory Central Committee, a Supreme Court Committee and
twenty-one local committees. Legal aid is at present available for civil proceedings
in the Court of Session and the sheriff courts. An applicant for legal aid in Scotland
is required to show a ‘probable cause’ and produce in support of his application a
statement corroborated according to the requirements of Scottish law.
Legal Aid in Criminal Courts
Free legal aid is already available in the criminal courts in England and Wales
under the Poor Prisoners’ Defence Act, 1930, and, in case of Appeal, under the
Criminal Appeal Act, 1907, and the Summary Jurisdiction (Appeals) Act, 1933.
The Legal Aid and Advice Act, 1949, makes certain procedural changes in the
system and, when fully implemented, will transfer financial responsibility for pay¬
ing for free legal aid from local to central funds. It also lays down the principle of
allowing fair remuneration to solicitors and barristers according to the work actually
and reasonably done.
G
88
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Under the Costs in Criminal Cases Act, 1952, the courts also have power, in the
case of an indictable offence, to order the reasonable costs of the defence to be paid
out of local funds when the accused has been discharged by the magistrates’ court
or acquitted. A magistrates’ court has power under the Act, if it dismisses an
information on summary trial, to order such costs as it considers just and reasonable
to be paid to the accused by the prosecutor.
Pending the full implementation of the Legal Aid and Solicitors (Scotland) Act,
legal aid in criminal cases is afforded to poor persons in Scotland under the Poor’s
Roll system, which is administered on a voluntary basis by the legal profession
with the. help of a grant from Government funds.
In Northern Ireland, free legal aid in criminal cases is afforded to poor persons
under the Criminal Justice (Northern Ireland) Act, 1945- The cost of providing
free legal aid is met out of public funds.
TREATMENT OF OFFENDERS
The chief aims of the penal system of the United Kingdom are deterrence and
reformation; its effectiveness depends on its total impact fear of detection, public
trial and conviction and the possibility of punishment—and not solely upon the
treatment of the offender, which today is based increasingly on the recognition
that the community has a responsibility not simply to punish or reject the law¬
breaker but to bring him back to his proper place in society.
Penalties
Except in relation to murder and certain rare offences for which there is a fixed
penalty, the court has discretion to select the penalty, within maxima prescribed
by law, which it considers most suitable in the light of the circumstances of the
offence and the offender. In general, the courts have power to impose either
imprisonment or a fine for serious offences, and, in certain cases, both; while most
minor offences are punishable by a fine only, with the alternative of imprisonment
if the fine is not paid. Moreover, it is at the discretion of the court, instead of
sentencing an offender, to discharge him absolutely, to place him on piobation, or,
in England and Wales only, to discharge him conditionally (i.e. subject to the
condition that he commits no offence during a specified period not exceeding
twelve months). There are special provisions governing the treatment of young
offenders; and the Criminal Justice Act, 1948, and the Criminal Justice (Scotland)
Act, 1949, provide that courts shall not sentence a person under 21 years of age
to imprisonment unless they consider that no other method of dealing with him
is appropriate.
Two special types of treatment—corrective training and preventive detention
have been devised to deal with the persistent offender. A sentence of corrective
training of not less than two nor more than four years (seven years in Northern
Ireland) may be imposed on offenders of 21 years of age or over if they are con¬
victed of an offence punishable with imprisonment for a term of two years or more
and have been convicted of such an offence on at least two previous occasions since
attaining the age of 17. Sentences of preventive detention (primarily for the pro¬
tection of the public) may be imposed on persons of not less than 30 years of age,
who are found guilty of offences punishable with imprisonment for a term of two
years or more and have been convicted of such offences on at least three previous
occasions since attaining the age of i7) and have been sentenced to borstal training,
imprisonment or corrective training on at least two of these occasions. A sentence
GOVERNMENT AND ADMINISTRATION 89
of preventive detention runs for not less than five years (three in Northern Ireland)
or more than 14 years, as the court decides.
Under the Homicide Act, 1957, the death penalty for murder is confined to
those forms of murder (known as ‘capital murder’) which strike most directly at
the maintenance of law and order and the public peace, i.e. any murder done in
the course of furtherance of theft, any murder by shooting or by causing an
explosion, any murder committed to escape lawful arrest or to effect or assist
escape or rescue from legal custody, any murder of a police officer (or person
assisting him) acting in the execution of his duty, 01 any murder by a prisoner of
a prison officer (or person assisting him) acting in the execution of his duty. The
penalty for murder not in capital categories is imprisonment for life, except that
the death penalty continues to apply where a person who is convicted of murder
has previously been convicted of another murder committed in Great Britain on
a different occasion. Persons under the age of 18 years at the time that the crime
was committed are not sentenced to death or to life imprisonment, but ‘to be
detained during Her Majesty’s pleasure’. If the defence is able to prove that a
person accused of murder was suffering from such abnormality of mind as sub¬
stantially impaired his mental responsibility for the killing, he is liable to be
convicted only of manslaughter.
It is the long-established practice for the Home Secretary or the Secretary of
State for Scotland to review every capital case before the law is allowed to take
its course and to consider whether there are grounds for advising the Crown to
exercise the Prerogative of Mercy. Where a reprieve is recommended, the sentence
of death is commuted to one of imprisonment for life. A person subject to a
sentence of life imprisonment is liable to be detained for the rest of his life, but
the Home Secretary may, if he thinks fit, release him on licence at any time. In
recent years, the average period served by persons whose death sentences have
been commuted has been about nine years, but the period varies according to the
circumstances of the particular case and the question of whether the prisoner’s
discharge would involve risk to the public.
The Homicide Act does not apply to Northern Ireland, but the exercise of the
Prerogative of Mercy is considered in all capital cases, the Governor acting for the
Crown in this matter on the advice of the Cabinet.
Administrative Authorities
In England and Wales, general responsibility for all institutions for the treatment
of offenders is vested in the Home Secretary. His statutory powers and duties in this
connection include the making of rules for the governance of such institutions, the
recommendations of persons for appointment by the Crown as Prison Commis¬
sioners, and the appointment of Boards of Visitors.
In the discharge of his duties relating to the treatment of offenders, the Home
Secretary is advised by an Advisory Council on the Treatment of Offenders, which
also acts as the National Working Group for the Economic and Social Council of
the United Nations, and as the National Committee of the International Penal and
Penitentiary Commission.
Responsibility to the Home Secretary for the administration of prisons, borstal
institutions and detention centres in England and Wales lies with the Prison
Commission, assisted by inspectors and by a professional and technical staff. The
Prison Commission consists of not more than five commissioners, who are appointed
by the Crown, including the chairman, who is appointed to that office by the Home
Secretary. There are also a number of assistant commissioners who are inspectors
under the Prison Acts.
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
The general oversight of penal institutions is the responsibility of either Visiting
Committees appointed by the justices for those prisons to which convicted persons
are committed direct from their courts, or Boards of Visitors appointed by the
Home Secretary for the other prisons and institutions. The main functions of
the committees and boards are: to act as the superior disciplinary authority of the
prison or institution; to constitute an independent judicial body to which any
prisoner or inmate may make a complaint or request; and to report direct to the
Home Secretary, both by formal annual report and as occasion may require, on
every aspect of the administration of the prison. In borstal institutions and preven¬
tive detention prisons, the boards also advise the Prison Commissioners on the
release of the inmates on licence.
The prison systems of Scotland and Northern Ireland are the responsibility of
the Secretary of State for Scotland and of the Minister for Home Affairs respec¬
tively, and are administered by the Home Departments in Edinburgh and in Belfast.
Prisons
Prisons in England and Wales are of the following types: local prisons of the
ordinary type, which receive all classes of prisoners direct from the courts; local
prisons of a special type, which may be open or walled, for short-sentence prisoners,
chiefly first offenders; regional training prisons, some of which are open, for first
offenders and trainable prisoners of other categories, including those sentenced to
corrective training; and central prisons for habitual law-breakers, preventive deten¬
tion prisoners and long-term prisoners of the ‘Star’ class1—one for the latter class is
an open prison. A new type of prison, which will provide facilities for the psycho¬
therapeutic observation and treatment of up to 300 prisoners, is under construction
and is expected to be ready for occupation by 1962. . . . . ,
In Northern Ireland, with its smaller population, the necessity for several kinds
of prison for the separation of various classes of prisoners does not arise to the
same extent as in England and Wales. The Scottish system of classification of
prisoners is broadly the same as that of England and Wales; but each prison in
Scotland accommodates more than one classification group.
Full-time prison officers of all ranks, except chaplains, are permanent cm
servants. In 1958, prison staff of all grades in England and Wales numbered about
8 000. Some 8 per cent of this number were women. In Scotland, in June 1958,
the prison staff numbered 766, including 71 women, and in Northern Ireland the
prison staff of-185 included 21 women.
Classification of Prisoners
Every person committed to prison is first received in the local prison serving the
court from which he is committed. Subsequently, he may either serve his whole
sentence at the local prison or he may be sent to another institution, depending on
his age, the length and nature of his sentence, and his personal history and character.
The object of classification is first to ensure the separation of the sexes, of young
nersons from adults, of untried prisoners from convicted prisoners and of civil
convicted prisoners,
appropriate to their
benefit therefrom.
1 ‘Star’ class prisoners are those who have not previously been convicted of serious
crime and are not of habitually criminal or depraved habits.
GOVERNMENT AND ADMINISTRATION
91
Training
The main elements of prison training (including corrective training) have been
defined as (1) the provision of work which will, so far as is practicable, help to fit
prisoners to earn their living after release, with technical training in skilled trades
for suitable persons, (2) the provision of suitable educational facilities, and (3) the
provision of every opportunity for the development of a sense of personal responsi¬
bility, including (for suitable persons) training in open conditions.
Full training can be given only in prisons set aside for the purpose, which provide
vocational training courses, based on a Ministry of Labour and National Service
syllabus, at which prisoners may receive a theoretical and practical training in a
number of skilled trades. The principles on which training is based, however, hold
good for all prisons and are applied as far as individual conditions permit.
Employment
Prison industries are organised under the control of a Director of Industries, who
has a head office staff of technical officers and supervisors, including a supervisor
of farms and gardens, and industrial managers at the prisons.
Except in local prisons, where the hours are shorter, prisoners in England and
Wales spend at present about 40 hours a week in the workshops or in other employ¬
ment such as building, farm work, domestic work and gardening, in company with
their fellow prisoners, and conversation is allowed. In most of the Scottish and
Northern Ireland prisons, prisoners are also employed for nearly 40 hours a week.
All prisoners are entitled to earn a limited amount from the first day of their
sentence; in England, Wales, and Scotland, these amounts may be increased for
satisfactory output after a specified lapse of time. In Northern Ireland, there is a
progressive system of earnings, which are not related to output or to work done.
Education
Educational schemes are provided in prisons in England, Wales, and Scotland
by the local education authorities with the advice of the Government Departments
responsible for education in their respective countries, and in Northern Ireland by
the Ministry of Home Affairs. The local authorities are reimbursed for the full cost
of their services, and the work in England and Wales is under the organisational
control of the Assistant Commissioner for Education in the Prison Commission.
Evening Institutes have been established; and a wide range of correspondence
courses is made available for those who have a serious desire to improve their
education and qualifications.
Educational schemes are supplemented by periodical lectures, film displays,
concerts, and dramatic performances. Prisoners may also use the prison library,
which is most cases is now stocked by the county, city or borough library committee.
Religion and Welfare
A chaplain of the Church of England (in Scotland of the Church of Scotland and
in Northern Ireland, of the Church of Ireland, and Presbyterian Church) and a
Roman Catholic priest are appointed to every prison. Ministers of the Methodist
Church and of other denominations are either appointed or specially called in as
required. The chaplain is generally responsible for welfare in the prison to which
he is appointed. Regular services are held, and chaplains and other ministers may
visit prisoners in their cells.
Prisoners may be visited by their relatives and friends at specified intervals and,
in England and Wales, by recognised prison visitors asked to serve in this field by
Q2 BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
the Prison Commissioners. The voluntary work of these visitors is co-ordinated
and guided by the National Association of Prison Visitors.
Privileges and Discipline
On reception under sentence, all prisoners, except those sentenced to imprison¬
ment for life, are credited with remission of one-third of their sentence (one-fourth
in Northern Ireland in respect of sentences of less than two years), provided that
this does not reduce their sentence below 31 days. The Home Secretary may at
any time, if he thinks fit, release on licence anyone sentenced to life imprisonment.
A prisoner sentenced to corrective training becomes eligible for release on licence
after serving two-thirds of his sentence. A prisoner sentenced to preventive deten¬
tion becomes eligible for release on licence after serving two-thirds or five-sixths
of his sentence (in Northern Ireland, two years, or one-half of his sentence, which¬
ever is greater) according to an assessment of his character, conduct and prospects,
which is made after he has served a substantial part of his sentence. In addition,
at successive stages of a prisoner’s sentence, he becomes entitled to additional
privileges; for example, he is allowed to have meals and recreation with his fellow
prisoners and to have some of his personal belongings in his cell.
Home leave (allowing five clear days at home) may be granted to prisoners
serving sentences of two or more years in regional training prisons. The purpose
of the scheme (introduced in 1951) is to contribute to the restoration of the
prisoner’s self-confidence by placing trust in him under conditions of freedom,
and to give him an opportunity, before his final release, to make contacts with
potential employers, to deal with domestic matters, and to renew home ties. Leave
is granted not earlier than four and not later than two months before the date of
rd.0£iS0
For breaches of discipline in prison, the Governor or the Visiting Committee or
the Board of Visitors have power to order forfeiture of remission (or postponement
of the date of release) and forfeiture of privileges.
After-Care of Prisoners
Prisoners from local prisons are assisted on discharge by Discharged Prisoners
Aid Societies, which are local and voluntary bodies supported partly by private
and partly by public funds. The work of the local societies is co-ordinated by the
National Association of Discharged Prisoners’ Aid Societies for England and Wales
and for Scotland, both of which depend on a grant from public funds for their
administrative expenses. For persons discharged from other prisons and from
borstals (who are, in general, subject to statutory supervision) after-care in England
and Wales is in the hands of the Central After-Care Association, a voluntary body
financed from public funds and governed by a council appointed by the Home
Secretary, which includes in its membership representatives of the Ministry of
Labour and National Service, of the National Assistance Board and of the probation
service. The Secretary of State for Scotland appoints an After-Care Council to
carry out similar duties in Scotland.
In England and Wales, the Association works through local associates, usually
probation officers, and, in Scotland, the Council works through voluntary guardians.
The officers of the local organisations make all arrangements for the reception of the
prisoner after his discharge, and will advise, assist and befriend him for as long as is
necessary or required by statute.
In Northern Ireland, the after-care of all prisoners is carried out by the
Discharged Prisoners’ Aid Societies with the help of probation officers.

Treatment of Young Offenders
Under the English and Scottish legal systems, a child under the age of eight
cannot be charged with an offence. A child aged eight but under fourteen years
old charged with an offence other than homicide must be dealt with in a juvenile
court unless charged jointly with an adult.
In England and Wales, a young person between fourteen and seventeen years
of age charged with an indictable offence may be dealt with summarily (as is usually
the case) or committed for trial by jury. In certain cases young persons may claim
to be tried by jury, though this right is rarely exercised. In Scotland and Northern
Ireland, all young persons up to the age of 17 years of age charged with offences
must be dealt with in juvenile courts, unless they have been charged in conjunction
with adult offenders.
The following methods of treatment are available in law for dealing with children
and young persons who have been found guilty of committing an offence: absolute
discharge; conditional discharge (in England and Wales only); fines (imposed upon
the offender or, in certain circumstances, upon his parents); probation; committal
to the care of a fit person (normally the appropriate local authority) until the age
of 18; or a period of detention in one of the different types of institution wdiich
are available when institutional treatment is considered necessary.
Remand Homes
In England, Wales and Scotland, remand homes are provided by local authorities
for the safe custody of boys and girls under the age of 17 before their appearance in
court, or between court appearances (while inquiries are made as to the best method
of treatment for them), while they are awaiting vacancies in approved schools, or
for a short period (up to a month) of punitive detention. Facilities for observation
are provided in remand homes, and valuable reports can thus be made to guide
those responsible for the future of young offenders.
In Northern Ireland, the responsibility for providing or arranging for the pro¬
vision of remand homes rests with the Minister of Home Affairs.
Approved Schools
Approved schools are residential schools for the education and training of young
offenders and children committed to them by the courts as in need of care or
protection. These schools may be provided by local authorities, by voluntary
organisations concerned with the welfare of children on a national scale, or by local
committees formed by people interested in such work. In England and Wales, the
schools must be approved by the Home Secretary; in Scotland, by the Secretary of
State for Scotland; and in Northern Ireland, by the Minister of Home Affairs.
The number of approved schools in England and Wales in 1958 was 118. There are
23 approved schools in Scotland, and five (known as training schools) in Northern
Ireland.
The schools are for boys only or for girls only. They are classified according to
the ages of the children on admission, and include separate schools for Roman
Catholic children. The assignment of a child to a school in the appropriate age
group is determined by such considerations as the location of the school in relation
to the child’s home, the type of training provided, and the probable reaction of a
child to the individual personalities of the staff.
In general, the education given in approved schools follows the lines of that given
in ordinary schools, with vocational training for older boys and girls: the emphasis
is on character building, and close attention is given to after-care.
g4 BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
The period during which a child or young person may be detained in an approved
school is determined by law. In Great Britain it is three years, except for children
under the age of 12 years and 4 months at the time of committal, who may be kept
until the age of 15 years and 4 months, and those over the age of 16 on committal,
who can be detained only up to the age of 19, or 19! if they have been found guilty
of absconding or of serious misconduct in an approved school. Managers of all
approved schools are under an obligation to review the progress of each child in
their school towards the end of the first year of detention and thereafter at least
quarterly, with a view to granting a release on licence as soon as the situation
warrants it. . .
Statutory responsibility for after-care rests on the school managers. A boy or girl
on release remains under the care of the managers during the periods of licence and
supervision. The period of licence lasts until the expiry of the time for which the
boy or girl might have been legally detained in the school. The period of super¬
vision lasts for three years more, or until the boy or girl reaches the age of 21
whichever is the shorter period. Managers are assisted in their after-care work by
welfare officers and social service organisations.
Attendance Centres
Thirty-seven attendance centres have been established in England and Wales to
deal with boys between the ages of 12 and 17 found guilty of offences for which an
adult can be sentenced to imprisonment. This form of treatment, started in 1950,
is designed to teach young offenders a respect for the law and to give them some
instruction in the proper use of leisure. Boys ordered to attend must do so during
their spare time on Saturday mornings or afternoons; they may be required to
attend for up to three hours on any one occasion and for not more than twelve
hours in all. The activities include a period of instruction in handicrafts, or a lecture
(e.g., on first aid) and a period of physical training or disciplinary tasks under
supervision. Efforts are made at the centres to induce the boys to join a youth club
or other suitable organisation.
Detention Centres
Detention centres are designed to provide a ‘short sharp shock for those who
have not yet developed a definitely anti-social attitude, but who need to be taught
that the law cannot be defied with impunity. The offender is normally sent to the
centre for three months, though in certain circumstances the courts have power to
commit for a shorter or longer term up to a maximum of six months. The regime
is designed to deprive the boy of his liberty and of all the elements of what he
thinks of as a ‘good time’, and to oblige him to live a brisk, disciplined life, main¬
taining the highest possible standards at the highest possible tempo. Each boy in
a detention centre must be alert, punctual and tidy, and emphasis is placed on the
inculcation of obedience, cleanliness and good manners. The routine provides a
normal working week of 44 hours, including one hour daily devoted to physical
training. Boys of compulsory school age receive full-time education, and classes of
further education are provided for others in the evenings. In 1958 there were four
detention centres in England and Wales—two junior centres for boys over 14 and
under 17, accommodating about 7° anc^ 6° boys respectively, and two senior
centres for boys over 17 and under 21, accommodating about 75 boys and 65 boys,
respectively.
Borstal Institutions
There are various types of borstal institution, which aim to provide suitable
conditions and training courses for different types of young offenders between the
GOVERNMENT AND ADMINISTRATION
95
ages of 16 and 21 years. For boys in England and Wales there are two borstal
allocation centres, and 15 training borstals, one correction centre and one recall
centre; and there are three training borstals and one recall centre for girls. In
Scotland, there are four borstals for boys and one for girls; and in Northern Ireland,
one for boys and one for girls. The period of the sentence is in effect four years
(three years in Scotland and Northern Ireland); it is divided between training
in a borstal institution and controlled freedom under supervision. In Scotland the
supervision period is for one year from the date of release from the institution or
until the expiration of three years from the date of sentence, whichever is the
shorter. The system of training seeks the all-round development of character and
capacities, and is based on progressive trust demanding increasing personal
decision, responsibility and self-control. There is much freedom of movement, and
many borstals are conducted in open conditions. An initial period of classification
ensures that each boy or girl is sent to the institution best suited to his or her
requirements.
Probation
The probation system is designed to secure the rehabilitation of an offender
while he remains at work or at school in the community under the supervision of
a probation officer, whose duty it is to advise, assist and befriend him. A cardinal
feature of the system is that it relies on the co-operation of the offender. Before
making a probation order, the court must explain its effects to the person concerned
and inform him that if he fails to comply with its requirements he will be liable to
be dealt with for the original offence. A probation order cannot be made without
the consent of the person concerned unless (in England, Wales, and Northern
Ireland only) he is under 14 years of age. The order usually requires the probationer
to keep in regular touch with the probation officer, to be of good behaviour and to
lead an industrious life. It may also require him to live in a specified place, or to
submit to treatment for his mental condition. A probation order is made for not
less than one year and not more then three years.
Every magistrates’ court and superior criminal court must have available the
services of probation officers of both sexes. In 1958, the total numbers were:
1,300 whole-time and 54 part-time probation officers in England and Wales,
14 whole-time and one part-time in Northern Ireland, and 120 whole-time and
34 part-time in Scotland. In London, the appointment of probation officers is the
responsibility of the Home Secretary, and in Northern Ireland of the Ministry of
Home Affairs; elsewhere it is the responsibility of probation committees appointed
by magistrates in England and Wales, and by local authorities in Scotland (except
for certain ex officio members), but all appointments are subject to confirmation
by the Home Secretary and the Secretary of State for Scotland, respectively.
Training facilities in England and Wales are provided by the Home Office on the
advice of the Probation Advisory and Training Board and are made available,
by arrangement, to Northern Ireland officers. In Scotland, training is provided
during the first year of appointment and before the officer is allowed to make
probation work his permanent career.
THE POLICE SERVICE
The police service of Great Britain is organised and controlled on a local basis
under the guidance of those Ministers of the Crown who are responsible for the
maintenance of law and order in their respective countries. In England and Wales,
the responsible Minister is the Home Secretary; in Scotland, the Secretary of State
96 BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
for Scotland. In Northern Ireland, the police force is controlled by an Inspector-
General, who is responsible to the Minister of Home Affairs.
POLICE IN GREAT BRITAIN
Police Forces
There are 126 separate, independent police forces in England and Wales, defined
according to area of responsibility as county forces; borough forces, combined
forces, which are forces whose area of responsibility extends over neighbouring
counties or boroughs; the Metropolitan Police Force, which is responsible for an
area of approximately fifteen miles radius from Charing Cross, but excluding the
City of London; and the City of London force. In Scotland, there are 33 forces,
including county forces, burgh forces and combined forces.
In England and Wales and Scotland, police forces vary considerably in size
according to the area and population which they serve. Thus, in 1958, the Metro¬
politan Police Force had a strength of approximately 16,800, while that of the
smallest force in Scotland was 15.
The strength of the regular police force in Great Britain in 1958 was approxi¬
mately 78,000, including women.
In addition to the regular police forces, there are the part-time Special
Constabulary, the police of certain public services, e.g., the British Transport
Commission Police, the Civil Aviation Constabulary, the Port of London Authority
Police and other dock and harbour forces (who, although not subject to the super¬
vision of the Home Secretary or the Secretary of State for Scotland, have duties
and powers analogous to those of ordinary constables but limited to the premises
and immediate neighbourhoods of their employers) and the police of the Service
Departments, i.e. the Admiralty Constabulary, the War Department Constabulary,
which guards War Office lands and military property, the Royal Marine Police,
who are employed chiefly in dockyards, and the Air Ministry Constabulary.
Police Authorities
In the counties of England and Wales the police authority is the Standing Joint
Committee, half of whose members are members of the county council while
the other half are justices of the peace. In the boroughs the police authority is
known as the Watch Committee and is elected by the council from its members.
The police authority of a combined force is made up of representatives of the
constituent areas as prescribed in the scheme under which they combine.
The Metropolitan Police Force is under the control of the Home Secretary. In
the City of London the Common Council is the police authority, although it usually
appoints a standing committee to deal with all police matters on its behalf.
In Scotland, the police authority for the counties is the county or joint county
council; in the large burghs it is the town council; where there are combined forces
there is a joint police committee.
It is the statutory duty of the police authorities to establish and maintain efficient
police forces for their areas. They are responsible for the appointment of the chief
officer of police in their areas, subject to the approval of the Home Secretary in
the provinces of England and Wales, to the approval of the Crown in the City of
London, and to the approval of the Secretary of State for Scotland in Scotland. In
the Metropolitan Police District the chief officer of police and his immediate
subordinates are appointed by the Crown on the recommendation of the Home
Secretary.
GOVERNMENT AND ADMINISTRATION
97
The police authorities are also responsible (with the approval of the Home
Secretary in England and Wales and the Secretary of State for Scotland in Scotland)
for the size and disposition of their forces; for paying the members of the forces
their prescribed emoluments; for providing and maintaining police premises; and
for exercising disciplinary functions in relation to the most senior officers.
Central Authority
Co-ordination and a certain measure of central control are exercised through
detailed police regulations which are issued by the Home Secretary and the Secre¬
tary of State for Scotland, who are required by the Police Act, 1919, ‘to act in
consultation one with another’ in this connection. The police regulations cover
such matters as discipline, mutual aid, pay, allowances, pensions, clothing, expenses
and conditions of service of the members of all police forces to which the Act
applies.
The Secretaries of State are advised on questions relating to the conditions of
service of the police by the Police Council for Great Britain, a negotiating body
established in 1953, which is representative on the one side of all ranks of the
police service and on the other of the police authorities. In their supervisory
responsibilities the Secretaries of State are assisted by Her Majesty’s Inspectors of
Constabulary, of whom there were five (in addition to a woman assistant inspector
for the women police) in England and Wales, and one in Scotland in 1958. Each
inspector is responsible for a certain number of forces, and satisfies himself of their
continuing efficiency by annual inspections, ad hoc visits and consultations when
particular problems arise. The inspectors report to the Secretaries of State on the
condition of the various forces, with the exception of the Metropolitan Police
Force, which is under the Home Secretary’s control and is not inspected.
Central control also derives from the fact that all police authorities receive a
Government grant equal to half their net expenditure reckoned in accordance with
the provisions of Orders made under the Miscellaneous Financial Provisions Act,
1950 (as regards England and Wales), and the Police (Scotland) Act, 1956 (as
regards Scotland). These Orders empower the Home Secretary and the Secretary
of State for Scotland to withhold the grant in whole or in part, permanently or for
such time as they may determine, if they are not satisfied that a police area is effi¬
ciently policed, that a force is properly maintained and administered, or that the
rates of pay or allowances are as prescribed or approved by them.
Police Officers
There are several different kinds of police officer in Great Britain: regular police
officers who usually serve for 25 years or more and thereafter retire on pension;
members of the first police reserve, which is composed almost entirely of police
pensioners or men with previous police experience who are prepared to give whole¬
time paid service to a particular force in an emergency, whether national or local;
members of the Special Constabulary, which consists of volunteers who perform
short periods of duty without pay in their spare time from their normal occupations.1
In general, entry to the regular police force is open to men between the ages
of 19 and 30, although an exception may be made in the case of ex-regular Navy,
Army and Air Force men of over 30 years of age. Women entrants in England
and Wales must be between the ages of 20 and 35, and in Scotland between 20 and
30 years old. The standard police ranks in Great Britain, except in the Metropolitan
1 In Scotland, the employment of special constables, other than in emergencies, is sub¬
ject to strict limitations.
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
98
Police District, are: chief constable, superintendent, inspector, sergeant and con¬
stable. The following intermediate ranks may also be adopted in areas where police
duties are particularly heavy: assistant chief constable, chief superintendent,
chief inspector and, in England and Wales only, station inspector, station sergeant
and acting sergeant. In the Metropolitan Police District the chief officer is the
Commissioner of Police of the Metropolis. He is assisted by a deputy commissioner
and four assistant commissioners. Next in rank are commanders, then deputy
commanders; thereafter (i.e. from chief superintendent downwards) the ranks are
the same as in the rest of the country. In the City of London the ranks are the
same as in the provinces except that the chief officer is called the Commissioner
of Police and the second in command is an assistant commissioner.
No member of the police service may belong to a trade union, since it is a basic
principle of the service that its members must not only be free from political bias,
but must also be seen to be free of it. The Police Act, 1919, however, laid it down
that the police should have a statutory representative organisation of their own.
There are now two such organisations to which all inspectors, sergeants and con¬
stables belong—the Police Federation in England and Wales and the Scottish
Police Federation. Any branch or committee of the federations may make representa¬
tions to the chief officer or police authority concerned, or to the appropriate
Secretary of State. Delegates from the Joint Central Committees of the two
federations sit on the Police Councils.
Police Cadets
Police cadets are recruited by most forces from boys between 15 and 18 years of
age, so that prospective constables shall have had some training and have gained
sufficient insight into police duties to make reasonably certain that they wish to
stay in the police service before they undergo constable’s training. A few forces
also recruit girl cadets.
Civil Staff
In order to release uniformed police for police duties, a number of police
authorities employ civilians to perform certain duties ancillary to police functions,
e.g., as shorthand-typists, switchboard operators, mechanics, canteen staff and
cleaners. In 1958, the civil staff employed by the police authorities in England and
Wales (outside the Metropolitan District) was 10-2 per cent of the actual strength
of the uniformed personnel.
Police Duties
Every police officer in Great Britain is an independent holder of a public office.
His powers as a constable, whether conferred by statute or by common law, are
exercised by him by virtue of his office and cannot be exercised on the responsibility
of any person but himself. Thus, unless acting in pursuance of a magistrate’s
warrant, a police officer is liable for any wrongful or mistaken action on his part,
for he is not the servant of the police authority, and in discharging his duties must
rely on his own discretion and his own knowledge of the law.
The manifold functions of a police officer as a constable range from the protection
of persons and property', road or street patrolling and traffic control to criminal
investigation (all police forces have their own criminal investigation departments)
and arresting persons committing offences or, in certain cases, under suspicion of
acting in an unlawful way. In England and Wales (although not in Scotland where
the police investigate cases and report to the prosecutor), the police are responsible
for initiating, and in most cases conducting, prosecutions, except those which must
GOVERNMENT AND ADMINISTRATION
99
be dealt with by the Director of Public Prosecutions, i.e. if the offence is punishable
by death; or when an offence is referred to him by a Government Department,
subject to his discretion; or in any case which appears to the Director ‘to be of
importance or difficulty or which for any reason requires his intervention’.
In the Metropolitan Police District, there are also the River Police, who carry out
a constant patrol of the river Thames; the Mounted Branch, which, in addition to
normal patrol and traffic duties, is employed as necessary on ceremonial work and
duties involving the supervision of large crowds; and a number of other specialised
branches of the police.
In addition to their duties as constables, police officers may be required by the
police authority to carry out other duties connected with the police, e.g., the
licensing and inspection of hackney carriages, but such duties have latterly been
considerably reduced.
Centrally Run Services
During recent years a number of common services have been established to
supplement those provided by the police authorities for their own use. In England
and Wales, such services include a training service, which provides nine residential
district training centres and a central police college; an installation and maintenance
service of wireless equipment for the police; and a forensic service, which provides
laboratories for the use of regional groups of forces. In Scotland, there is a central
police college, which provides training courses for recruits and courses of higher
training; but the installation and maintenance of wireless equipment is a direct
charge upon the police authorities concerned and there is no centrally run forensic
science service. The Glasgow police force, however, operates an extensive labora¬
tory, the service of which is available to the whole of the Scottish police, and the
universities of Aberdeen, Edinburgh, Glasgow and St. Andrews render assistance
when required.
A number of national services are provided by the Metropolitan Police Force,
whose functions in this respect include: (i) the maintenance of the central Criminal
Record Office, which is a national registry of criminals and crime, containing a
Central Fingerprint Bureau, the services of which are available to all police forces
of the United Kingdom and certain foreign forces; (2) the publication of the Police
Gazette? which contains particulars of people wanted for crime and details of
stolen property, and is supplied without charge to the police forces of the United
Kingdom and to certain other Commonwealth and foreign forces; (3) the organisa¬
tion and control of the Special Branch of the Criminal Investigation Department
at New Scotland Yard, whose duties include the protection of Royalty, some
Ministers of the Crown, and distinguished foreign visitors; and (4) the carrying
out of extradition orders made by the courts. For certain of these services, the
Metropolitan Police Force receives an additional Exchequer grant.
POLICE IN NORTHERN IRELAND
The general control of the Royal Ulster Constabulary, which is a national force,
is vested in an Inspector-General, who is responsible to the Minister of Home
Affairs. The cost of the force is met from the Northern Ireland Exchequer, the
County Borough of Belfast contributing a token sum of £25,000 annually towards
the cost of policing the City of Belfast.
1 A Scottish Police Gazette is published by the City of Glasgow Police Force.
IOO
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
The strength of the Royal Ulster Constabulary in 1958 was approximately 2,800,
including women. Conditions of service and pay follow closely on the lines of the
police service in Great Britain, the general duties pertaining to the tasks being
similar in all respects.
In addition to the Royal Ulster Constabulary, there exists in Northern Ireland an
auxiliary police force called the Ulster Special Constabulary, which is also under
the general control and direction of the Inspector-General. In the main, this force
is a part-time force and its duties cover training and assistance to the regular force
on special occasions. If necessary, however, its part-time personnel may be
mobilised for full-time duty and its duties extended to cover ordinary police duties.
The strength of the Special Constabulary in 1958 was approximately 13,500 part-
time officers and men, and over 100 full-time personnel.
THE FIRE SERVICE
The fire services in Great Britain are organised on a local basis, subject to a
measure of central control exercised by the Home Secretary (in England and Wales)
and the Secretary of State for Scotland (in Scotland). The fire services in Northern
Ireland are controlled by two authorities, the Belfast Corporation and the Northern
Ireland Fire Authority, which are responsible to the Minister of Home Affairs.
Every place throughout the United Kingdom is covered by a public fire brigade.
FIRE SERVICES IN GREAT BRITAIN
In 1958, there were 135 local authority fire brigades in England and Wales and
11 in Scotland.
Fire Authorities
The responsibility for fire-fighting functions, which was vested in the two
Secretaries of State on a national basis as an emergency measure during the second
world war, was restored in 1948 to local government control under the Fire Services
Act, 1947. The effect of the Act was to transform the National Fire Service (estab¬
lished in 1941) into separate fire brigades administered, in England and Wales, by
the county or county borough councils, which were created the fire authorities for
their areas and were given powers and duties which they exercise either separately
or as combined authorities where neighbouring councils care to make such arrange¬
ments to increase the efficiency of the service. The Act provides that (outside the
London area) each fire authority which is a county council must establish a fire
brigade committee, consisting of both county council members and representatives
of the county district councils in the county, to deal on the county council s behalf
with matters concerning fire prevention and control. The London County Council
is in direct control of the London Fire Brigade, which serves all London, including
the City of London. In Scotland, the local authorities are grouped in eleven areas
each with a single brigade; with the exception of Glasgow, where the town council
of the city is the responsible authority, each area is administered by a joint
committee representative of the councils of the counties and large burghs in the
area.
Central Control
The Home Secretary and the Secretary of State for Scotland are empowered to
make regulations prescribing such matters as conditions of service, standards of
efficiency and the organisation of training in the local fire brigades. In matters
GOVERNMENT AND ADMINISTRATION
IOI
affecting the fire brigades as a whole (excluding regulations about conditions of
service and similar matters), each Secretary of State is advised by a Central Fire
Brigades Advisory Council, consisting of representatives of the local authority
associations, representatives of the chief officers (firemasters in Scotland) and other
members of the brigades, and other persons having special qualifications for the
purpose. The Advisory Councils are not concerned with the conditions of service
of members of the brigades. On these subjects the Secretaries of State are advised
by the National Joint Council for Local Authorities’ Fire Brigades in Great Britain
and the National Joint Council for Chief Officers of Local Authorities’ Fire
Brigades in Great Britain.
Central control is also exercised through the inspectors of fire services, whose
duties include advising the Secretaries of State on technical matters. In 1958, there
were 12 inspectors and assistant inspectors in England and Wales and one inspector
and an assistant inspector in Scotland. There was also a woman staff officer.
Establishment Schemes
Each fire authority is required to draw up a scheme showing the establishment
of officers and other ranks (both whole-time and part-time) the number and loca¬
tion of fire stations and the number and type of vehicles and appliances considered
necessary for the provision of an all-over cover of its area. Details of establishment
schemes, which must be approved by the Secretaries of State, vary considerably
according to the fire risks in the area concerned; but in an English county of about
500,000 acres with a mixed urban and rural population of some 750,000, for
example, there might be 30 whole-time and part-time fire stations equipped with
150 vehicles and appliances and served by a whole-time force of approximately
250 and a part-time force of approximately 400 officers and men.
It is the duty of each fire authority to purchase such vehicles and equipment as
are required under the establishment scheme. Equipment is standardised, and
appliances are bought by fire authorities to requirement specifications which ensure
that essential standards are maintained, and yet allow sufficient freedom of design
to meet local requirements and further developments.
Operational Methods
Each fire authority is required to appoint a chief officer (firemaster in Scotland)
to be the chief administrative and executive officer for the fire services in its area.
The appointment must be ratified in England and Wales by the Home Secretary
and in Scotland by the Secretary of State for Scotland. The chief officer or fire-
master is responsible to the fire authority for seeing that both the fire brigade and
the fire department (which is the administrative centre and staff headquarters for
the fire brigade) are organised and managed in accordance with policy laid down.
There is a central headquarters for operational control, which is exercised on a
local basis by divisional officers in charge of geographical divisions into which
most areas are divided for the purpose. Each divisional officer has at his disposal
a small staff of whole-time, and a varying number of part-time, officers and men;
and he is responsible for mobilising this force in the strength necessary for dealing
with any outbreaks of fire in his division. Constant communication is maintained
between divisional and brigade headquarters; and if at any time an outbreak of
fire should grow beyond the capabilities of a divisional force, help is sent from one
or more neighbouring divisions in its area, or even from the area of another fire
authority. Under arrangements for mutual help made by all fire authorities, the
nearest available force is sent to the scene of a fire, regardless of area boundaries.
102
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Firemen
Firemen in Great Britain include: whole-time firemen; part-time firemen
either ‘retained’ firemen, who undertake, in return for a small retaining fee, to
attend fires if they are called upon to do so, or ‘volunteer’ firemen, who receive
no remuneration; auxiliary firemen, who are enrolled as part of the local authority
civil defence organisation as members of individual brigades under the command
of chief officers or firemasters, and whose activities are restricted (except in a
war emergency) to such duties as are desirable for training; and members of fire¬
fighting organisations with specialised functions, which are outside the scope of
the 1947 Act, e.g., those maintained by the War Office, the Air Ministry, the
Ministry of Transport and Civil Aviation and by some of the more important
industrial and commercial concerns.
Ranks in the fire services (for men) are chief officer, assistant chief officer (fire-
master and assistant firemaster in Scotland), divisional officer, assistant divisional
officer, station officer, sub-officer, leading fireman and fireman. Ranks in the
women’s branch, which is mainly concerned with controls, administrative duties
and duties of a clerical nature, are (for Great Britain as a whole) group officer,
assistant group officer, senior leading firewoman, leading firewoman, and fire-
woman. Promotion in the lower ranks of the fire-fighting forces is by examination
and by merit, and in the higher ranks by merit only.
Training for full-time firemen in England and Wales includes practical and
theoretical instruction given to recruits at a training school, which is run either by
the fire authority itself or by a neighbouring authority, and refresher courses for
firemen, arranged by fire departments. The training of recruits and junior ranks
in Scotland is carried out at a central training school which is the responsibility
of the Scottish Home Department. Courses for officers and potential officers of
fire authority brigades are held at the Fire Service College, at Wotton House,
near Dorking, Surrey, which is maintained by the Home Office and the Scottish
Home Department as the central training institution for the fire services.
Finance
Every fire authority is required to submit to the Home Secretary or to the
Secretary of State for Scotland an annual statement showing its expenditure and
income in connection with the provision of fire services during the preceding year.
The Government pays a grant of 25 per cent of the net expenditure approved by
the Home Office or the Scottish Home Department, less an annual contribution
towards the expenses of the Fire Service College (and in Scotland a contribution
towards the Scottish Fire Service Training School); the rest of the money is raised
from local authority funds.
Research
The principal means by which research on fire prevention and fire-fighting is
carried on is the Joint Fire Research Organisation, the cost of which is shared
equally between the Government and the Fire Offices’ Committee (a committee
of the insurance companies dealing in fire risks). The organisation conducts con¬
tinuing research into all aspects of fire prevention and fire-fighting and controls a
Fire Research Station at which practical tests are carried out.
FIRE SERVICES IN NORTHERN IRELAND
In Northern Ireland, the Belfast Corporation controls the Belfast Fire Brigade
and is responsible for the area inside the city boundary, and the Northern Ireland
Fire Authority covers the rest of the country outside Belfast.
GOVERNMENT AND ADMINISTRATION
103
The Belfast Fire Brigade maintains five whole-time stations and has an establish¬
ment of 190 officers and men manning 12 appliances, while the Northern Ireland
Fire Authority has one whole-time station in Londonderry and 44 other stations
throughout the remainder of the area, and an establishment of 88 whole-time
officers and men and 666 part-time firemen, manning 60 appliances.
Ranks of Firemen
The ranks of firemen in Northern Ireland are: for the Northern Ireland Fire
Authority—fire force commander, divisional officer, assistant divisional officer,
senior company officer, company officer, section leader (retained brigades only),
leading fireman and fireman; and for the Belfast Fire Brigade—chief officer, deputy
chief officer, divisional officer grade 2, divisional officer grade 3, assistant divisional
officer, station officer, sub-officer, leading fireman and fireman.
Finance
The Fire Services Acts (Northern Ireland), 1947-56, under which the fire
authorities were established, provided that the amount of fire service grant payable
to the Northern Ireland Fire Authority should be 50 per cent of the loan charges
in respect of capital expenditure which did not exceed £60,000, and 25 per cent
of the amount (if any) by which the loan charges exceeded £60,000, together with
50 per cent of the first £150,000 of other net expenditure and 25 per cent of the
excess over that amount. Expenditure in excess of the fire service grant is appor¬
tioned among the local authorities liable to contribute to the funds of the Authority.
Under the Fire Services Acts, the Belfast Fire Brigade cannot qualify for the
payment of fire service grant.

III. DEFENCE
THE DEFENCE SYSTEM
An adequate general survey of the principles which govern United Kingdom
defence policy is possible only in the wider context of the United Kingdom s
international relationships, its place in the Commonwealth and in world affairs,
and its responsibilities towards British dependent and protected territories
subjects which, as explained in the Introduction, fall outside the scope of this
handbook. This chapter, therefore, can attempt little more than an outline of the
present pattern of the development of Britain’s armed forces.
DEFENCE POLICY
The national defence policy has been increasingly based on the realisation that
no country can protect itself in isolation and the defence of Britain is possible only
as part of a system of collective defence arrangements. Policy is therefore determined
largely by Britain’s obligations to contribute to the collective defence organisations
of which it is a member—the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO) and
Western European Union, the Baghdad Pact, and the SEATO defence system in
South-East Asia—as well as to discharge its own special responsibilities in many
parts of the world; and defence planning is carried out in close co-operation with
Britain’s partners in these organisations with the aim of creating integrated allied
forces.
Close liaison is maintained with other Commonwealth countries, between whose
forces there is considerable standardisation of equipment, weapons and training
techniques and interchange of personnel.
At the same time the United Kingdom continues to work for the attainment of
international agreement on the control of all forms of armaments.
Machinery of Higher Defence Planning
The Queen is titular head of all the armed forces. Supreme responsibility for
national defence rests, under the ultimate control of Parliament (which makes
annual financial provision for defence needs), with the Prime Minister and the
Cabinet. Subject to this supreme responsibility, defence problems which engage
the collective responsibility of the Cabinet are normally handled on the Cabinet’s
behalf by the Defence Committee, meeting under the chairmanship of the Prime
Minister. The Minister of Defence, who is a member of the Cabinet and of the
Defence Committee, answers to Parliament for all matters of policy common to
the three fighting Services—the Royal Navy, the Army and the Royal Air Force. The
Minister is responsible for:
(1) the apportionment in broad outline of available resources between the
three Services in accordance with the strategic policy laid down by the
Defence Committee; this includes the framing of general policy to govern
research and development and the correlation of production programmes;
(2) the settlement of questions of general administration on which a common
policy for the three Services is desirable; and
104
DEFENCE
105
(3) the administration of inter-Service organisations such as the Imperial
Defence College, Amphibious Warfare Headquarters, the Joint Intelligence
Bureau, and the Joint Services Staff College.
Each of the three Service ministers—the First Lord of the Admiralty, the
Secretary of State for War (who deals with the Army), and the Secretary of State
for Air—is responsible to Parliament for the administration of his own Service;
and the Minister of Supply is similarly responsible for the Service supplies procured
by his Department. All these ministers are members of the Defence Committee,
while consultation on defence policy between them and the Minister of Defence
and discussion of inter-Service problems take place at meetings of the Defence
Board, of which the Minister of Defence is chairman. The Chiefs of Staff Com¬
mittee, which comprises the Chief of the Defence Staff (who is principal military
adviser to the Minister of Defence) as chairman and the professional heads of the
three Services, is collectively responsible to the Government for professional advice
on strategy and military operations and on the military implications of defence
policy generally. The Chiefs of Staff are members of the Defence Board, are in
attendance at meetings of the Defence Committee and may be invited to attend
meetings of the full Cabinet as necessary; they have at all times a right of access to
the Minister of Defence and, when necessary, to the Prime Minister. Policy within
each Service is controlled by an administrative directorate: the Board of Admiralty,
the Army Council and the Air Council, each headed by the responsible minister.
Britain’s defence policy is reviewed each year in a White Paper presented to
Parliament by the Minister of Defence immediately before the detailed Estimates
of the Service Departments. The White Paper describes the defence programme
proposed by the Government and indicates how each of the Services will carry its
part of the programme into effect.
The White Paper for 1957—Defence: Outline of Future Policy, Cmnd. 124—set
out a five-year plan for the reshaping of the defence forces in the light of changes
in the international situation, the rapid progress in military technology, and the
need to relieve the burden which defence requirements had been imposing on the
country’s financial and economic strength. This programme, described as involving
‘the biggest change in military policy ever made in normal times’ is now being put
into effect, and progress during the first year was reviewed in the 1958 White Paper,
Report on Defence: Britain's Contribution to Peace and Security, Cmnd. 363.
The Long-term Plan
Britain’s armed forces, the 1957 White Paper stated, must be able to perform
two main tasks:
(1) ‘to play their part with the forces of allied countries in deterring and
resisting aggression; and
(2) ‘to defend British colonies and protected territories against local attack,
and undertake limited operations in overseas emergencies.
‘The aim must be to provide well-equipped forces sufficient to carry out these
duties, while making no greater demands than are absolutely necessary upon man¬
power, money, and other national resources.’
The new plan provides for smaller, highly trained, all-regular forces with
increased mobility, equipped with the most modern weapons and organised on
up-to-date lines. To permit reductions in the numbers of men serving in the various
places overseas where Britain has defence responsibilities, a central reserve will be
maintained together with the means of transport, including airlift, to take it rapidly
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
106
to the scene of any trouble. Since ‘the over-riding principle must be to prevent war
rather than prepare for it’, priority is given to the production of the deterrent
nuclear weapons and the means to deliver them though it is emphasised that
conventional forces armed with conventional weapons will still be essential.
The intention is that there should be no further call-up of men for National
Service after the end of i960 and that by the end of 1962 the armed forces should
be composed wholly of Regulars and reduced to little more than half the present
size. If, however, voluntary recruiting fails to produce the numbers required it
may be necessary to have some limited form of compulsory service after 1962.
During the two years ending April 1959, the male strength is being reduced from
about 704,000 to about ssbjooo.1 The rate of run-down in later years will depend
on the international situation and the requirements of the regional defence
organisations of which Britain is a member.
DEFENCE AND THE ECONOMY
After the end of the second world war the strength of the armed forces had been
drastically reduced. It was not until growing world tension made it inevitable that
this trend was first halted and then reversed. Following the outbreak of war in
Korea in 1950, the United Kingdom embarked on a programme for building up
its defence forces, at a cost estimated originally at £4,700 million over a three-year
period.
Between 1950 and 1953 annual defence expenditure was nearly doubled, rising
to some £1,400 million in 1952-53, and over the same period the total strength of
the active forces increased from just under 7oo>oo° a peak of about 875>000 at
the beginning of 1953. With the end of hostilities in Korea, the programme was
revised to meet the changed conditions and to keep it within the limits of the
country’s economic resources in the face of rising costs. In place of a short
rearmament spurt there was substituted the policy of the ‘long haul’; the pro¬
gramme was slowed down and spread over a longer period.
Nevertheless, the burden on the economy continued heavy. Over the five years
1952-56, defence absorbed on average nearly 10 per cent of Britain’s gross national
product. In 1956, some 7 per cent of the working population was either in the
Services or supporting them, and one-eighth of the output of the metal-using
industries—vital to the economy as a main source of exports—was devoted to
defence. The very heavy cost of maintaining large British forces abroad (which in
1956 involved expenditure of some £179 million in foreign currency) placed a
severe strain on the balance of payments. The total net defence budget of nearly
£1,500 million in 1956-57 (after allowing for receipts from United States aid under
the Mutual Security Programme and German contributions to the cost of British
forces stationed in Germany as part of the NATO forces) equalled more than
one-third of total central Government current ordinary expenditure.
The effects on the economy of the new defence policy announced in 1957 were
already beginning to make themselves felt in 1958. The proportion of the working
population in the Services or supporting them is falling, the claims on the metal¬
using industries are being appreciably reduced, and the call on scientific and
engineering skills is easing. Even in 1957, current expenditure on defence
represented about 8 per cent of the gross national product, compared with 9 Per
cent in the previous year.
1 Excluding Colonial troops and other forces enlisted overseas, amounting in 1958 to
about 48,000.
DEFENCE
107
Current Defence Budget
The gross estimates for 1958-59 totalled £1,465 million (as against £1,483
million for 1957-58 and about £1,600 million for 1956-57). The figure of £1,465
million for 1958-59 did not take into account receipts in respect of local costs for
British forces in Germany. These costs, estimated at £47 million, were included
as appropriations-in-aid.1 Since there will be no receipts from the United States
in respect of defence aid, the Estimate presented to Parliament for 1958-59 was
£1,418 million.
Because of the increasing complexity of modern weapons and equipment and the
higher cost per man of regular forces, future defence expenditure will not show a
reduction proportionate to that in manpower.
The allocation of finance between the various Services is shown in Table 5.

The Ministry of Defence Estimate consists mainly of contributions to inter¬
national defence organisations, largely to the NATO common infrastructure
programmes.2
Defence expenditure by civil Departments in 1958-59 (including loan expendi¬
ture by the Post Office) was estimated at £18-85 million.
MANPOWER
Each of the three fighting Services is at present made up of a combination of
voluntary recruited regulars and men called up for National Service, and each
includes a corps of women volunteers who form part of the regular forces. An
analysis of the strength of the forces in April 1958, with estimates for 1959, is given
in Table 6.
1 Under an agreement announced in May 1958, the Federal German Republic is to pay
£12 million annually for three years towards these costs.
2 ‘NATO common infrastructure’ has been defined as capital investment in basic
facilities, such as airfields, signals systems and headquarters, designed for common use.
By March 1958, shared expenditure under the infrastructure programmes amounted to
about £440 million and further programmes had been agreed for implementation by 1961
which, it was estimated, would bring the total to £928 million. The United Kingdom is
contributing 12 per cent of the cost of the programmes.

(3) The estimated strength figures of the Army and RAF at 1st April, 1959, cannot
as yet be divided between Regulars and National Service men.
In addition, reserve and auxiliary forces with training liability (volunteers and
part-time National Service men) totalled 617,000 at 1st April, 1958.
Arrangements for recruitment and training of regulars are summarised for each
Service separately later in this chapter. An increase in regular recruiting, especially
for the Army, will be necessary to achieve an all-regular footing by 1962. Pay
and allowances have recently been substantially increased and other steps are being
taken to improve the conditions of Service life, including a five-year Service
building programme, costing £90 million.
A Regular Forces Resettlement Service has been set up by the Minister of Labour
and National Service to assist Regular officers and other ranks who are being
retired or discharged prematurely owing to the manpower cuts to find civilian
employment on leaving the forces.
National Service
Compulsory military service in peace time was first introduced in Britain in
1939, shortly before the outbreak of the second world war. Under the National
Service Acts, 1948-50, fit male British subjects between the ages of 18 and 26
ordinarily resident in Great Britain are (with certain limited exceptions) liable to
serve for two years in one of the armed forces.1 After this period of whole-time
service they must serve for a period of 3 J years with one of the reserve forces, giving
in all 5i years of whole-time and part-time service. During the latter period they
may be called upon to undergo up to 60 days’ training in all, if required, but not
more than 21 days in any year. In addition, National Service men called up before
31st December, 1953, remain statutorily liable, on completion of their 5! years
National Service liability, to recall as reservists up to 30th June, 1959, but are not
required to carry out training during this latter period of reserve liability.
1 The upper age limit may be extended, under the National Service Act, 1955, in the
case of men absent from Great Britain in the last year of their liability. The National
Service Acts operate for a limited period and they do not apply to men bom after 1940.
DEFENCE
ICQ
Men employed in certain occupations are granted deferment of National Service,
in the national interest, for as long as they are engaged in those occupations. This
provision applies to men in certain coalmining occupations, merchant seamen, sea¬
going fishermen who are members of the Royal Naval Reserve (Patrol Service),
regular whole-time agricultural workers whose call-up would mean a loss in food
production, crofters, some graduate teachers, some highly skilled scientists and
engineers engaged on work of high priority or on fundamental research, some
science and engineering graduates possessing higher degrees, a very small number
of shale oil underground workers, and a limited number of police cadets.
Deferment for a limited period is granted to students and apprentices to enable
them to undertake or complete approved courses of full-time studies or training.
Postponement of call-up may also be granted on the grounds of exceptional
domestic, business or other hardship. Applications for postponement which are not
granted by authorised officers of the Ministry are referred to independent local
committees from whose decisions appeal may be granted to an umpire appointed
by the Crown.
Men registering as conscientious objectors are subject to the decisions of local
tribunals of impartial persons appointed by the Minister of Labour and National
Service, with the right of appeal to an appellate tribunal.
Men called up under the National Service Acts have statutory rights to
reinstatement in their former civil employment.
The Ministry of Labour and National Service calls up the men from civil life
for registration and medical examination and posts them to the Services. The Army
is by far the biggest user of National Service men. In 1958, nearly half the Army’s
active male strength was provided by National Service men as against about a
quarter of the Royal Air Force and just over five per cent of the Royal Navy.
In October 1955, the Government announced its decision to reduce the size of
the active forces (then nearly 800,000) by slowing down the rate of call-up for
National Service and allowing the general age of call-up to rise from 18 to 19
years. It was also stated that, in general, it would not be necessary to require
National Service men (who have a maximum liability for 60 days’ training during
their 3^ years’ part-time service) to do more than 20 days’ training in all. In the
spring of 1957, the decision was taken to plan on the basis that the reduced man¬
power required under the new defence plan would be obtained by voluntary
recruitment and, subject to the fulfilment of this expectation, that there would be
no further call-up for National Service after the end of i960. The last National
Service men will therefore be due to complete their whole-time service by the end
of 1962.
During the run-down period not all men liable for National Service will be
required, and the intake will be diminished by further slowing down the rate of
call-up. It is intended to rely as far as possible on men in the age groups already
called up who had been granted deferment to enable them to complete training
or studies; they will be called up after completing their courses and will be
supplemented by younger men, mainly those not eligible for deferment. Men born
after 30th September, 1939, are unlikely to be called up.
Deployment Overseas
The deployment of United Kingdom forces is world-wide, in fulfilment of
responsibilities under the regional defence organisations of which the United
Kingdom is a member, and for the defence of United Kingdom dependencies. A
considerable part of these forces is committed to NATO on the continent of
IIO BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Europe. Forces are also maintained in the Middle East, the Far East, East and
North Africa, and the Caribbean.

have been to the Royal Naval Staff College, Greenwich (London), the Army Staff
College at Camberley (Surrey), or the Royal Air Force Staff Colleges at Bracknell
(Berkshire) and Andover (Hampshire) go to the Joint Services Staff College at
Chesham (Buckinghamshire), where they live and work together and where
particular attention is paid to the inter-Service aspects of staff work. This College
caters for about 150 students a year from the Navy, Army and Air Force, the Civil
Service, and other Commonwealth countries. Finally, there is the Imperial Defence
College in London, to which are sent a few specially selected and more senior
officers from the Services, the Civil Service, and from other Commonwealth
countries.
SUPPLY OF WEAPONS AND EQUIPMENT
The Ministry of Supply is responsible for the procurement of all weapons and
equipment used by the Army and Air Force. It is also responsible for the procure¬
ment for the Royal Navy of aircraft, some guns and ammunition, guided weapons
and a certain amount of miscellaneous equipment. The Admiralty is responsible
for the procurement of ships and associated equipment.
Production and Research
Production for the Services is carried out to a great extent by private industry
on a contract basis, but also by the Royal Ordnance Factories, the Royal Dockyards
and other establishments operated by the Ministry of Supply and the Admiralty.
The Ministry of Supply’s research establishments carry out research and develop¬
ment on behalf of the War Office and Air Ministry, and also for certain aspects of
Admiralty requirements, in particular naval aviation. Among the most important
of these establishments are: the Royal Aircraft Establishment, Farnborough; the
Royal Radar Establishment, Malvern; the National Gas Turbine Establishment,
Farnborough; and the Guided Weapons Establishment at Aberporth, Cardigan¬
shire. The Admiralty has its own research establishments which carry out research
DEFENCE
III
on ships and maritime equipment and also on certain kinds of electronic equipment
on behalf of all three Services. Current production and development programmes
are summarised later in this chapter in the sections dealing with the three Services
individually.
Development and production of nuclear warheads to meet Service requirements
are carried out by the Atomic Energy Authority (see the Science section of Chapter
VII) under contract from the Ministry of Supply, which is responsible for the
completed weapons. The Authority is also co-operating with the Admiralty in
research on the development of nuclear propulsion.
Service officers attend courses at the Atomic Energy Research Establishment,
Harwell, and have also been attached to industrial firms manufacturing guided
weapons during the development stage.
Guided missiles are tested at the Ministry of Supply’s research establishments
and guided and ballistic missiles at the Woomera range set up in Australia under
the Joint United Kingdom/Australia Guided Weapon Project. Service firing trials
of air-to-air and surface-to-air missiles are carried out at Aberporth and at the Army
gunnery range in Anglesey; a range for testing surface-to-surface missiles is being
set up on South Uist in the Hebrides. There is close collaboration with the United
States in the exchange of information and visits by technical personnel.
Some military equipment, including guided weapons, aircraft and radar equip¬
ment, is being supplied to Britain by the United States under the Mutual Security
Programme. Part of this equipment is manufactured in the United Kingdom and
financed by the United States under the ‘off-shore procurement’ programme. Under
this programme the United Kingdom is also making equipment for other NATO
countries in Europe. The total value of such contracts placed in the United King¬
dom to the end of 1957 was $640 million.
In addition to any orders for warships that may be placed from abroad with
British yards, ships of the Royal Navy which have become surplus to United
Kingdom requirements are made available to the Governments of other Common¬
wealth countries and to those of other friendly Powers.
Nuclear Weapons
During the second world war, British research workers played an essential part
in the allied project that led to the production of the first atomic bombs in the
United States. After the war, an Act of the United States Congress1 prohibited the
exchange of information on atomic weapons, and the United Kingdom decided to
develop its own independently. The first test explosion of a British atomic weapon
was carried out in 1952 in the Monte Bello Islands off the north-west coast of
Australia; further tests took place a year later near the Woomera rocket range in
Central Australia, and early in 1954 it was announced that delivery of atomic
weapons to the armed forces had begun. Further series of tests were held in 1956
and 1957, in the Monte Bello Islands and at the weapons proving ground at Mara-
linga in the South Australian Desert. Britain now has a substantial and growing
stockpile of kilo ton2 weapons.
In February 1955, the Government announced its intention to proceed with the
development and production of thermonuclear weapons. The first test explosions
1 The Atomic Energy Act, 1946 (known as the MacMahon Act), subsequently replaced
by the Atomic Energy Act, 1954. Substantial relaxations were made by amending legisla¬
tion passed in 1958, which permits, inter alia, the exchange, with friendly nations, of both
nuclear and non-nuclear parts for weapons and military reactors and of information on
atomic weapon development.
2 A kiloton weapon is equivalent to one thousand tons or more of high explosive.
II2 BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
were successfully carried out in May and June 1957 near Christmas Island in the
central Pacific, and further tests were carried out in the same area later in 1957
and in 1958. In March 1958, it was announced that British megaton1 weapons
were being produced and supplied to the Royal Air Force. }
The chief means of delivering these weapons are at present the RAF s medium
bombers of the V-class. It was stated in March 1958, that progress was being
made with propelled bombs which could be released a considerable distance from
the target. In February 1958, the United Kingdom and United States Governments
signed an agreement for the provision of launching sites in the United Kingdom
for United States Thor intermediate-range ballistic missiles. The weapons will be
operated by RAF Bomber Command from sites in eastern England, while the
nuclear warheads will be held by the United States. A British ballistic missile of a
more advanced type, designed for launching from underground, is being developed
in close co-operation with the United States.
THE FIGHTING SERVICES
the royal navy
The Royal Navy is governed by the Board of Admiralty. The First Lord of the
Admiralty is the minister responsible to Parliament for the Navy. The other nine
members of the Board are the First Sea Lord and Chief of Naval Staff, who is the
professional head of the Service and is a member of the Chiefs of Staff Committee;
the Second Sea Lord and Chief of Naval Personnel; the Third Sea Lord and
Controller of the Navy, whose responsibilities include ship construction and repair,
research and the provision and repair of Naval aircraft; the Fourth Sea Lord and
Vice-Controller, responsible for supplies and transport, maintenance and dockyard
organisation; the Deputy Chief of Naval Staff and Fifth Sea Lord, responsible for
stating requirements for ships, aircraft and weapons and for laying down Admiralty
policy on aircraft research and development; the Vice-Chief of Naval Staff, who
assists the First Sea Lord; the Parliamentary and Financial Secretary and the Civil
Lord, who assist the First Lord in his parliamentary business; and the Permanent
Secretary, who is a civil servant and responsible for the general conduct of
Admiralty business, including finance.
The Shape of the Fleet
When rearmament started in 1950, the Admiralty gave particular attention to
the need to build up anti-submarine and minesweeping forces, and to expand the
Fleet Air Arm. The building of aircraft carriers and ‘Daring’ class destroyers
already in hand was therefore pressed forward as quickly as possible, and a large
programme of modernisation and conversion of ships and a much increased
building programme were started.
By the beginning of 1957, a strong force of new and modernised carriers was
being built up; eight ‘Daring’ class destroyers (larger and more heavily armed than
the older destroyers) had joined the fleet; the frigate building programme had
made good progress and the minesweeper building programme was almost
completed; and several new submarines were in commission, including Britain s
first experimental high-speed submarine Explorer.
The new defence plans envisage a Navy that is smaller than in the past but
highly mobile. The carrier will continue to be the core of the new Navy. Grouped
round the carriers will be supporting ships carrying the latest weapons for dealing

million tons or more of high explosive.

US
with air, surface and underwater attacks and capable of acting by themselves on
detached service. Apart from carriers, the number of large ships will be restricted
to the minimum. Existing cruisers will, in due course, be replaced by those of the
‘Tiger’ class, now under construction. Many ships in reserve, including battleships,
are being disposed of.
The modern carriers have, or are being equipped with, the angled flight deck,
the steam catapult, the automatic aircraft positioning device, and the mirror and
‘Audio’ landing aids (all British inventions), the new arrester gear and an advanced
type of radar equipment. A new carrier, Hermes, is being built. Early in 1958
there were in the active Fleet three front-line carriers—Ark Royal, Eagle and
Bulwark; a fourth, Victorious—one of the best equipped carriers in the world—was
undergoing trials after modernisation {Victorious joined the Fleet towards the
end of 1958); a fifth carrier, Centaur, was being modernised and a sixth, Albion,
was refitting. Bulwark is to be converted into a Royal Marine commando carrier.
The first ‘Tiger’ class cruisers, with fully automatic guns and the latest control
equipment, are expected to start trials early in 1959. Four new-design destroyers
larger than present types are on order and will be fitted with a ship-to-air guided
missile, the Seaslug, trial firings of which have been carried out in the experimental
ship Girdle Ness.
Three fast long-range submarines of the ‘Porpoise’ class are expected to come
into service during 1958-59.
One of the main purposes of the Reserve Fleet is to have ready, at short notice,
ships to replace those in the Active Fleet which are damaged or withdrawn for
refit or modernisation. Under the new defence policy the Reserve Fleet is to be
smaller than in the past but is being maintained at a higher state of readiness.
Afloat support to the Fleet for replenishment at sea, or in harbours or anchor¬
ages, is provided by the Royal Fleet Auxiliary Service, comprising tankers, store¬
issuing ships, tugs and salvage vessels. These ships fly the Blue Ensign and are
manned by Merchant Navy officers and seamen.
Research and Development
Much experimental work has been carried out, with the Atomic Energy Authority,
on Dreadnought, the Navy’s first nuclear-propelled submarine, for which a nuclear-
propulsion unit is being obtained from the United States. Fundamental
investigations are also in hand for the development of counter-measures against
submarines with increased underwater speed. Research is proceeding with the aim
of providing automatic means for handling tactical information in warships.
Research and development work to meet the Navy’s modern requirements for
weapons are being concentrated in two establishments. At Portsdown (near Ports¬
mouth), the design and development of ship-borne gunnery and guided missile
systems will be carried out. At Portland (Dorset), all aspects of work on underwater
detection will be co-ordinated with work on underwater weapons.
The close relationship between the United Kingdom and the United States of
America is being continued, as well as collaboration with other members of the
Commonwealth. Several valuable items of new equipment have been brought into
service through the United States Mutual Weapons Development Programme and
certain naval projects are being discussed with countries of the Western European
Union.
Naval Commands and Dockyards
The Navy’s main Home commands are Portsmouth, Plymouth, The Nore,
Scotland (Rosyth) and the Commander-in-Chief, Home Fleet. As one of the
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
114
steps to be taken to ensure that available resources are used to the best advantage,
it was announced in February 1958 that the Nore Command (based on Chatham)
would be abolished and its functions transferred to other commands by April 1961.
A major reorganisation of the Navy’s dispositions overseas was also announced in
the same month. In the North Atlantic and Mediterranean area, where command
arrangements are integrated with the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation, United
Kingdom Naval forces are to be equipped predominantly for an anti-submarine
role, and will consist of two aircraft carriers (with a third in reserve), two cruisers
and a number of destroyers, frigates and submarines. In the Far East, the fleet
(based on Singapore) will be an all-purpose force of one aircraft carrier, one com¬
mando carrier and one cruiser, together with destroyers, frigates and smaller vessels.
Small Naval forces continue to operate under the Commander-in-Chief, South
Atlantic and South America Station, who, when not afloat, flies his flag near Cape
Town (by agreement with the South African Government); the Senior Naval
Officer, West Indies Station, who flies his pennant afloat; and the Senior Naval
Officer, Persian Gulf, who, on the abolition of the East Indies Command in 1958,
became Naval Deputy to the Commander, British Forces, Arabian Peninsula.
Naval shore support at home and overseas is also being reorganised in line with
the changes in the operational fleet. The reductions announced include the closing
of H.M. Dockyards at Hong Kong, Sheerness and Portland and of five Air Stations
in the United Kingdom. At home, the dockyards at Portsmouth, Devonport,
Chatham and Rosyth will continue to provide the Navy with major supplies and
repair facilities. Singapore, Malta and Gibraltar are the main dockyards overseas,
but the level of Naval activity in Malta is likely to decline and the future of the
dockyard there will be decided, in due course, after consultation with the Maltese
Government.
Fleet Air Arm
The Hawker Sea Hawk and the de Havilland Sea Venom provide the day and
all-weather fighter strengths of the Fleet Air Arm, but they are to be succeeded
respectively by the Supermarine Scimitar, which can carry an atomic bomb and
which is fitted, owing to its high speed, with a ‘flap-blowing system to facilitate
landing on carriers, and the de Havilland Sea Vixen, with armament which includes
an air-to-air guided weapon, the Firestreak.
The anti-submarine turbo-prop Fairey Gannet has been in service since 1954
and is due to be replaced in that role by helicopters. A new strike aircraft, the
Blackburn NA 39, is being developed to replace the Wyvern; it has a greater range
and speed and is able to carry an atomic bomb.
British-built helicopters, the Whirlwind and the Dragonfly, are now in service
with the Fleet Air Arm. A more powerful helicopter, the Wessex, is under develop¬
ment as a replacement for the Whirlwind.
Royal Marines
The Corps of Royal Marines is a body of men trained for service on sea or land.
Its official existence dates from 1664. The present-day functions of the Corps are:
(1) to provide personnel for the Commando Brigade;
(2) to supply detachments for H.M. ships, which {a) man a proportion of the
ships’ armament, {b) provide emergency landing parties, and (c) carry out
guard duties and the like; and
(3) to provide crews for minor landing craft and certain other parties required
for amphibious assault.

Women’s Royal Naval Service
The Women's Royal Naval Service (WRNS) is an integral part of the Naval
Service. Its members serve both at home and overseas. It has its own disciplinary
code. Nursing services for the Navy are provided by Queen Alexandra's Royal
Naval Nursing Service and Voluntary Aid Detachments.
Recruitment and Training for the Regular Navy
The main entry for Naval officers is the cadet-entry. Cadetships on the General
List are available to young men between the ages of approximately 17 and 19
years, and those selected, except electrical specialists, spend two years and four
months at the Britannia Royal Naval College, Dartmouth, after which they join
the Fleet as Acting Sub-Lieutenants. Cadets chosen for electrical specialisation
spend one year at Dartmouth and then read for an appropriate degree at a
university at Admiralty expense.
Short service commissions on the Supplementary List for aircrew duties with the
Fleet Air Arm or in electrical specialisation are available to young men with
appropriate qualifications. Doctors, dental surgeons and instructor officers all enter
on short service commissions after completing their professional training, and
permanent commissions are awarded to them according to the vacancies available.
Ratings may qualify for a commission on the General List, on the Supplementary
List for aircrew duties, and on the Special Duties List which has replaced the
Branch List.
Commissions in the Royal Marines are gained through the same examination as
are cadetships in the Royal Navy, and successful candidates are given a special
training, part naval and part military, which lasts three years.
The age limits for entry as a rating in the Navy are as follows: seaman, engineer¬
ing mechanic, electrical mechanic and Naval air mechanic branches, 15 to 28 years;
communications, Naval airman and supply and secretariat branches, 16J to 28;
artificer apprentices, 15 to 17; sick berth branch, 17 J to 28; artificers (trained),
igi to 28 years. The initial engagement is for a period of 9 years over the age of 18
except for artificer apprentices, for whom it is 12 years over the age of 18. Age
limits for entry into the ranks of the Royal Marines are: marines, 17 to 28 years;
junior entry (general service duties), 16 to 17; boy buglers, 15 to 16J; junior
musicians, 14 to 17^; musicians (trained), 17 to 28 years. Women may enter the
Women’s Royal Naval Service (WRNS) between the ages of 17J and 28 years for
an initial period of 4 years; most WRNS officers are selected from serving ratings.
On entry, all Naval and WRNS ratings and Royal Marines other ranks are given
a basic training at the appropriate school or shore establishment and are given
‘refresher’ courses at regular intervals during their time in the Service.
Reserve and Auxiliary Forces
A unified naval volunteer reserve is being established by combining, under the
title of the Royal Naval Reserve (RNR), the former Royal Naval Reserve, consisting
of officers of the Merchant Navy and members of the Fishing Fleet who volunteer
to serve in the Royal Navy in war, and the former Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve,
whose members voluntarily undertake part-time training for various aspects of
Naval service. Other reserves include the Royal Fleet Reserve (RFR), composed of
men who have completed their service as Regulars; the Royal Naval Special Reserve
(RNSR), which includes most of the National Service men who are discharging
their liability for part-time service; the Royal Marine Forces Volunteer Reserve
(RMFVR); and the Women's Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve (WRNVR). Behind
these fully trained reserves, available to meet immediate needs on mobilisation, is
H6 BRITAIN*. AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
the vast background of officers and men with past war-time and peace-time service
in the Royal Navy who are liable, if still fit for service, to recall in the event of war.
Royal Naval Minewatching Service
The Minewatching Service, a civilian organisation composed of men and women
volunteers, is responsible in time of war for manning posts around the coast and
overlooking the main navigable waterways. Its object would be to spot mines
dropped from aircraft, and to plot and report their positions.
Sea Cadet Corps
The Sea Cadet Corps, which is administered by the Navy League in conjunction
with the Admiralty, is the oldest pre-Service movement for boys in Britain; its
origin dates from the time of the Crimean "War in the mid-nineteenth century. Its
aim is to give technical training to, and instil Naval tradition in, boys under the
age of 18 who intend to serve in the Royal and Merchant Navies and also to those
sea-minded boys who do not intend to follow a sea career but will, given this
knowledge, form a valuable reserve for the Navy. It also aims to provide for the
social and educational welfare of the cadets and to develop character and good
citizenship.
THE ARMY
The control of the Army is vested in the Army Council, of which the Secretary
of State for War is president. The other civilian members of the Council are the
Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for War and Financial Secretary of the
War Office (who is a Minister), and the Permanent Under-Secretary of State for
War, a civil servant who acts as secretary to the Council. The military members
of the Army Council comprise the Chief of the Imperial General Staff; the Vice-
Chief of the Imperial General Staff, who is responsible for strategic policy and
plans, operations and intelligence; the Deputy Chief of the Imperial General Staff,
responsible for war organisation, equipment, weapons and training; the Adjutant-
General to the Forces, responsible for manpower, personnel, discipline, medical
services, welfare, education, and the women’s services; and the Quartermaster-
General to the Forces, responsible for supplies, transport and, jointly with the
Permanent Under-Secretary, works services.
Organisation of the Active Army
The active Army is organised in 291 arms and services, which include the
Household Cavalry, the Royal Horse Artillery, the Royal Armoured Corps (the
historic Cavalry Regiments and the Royal Tank Regiment), the Royal Regiment
of Artillery, the Corps of Royal Engineers, the Royal Corps of Signals (which
provides land and wireless communications), the five regiments of Foot Guards
(the Brigade of Guards), the regiments of the Infantry of the Line (grouped into
brigades and the Parachute Regiment), the Army Air Corps (which operates light
aircraft on reconnaissance and undertakes aerial observation and liaison work), the
Royal Army Service Corps (responsible for the provision of food and fuel supplies
and transport vehicles), the Royal Army Medical Corps, the Royal Army Ordnance
Corps (responsible for most equipment and stores), and the Royal Electrical and
Mechanical Engineers.
The Women’s Royal Army Corps (formerly ATS) and the Queen Alexandra s
Royal Army Nursing Corps (formerly QAIMNS) are both corps of the Regular

Army, their officers and other ranks being subject to military law and the Queen’s
Regulations in the same way as members of the other corps.
Within the United Kingdom, the Army is organised into Scottish, Northern,
Southern, Eastern, and Western Commands, London District, and Northern
Ireland District. There are four main commands overseas: Middle East Land
Forces, East Africa Command, Far East Land Forces, and the British Army of the
Rhine (which forms part of Britain’s contribution to the NATO forces).
In July 1957, plans were announced for reducing the Royal Armoured Corps,
the Royal Artillery, the Royal Engineers and the infantry by a total of 51 regiments
or battalions; 30 of these reductions will have been made by April 1959. Corre¬
sponding reductions are being made in supporting and administrative units.
Following extensive trials carried out in the British Army of the Rhine, Army
field formations are being reorganised on the basis of flexible, self-contained
infantry and armoured brigade groups, able to fight, to move and to maintain
themselves under minimum direction from headquarters.
As the strengths of overseas garrisons are reduced, increased importance is being
attached to a central strategic reserve, based mainly in the United Kingdom, which
is being reconstituted on a brigade group basis.
Equipment
By the end of the five-year programme initiated in 1957, the weapons of the
I939_45 war will have almost completely disappeared and the Army will be com¬
pletely rearmed. With the development of nuclear weapons, attention is being given
to the need to increase mobility without loss of fighting capacity and, in the interests
of economy, the aim is to simplify the Army’s equipment as much as possible and
‘to produce a family of weapons with no overlapping members’.
The programme of rearmament launched in 1950 concentrated at first on the
production of tanks and other armoured vehicles, infantry weapons, and modern¬
ised engineering and signal equipment. The Army was equipped with a complete
new range of wheeled vehicles and with large numbers of the Centurion medium
tank, which proved outstandingly successful during the Korean war. More recently,
production was begun of a heavy gun tank, the Conqueror, and by 1957 it had under¬
gone Service trials.
Among other current plans, a proportion of the Army is being equipped with the
British version of the FN self-loading rifle, a weapon of Belgian origin adopted by
the United Kingdom in the interests of standardisation with other NATO forces; the
L.2 sub-machine gun, which is being produced in quantity, has virtually taken
the place of the Sten, and a replacement for the Vickers medium machine gun is
being developed; an improved anti-tank gun is being issued, and an anti-tank
guided weapon is being developed; while a powerful armoured car, the Saladin,
a personnel carrier, the Saracen, a versatile scout car, the Ferret, and a new mark
of the Centurion tank are in various stages of production. A new range of radio
equipment, giving a performance greatly superior to previous systems, is being
brought into service.
Progress is being made in the introduction of surface-to-surface guided weapons,
the first of which are being supplied by the United States. The first guided weapon
course was started at the Royal Military College of Science in Berkshire as early as
1950. In 1955, groups of Army instructors began to receive training in the United
States in the use of the Corporal guided missile; training in Britain is now given
at the School of Artillery at Larkhill. Two artillery regiments are being equipped
with the Corporal, and both units will join the British Army of the Rhine on com¬
pletion of their training. To provide anti-aircraft protection for troops in the field.

BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
surface-to-air guided missiles are being developed, and the English Electric
Thunderbird, which can deal with targets at a wide range of altitudes, is being made
available for training during 1958-59.
Recruitment and Training for the Regular Army
The normal method of entry for a regular commission in the Army is through the
Royal Military Academy, Sandhurst (Camberley, Surrey), where selected cadets
undergo a course lasting two years before receiving their commissions. This course
gives a general military and academic background for all arms and services, and
young officers on leaving Sandhurst then attend special Arm Courses to prepare
them for their own arm, some attending technical courses at the Royal Military
College of Science (Shrivenham, Berkshire) and at Cambridge University. Cadets
may enter Sandhurst direct from school or after they have enlisted in the Army
or been called up for National Service.
The War Office also maintains a boarding school known as Welbeck College,
at Worksop, Nottinghamshire, where 150 boys are educated for two years between
the ages of 16 and 18 years. These boys pass into the Royal Corps of Signals,
Royal Army Ordnance Corps or the Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers.
A few may be commissioned into the Royal Engineers.
University graduates may be accepted for direct regular commissions.
A small number of schoolboys are selected to take engineering or science degrees
at the Royal Military College of Science as National Service officers and thereafter
to be granted regular commissions. Regular commissions may also be granted to
other officers already serving on National Service commissions or on short service
commissions. Candidates for National Service commissions are trained at the
Officer Cadet School, Mons Barracks, Aldershot. At this school the course, which
consists of purely military training, lasts for four months.
Men wishing to enlist in the ranks must be British subjects between the ages of
17J and 30 years, of good character, medically fit and able to pass an intelligence
test. Men with certain trade qualifications may be accepted up to the age of 33
years.
Men can sign on for 22 years (with the option of finishing their Colour Service
at the end of six years or at the end of any consecutive period of three years there¬
after, provided they give six months’ notice in writing).
Men may choose the corps in which they wish to serve and their wishes regarding
trade training are met as far as possible.
On entry into the Army, other ranks are trained at the depots or with the
training units of the arms or services for which they have been selected. This
initial training consists of six weeks’ basic military training common to all arms
and services, and a further period of training which is special to the arm or service
concerned. This latter training varies in length of time, e.g., infantry, four weeks;
Royal Signals electronic technician, 22 weeks.
A boy can enlist in the Army as an Army apprentice tradesman, between the
ages of 15 and 17; a junior leader, between the ages of 15 and i6i; and a drummer
band boy, piper or tailor, between the ages of 15 and 17 J years.
After the age of 18 years, Army apprentice tradesmen serve nine years with the
Colours and three years in the Reserve. Boys enlisted for training with junior
leader units may serve either for nine years with the Colours and three years in
the Reserve, or six years with the Colours and six years in the Reserve. The object
of the junior leaders’ units is to produce long-term Regular warrant officers and
senior non-commissioned officers, and that of the apprentice schools is to produce

The Reserve Army
With a smaller Regular Army, the Reserve Army, consisting of the Army
Emergency Reserve and the Territorial Army, will have an increasingly important
part to play.
The Territorial Army consists of volunteer officers and other ranks (including
women), National Service officers and men carrying out their statutory obligation
of three and a half years’ part-time service after completing their whole-time service
with the Army, and the Territorial Army Reserve of Officers. With the end of
National Service it will become a wholly volunteer force. Its main role in the event
of war would be the defence of the United Kingdom, but some units might be
needed overseas and all its members are liable for service in any part of the world
when the army reserve is called out by proclamation. Volunteers are required to
attend annual camp and to carry out a minimum number of training periods.
While the military authorities are responsible for policy, training and discipline,
local administration of the Territorial Army is carried out largely by county
Territorial and Auxiliary Forces Associations.
The Army Emergency Reserve has as its main function to provide essential com¬
munications and the technical and administrative services required on mobilisation
by both the Regular and the Territorial Armies. It consists of specialist units and
pools of skilled men—both volunteers and part-time National Service men—who
can be called upon at short notice to fill gaps in Regular units. It also provides units
of the Mobile Defence Corps for civil defence tasks.
Cadet Forces
The Combined Cadet Force and the Army Cadet Force provide training on Service
lines for boys between the ages of 14 and 18 years. The Combined Cadet Force
provides training in schools in which education is continued to the age of 17 years
or above. Cadets receive a general basic training and then specialised training in the
Royal Navy, Army or Royal Air Force Sections. Contingents are affiliated to
Regular units and establishments of the Services. The Army Cadet Force is re¬
cruited from schools which do not raise contingents of the Combined Cadet Force,
and from boys who have left school.
THE ROYAL AIR FORCE
The Royal Air Force is administered by the Air Council, composed of the
Secretary of State for Air, who is president, and seven other members. The
Parliamentary Under-Secretary for Air is vice-president and the Permanent Under¬
secretary of State for Air, who is a civil servant, is secretary of the Council. The
Service members are the Chief of the Air Staff, who is responsible for strategic
policy and the fighting efficiency of the RAF; the Vice-Chief of the Air Staff,
responsible for inter-Service policy, operations, intelligence, liaison with other air
forces, standardisation and ground defence; the Deputy Chief of the Air Staff,
responsible for the preparedness for war of the RAF, for command, staff and air-
training, and for policy regarding future aircraft and weapons; the Air Member
for Personnel; and the Air Member for Supply and Organisation.

Coastal Command’s long-range maritime reconnaissance force, which is com¬
mitted to NAT O, is wholly equipped with Shackleton aircraft. An improved
version—the Shackleton Mark 3—is being introduced.
Transport Command is being re-equipped to provide increased mobility for the
strategic reserves of both land and air forces. A Comet 2 squadron was formed in
1956 the first all-jet transport squadron in any air force—and has proved very
successful. Britannia aircraft are on order and when in service will provide long-
range transport; for short and medium ranges, use will still be made of piston-
engined Hastings. The Beverley freighter, now in service, is a versatile aircraft
which can lift large loads.
Increasing use is being made of helicopters for operations and for the Search and
Rescue Organisation of Coastal Command. The Sycamore and Whirlwind heli¬
copters have given good service, particularly in Malaya, and the Bristol 192 twin-
engined helicopter is on order.
Following a decision to base initial flying training on jet aircraft, an order was
placed for the Jet Provost trainer and, in July 1958, for a training version of the
Lightning. The RAF is the first air force to adopt all-jet training.
In recent years there has been a great deal of airfield development in the United
Kingdom to provide for the operation of the V-bombers and the new fighters,
and a major programme of airfields, depots and technical facilities has also been
carried out for units of the United States Air Force stationed in Britain.
Recruitment and Training for the Regular Air Force
It is the aim of the Air Council that all pilots, navigators and air electronics
officers shall enjoy commissioned status. Appointment to a permanent commission
in the General Duties Branch may be obtained either through a cadetship at the
Royal Air Force College, Cranwell, Lincolnshire (pilots and navigators only), or by
entry as a university graduate under special conditions. The majority, however,
enter on short-term commissions or under the direct commission scheme which
offers the choice of serving for eight or twelve years on the active list and going
out with a gratuity, or of staying in the Service to qualify for pension. Except for
those entering through Cranwell, where the course lasts three years, flying training
takes about 18 months for pilots and one year for navigators and air electronics
officers.
Officers in ground branches are usually found from people in civil life, some of
whom already hold professional qualifications, who enter the Royal Air Force on
short service commissions. Short service officers may be selected for permanent
commissions while in the Royal Air Force.
Permanent commissions may also be obtained through cadetships at the Royal
Air Force Technical College, Henlow, Bedfordshire (Technical Branch), the RAF
College, Cranwell (Secretarial and Equipment Branches), or the Royal Military
Academy, Sandhurst (RAF Regiment). University graduates are also eligible for
permanent commissions under special conditions. Some technical cadets proceed
after one year at Henlow to a three-year degree course at a university.
Women’s Royal Air Force
Women play an important part in the work of the Royal Air Force and of its
reserve and auxiliary formations. The WRAF is an integral part of the Royal Air
Force and its members train with and work alongside airmen in the same trades,
serving both in the United Kingdom and overseas. Nursing services are provided
by Princess Mary's Royal Air Force Nursing Service.

Auxiliary and Reserve Forces . , ,
The Royal Auxiliary Air Force consists of fighter control units raised and
maintained by Territorial and Auxiliary Forces Associations.
The Royal Air Force Volunteer Reserve, which is part of the Royal Air Force
Reserve provides a pool of officers, airmen and airwomen mainly with previous
Air Force service, who, like the personnel of the Royal Auxiliary Air Force, train
on a part-time basis. It includes members of the university air squadrons.
Part-W National Service men serve in Class H of the Royal Air Force Reserve
or they may volunteer to join the Volunteer Reserve or the Royal Auxiliary Air
Force.

Corps a predominantly voluntary civilian organisation, administered by Fighte
Command and devoted to the specialised tasks of identifying and reporting i
movements of aircraft, and of measuring and reporting on radioactivity m the event
of nuc-lear attack The Corps originated in the first world war to report the move¬
ments of German aircraft and zeppelins over Britain and was officially established
in 1925-

Organisation of Civil Defence
Civil defence planning in the United Kingdom is the responsibility of a number
of ministers each of whom undertakes the duties which, in war time, would
represent a natural extension of his peace-time functions. As the development of
effective civil defence services involves much detailed planning at local level, the
central Government has enlisted the assistance of local government authorities, of
industry and commerce and of public bodies of many kinds, including voluntary
organisations such as the Voluntary Aid Societies and the Women’s Voluntary
Services.
In addition to his direct responsibilities under the Civil Defence Act, 1948, the
Home Secretary is responsible for co-ordinating the defence plans of all the civil
agencies of the Government. The Secretary of State for Scotland is responsible for
civil defence matters in Scotland.
In England and Wales, the Elome Secretary supervises the civil defence activities
of the police and fire services, and he administers the Civil Defence Corps and the
Industrial Civil Defence Service as well as such matters as shelter policy and the
national air-raid and fall-out warning and monitoring systems. The Civil Defence
Department of the Home Office is under the charge of a Director-General of Civil
Defence, appointed by the Home Secretary. Other Government Departments have
direct responsibility for the civil defence applications of the services which they
control; for example, the Ministry of Health is responsible for the hospital and
first-aid services, and the Post Office for telecommunications.
In Scotland, the Scottish Home Department deals with questions corresponding
to those dealt with by the Home Office in England and Wales, and the Department
of Health for Scotland is responsible for such matters as the hospital and first-aid
services.
In Northern Ireland, the Civil Defence Act (Northern Ireland), 1950, places
responsibility for civil defence matters on the Ministry of Home Affairs, which
may arrange for other Departments to undertake some functions on its behalf.
The co-ordination of civil defence planning in Great Britain necessarily involves
much work by interdepartmental committees, on which all Departments with civil
defence responsibilities in Great Britain are represented, in order that plans and
programmes may be constantly reviewed to take account of changes in the scale
and nature of possible attacks.
England is divided into ten Civil Defence Regions in charge of Regional
Directors of Civil Defence, appointed by the Home Office, and there is also a
Director of Civil Defence for Wales. Their duties include liaison with the armed
forces and the planning of combined exercises. There is no corresponding regional
organisation in Scotland, where planning is carried out centrally, although the
country is divided into zones for operational purposes.
The Civil Defence Services
To provide the personnel required in war for civil defence tasks, the following
services, in which in times of peace only part-time service is required, are raised
in Great Britain1 by voluntary recruitment of civilians, both men and women:
1. The Civil Defence Corps, which was created by the Secretary of State’s
Warrant in May 1949, to assist local and other authorities to carry out
their civil defence functions.
1 In Northern Ireland there are three main services: the Civil Defence Corps, the
Auxiliary Fire and Rescue Service, and the Hospital Service Reserve.
[24 BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
2. The Industrial Civil Defence Service, which comprises civil defence units
formed in industrial and commercial premises.
3. The Auxiliary Fire Service, to reinforce the fire services maintained by
local authorities under the Fire Services Act, 1947. (The Fire Service
would become a national organisation in time of war.)
4. The National Hospital Service Reserve, limited at present to trained nurses
and persons willing to be trained as nursing auxiliaries to reinforce the
National Hospital Service in England and Wales. In Scotland, there is also
an Ambulance Section of the Reserve to provide the additional manpower
for the war-time operation of the Scottish Ambulance Service.
Subject to restrictions regarding age and obligation to serve in the armed forces,
recruits for all services are drawn from men and women who are willing to serve
as long as they are able and who will undertake to train regularly. The Government
does not pay the volunteers for their services but reasonable out-of-pocket expenses
are reimbursed.

The Civil Defence Corps. This Corps is recruited and organised by certain local
authorities (mainly the councils of counties and county boroughs in England and
Wales, or large burghs in Scotland) in local divisions. The local divisions are
subdivided into five sections1 as follows:
Headquarters: control of civil defence operations, communications, recon¬
naissance (including the identification of toxic agents).

tion of stretcher-bearers.
escort and welfare of homeless and evacuees, assistance with
billeting, rest centres, supervision and welfare of the public in
shelters, emergency cooking and feeding, public information

The Industrial Civil Defence Service. The Government has invited the manage¬
ments of the larger industrial and commercial undertakings to form civil defence
units for the protection of their own personnel and to give such assistance as they
are able to the public civil defence sendees. The Government’s aim is to have an
1 Four in Scotland, where there is no separate Ambulance and Casualty Collecting
section, ambulance services being provided by the National Hospital Service Reserve, an
casualty collecting being a warden duty. In Northern Ireland, the Civil Defence Corps,
which is organised directly by the Ministry of Home Affairs and not by the local authori¬
ties, consists of three sections only—Headquarters Wardens and Welfare; the Ambulance
Service forms part of the Hospital Service, and the Rescue Section has been integrated
with the Auxiliary Fire Service to form the Auxiliary Fire and Rescue Service.
DEFENCE
125
efficient civil defence unit in all premises where more than 200 people work. Units
formed under these arrangements comprise sections similar to those of the Civil
Defence Corps; they train in the same way as the Corps and in war would operate
in close association with it and with the other public civil defence services.
Training
Members of the Civil Defence Corps are required to undertake the training
necessary to enable them to carry out the duties of an ordinary member of the
section of the Corps to which they belong, and thereafter to undertake a few hours’
refresher training, including exercises, each year. If they wish to increase their
knowledge they may undertake courses of additional and advanced training.
Civil defence instructors (except instructors in first aid) are trained either at one
of the three central training schools or locally, under arrangements made by local
authorities, in accordance with directions given by the Home Office or the Scottish
Home Department. Courses and studies for senior officials concerned with civil
defence are held at the Civil Defence Staff College at Sunningdale, Berkshire, and
in Scotland, at Taymouth Castle, Perthshire.
Auxiliary firemen are trained in fire-fighting by firemen of the regular brigades
of local authorities. They are encouraged to gain practical experience of fire¬
fighting by performing stand-by duty at fire stations to enable them to respond,
with regular members of the brigade, to calls to fires. Auxiliary firemen also attend
exercises involving the control of large numbers of pumping and other appliances
used in fire-fighting operations.
The Police
In time of war the police would continue to be responsible for the maintenance
of law and order and the control of traffic, and they would also be responsible for
certain additional war-time and civil defence tasks. In all these duties they would
have the aid of the Special Constabulary.
Role of the Armed Forces
The Services have a vital role to play in civil defence; all armed forces, whether
regular or reserve, in the country at the outbreak of war who are not engaged in
active operations against the enemy will have to be prepared to assist in the struggle
for survival. The armed forces are in no sense a substitute for civil administration;
the aim will be to support the civil authorities by all possible means. All units of
the Regular and Reserve Armies are trained in peace time for the civil defence
tasks they may be expected to perform in war. In addition, some 25,000 men of
the Royal Air Force have been trained in emergency fire-fighting operations at
Home Office training centres to enable them to serve as firemen in a National Fire
Service.
The United Kingdom Commanders-in-Chief Committee, under the chairman¬
ship of the Commander-in-Chief United Kingdom Land Forces, is responsible to
the Chiefs of Staff for co-ordinating Service plans for home defence, including
Service assistance to civil authorities for both civil defence and national recovery.
While fulfilling those functions the Committee maintains close liaison with the
Director-General of Civil Defence.
There is also close liaison in peace time between the civil and military authorities
at all levels. Joint exercises are continually being held and everything possible is
being done to align the civil and military chains of command. As a result, the
functions which the military authorities could undertake in support of the civil
authorities have been more clearly defined: there is also a growing understanding
among the civil authorities of the part that the military authorities can best play.
126
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
There are two main ways in which the fighting Services can render assistance:
by helping the civil authorities to maintain control; and by the direct employment
of units on various tasks such as aid to the police in the maintenance of law and
order and traffic control, aid to the fire service, assistance in the reception and care
of the homeless, treatment and evacuation of casualties and in the clearance of
radioactive fall-out zones, the provision of guards, the maintenance of road, rail
and water communications, light rescue, reconnaissance and the provision and
running of camps.
IV. SOCIAL WELFARE
STATE AND VOLUNTARY SERVICES
In Britain the State is now responsible, through either central or local government
authorities, for a range of services covering subsistence for the needy, education
and health services for all, housing, employment or maintenance, the care of aged
or handicapped persons, the care of children, the nutrition of mothers and children,
and sickness, maternity and industrial injury benefits, widow’s and retirement
pensions and family allowances. Public authorities in the United Kingdom are
spending over £3,000 million a year on social services; that is over £50 a year a
head of the population.
Voluntary organisations, especially the Churches, were the pioneers of nearly all
the social services. They provided schools, hospitals, clinics, dispensaries, and
social and recreational clubs before these were provided by the State. They made
themselves responsible for the welfare of the very young and the very old, the
homeless and the handicapped, before it was generally accepted that the whole
community had a responsibility towards these people. Where the services and the
facilities they provided were adequate, they have been encouraged to continue. The
State now supplements these voluntary services and provides financial assistance,
sees that essential services are brought within the reach of every citizen, and ensures
that the necessary standards are maintained.
Many voluntary social services surround and supplement the State services. The
two types are complementary, not competitive, and they merge into each other. The
State services often work through voluntary agencies specially adapted to serve
individual or special needs. The welfare work of the National Assistance Board is
supplemented by the work of many voluntary social service societies with whose
workers the Board s officers co-operate, while the institutional provision made by
the State and by local authorities for the care of the chronic sick and the aged is
supplemented by voluntary homes of various types for the care of the sick and
elderly, most of whom receive State pensions or benefits.
Voluntary Bodies
The number of voluntary charitable societies and institutions in Britain runs into
thousands. Some of them are large and some are small and local in character. Some
have general aims and others, such as the Royal National Institute for the Blind,
have been established for a particular purpose. The societies co-operate with each
other and with local authorities engaged on the same work.
Foremost among societies providing general social service are the National
Council of Social Service, with the Scottish Council of Social Service and the
Northern Ireland Council of Social Service, and the Family Welfare Association.
The National Council of Social Service was established in 1919, and the correspond-
ing Scottish Council in I943> create a closer link between the machinery of
government and the voluntary activities of the ordinary citizen. The Family
Welfare Association, formerly the Charity Organisation Society, which was founded
in 1869, works on personal lines to help any individual or family in need or diffi¬
culty. It works mainly in London, but there are some 180 voluntary family case¬
work agencies serving other areas of Britain.
127
i2g BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
There is a Central Council for the Care of Cripples, and the major societies
caring for homeless children are represented on the National Council of
Associated Children’s Homes. Other examples of co-ordination in a specialised
field are the National Association for Mental Health, the Women s Group on Pu ic
Welfare and the National Marriage Guidance Council.
Societies working on a national scale whose social work is definitely religious in
inspiration include the Salvation Army, the Church Army, the Social Service of
the Church of Scotland, the Church of England Children s Society, the Church
of England Moral Welfare Council, the Young Men’s Christian Association, the
Young Women’s Christian Association, the Society of St. Vincent de Paul, e
Crusade of Rescue, the Jewish Board of Guardians and the Catholic Marriage
^<War-firne>organisations such as the Women’s Voluntary Services (WVS) and the
Citizens’ Advice Bureaux continue, with official support, to do very valuable wor .
The Citizens’ Advice Bureaux (there are still over 400 of these) act as interpreters
between the Government Departments and the ordinary citizen. WVS activities
are many and various. They include welfare work for children, the aged and the
sick, and for certain foreign workers, as well as relief work in emergencies.
The old-established British Red Cross Society not only aids the sick and wounded
in time of war but works in peace time for ‘the improvement of health, the preven¬
tion of disease, and the mitigation of suffering’. It is in particular developing its
welfare services for civilian disabled, invalid and crippled children and the aged, i >
members of the St. John Ambulance Brigade and, in Scotland, the St. Andrew s
Ambulance Association likewise render voluntary auxiliary medical services and
undertake welfare work for the sick and the infirm.
The Social Worker .
While the voluntary worker giving full-time or part-time service has done pioneer
work in many of Britain’s social services and continues to play an essential part m
probably every service, social services of all kinds increasingly depend for their
operation primarily on the professional social worker, that is the full-time salaried
worker trained in the principles and technique of social service. Training for many
forms of social work consists of a basic university diploma or certificate course in
social science followed by a specialised training for a particular service, x he latter is
usually organised by the profession concerned. An attempt is being made to lessen
specialisation in social work. , ^ „ r
Voluntary organisations were the pioneers in the employment and training oi
social workers, but Government Departments and local authorities now employ a
considerable number of trained social workers of various kinds. Such workers mclu e
regional and local welfare officers; children’s care organisers; children s officers
child care officers and homes’ residential staff for work under the Children Act,
1048; neighbourhood workers; youth leaders; almoners; mental health workers
psychiatric social workers; tuberculosis care workers; housing managers; personne
managers and probation officers—in fact, representatives of most branches of social
work. In June 1955 the Minister of Health and the Secretary of State for Scotland
set up a working party to examine the field of work, recruitment and training o
social workers in the local authorities’ health and welfare services.
NATIONAL INSURANCE AND RELATED SERVICES
National Insurance, Industrial Injuries Insurance, Family Allowances and
National Assistance together constitute a system of social security in the Unitea
Kingdom which ensures that in no circumstances need anyone fall below a minimum
SOCIAL WELFARE
129
standard of living. The Ministry of Pensions and National Insurance administers
the first three of these measures in Great Britain; in Northern Ireland they are
administered by the Ministry of Labour and National Insurance.
National Assistance is administered by the National Assistance Board in Great
Britain, and in Northern Ireland by the National Assistance Board for Northern
Ireland. Pensions and welfare services for war pensioners and their dependants are
the responsibility of the Ministry of Pensions and National Insurance throughout
the United Kingdom.
Appeals relating to claims for insurance benefits or war pensions, or applications
for assistance, are not decided by the Ministry or the Board but by independent
authorities appointed under the Acts.
The Poor Relief Act of 1601 can be regarded as the starting-point of public pro¬
vision for social security in England and Wales. From the beginning of the present
century, and particularly after the Royal Commission on the Poor Laws and Relief
of Distress had issued its report, with the influential Minority Report, in 1909, a
strong movement arose against the form and spirit of the poor law as it had been
administered under the Poor Law Amendment Act of 1834. The first departure
from the poor law as the sole means of relief given from public funds had been the
introduction in 1908 of non-contributory old age pensions granted on a test of means.
Other changes followed, the broad effect of which was gradually to transfer more
and more of the old poor law functions from local to central government adminis¬
tration, and the process was completed in 1948 with the passing of the National
Assistance Act. In the same period there was a development of compulsory insurance
administered on a national basis. The Workmen’s Compensation Act of 1897 fore¬
shadowed the present National Insurance Industrial Injuries scheme; although the
system it introduced was not itself a State-administered insurance scheme, it re¬
quired employers to pay compensation to workers for accidents at work. In 1912
came the National Health Insurance scheme and with it the introduction of the
contributory principle on which all later measures have been based. In return for a
small weekly contribution it provided a small cash payment and medical treatment
without charge during sickness. It applied only to a limited number of the lower-
paid workers. In 1912 also a limited scheme of unemployment insurance was started.
This was extended in 1920 to cover the great majority of employed persons, a very
necessary provision in view of the large-scale unemployment of the inter-war years.
In 1926 contributory pensions for old people, widows and orphans were introduced.
By the beginning of the second world war the social services in Britain were
among the best in the world, but they lacked co-ordination by the very fact of their
piecemeal development, and they were not universal.
Under the stimulus of war, when plans for post-war reconstruction were being
formulated, Lord (then Sir William) Beveridge was invited by the National Coali¬
tion Government to investigate the country’s existing social insurance system. In
1942 the Beveridge Report was published; it recommended the creation of a com¬
prehensive and unified system of social insurance. The report aroused intense
interest and was accepted in general by the Government as the basis on which the
future social security structure should be built.
In the immediate post-war years a series of Acts introduced a new comprehensive
system which became fully operative on 5th July, 1948. Adjustments have been
made by a number of subsequent Acts.
Reciprocity
The national insurance, industrial injuries and family allowances schemes of
Great Britain and those of Northern Ireland and the Isle of Man operate as a single
130
Britain: an official handbook
system. Reciprocal agreements on family allowances are m operation with Australia,
. New Zealand, Jersey and Guernsey, and there are further agreements with Aus¬
tralia and New Zealand (on sickness, unemployment and widow s benefits, an
retirement pensions), with Jersey (on sickness, industrial injuries and widow s
benefits, guardian’s allowances and retirement pensions), with the Irish Republic
(on sickness, unemployment, maternity and widow’s benefits, and the insurance of
seamen), with Cyprus (on sickness, unemployment and widow s benefits, maternity
grants, guardian’s allowances, retirement pensions and death grants), and with
Malta (on sickness, industrial injuries, unemployment and widow s benefits,
guardian’s allowances and retirement pensions). Agreements covering various
aspects of social security have been in operation with France since November 1949,
with Italy since May 1953, with Switzerland since June 1954, with Luxembourg
since April 1955 and with the Netherlands since June 1955- Agreements with
Sweden and Israel came into operation in June and November 1957 respectively,
and with Norway, Belgium and Yugoslavia in April, June and September 195b. An
agreement with the German Federal Republic was signed in December 195b.
An agreement with Denmark on industrial injuries benefits has been in operation
since May 1954. Similar agreements with other countries are under negotiation.
The schemes in Northern Ireland are similarly linked with most of the countries
A multilateral agreement on social security, signed by the five Brussels Treaty
Powers, was-ratified by the United Kingdom in May 1950 and is m operation
between the United Kingdom, France, Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg.
Other multilateral provisions, embodied in two interim agreements on socia
security signed by the member countries of the Council of Europe and in a United
Nations Convention on the status of refugees, have also been ratified by the Unite
Kingdom.
FAMILY ALLOWANCES
Family allowances have been provided by the State since August 1946, under the
Family Allowances Act of June 1945- Some five and a quarter million allowances
are being paid in Great Britain to over three and a quarter million families with two
or more children. An allowance is paid for each child other than the first or only
child below the age limits. The age limits are 15 years for children who leave school
at that age, 16 years for those who are handicapped, and 18 years for those who
remain at school or are apprentices. The allowance was raised from p. to 8s. a
week in September 1952 and, by the Family Allowances and National Insurance
Act, 1956, for the third and each subsequent child in a family the rate was increased
by 2s. to 10s. as from October 1956.  
Familv allowances are paid from the Exchequer and their object is to benefit the
family as a whole; they belong to the mother, but may be paid either to the mot er
or the father. There is no insurance qualification, and parents who are not British
subjects may claim allowances if they satisfy a special residence qualification
The corresponding scheme in Northern Ireland makes similar provision for
family allowances.
NATIONAL INSURANCE
The National Insurance Act, 1946, came into full operation on the 5th Ju'Y, 1948-
It has been amended by the National Insurance Acts, 1949 and 195L me Family
Allowances and National Insurance Acts, 1952 and 1956, and the National Insurance
Acts, 1953, 1954, 1955, 1956 and 1957- The Acts apply, in general, to everyone over
school-leaving age living in Great Britain. There are similar schemes in Northe
Ireland and the Isle of Man.
SOCIAL WELFARE
131
Contributors are divided into three classes:
Class 1—Employed persons. Those who work for an employer under a contract of
service or are paid apprentices—about 22 million.
Class 2—Self-employed persons. Those in business on their own account and
others who are working for gain but do not work under the control of an
employer—nearly ij million.
Class 3—Non-employed persons. All persons insured who are not in Class 1 or 2—
about half a million.
This general classification is subject to certain modifications, made by regulations,
to meet special circumstances. Married women engaged only in their own house¬
hold duties are, in general, provided for by their husbands’ insurance and cannot
become insured in their own right unless they were insured under the old scheme
on the 5th July, 1948, and continued to pay contributions as non-employed persons,
or unless they have since taken up paid work. Employed married women may choose
whether to pay separate contributions themselves or to rely on the cover provided
by their husbands’ contributions. Students receiving full-time education and un¬
paid apprentices need not pay contributions. Up to the age of 18, contributions are
credited to them. Over that age they may, if they wish, pay as non-employed
persons (Class 3). Self-employed and non-employed persons whose income is not
more than £156 a year can apply for exception from liability to pay contributions
under the scheme.
Contributions
The main weekly rates of contribution as in September 1958 are shown in Table 7.

are normally paid on a single contribution card by National Insurance stamps
bought from a post office. It is the employer’s responsibility in the first place to see
that the Class i contributions are paid, but he can deduct the employee’s share from
his or her wages. The self-employed and non-employed must stamp their own cards.
Contributions are usually credited for weeks of unemployment, sickness or injury,
or if widow’s benefit is being paid.
insured person ceases to be liable for National Insurance contributions when
he retires, or is deemed to have retired, from regular employment. If such a person
does any work as an employed person thereafter, he must pay an Industrial Injuries
contribution; his employer’s liability remains the same as shown in Table 7.
Benefits
The scheme provides sickness, unemployment, maternity and widow s benefit,
guardian’s allowance, retirement pension and death grant. Persons in Class 1 are
covered for all benefits; those in Class 2 for benefits other than unemployment and
industrial injuries benefits; and those in Class 3 for benefits other than sickness,
unemployment and industrial injuries benefits, and maternity allowance.
For most of the benefits there are two contribution conditions. First, before any
benefit can be paid, a minimum number of contributions must actually have been
paid since entry into insurance; secondly, the full rate of benefit cannot be paid
unless a certain number of contributions have been paid or credited over a specified
period. For guardian’s allowance and industrial injuries benefits there are no
contribution conditions.
Rates of benefit have been increased since the scheme began. The rates current
in mid-195 8 are set out below.
Sickness Benefit
The standard weekly rate of sickness benefit for a man or woman over 18 (except
a married woman) is 50s., with an increase of 30s. for an adult dependant and 15s.
a week for the first or only child under the family allowances age limits, with 7s.,
in addition to any family allowance payable, for each subsequent child. The
weekly rate for a married women is 34s., but she is paid at the 50s. rate if she
is maintaining an invalid husband or is separated from her husband and cannot get
financial support from him.
Unless 156 Class 1 or Class 2 contributions have been paid since the entry into
insurance, sickness benefit can be drawn only for a year, but in general it continues
for as long as sickness lasts, once 156 contributions have been paid.
Unemployment Benefit
The rates of unemployment benefit are the same as for sickness benefit.
Unemployment benefit is payable in the first place for 30 weeks, but it may be
continued for up to a maximum of 19 months in all, according to the person’s
record of contributions paid as against unemployment benefit drawn in recent years.
Maternity Benefit
A maternity grant of £12 10s. is payable for a confinement, provided the required
contribution conditions have been satisfied, and a further grant of £12 10s. for
each additional child born at the confinement who is alive twelve hours after
birth. A home confinement grant of £5 is payable where the mother is not confined
in free accommodation under the National Health Service or in accommodation
otherwise paid for out of public funds. A maternity allowance of 50s. a week, begin¬
ning the eleventh week before the expected week of confinement, payable for
SOCIAL WELFARE
133
18 weeks, is available for working women who satisfy the contribution conditions.
These are that in the 52 weeks ending 13 weeks before the expected week of her
confinement, the claimant must have paid 26 contributions at the full rate as an
employed or self-employed person and, for an allowance at the maximum rate, have
a total of at least 50 contributions paid or credited. Increases of maternity allowance
for dependants are payable in certain circumstances at the same rates as increases of
sickness benefit.
Widozvs Benefit
There are three kinds of widow’s benefit, paid only on the deceased husband’s
insurance. A Widow’s Allowance of 70s. a week plus 20s. a week for the first
or only child under the age limits and 12s. a week for second and subsequent
children (in addition to family allowances) is paid for 13 weeks. A Widowed
Mother’s Allowance of 70s. a week is paid following tvidow’s allowance to a widow
who has a child who qualifies under the age limits; she also receives 12s. a week,
in addition to any family allowance, for each child after the first. A widowed
mother’s allowance at the lower rate of 50s. a week may be paid to a widow who
has residing with her a person under 18 who, but for age or because of absence
abroad when the husband died, would have qualified as a child for this purpose
(for example, a son or daughter aged 17 who is neither at school nor an apprentice
and, therefore, is not within the family allowances’ age limits). A Widow’s Pension
of 50s. a week is paid to a widow who is 50 or over at the time of the husband’s,
death and has been married three years, or who is 50 (40 if the husband died before
4th February, 1957) or over when her widowed mother’s allowance ends, provided
three years have elapsed since the marriage. Widowed mother’s allowance and
widow’s pension are reduced by 6d. for each complete is. of the first 20s. of
earnings in excess of 60s. and 50s. respectively, and by is. for each shilling of
higher earnings. In the case of widowed mother’s allowance the total deducted in
any one week cannot exceed 50s., whatever the earnings may be.
There are special rules to help widows to qualify for sickness or unemployment
benefit if they are unable to obtain work when widow’s allowance or widowed
mother’s allowance ends.
Guardian's Allowance
A Guardian’s Allowance of 27s. 6d. a week may be paid to a person who has in hi&
family a child whose parents (or step-parents) have died and one of whom was
insured under the National Insurance Acts. This continues while the child remains
in the guardian’s family and is a child within the meaning of the Family Allowances.
Act.
Retirement Pension
Retirement pensions are paid to men at the age of 65, and to women at the age of
60, provided the required contribution conditions have been satisfied and subject,
to retirement from regular employment. From the age of 70 (men) and 65 (women),
however, the pension is payable whether or not the claimant has retired. The
standard rate is 50s. a week. A married woman ordinarily qualifies for pension on
her husband’s insurance at the standard rate of 30s. a week. If after retirement a.
pensioner below the age of 70 (65 for a woman) earns over £2 10s. a week, 6d. is
deducted from the pension for each is. earned over that amount up to £3 10s.
and is. is deducted for each shilling earned over £3 10s.
Men and women are encouraged not to retire at minimum pension age and are
able to earn a larger retirement pension by continuing at work and paying contribu¬
tions. For every 25 contributions they pay for weeks of work between the ages of
I34 BRITAIN! AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
65 and 70 (men) or 60 and 65 (women) their pension is increased by is. 6d. a
week. The pension of the wife of such a contributor is increased by is. a week for
every 25 contributions paid by the husband after he has reached the age of 65
and the wife has reached 60, and it continues at this rate up to the time of the
contributor’s death; if his wife survives him her increments of pension are re¬
calculated at the is. 6d. rate if the is. increases were earned after 16th July, 1951.
A man now reaching the age of 65 who continues at work for a further five years can
therefore receive a pension of as much as 65s. a week on attaining the age of 70.
If he has a wife not more than five years younger than himself, their combined
pensions can be 105s. a week; if the wife survives her husband her pension can be
65s. a week. .
A retirement pensioner is entitled to an increase of 30s. a week for his wife if she
is under 60 and also to an increase of 15s. for the first child under the family
allowances’ age limits, and 7s. for each succeeding child, in addition to any family
allowance payable.
Death Grant
A Death Grant of up to £25 is paid on the death of an adult, and a smaller sum
on the death of a child, provided the required contribution conditions have been
satisfied. Grants are not paid for persons who were already over pension age on
5th July, 1948. Reduced grants are paid on the deaths of men who were over 55 years
of age and women who were over 50 on 5th July, 1948.
NATIONAL INSURANCE (INDUSTRIAL INJURIES)
The Industrial Injuries Insurance scheme, which replaced the Workmen’s Com¬
pensation scheme in July 1948, provides benefits for personal injuries caused by
accidents arising out of, and in the course of, employment, and for prescribed diseases
due to the nature of employment. It covers practically everyone in Class 1 of the
National Insurance scheme and certain others. The relevant Acts are the National
Insurance (Industrial Injuries) Acts, 1946 to 1957- Cover against industrial
injuries and diseases in Northern Ireland is provided to the same extent by the
separate legislation of the Parliament of Northern Ireland.
Benefits
Injury Benefit
Injury Benefit for an adult is 85s. a week plus 30s. for an adult dependant
and 15s. for the first or only child under the family allowances age limits and
7s. for each other eligible child, in addition to any family allowance payable. It
is paid when the insured person is incapable of work as a result of an industrial
accident or disease, and payment can continue for a maximum of 26 weeks from
the date of the accident or development of the disease.
Disablement Benefit
Disablement Benefit may be paid when injury benefit stops and the amount
depends on the extent of the disablement, as assessed by a medical board. It varies
from 85s. for 100 per cent disablement to 17s. a week for 20 per cent disablement.
For disablement of less than 20 per cent a gratuity is normally paid, ranging up
to £280.
In the following circumstances Disablement Benefit may be increased:
1. It will be made up to the 100 per cent rate during in-patient treatment in a
hospital for the relevant injury or disease, and increases for dependants may
also be paid.

2. If benefit is being received at the zoo per cent rate and someone is needed to
look after the insured person, a constant attendance allowance not exceed-
ing 35s. a week (70s. in cases of exceptionally severe disablement) may be
paid.
3. If the insured person is permanently unfit for work an unemployability
supplement of 50s. a week may be paid, with allowances for dependants.
4. If the insured person is unfit to return to his former job, or work of a similar
standard, benefit may be increased (subject to a maximum of 85s.) by a
special hardship allowance of up to 34s. a week.
Death Benefit
If the accident or disease results in the insured person’s death, Death Benefit is
paid to the dependants.
For widows living with their husbands at the time of death, a pension of 70s. a
week is payable for the first thirteen weeks of widowhood. Thereafter, if the widow
(1) is entitled to a child’s allowance or was over the age of 40 on ceasing to be so
entitled, or (2) was over 50, or was permanently incapable of self-support, at the
time of her husband’s death, or (3) is not entitled to child’s allowance, but has
residing with her a young person under the age of 18 who was in her late husband’s
family, or (4) is over 40 when (3) ceases to apply, or (5) is pregnant by her late
husband, she is entitled to a pension of 56s. a week. If none of these conditions is
satisfied, the widow may receive a pension of 20s. a week.
In addition, allowances will be paid for children under the family allowances age
limits. For widows, these allowances are normally at the rate of 20s. a week for the
first or only child and 12s. a week for each other child. For other beneficiaries, the
rate is 15s. and 7s. a week respectively.
Certain other dependants, such as parents and other relatives, are entitled to
pensions, allowances or gratuities. The amounts vary with the closeness of the
relationship and the extent to which the dependants were maintained by the
deceased during his lifetime.
NATIONAL ASSISTANCE AND WELFARE SERVICES
The National Assistance Act, 1948, came into operation on 5th July, 1948. It
provides a unified State service of financial assistance for those in need, replacing
the various services of this kind provided in the past by the State and local authori¬
ties. As the residual service, National Assistance meets the financial needs of all
those people who are unable to maintain themselves and who fall outside the scope
of the other social security services, and supplements the insurance benefits when
they are insufficient.
The National Assistance Board is responsible for administering these weekly
cash grants. It has various other duties, including the administration of non¬
contributory pensions under the Old Age Pensions Act, 1936 (still payable on a
nationality, means and residence test to a diminishing number of persons over 70
and blind persons over 40, who do not receive pensions under the contributory
scheme); the administration of hostels provided under the Polish Resettlement Act,
1947; and the assessment under the Legal Aid and Advice Act, 1949, and the
Legal Aid and Solicitors (Scotland) Act, 1949, of the maximum amount a person
applying for legal aid may be called upon to pay towards the cost of the action.1
The Board is responsible for influencing ‘persons without a settled way of living’
to lead a more normal life. It provides temporary accommodation for such persons

136
usually through the agency of local authorities, and it runs a residential re-establish¬
ment centre for men of this type or men who have been long unemployed and in
receipt of National Assistance grants.
The provision under the National Assistance Act of residential accommodation
for the aged, infirm and others, and of special welfare services for the blind, the
deaf, the crippled and other handicapped persons is the responsibility not of the
National Assistance Board but of county and county borough councils in England
and Wales and, in Scotland, of councils of counties and large burghs.
In Northern Ireland, financial assistance is given under the provisions of the
National Assistance Act (Northern Ireland), 1948, to persons in need and there is
also a system of non-contributory pensions similar to that in operation in Great
Britain. Under the Welfare Services Act (Northern Ireland), 1949, local authorities,
in their capacity as welfare authorities, provide residential accommodation for
aged, infirm and other persons who are in need of care and attention. The welfare
authorities also provide special services for the blind, deaf and other handicapped
persons.
Old People’s Welfare
The newer homes provided by local authorities for aged or other infirm persons
usually have accommodation for 25 to 40 residents; over a thousand have been
opened in Great Britain since the end of the second world war. County welfare
authorities in Northern Ireland have provided over 20 similar homes. These
smaller homes are gradually replacing the larger institutions which were previously
maintained by local authorities.
Voluntary bodies take a large share in work for old people, which has been steadily
expanding since the second world war brought into prominence the problems of old
people’s welfare that social and population changes had already begun to accentuate.
Voluntary homes for old people now number about 1,800 and some 7,000 social
clubs for elderly people have been started in recent years in all parts of Britain. The
regular visiting of lonely old people and the delivery of cooked meals to their homes
(‘meals-on-wheels’) are other welfare services that are being developed by voluntary
effort with the support of local authorities. Their object is to enable old people to
continue to live in their own homes wherever possible. Domestic help and home
nursing are provided in the National Health Service (see p. 147)"
Local Old People’s Welfare Committees are formed by those concerned in this
work, and are aided by the National Old People’s Welfare Council, an associated
group of the National Council of Social Service widely representative of voluntary
and statutory bodies having direct contact with old people, or by the Scottish Old
People’s Welfare Committee, a committee of the Scottish Council of Social Service.
A National Corporation for the Care of Old People was established in 1947 by the
Nuffield Foundation to stimulate and to give financial support to schemes for the
welfare of the aged, to maintain an expert technical advisory service, and to
encourage and to undertake research and experiment for the welfare of old people.
The Corporation is now concentrating its main effort on home services for old
people. The King George VI Foundation has allocated £440,000 from the King
George VI Memorial Fund to schemes for the benefit of old people.
CARE OF CHILDREN
The Children Act, 1948, which came into force with the ending of the Poor Law,
places upon local authorities in Great Britain a duty to receive into their care any
SOCIAL WELFARE
137
child under the age of 17 who has no parent or guardian, or who has been abandoned
or whose parents are unable to provide for him temporarily or permanently. Local
authorities must keep a child in care until he is 18 years of age or until he no longer
requires it. Under the Children and Young Persons Acts, 1933-52, as regards
England and Wales, and under the Children and Young Persons (Scotland) Act,
I937, local authorities are required also to accept children committed to their care,
until the age of 18, by Juvenile Courts, as needing care or protection. Both categories
of children are to be treated so as to further their best interests and to afford them
opportunity for the proper development of their characters and interests.
Children in care are, if possible, to be boarded out with foster parents, who
receive an allowance to cover the cost of maintenance. If a foster home cannot be
found, a child may be placed in a children’s home managed by a local authority or
a voluntary organisation. Many children’s homes are now provided in small houses,
on housing estates or in ordinary streets, where a group of ten or fewer children
live in the care of a housemother or houseparents, the husband following his normal
employment. Other children may be placed in hostels or lodgings or in other accom¬
modation specially suited to their needs. The desirability of returning a child to his
family circle as soon as possible is fully appreciated, and work is carried out to
rehabilitate the family where this is necessary.
To carry out their functions under the Children Act each local authority (county
council and county borough council or, in Scotland, council of a large burgh) is
required to appoint a Children’s Committee and a Children’s Officer to be respon¬
sible for the care and upbringing of children in the authority’s care. Children’s
officers are assisted by a staff of child care officers who undertake inquiries and who
supervise children placed in foster homes. Regulations for England and Wales safe¬
guarding the boarding out of children by local authorities and voluntary organisa¬
tions and the conduct of children’s homes have been made by the Home Secretary.
The Secretary of State for Scotland is the responsible Minister in Scotland.
In Northern Ireland, the Children and Young Persons Act (Northern Ireland),
I95°, gave to the welfare authorities of each county and county borough the duty
of caring for homeless and neglected children under the general direction of the
Ministry of Home Affairs.
Voluntary organisations, many of which were pioneers in the work of child care,
continue to play a valuable part. The larger societies, such as Dr. Barnardo’s, the
Church of England Children’s Society and the Catholic Child Welfare Council, are
constituent societies of the National Council of Associated Children’s Homes, to
which a large number of smaller voluntary homes are also affiliated. In Scotland,
a valuable contribution is also made by the Children’s Homes and Hostels under the
auspices of the Church of Scotland Committee on Social Service, and by other
voluntary organisations, including the Orphans’ Homes of Scotland.
Children’s homes provided by voluntary organisations are required to be regis¬
tered under the Children Act. The boarding out of children and all children’s
homes, whether local authority or voluntary homes, are subject to inspection by
Inspectors of the Home Office Children’s Department or of the Scottish Home
Department.
The cost of the local authorities’ child care service, including the provision of
training for houseparents and child care officers, is shared between the local
authorities and the Exchequer.
The practice of adoption, for which legal provision was first made in England
and Wales in 1926 and in Scotland in 1930, has considerably increased during the
last twenty years. It is now regulated by the Adoption Act, 1950, as amended by
the Children Act, 1958.
I3g BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
To safeguard the welfare of children living with their own parents or guardians,
the children’s departments have a duty to cause inquiries to be made in any case
in which it is reported that a child may need care or protection. In addition, all
local authorities have been asked by the Government Departments concerned to
appoint a committee to co-ordinate local authority and voluntary services dealing
with unsatisfactory families, and to designate one of their officers as co-ordinating
officer for the purpose of calling meetings of interested bodies to discuss particular
‘problem families’ and to decide on a course of action. Local health authorities
have wide powers under the National Health Service Act to make arrangements
for the prevention of illness, and for care and after-care; these arrangements enable
preventive and remedial measures to be taken to safeguard the physical and mental
health of the children of problem families. These problem families, a very small
minority in the community, are the focus of much attention from health, housing,
education, children’s and welfare authorities and voluntary bodies. The voluntary
Family Service Units undertake intensive and prolonged casework with such
families and there are several voluntary recuperative centres to which mothers, with
their children, can be sent for a period of residential training, sometimes as a
condition of a probation order. The old-established National Society for the
Prevention of Cruelty to Children and its Scottish counterpart maintain inspectors
and visitors for the investigation of cases of reported cruelty or neglect of children
in their own homes; when necessary they resort to law for the protection of children,
but they prefer to achieve their purpose by warning and advice.
WAR PENSIONS AND RELATED SERVICES
Pensions to persons disabled or bereaved through the wars are paid under Royal
Warrants and other instruments. .
The current basic pension for 100 per cent disablement for a private soldier is
85s. a week, but the amount varies according to rank and the degree of disable¬
ment. The latter is assessed by comparing the disabled person with a normal
healthy person of the same age and sex, without taking earning capacity into
account. Allowances for a wife and children are paid in addition to the basic pension
and there are various supplementary allowances, the main ones being for un¬
employability (55s. a week), constant attendance (up to 35s. and, exceptionally,
70s. a week), comforts (10s. or 20s. a week), and lowered standard of occupation
(up to 34s. a week). There is an allowance (at rates varying between 5s. and 15s. a
week) for persons drawing disablement pensions who are aged 65 or over and whose
assessment is 40 per cent or more.
Both the basic disablement pension and the supplementary payments are tree ot
income tax, and children’s allowances are paid in addition to any allowance payable
under the Family Allowances Acts.
War pensioners have priority (except over more urgent cases) for treatment ot
their war disabilities in National Health Service hospitals.
Pensions are paid to war orphans and to war widows. The standard rate of
pension for war widows of private soldiers is 66s. a week, an addition being made
for higher rank, and they also receive allowances for their children (25s. for each
child), and, in certain cases, an allowance for rent (up to 25s. a week). Parents or
other relatives who were dependent on a person whose death resulted from the
wars may receive pensions if they are in pecuniary need.
The Ministry of Pensions and National Insurance maintains a welfare service for
war pensioners, with a special branch for war orphans.
SOCIAL WELFARE
139
Many ex-Service organisations, e.g., the British Legion, and other voluntary
associations give financial aid and personal service to disabled ex-servicemen and
women and their families. The Ministry and these bodies work in co-operation.
HEALTH
The concern of the State with the nation’s health is chiefly a development of the
last 100 years. The second half of the nineteenth century saw the growth of the
environmental or public health services, such as provision of pure water, sewerage,
disposal of refuse and cleaning of streets, and also building byelaws and other
measures designed to promote healthy living conditions in Britain. Local
authorities provided smallpox and other infectious-disease hospitals and poor law
infirmaries in the nineteenth century, but the major hospital and medical services
remained in the hands of voluntary hospitals and private practitioners until the
twentieth century. This century has seen the main development of publicly provided
personal health services, as distinct from environmental services. The medical
benefit introduced under the National Insurance Act of 1911 was the first step in
the provision of a State-aided general practitioner service outside the Poor Law.
The early years of the century were notable for the development of maternity and
child welfare and measures for the prevention and treatment of tuberculosis; there
was progressive development in the hospital services provided by local authorities
until these were absorbed in the National Health Service created in 1948.
Over the past forty years advances have been made in many directions: medical
research, discovery of important new drugs, blood transfusion, control and treat¬
ment of venereal disease, and research into diet. The second world war served to
emphasise the importance of a sound diet and as a result the Welfare Foods Service
for expectant and nursing mothers and young children was introduced, and the
School Meals Service and industrial canteens were expanded. War also stimulated
developments in industrial health services and in the rehabilitation of the disabled.
Scientific discoveries and improved services are reflected in declining mortality
rates and improved physique.
PUBLIC HEALTH
The Public Health Act of 1936 brought up to date and consolidated preceding
Acts; it constitutes the present basic public health code in England and Wales.
Local authorities are mainly responsible for its implementation and they have exten¬
sive powers for the making and administration of byelaws (laws of local application)
relating to matters of public health. The local authorities chiefly concerned are the
councils of county and non-county boroughs, urban and rural district councils, and,
to a limited extent, parish councils. Local authorities also have power to secure
clean air by establishing smoke control areas (see the Fuel and Power section of
Chapter IX).
The development of the public health services in Scotland and in Northern
Ireland has been largely on the same lines as in England and Wales, although these
services have been based on separate Acts, and different authorities are responsible
for the various services. The Public Health (Scotland) Act, 1897, and the Burgh
Police (Scotland) Act, 1892, constitute the basic legislation for Scotland. The local
authorities concerned are the councils of counties and burghs. In Northern Ireland,
the county and county borough councils are mainly responsible for administering
the Public Health Acts (Northern Ireland), 1878-1949.
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
140
Control of Infectious Diseases
Local authorities are responsible to the Minister of Health (or the Secretary of
State for Scotland) for recording notifications of the prescribed infectious diseases;
they are also responsible for the investigation by the Medical Officer of Health of
outbreaks of infectious diseases, and for disinfection and other measures advised
by the Medical Officer of Health for prevention of the spread of infectious diseases
The same Ministers have the general responsibility for supervising the operation
of health control at seaports and airports, the primary object of which is to prevent
the introduction of infectious disease into the country. It is operated at the principa
seaports by Port Health Authorities specially constituted for the purpose, and at
others by the local authorities. Health control at airports is operated by the local
authorities. At seaports, the work is carried out by the Port Medical Officer assisted
by Port Health Inspectors, rodent officers and others; at airports, the Airport
Medical Officer is responsible.
Pure Food
The purity, hygiene and description of food are controlled by legislation now
consolidated for England and Wales in the Food and Drugs Act, 1955, and for
Scotland in the Food and Drugs (Scotland) Act, 1956. In England and Wales the
Act, and regulations made under it are, in general, carried out and enforced by
Food and Drugs Authorities (i.e. county councils, county borough councils and,
generally, the larger borough and urban district councils) in relation to composition,
adulteration and description, and by local authorities (i.e. county borough,
borough, urban district and rural district councils) in relation to purity and
hygiene; the Ministry of Health and the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and
Food are the central Departments responsible for advising and for making regula¬
tions under the Act. Premises where food for sale for human consumption is
prepared, sold or stored are required to conform to certain hygienic standards.
Authorised officers of food and drugs authorities and of local authorities are
empowered to take samples of any food for sale for human consumption, for
analysis or for bacteriological or other examination. Special regulations are in
force for certain foods such as milk, meat and ice-cream.
In Scotland, the local authorities chiefly concerned are the councils of counties
and large burghs; the central Department is the Department of Health for Scotland.
THE NATIONAL HEALTH SERVICE
The National Health Service was established in 1948. The relevant Acts, the
National Health Service Act, 1946, the National Health Service (Scotland) Act,
1947, and the Health Services Act (Northern Ireland), 1948, came into force
simultaneously on 5 th July, 1948.
The National Health Service Act, 1946, aims ‘to promote the establishment in
England and Wales of a comprehensive health service designed to secure improve¬
ment in the physical and mental health of the people of England and Wales and the
prevention, diagnosis and treatment of illness, and for that purpose to provide or
secure the effective provision of services’. The National Health Service (Amend¬
ment) Act, 1949, and the National Health Service Acts, 1951 and 1952, make some
modifications in the scheme for Great Britain and provide for charges to be made
for certain parts of the Service, which is otherwise available free of charge to all
according to medical need, without regard to any insurance qualification.

Health Service Administration in Great Britain
In England and Wales the Minister of Health has direct responsibility for (1) the
provision on a national basis of all hospital and specialist services, (2) the mental
health functions previously in the hands of the Board of Control, except for the
quasi-judicial functions of the Board designed to safeguard the liberty of the
patient,1 (3) the conduct of research work into matters relating to the causation,
prevention, diagnosis or treatment of illness or mental defect, (4) a public health
laboratory service, and (5) a blood transfusion service. He has indirect responsibility
for the general practitioner services and local health authority services. He is
advised by the Central Health Services Council and by standing advisory com¬
mittees on various aspects of the Service.
The hospital and specialist services are administered through Regional Hospital
Boards and Hospital Management Committees or, in the case of teaching hospitals,
by Boards of Governors. The hospitals themselves have been grouped into admini¬
strative units; these consist sometimes of several formerly independent hospitals
and sometimes of one. There are nearly 400 such groups under the control of
hospital management committees, which are in turn under the control of 14 regional
hospital boards. The regions are arranged so that the hospital and specialist services
can conveniently be associated with a university having a school of medicine.
The members of the hospital management committees are appointed by the
regional hospital board. The committees, by their constitution, reflect the com¬
munities concerned, for they usually include not only medical practitioners but
members of local authorities, trade unionists and others. The regional hospital
boards are appointed by the Minister and are similarly constituted. The term of
office is three years, one-third of the board or committee retiring each year but
being eligible for reappointment. The boards of governors of teaching hospitals are
appointed by the Minister, a proportion of the members being nominated by the
teaching faculty of the university, the regional hospital board and the medical staff.
All appointments to hospital management committees, regional hospital boards and
boards of governors are honorary.
Medical and dental schools are not under the control of the Minister; but it is
his responsibility to provide clinical facilities for the training of medical students.
The universities are responsible for the provision of teaching.
The administration of the General Medical, Dental, Pharmaceutical and Optical
Services is in the hands of 138 Executive Councils, each covering the area of a
county or county borough. (In a few cases two areas are combined under one
council.) Each council has an Ophthalmic Services Committee responsible for
administering the Supplementary Ophthalmic Service. Doctors, dentists and phar¬
macists are represented on the Executive Councils and each profession also forms a
local committee. Councils of counties and county boroughs are the 146 local health
authorities in charge of local health services.
1 The functions of the Minister include the supervision of local authorities in the per¬
formance of their duties with regard to persons of unsound mind, the general supervision
of matters relating to mental defectives, and the licensing or other formal approval of
accommodation for mentally ill or defective patients outside the National Health Service.
The Board of Control deals with the admission, discharge and periodic review of mentally
disordered or defective patients and inspects all institutions for their care, whether in or
outside the National Health Service. In Scotland, there is a separate General Board of
Control with functions similar to those of the Board of Control in England and Wales.
The Royal Commission set up in 1954 to inquire into the existing law and administrative
machinery in England and Wales governing the certification and care, other than hospital
care or treatment under the National Health Service Acts, of persons suffering from
mental illness or defect, which reported in May 1957, recommended changes in law and
procedure, including the abolition of the Board of Control.

In Scotland, the Secretary of State for Scotland is the responsible Minister; 31
county councils and 24 town councils of large burghs are the local health authori¬
ties; hospital and specialist services are administered by five Regional Hospital
Boards appointed by the Secretary of State, assisted by 84 Boards of Management
(the equivalent of hospital management committees in England); and there are 25
Executive Councils, each serving the area of one or more local health authorities.
The teaching hospitals in Scotland come under the control of the Regional Hospital
Boards, but special Medical Education Committees consider matters relating to
medical teaching. The Scottish Health Services Council and its Standing Advisory
Committees advise the Secretary of State and keep closely in touch with the Central
Health Services Council on common issues.
The Northern Ireland Health Services are described separately on page 149.
Health Service Finance
Annual expenditure on the National Health Service in the United Kingdom
amounts to about 3^ per cent of total national resources. The greater part of the
cost falls on the Exchequer, to be met from general taxation, and a small part is
met from local rates. Other income is derived from the National Health Service
contribution paid with the National Insurance contribution and from the payments
for those parts of the Service for which charges are made.
To help to limit expenditure without reducing the services offered, it was found
necessary in 1951 and again in 1952 to introduce charges for certain items in the
Service. There is a charge of is. for each item prescribed on a prescription form,
and charges are also made for dentures and spectacles (except children’s spectacles
in standard frames), for elastic hosiery supplied in the family doctor service or
hospital out-patients’ department, for certain appliances supplied to out-patients,
for treatment in the dental service (but not for examination only or for treatment
given to persons under 21 or to nursing or expectant mothers), and for some local
health authority services. Certain exemptions or refunds are made and anyone may
apply to the National Assistance Board for help in meeting any of these charges.
Under the 1946 Act, a limited number of beds may be put aside for hospital patients
wishing for privacy, provided that this accommodation is not needed on medical
grounds for non-paying patients. Charges for these ‘amenity’ beds are fixed under
Regulations. Provision is also made at certain hospitals for patients who wish to
occupy private patients’ accommodation on payment of the whole cost of this
accommodation and treatment. Such patients may make private arrangements for
treatment by a doctor of their own choice.
Hospital medical staffs are either full-time and salaried or part-time; part-time
medical officers are usually paid on a sessional basis and are free to accept private
patients. General medical practitioners in public service are remunerated mainly
by capitation fees according to the number of persons on their lists.
Dentists providing treatment in their own surgeries are paid on a prescribed scale
of fees according to the treatment they have carried out. Pharmacists dispensing
on their own premises are paid on the basis of the prescriptions they dispense.
Doctors and ophthalmic opticians taking part in the Supplementary Ophthalmic
Service are paid prescribed fees for each sight test made; opticians who dispense
spectacles are paid according to the number of pairs supplied.
A committee set up to review the cost of the Health Service found no scope for
recommendations which would either produce new sources of income or reduce
substantially the annual cost of the Service. It found that the real cost of the Service,
144
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
after allowing for rising prices, had increased little during the years 1949-54 while
many of the services provided were substantially expanded and improved.
The General Practitioner Services
The General Practitioner Services cover the medical attention given to individuals
by doctors and dentists of their own choice, from among those enrolled in the
Service. Doctors and dentists normally work at their own surgeries; in a few places
they practise in health centres established under the National Health Service Acts.
Nearly 25,000, or almost all, general medical practitioners (principals and assistants)
in Great Britain take some part in the Service.
Doctors previously in practice were entitled to join the Service at its start in the
place where they were practising. Those now wishing to enter practice have to apply
through their Executive Councils to the central Medical Practices Committee, so
that a better distribution of doctors throughout the country may be facilitated.
The maximum number of patients’ names permitted to be on a family doctor’s list
is normally 3,500; the average number in England and Wales is about 2,200. It is
normally through the patient’s own doctor that access to most other parts of the
Health Service is obtained.
Of about 11,200 dentists in England and Wales available for general practice,
about 10,200 are in the Service, and in Scotland 1,120 dentists (practically all those
in general practice) are in the General Dental Service.
Over 900 ophthalmic medical practitioners and over 7,000 ophthalmic and dis¬
pensing opticians in England and Wales, and 70 ophthalmic medical practitioners
and 900 ophthalmic and dispensing opticians in Scotland, are engaged in the
Supplementary Ophthalmic Service. This service provides for the testing of sight
and provision of spectacles. Cases requiring treatment are dealt with through the
hospital eye sendee. .
Almost all chemists (nearly 16,000 in England and Wales and 2,600 in Scotland)
are taking part in the Service.
Hospital and Specialist Services
The hospital and specialist services include the provision of consultants; hospitals
of all kinds including maternity accommodation, tuberculosis sanatoria, mental
hospitals and institutions for the mentally defective, infectious-disease units, con¬
valescent homes and rehabilitation centres; and all forms of specialised treatment.
In the Service in England and Wales there are nearly 3,000 hospitals (including
teaching hospitals) with nearly 500,000 available beds and a nursing and midwifery
staff of nearly 150,000 full-time and over 38,000 part-time nurses. In Scotland, there
are 400 hospitals with nearly 67,000 beds and some 22,000 full-time and 5,000 part-
time nurses and midwives. A small number of hospitals remain outside the Service
for special reasons. Most of these are run by Religious Orders.
An expanded programme of new hospital building and capital improvements in
existing hospitals, begun in 1956, is proceeding on an ever increasing scale.
Teaching Hospitals
The 26 London teaching hospitals are in fact groups of hospitals, and include
about 100 hospitals, convalescent homes, branches, annexes or treatment centres.
The 10 teaching hospitals elsewhere in England or in Wales cover some 70 hospitals
and other establishments.

Rehabilitation
The importance of rehabilitation as a facet of medical treatment is firmly estab¬
lished and, today, hospital treatment is not limited to the relief of pain, or alleviation
or cure of pathological conditions, but aims at restoring the individual’s functional
capacity without delay. Special rehabilitation facilities are provided, for those
requiring them, in the departments of physical medicine and occupational therapy
at the main hospitals, and in a few special rehabilitation centres which are not
attached to any hospital. The work is carried out under the guidance of the appro¬
priate medical specialist by physiotherapists, remedial gymnasts, occupational
therapists and social workers, working as a team. Experience has shown that efficient
medical rehabilitation reduces the stay in hospital, the incidence of permanent
disability and the period of incapacity for full work. The departments work in close
association with the Disablement Resettlement Service of the Ministry of Labour
and National Service. Rehabilitation methods have been applied with advantage
in the care of the chronic sick, the aged and the handicapped and have enabled
many patients to become self-sufficient or to be discharged from hospital and to
resume an independent life in their own homes.
Blood Transfusion
The National Blood Transfusion Service is administered by the regional hospital
boards under the National Health Service. Each region maintains an organisation
for collecting blood within the region. Voluntary donors, recruited from the public,
give their blood without payment. It is kept in the regional blood bank, or issued
to area blood banks which are maintained at general hospitals in each region.
There are two central laboratories administered by the Medical Research Council
on behalf of the Ministry of Health: the Blood Group Reference Laboratory, which
prepares grouping serum and investigates blood grouping problems referred to it,
and the Blood Products Laboratory, which prepares dried plasma and plasma
fractions.
Medico-Social Work
There are over 1,000 trained almoners working in Britain; the majority work in
hospitals, others in local authority services or elsewhere. The almoner co-operates
with the medical staff in the investigation and treatment of disease by elucidating
and adjusting social and economic factors which contribute to a patient’s disability
or impede his restoration to health. Psychiatric social workers are specially trained
for work in the mental health and child guidance services. They are an invaluable
complement to doctors, not only in mental and mental deficiency hospitals but also
in the local health and education services, in assessing the environmental factors in
mental abnormalities and in helping patients to make the necessary adjustments.
Local Health Services
The Local Health Services administered by the county and county borough
councils (in Scotland, county and large burgh councils) include those for maternity
and child welfare (but not hospitals and maternity homes), domiciliary midwifery,
vaccination and immunisation, health visiting, home nursing, the prevention of
illness and the care and after-care of the sick (including the mentally ill and also the
mentally defective), the provision of domestic help (in such circumstances as sick¬
ness, confinement or old age), the ambulance service (in Scotland, the responsibility
of the Secretary of State), and the establishment and maintenance of local health
centres (in Scotland, the responsibility of the Secretary of State).
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
146
Welfare Centres
Maternity and child welfare centres have been established for many years. These
are part of the advisory and preventive services of the local health authority and
they provide regular supervision by nurses and doctors for expectant and nursing
mothers and young children. Special sessions for test feeding and for remedial
exercises are also arranged at some centres. A special feature of the service is the
education of mothers by means of talks, demonstrations and classes. Practically all
centres are distribution points for the national dried milk and vitamin preparations
provided for expectant mothers and young children which are distributed by local
health authorities (see below). In England and Wales more than 75 per cent of all
babies are taken to the centres.
Maternal Care
According to the advice given by the doctor or midwife and her own preference,
the expectant mother may arrange to have her baby at home or in hospital; in
allocating hospital beds, priority is given to those for whom domiciliary confinement
is inadvisable for medical or obstetric reasons or because of adverse home conditions.
For a home confinement every mother has available to her the services of either a
general practitioner obstetrician or her own family doctor if he is willing to under¬
take her maternity care, besides those of a trained midwife employed in the domici¬
liary service of the local health authority. The doctor carries out certain ante-natal
and post-natal examinations, attends at the confinement if he thinks it necessary,
and gives any other medical care required. The services of a consultant obstetrician
are also available if the doctor seeks his advice. Routine supervision and advice is
provided by the midwife, who visits regularly before the confinement for the
purpose of examination and to give the mother advice and help. In addition, the
expectant mother may attend the ante-natal clinic for instruction in preparation for
motherhood and in some cases for interim ante-natal supervision. The midwife
delivers the patient (unless the doctor considers it necessary to be present) and
continues in attendance for the first 14 days after the birth. Midwives work in close
touch with the welfare centres in the care of the mother both before and after the
birth of the child.
Welfare Foods Service
Local health authorities distribute the welfare foods, other than liquid milk, that
the Welfare Foods Service1 provides for expectant and nursing mothers and young
children at a low cost or free of charge. These foods are National Dried Milk as an
alternative to liquid milk2 and at an equivalent price; orange juice, at 5d. a six-
fluid-ounce bottle, for expectant mothers and children under two; cod liver oil,
free of charge, for expectant mothers and children under five; vitamin A and
D tablets, free of charge for expectant mothers as an alternative to cod liver oil,
and also for mothers for 30 weeks after confinement. These supplies of milk and
orange juice are provided free of charge if the families cannot afford to pay.
1 The Service began as a war-time measure with the National Milk Scheme in i94°> but
in 1946 the Government decided to continue the extended scheme as part of the peace¬
time social services. Beneficiaries now obtain the necessary tokens from the Ministry ot
Pensions and National Insurance.
2 The liquid milk allowance (which is obtained through the usual retail channels) is one
pint a day at 4d. a pint for expectant mothers, children under five years of age, and children
of five years or more but under sixteen years who are physically and mentally handicapped
or who are unable to attend school or an occupation centre (where they would receive milk).
SOCIAL WELFARE
147
Other Maternity and Child Welfare Services
Many local health authorities make special arrangements for premature babies
remaining in their own homes, by lending equipment and appointing experienced
nursing staff to supervise their care.
There are some 550 day nurseries for children under five in Great Britain pro¬
vided by local health authorities or voluntary associations working with them. The
National Health Service Act, 1952, gave local authorities power to make charges
for the use of day nurseries. Private or factory nurseries (of which there are about
460 altogether) must be registered with the local health authorities; this regulation
applies also to persons who mind for payment more than two children, not all of the
same family.
Local authorities co-operate with voluntary denominational and other bodies
caring for unmarried mothers and their babies, or make direct provision for their
special needs through welfare workers, homes, hostels and nurseries, and by finding
suitable foster-mothers.
Health Visiting
Health visitors are State Registered Nurses, with at least six months’ training in
midwifery, who have had special training in health visiting. They are employed by
local health authorities to visit people in their own homes to give advice on the care
of young children, expectant and nursing mothers, persons suffering from illness,
including mental illness, and any injury or disability requiring medical or dental
treatment, and on measures necessary to prevent the spread of infection. Their
duties include health education and attendance at ante-natal and child welfare
clinics. They may also undertake tuberculosis visiting and school nursing.
Home Nursing
The employment of nurses for attending persons who require nursing in their
own homes is the responsibility of the local health authorities. Although many
authorities employ nurses directly for this purpose, others have entered into arrange¬
ments with voluntary organisations to provide a service on their behalf.
Domestic Help
Local health authorities have the power to make arrangements for providing
domestic help in households where it is needed owing to illness, confinement, or
the presence of children, old people or mental defectives. This is not one of the
free services and authorities are authorised to recover from those assisted such
charges as the authorities consider reasonable, having regard to the person’s means.
Ambidance Services
Free conveyance by ambulance between home and hospital or clinic is provided
where necessary, either directly by local health authorities or, on their behalf, by
voluntary organisations. The Hospital Car Service (organised by the St. John
Ambulance Brigade, the British Red Cross Society, and the Women’s Voluntary
Services) provides special transport in many areas for patients who are not stretcher
cases; such patients are conveyed in private cars whose owners volunteer to give
this service, and the authorities make a mileage payment to the volunteers to cover
their expenses. In Scotland, ambulances are run by the Scottish Ambulance
Service (St. Andrew’s Ambulance Association and the Scottish Branch of the
British Red Cross Society) on behalf of the Secretary of State.
Mental Health Services
Persons who are suffering from mental illness can consult the family doctor and
receive specialist advice at hospital out-patient clinics in the ordinary way. If they
j^g BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
need to enter a mental hospital they can do so as voluntary patients with little
formality. If need be, they may be admitted under Order as temporary or certified
patients. If patients, or their relatives, are unable or unwilling to make the necessary
arrangements for admission to a mental hospital, it is the duty of a duly authorised
officer of the local health authority to do so. The local health authority is expected
to offer a welfare service to such patients, whether before admission or to help
their rehabilitation on discharge.
Local health authorities have a duty to ascertain mental defectives in the com¬
munity, to supervise them and to provide, where practicable, suitable training or
occupation. This is given in occupation centres where the defectives attend daily,
as at school, or by home teaching. If supervision affords insufficient protection it
is the duty of officers of the local health authority to take the initial steps to place
such defectives under guardianship within the community or to arrange for their
admission to a mental deficiency hospital.
Prevention of Illness: Care and After-Care
Measures for the prevention of tuberculosis, e.g., the tracing of sources of infec¬
tion, the prevention of its spread, and the removal of the cause of infection, are the
responsibility of all the local health authorities. Facilities for diagnosis and treatment
are the responsibility of the hospital service and are provided through sanatoria
and chest clinics. The chest physicians staffing these clinics are often employed
jointly by the hospital authorities and local health authorities, to ensure that diagnosis
and treatment are properly co-ordinated with prevention and after-care. Among the
duties of these officers are those of making recommendations for residential treat¬
ment, visiting the homes of patients, and examining and advising contacts . They
are assisted in this work by tuberculosis health visitors and nurses. Most local
health authorities have statutory or voluntary tuberculosis care committees.
Mass miniature radiography was introduced in 1943 as a means of early diagnosis
of tuberculosis. About 75 units now operate under the regional hospital boards in
England and Wales, in close co-operation with local health authorities; there are
10 units in Scotland. They examine nearly four million persons a year, concentrating
increasingly on areas with a bad record for tuberculosis, on specially susceptible
groups in the population, and on adults in regular contact with organised groups
of children.
Care and after-care of patients is supplemented by general advice and assistance
given to households in which the patients live. Local health authorities send suitable
patients to the village settlements for tuberculous persons which are run by volun¬
tary bodies or by local health authorities of other areas; and training for employment
is carried out in conjunction with the training and resettlement schemes of the
Ministry of Labour and National Service.
Care and after-care arrangements are made by all local health authorities for other
types of illness, including mental illness or mental defectiveness.
As part of their preventive work, local health authorities give help and advice to
families which may be in difficulties and in danger of breaking up.
A charge may be made for some of these services, if the person wishing to make
use of them can reasonably be expected to contribute towards their cost.
Vaccination and Immunisation
Arrangements for vaccination against smallpox and immunisation against
diphtheria, without charge, as part of the National Health Service, are made by
all local health authorities; in addition, most local health authorities have similar
arrangements for immunisation against whooping cough, and a small number have
SOCIAL WELFARE
I49
authority to provide for immunisation against tetanus. In 1957 there were only 6
deaths from diphtheria in England and Wales, as against 2,641 in 1941, and in
Scotland, none as against 517 in 1941.
Vaccination against poliomyelitis, which was introduced for children in 1956
and made available to some adults in 1957, is being extended in 1958 to all persons
up to the age of 25 years as well as to certain others. BCG vaccination against
tuberculosis is available to certain adults and children.
Health Centres
A few health centres have been established, differing widely in size and character
according to local need. Experience shows that they are likely to be most successful
in areas of housing development where new services are needed. The need to
observe the working of the experimental centres already provided and to conserve
scarce resources is likely to prevent any general expansion of the service in the near
future. In Scotland, the provision of health centres is not the responsibility of local
health authorities but of the Secretary of State for Scotland.
HEALTH SERVICES IN NORTHERN IRELAND
In Northern Ireland the historical development of the health services has taken
broadly the same course as in other parts of the United Kingdom and the Health
Services established under the Health Services Act (Northern Ireland), 1948, corre¬
spond fairly closely to the medical care system established under the National
Health Service in Great Britain. The essential principle is that the same range of
services shall be available to citizens in Northern Ireland as in England, Wales and
Scotland. The Services in Northern Ireland are financed as in the rest of the
United Kingdom.
In hospital administration the role of the central Government is not quite so
immediate or direct as in Great Britain, and hospital property, for example, is vested
not in the Minister of Health and Local Government but in the Northern Ireland
Hospitals Authority. The Hospitals Authority has under its control 64 hospitals
and three special care institutions containing in all about 15,000 beds.
The Tuberculosis Service is on a separate footing from the main Hospital Service,
having been established a little earlier to deal urgently with a serious tuberculosis
problem. The Northern Ireland Tuberculosis Authority, which was constituted for
the prevention of tuberculosis and the care of tuberculous patients by the Public
Health (Tuberculosis) Act (Northern Ireland), 1946, has seven hospitals under its
control.
Vaccination against smallpox is compulsory in Northern Ireland but otherwise
the range of preventive and domiciliary services is similar to that existing in Great
Britain. Domestic help (whole-time or part-time) for aged or handicapped persons
and expectant mothers is provided by county welfare authorities under the Welfare
Services Act (Northern Ireland), 1949.
VOLUNTARY AID FOR THE SICK AND HANDICAPPED
A number of voluntary organisations provide services of various kinds for sick
and handicapped persons in co-operation with, or supplementary to, the provision
made by central and local authorities. Some convalescent homes, for instance, of a
type outside the scope of the hospital service, are administered by such bodies. In
many areas invalid children and others needing care in their own homes are visited
and helped by voluntary organisations. Though the need for material aid from
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
ISO
private sources becomes less as public provision extends, many forms of help to
meet individual needs that would not otherwise be met are given by voluntary
agencies. Their most valuable service is probably to provide personal service and
the continued personal interest that can contribute so much to the welfare of the
sick and infirm. These voluntary agencies usually depend largely on the work,
part-time or full-time, of unpaid volunteers.
A great deal of voluntary help is given to hospitals by voluntary bodies and indi¬
vidual voluntary helpers. More than half the hospitals in England and Wales have
their own Leagues of Friends or similar bodies of voluntary workers who organise
and undertake a variety of services for their hospitals. Many hospitals also have help
from the British Red Cross Society, the Order of St. John, the Women’s Voluntary
Services, or a similar organisation. The operation of canteens for out-patients and
trolley-shops and library services for in-patients, visiting in the wards, receiving
new patients, and mending linen are among the tasks commonly undertaken.
THE MEDICAL, DENTAL AND ALLIED PROFESSIONS
Only persons whose names are on the Medical Register can practise as doctors
under the National Health Service. Apart from medical practitioners, only persons
whose names are on the Dentists’ Register can practise dentistry in Britain. The
minimum qualification for registration as a doctor requires five to seven years’
training in medical school and hospital, plus one year as an intern; for a dentist,
four or more years at a dental school are required. The governing body of the
medical profession is the General Medical Council, first set up in 1858; that of the
dentists is the General Dental Council, which succeeded the Dental Board in 1956.
The minimum period of hospital training required to qualify for State registra¬
tion as a general trained nurse is three years. Training is available also in sick
children’s, mental, and mental deficiency nursing. The qualifying period for enrol¬
ment as an assistant nurse is one year’s practical training followed by one year’s
work under supervision. The governing body of the nursing profession is the
General Nursing Council, set up in 1919. Midwives must be certified by the
Central Midwives Board. Most pupil midwives are already State registered general
nurses or sick children’s nurses; for them the two-year midwifery training period is
reduced to one year.
Only registered pharmaceutical chemists may practise as pharmacists or describe
themselves as such, and qualifications requiring four to five years’ academic study
and practical training are necessary for registration. The Pharmaceutical Society of
Great Britain is the governing body of the profession. Training as an ophthalmic
optician takes three years followed by a year under supervision. Under the
Opticians’ Act, 1958, a General Optical Council will be set up to regulate the
profession and only registered ophthalmic opticians (or registered medical practi¬
tioners) will be allowed to test sight.
For the professions of almoner, chiropodist, dietitian, medical laboratory tech¬
nician, occupational therapist, psychiatric social worker, physiotherapist, radio¬
grapher and speech therapist a good general education is required followed by a
professional training. The length and nature of the training varies according to the
profession, and may be as long as three years.
MEDICAL RESEARCH
The Medical Research Council (see the section on the Promotion of the Sciences
in Chapter VII) is the main governmental organisation engaged in medical research
in Britain. A considerable amount of research is also carried out in the universities
SOCIAL WELFARE
151
and their associated medical schools and teaching hospitals, while the Minister of
Health and the Secretary of State for Scotland, and hospital boards and committees,
are also able to initiate and maintain research within the National Health Service.
The Public Health Laboratory Service, administered by the Medical Research
Council for the Ministry of Health, also undertakes research in addition to its more
routine duties, and this provides an important complement to the work of the
Council.
A valuable contribution to research in particular branches of medicine is made
by private organisations, of which the British Empire Cancer Campaign and the
Nuffield Foundation are the largest. There is close collaboration between the
Medical Research Council and these other organisations to ensure the best alloca¬
tion of their respective resources.
Medical Research Council
The Medical Research Council’s programme of work is carried out both in its
own research establishments and by independent investigators, in the universities
and elsewhere, who receive grants from the Council. The programme includes
fundamental studies of the structure and natural processes of the body; clinical and
laboratory studies of disease; the development and evaluation of special methods
of treatment and also of prophylaxis and diagnosis; and the study of social and
occupational factors affecting health and the efficiency of body and mind.
In planning and carrying out its programme, the Council is assisted by special
advisory committees which it may appoint. One of the more important of these is
the Clinical Research Board, set up in consultation with the Health Departments
to assist the development of clinical research.
The Public Health Laboratory Service
The Public Health Laboratory Service provides a network of bacteriological and
virological laboratories throughout England and Wales to assist in the diagnosis,
prevention and control of epidemic diseases. The largest establishment is the
Central Public Health Laboratory at Colindale, in north-west London, which
includes the National Collection of Type Cultures, the Standards Laboratory for
Serological Reagents, the Food Hygiene Laboratory, and reference laboratories
specialising in the identification of certain infective micro-organisms.
In Scotland and Northern Ireland there is no separate Public Health Laboratory
Service; bacteriological work is mainly done in hospital laboratories.
EDUCATION
There are nearly nine million children and young people in full-time attendance
at schools, universities, training colleges or technical colleges in the United King¬
dom. Over 90 per cent of school children attend publicly provided or aided schools.
The universities are independent, self-governing institutions but are aided from
public funds. Most technical colleges and other centres of further education are
publicly maintained. Many schools and colleges continue to benefit from the endow¬
ments provided by benefactors in past centuries.
The bulk of expenditure on education in the United Kingdom therefore comes
from public funds. It is estimated for 1958-59 that total public expenditure on
education, which is increasing, will be about £805 million. This includes expendi¬
ture on university education. Of public expenditure on education other than in the
universities, at present about 60 per cent comes from taxes and about 40 per cent
from local rates.

j,j2 BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
In England and Wales, the main development of publicly provided primary
education dates from 1870, and that of secondary education from the beginning of
the present century. In 1833 the Government had begun to make annual grants to
the voluntary societies which were providing schools, and the Elementary Educa¬
tion Act of 1870 accepted the principle of compulsory education. By the end of the
nineteenth century, elementary education had become virtually both compulsory
and free. Public provision of secondary education (already begun in Wales) started
in England under the Act of 1902. The Education Act of 1944 now governs public
education in England and Wales. It seeks to widen and improve educational oppor¬
tunities at every stage. .
The Scottish and Northern Ireland educational systems both have long histones
independent of that of education in England, but the same general policy is now
being implemented throughout the United Kingdom, with some national variations.
Educational Administration
Administration of publicly provided education in Britain is divided between the
central Government Departments (the Ministry of Education for England and
Wales, the Scottish Education Department, and the Ministry of Education for
Northern Ireland), local education authorities, and various voluntary organisations.
The relation between these three groups is based on consultation and co-operation,
both by direct contact between the parties and through Her Majesty’s Inspectors
who act as liaison officers, particularly between local education authorities and the
Departments. .
The local education authorities (called education authorities in Scotland) are
responsible for ensuring that adequate provision is made in their areas for the two
stages of school education (primary and secondary), and that those pupils who
would profit by proceeding to a university have the opportunity of doing so. They
are also responsible for the provision of all forms of ‘further education’, i.e. post¬
school education outside the universities.
All schools, including independent schools (which must be registered), are
subject to official inspection.
SCHOOLS
Parents in Britain are required by law to see that their children receive efficient
full-time education, at school or otherwise, between the ages of 5 and 15. In England
and Wales over 6,850,000 children, including about 190,000 under and 262,000 over
compulsory school age, are attending publicly maintained schools, besides 104,000
others (including 1,500 under and nearly 30,000 over school age) who are at schools
receiving direct grants from the Ministry of Education. There are also about half
a million children of all ages at independent schools. In Scotland, 860,000 children
are attending publicly maintained or aided schools and about 22,000 are at indepen¬
dent schools. In Northern Ireland, 260,000 children (including 12,300 under and
12,000 over compulsory school age) are attending publicly maintained or aided
schools; independent schools are few.
In England and in Northern Ireland it is usual for boys and girls to be taught
together in primary schools, but rather more than half the secondary schools are
for boys or girls only. Mixed schools are more common in Wales; and in Scotland
all but a few city schools take both boys and girls.
The majority of independent schools are for boys or for girls only, except in classes
for small children. There are, however, a few schools which are co-educational.
In England and Wales, three kinds of school are supported from public funds:
county schools (the largest group) which are provided and maintained by local
SOCIAL WELFARE
153
education authorities, i.e. their full cost falls on public funds; voluntary schools
which have been provided by a voluntary body (usually of a religious denomination)
but which are maintained by local education authorities; and direct grant schools
which are completely independent of local education authorities but receive a
grant-in-aid from the Ministry of Education. These last (the smallest group) mostly
provide education of the grammar school type; they include some schools of ancient
foundation.
In Scotland, most of the schools supported from public funds are provided by
education authorities and are known as public schools (in England this term is used
for a type of independent school of which there are also a few in Scotland and
Northern Ireland). There are also a few grant-aided schools (some of ancient
foundation) conducted by voluntary managers and receiving grants direct from
the Scottish Education Department.
In Northern Ireland, there are county schools, managed by local education
authorities, and voluntary schools, which are grant-aided schools under voluntary
management.
In England and Wales, no fees are charged to parents of children attending schools
maintained by local education authorities, and books and equipment are supplied
free. Grammar schools receiving grants direct from the Ministry of Education still
charge fees but they are required to offer each year, to pupils who have at any time
previously attended a grant-aided primary school for not less than two years, free
places to the extent of not less than 25 per cent of the previous year’s admission to
the upper school; and a further 25 per cent of the places must be put at the disposal
of the local education authorities if they require them. Pupils occupying these latter
places need not previously have attended a grant-aided primary school. Day pupils
not holding free places are entitled to claim a remission of fees in accordance with
an approved income scale, and the Ministry pays the governors of the school the
amount of the fees so remitted. Local education authorities also pay for some free
places in independent schools, which normally charge fees. A number of indepen¬
dent schools are able to offer some scholarships from endowments.
In Scotland, education authorities may charge fees in certain schools provided
that this does not prejudice the provision of free education for all who desire it.
In Northern Ireland, no fees are charged to parents of children attending any
county or voluntary primary, intermediate or special school; qualified pupils
attending both county and voluntary grammar schools receive scholarships from
the local education authorities which cover the whole or most of the fees charged
by the school.
Primary Schools
A child’s primary education continues until about the age of 11 in England, Wales
and Northern Ireland and 12 in Scotland. There are some nursery schools and classes
for children between 2 and 5 years old. In England and Wales, there are infant schools,
or departments, for all children between 5 and 7 send, junior schools for those aged 7 to
11. In Scotland there are primary departments for children between 5 and 12 years
old.
Secondary Schools
Public provision of secondary education is being greatly extended with the aim
of providing for all children an education suited to their particular abilities.
England, Wales and Northern Ireland
In England and Wales, grammar schools take children who hope to reach a
university and others likely to profit from an academic type of education. A large
Britain: an official handbook
154
proportion of university students are recruited from these schools which, in England
and Wales, are attended by about one secondary school pupil in four. Secondary
modern schools form the largest group of secondary schools. They give a general
education with a practical bias, closely related to the interests and environment of
their pupils. The secondary technical schools are the smallest group and offer an
education largely related to industry, including commerce, or agriculture. Each
local education authority decides how the selection shall be made for its secondary
schools: generally speaking, this selection depends upon an assessment of the child’s
ability as shown in the primary school, often coupled with objective tests taken
at about eleven years of age. There is provision for an appeal to the Minister of
Education in the event of a dispute between a local education authority and a
parent, and almost all authorities reconsider original decisions when subsequent
events prove this to be necessary.
Two types of education may be given in one school a bilateral school, some
authorities are establishing comprehensive schools providing all types of secondary
education. ,
In Northern Ireland, secondary intermediate schools are the equivalent of the
secondary modern schools in England and Wales. Technical intermediate schools in
Northern Ireland offer the same facilities as secondary technical schools in England
and Wales.
Most grammar school pupils remain until they are 16 years old, some until they
are 17, 18 or 19. Most secondary modern pupils at present leave at the age of 15*
but the number staying on until the age of 16 is increasing.
Scotland
Scottish secondary schools fall into two main categories, those providing courses
extending normally to three years, generally called junior secondary schools, and
those providing courses of five or six years, known as senior secondary schools. In
each type of school the courses are intended to provide a general education, but
they are differentiated in character to suit the varying needs and abilities of the
pupils, and include literary, commercial, boys’ technical, domestic and rural courses.
While some schools are purely junior secondary and some purely senior secondary,
there are also a number of schools of the comprehensive type in which all kinds of
courses, both junior secondary and senior secondary, are provided. Many schools
also provide modified courses for pupils of limited ability for whom the normal
courses are too exacting.
Promotion from the primary to the secondary school takes place usually between
the ages of 11J and izb The fitness of pupils to profit from the various types of
secondary course is assessed on the basis of teachers’ estimates of attainment, intelli¬
gence tests, and attainment tests, with due regard to the wishes of the parents. There
is provision for an appeal to the Secretary of State for Scotland in the event of a dis¬
pute between the education authority and the parent and also for the reconsideration
of original allocations where transfer to another course subsequently appears to be
necessary.
Independent Schools
The largest and most important of the independent schools are known in England
as public schools, although not all schools classed as public schools are indepen¬
dent (those which are not are mostly direct-grant schools) and public schools form
only a minority of all independent schools.
The public school is a characteristic English institution which has made a notable
contribution to English education. Many public schools date from the sixteenth
SOCIAL WELFARE
155
century, some are older (e.g., Winchester, founded in 1382, and Eton, founded in
I44°)> and many have some income from endowments. Each is controlled by its
own Board of Governors. Public schools have emphasised the importance of
character-building, and in these schools were developed the prefect system, whereby
day-to-day discipline is largely maintained by the pupils themselves, and the house
system, whereby a school is divided into groups of about 50 pupils, each under the
care of a housemaster. The public school is also characterised by a high staffing
ratio and a high proportion of pupils doing advanced work. A public school is often,
although not necessarily, a boarding school; day boys are also taken at some of these
boarding schools. The usual age of entry to the independent public schools for boys
is 13 and the leaving age about 18. There are some girls’ public schools modelled
to a certain extent on the public schools for boys.
There are also preparatory schools, many of them boarding schools, for boys aged
from about 8 to 13 years most of whom are intending to enter public schools; there
are some similar schools for girls, and a wide range of other day and boarding
schools covering every age group and grade of education and every variety of
educational method. Some of these schools are owned and managed, often under a
trust deed, by independent non-profit-making bodies. Others are privately owned
by proprietors for whom the running of the school provides a living.
Secondary School Examinations
In 1951, the General Certificate of Education superseded the former School
Certificate and Higher Certificate examinations in the secondary schools (State-
aided and independent alike) of England and Wales. This examination, which may
also be taken by candidates not attending school, is conducted at three levels
(ordinary, advanced and scholarship). Most candidates are at least 16 years old on
1 st September of the year of their examination, but a child can sit at an earlier age
at the discretion of the headmaster or headmistress of the school, and many do so.
In Scotland, the courses in senior secondary schools lead to presentation for the
Scottish Leaving Certificate at about the age of 17, although many pupils who are
under 17 take the examination. The certificate, which can be taken only by pupils
in attendance at Scottish schools, is awarded on examinations conducted by the
Scottish Education Department.
In Northern Ireland, the Junior Certificate Examination is taken at about the
age of 15 and the Senior Certificate Examination, which is conducted at two levels,
at about 17 years of age.
Teachers
Teachers are appointed by local education authorities or school governing bodies
or managers. In England and Wales they are not subject to official control on
questions relating to curricula or methods. In Scotland, schemes of work in primary
and secondary departments are subject to the approval of one of Her Majesty’s
Inspectors, and no pupil may be presented for the Scottish Leaving Certificate
examination unless he has followed a course approved by the Scottish Education
Department. In Northern Ireland, the curriculum of each grant-aided school is
subject to the approval of the Ministry, but considerable latitude is afforded both
in the scope of the curriculum and in the methods employed.
In 1957, there was one full-time teacher to 27 pupils in publicly maintained
primary and secondary schools in England and Wales; the figure was 24 for
Scotland and 29 for Northern Ireland. The high birth rate at the end of the second
world war is the chief of several factors in the present need for more teachers.
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
There are 155 teachers’ training colleges in England and Wales. At present, the
usual training course lasts for two years, but there are three-year courses for women
taking housecraft or physical education and the ordinary course is to be extended
to three years in September i960. There are 23 university departments of education
providing a one-year course for graduates. In Scotland, there are four general
colleges, two denominational colleges and a college for women teachers of physical
education. Courses are normally of one year’s duration for graduates or the
equivalent, and of three years for non-graduates. Northern Ireland has two general
teachers’ training colleges, one university training department and three specialist
colleges—one for training teachers of physical education, one for teachers of
domestic science and one for teachers of art. The basic course in the general
training colleges lasts three years. The Education Departments, the universities,
local education authorities and other bodies provide a variety of short courses for
practising teachers.
Teachers from schools in the United Kingdom go to a number of overseas
countries each year under interchange schemes or schemes for temporary overseas
posts. Nearly 100 teachers from the United States and about 5° teachers from
Canada exchange posts for a year with teachers from Britain, and similar exchange
schemes, on a smaller scale, operate between Britain and Australia, New Zealand,
South Africa and the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland. There are also official
schemes operating between Britain and several other European countries for similar
exchanges and for temporary assistants’ posts for language specialists.
There are national salary scales for teachers in schools and other educational
institutions maintained from public funds in England and Wales, in Scotland, and
in Northern Ireland; and these scales influence the salaries paid to teachers in many
independent schools. There are also national superannuation schemes which are
administered by the central Departments.
In England and Wales, agreed salary scales are submitted to the Minister by
joint committees of representatives of local education authorities’ and teachers
associations. The best-known of these committees are the Burnham Committees
dealing with the salaries of teachers in primary and secondary schools and in
establishments of further education.
The Minister can accept or reject (but not modify) the committees’ recommen¬
dations and make the approved scales mandatory on local education authorities.
Broadcasting and Visual Aids
The School Broadcasting Department of the British Broadcasting Corporation
sends out over 50 sound transmissions a week which reach nearly 29,000 schools in
the United Kingdom, over 73 per cent of the possible total. School broadcasting
does not attempt to cover the whole school curriculum, or to replace the teacher,
but to supplement existing work in the schools.
Television broadcasts to schools were begun in 1957 by both the British Broad¬
casting Corporation and the Independent Television Authority. Daily programmes
are received by over 1,500 schools. Other visual aids to education films, film strips,
wall charts, pictures, and models—are being increasingly used in Britain s schools.
Religion in Schools
In England and Wales, all children in county or voluntary schools, that is, all
schools wholly or partly financed by local authorities, receive religious instruction
and take part in a daily corporate act of worship unless their parents object. In
county schools, and in certain circumstances in voluntary schools, religious instruc¬
tion of an undenominational Christian character is given. In all kinds of voluntary
SOCIAL WELFARE
157
school1 there is opportunity for denominational instruction. Over a third of the
schools maintained by local education authorities in England and Wales are volun¬
tary schools and the majority of these are Church of England primary schools.
There are nearly 2,000 Roman Catholic voluntary schools and smaller numbers
belonging to other religious bodies. In county schools in Northern Ireland, clergy
have a right of access to give denominational instruction to children of their per¬
suasion for a limited period each week. In Scotland, subject to safeguards for the
individual conscience, matters relating to religious instruction are in the hands of
the school managers, but there are a number of denominational schools conducted
by education authorities.
Services in the school chapel and religious teaching are an essential part of the
life and education of the independent public schools and most of these schools are
linked to some religious denomination.
Health and Welfare of School Children
Physical education, including games, is in the curriculum of all schools.
The School Health Service provides regular medical examination and certain
free treatment for all children attending schools maintained by local education
authorities. Treatment facilities include dental clinics and child guidance centres.
(There are also child guidance clinics in the National Health Service.) In Northern
Ireland the School Health Service is operated by the health authorities.
Milk (normally one-third of a pint a day) is given free to all children in school
who wish to have it, and the School Meals Service provides a daily dinner at a
subsidised price (remitted where there is need) to nearly half the pupils in county
and voluntary schools. Education authorities have power to provide free transport
for children who live more than a reasonable distance from the schools which they
attend; this distance is defined as two miles for those under eight years (11 years
in Northern Ireland) and three miles for those over eight years.
Special educational treatment, either in special schools or otherwise, is provided
between the ages of five (or less) and 16 for children who require it on account of
any physical or mental handicap, including maladjustment. There are over 800
special schools in the United Kingdom, including hospital schools, day and board¬
ing schools, and boarding homes for handicapped children attending ordinary
schools.
School Building
An extensive building programme for education has been undertaken in Britain
since the end of the second world war. In the early post-war years, schools, together
with factories and houses, were given priority over less essential forms of building.
Many war-damaged schools had to be repaired or rebuilt. Entirely new schools,
both primary and secondary, were needed to provide for the increased number of
school children and their longer school life, and for the many post-war housing
estates and for the new towns; new buildings were also needed to replace or improve
those which, by modern standards, were out of date and ill-equipped. Although
nearly 4,300 new post-war schools had been completed in the United Kingdom by
the end of 1957, and 1,000 more were under construction, much remains to be done.
1 The majority of voluntary schools are either ‘aided* or ‘controlled’ schools. The
controlled school has less independence than the aided school: for example, in the con¬
trolled school, denominational instruction may be given only for two periods a week, and
only to children whose parents desire it. The aided school, however, has financial obliga¬
tions for part of its maintenance, whereas the controlled school has none.
j^g BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Advantage is being taken of this opportunity to raise standards in public educa¬
tional building and to introduce new ideas and methods in the design and construc¬
tion of schools. Education authorities are using both traditional and new methods
of building. Post-war school buildings are light and airy, with an imaginative use
of colour and generous provision of practical rooms and space for outdoor games.
Local education authorities are responsible for providing the schools and other
buildings needed for public education in their areas, but the central Departments
exercise control by approving annual building programmes, framing regulations,
fixing cost limits and approving or rejecting the authorities’ plans; they also offer
guidance to authorities in the form of building bulletins and in other ways.
UNIVERSITIES
There are 16 universities in England, four in Scotland, the University of Wales,
and the Queen’s University of Belfast in Northern Ireland.
The English universities are: Oxford, Cambridge, London, Birmingham, Bristol,
Durham, Exeter, Hull, Leeds, Leicester, Liverpool, Manchester, Nottingham,
Reading, Sheffield and Southampton. There is also the University College of
North Staffordshire, which is empowered to award its own Bachelor of Arts degree.
A new University College of Sussex is under consideration.
The Universities of Oxford and Cambridge date from the twelfth and thirteenth
centuries, and the Scottish Universities of St. Andrews, Glasgow, Aberdeen and
Edinburgh from the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries. All the other universities
were founded in the nineteenth or twentieth centuries.
The Universities of Oxford and Cambridge are each composed of a number of
residential colleges. These colleges are corporate bodies governed by their own
Fellows and distinct from the university. Most of the Fellows of the colleges are
university teachers or officers and the majority of university teachers are also
Fellows of colleges. The universities, as distinct from the colleges, own the main
libraries, laboratories, and other buildings used for teaching and research.
The other universities in Britain are in the main non-residential and most are
non-collegiate. Those which are composed of groups of largely autonomous colleges
are London, with over 20,000 students by far the largest of Britain s universities;
Durham, which includes King’s College, Newcastle upon Tyne; and St. Andrews,
which consists of colleges in St. Andrews itself and in Dundee. The University
of Wales comprises the University Colleges of Aberystwyth, Bangor, Cardiff and
Swansea, and the Welsh National School of Medicine at Cardiff. The Queen’s
University of Belfast recognises Magee University College, Londonderry, for
certain arts courses. ... 1 u •
The Education Departments have no jurisdiction over the universities, and their
relations with them are concerned mainly with the training of school teachers, the
provision of extra-mural education, and the award of scholarships from public
funds. The universities receive aid from the State mainly in the form of direct
grants from the Treasury which, in Great Britain, are made on tne advice of the
University Grants Committee, a committee appointed by the Chancellor of the
Exchequer from persons with experience of university administration and
education. ...
The proportion of university income provided by the Exchequer is increasing
and in 1956-57 was 70 per cent for the United Kingdom. Another 3 per cent was
contributed by local authorities, 11 per cent by fees, and the balance by endowments
and other sources.

159
Students
Admission to the universities is by examination and selection; there is no religious
test and no colour bar. Women are admitted on equal terms with men, but at
Cambridge their numbers are limited by statute (as they were at Oxford until 1957).
The general proportion of men to women students is three to one; at Oxford it is
six to one, and at Cambridge ten to one.
All universities in Britain limit the number of undergraduates; in spite of the
increase in these limits which has taken place since the end of the second world
war, the demand for places continues to be very keen and many candidates are
unable to gain entrance to the university of their first choice.
Scholarships and Other Awards
Scholarships and other awards are now very widely available, for it is the national
educational policy that no able boy or girl shall be prevented by lack of means
from pursuing a university or other advanced course of study. About 75 per cent of
university students in Great Britain are now aided from public or private funds.
The Ministry of Education offers about 2,000 State scholarships annually on open
competition for full-time honours courses at universities and, in addition, it gives
some 1,500 new supplementary grants each year to winners of open scholarships
awarded by the universities and colleges from their own funds. The Ministry
also awards 225 technical State scholarships annually. (These and the ordinary
State scholarships may be held at a technical college instead of a university for
courses of appropriate level.)
Local education authorities in England and Wales make awards to over 13,000
other students each year to enable them to enter a university.
State studentships for postgraduate study in arts subjects are offered annually by
the Ministry of Education; 250 were awarded in the first year, 1957. Postgraduate
awards for scientists and technologists are made by the Department of Scientific
and Industrial Research and the research councils.
In Scotland, the power of awarding bursaries and scholarships is confined in the
main to the education authorities, who in exercising this power are required to
comply with regulations made by the Secretary of State. There are no State scholar¬
ships, but the Secretary of State supplements scholarships at English universities
won in open competition by Scottish students.
University scholarships in Northern Ireland are awarded by the local education
authorities. The Ministry of Education awards State exhibitions. Scholarships
awarded by the universities and State exhibitions may be supplemented by local
education authorities. Postgraduate awards are made by the Ministry of Education.
Studies and Degrees
Courses in arts and science are offered by all universities and, at nearly all
universities, courses are available in one or more applied sciences. At the beginning
of the academic year i957~58, 43 per cent of full-time university students in Great
Britain were taking arts courses and 57 per cent were studying science or technology
(including medicine).
University degree courses generally extend over three or four years; though in
medicine five or six years are required. The first degree of Bachelor (Master in
Scotland) is awarded on the completion of such a course, depending on satisfactory
examination results. In most universities an ‘ordinary’ (or ‘pass’) or an ‘honours’
degree can be taken, although the majority of students take honours courses.
Further study or research is required at the modern universities for the degree of
Master and by all universities for that of Doctor. Actual degree titles vary according
j6o BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
to the practice of each university; some differentiate between the arts and sciences
and some do not. Diplomas and certificates are awarded after shorter courses m
some subjects. , , _ . . „
The tutorial system of individual tuition to supplement the lecture system is a
traditional and valued feature of the Universities of Oxford and Cambridge; it is
now being developed in the other universities and colleges of Britain.
Most members of the academic staffs devote time to research and at all univer¬
sities there are postgraduate students engaged in research. There has been an
expansion particularly of research and study in science and technology in recent
years (see the Science section of Chapter VII).
University Expansion
The universities of Britain are expanding rapidly to meet the greatly increased
demand for university education which will arise during the next decade and also
to meet the need of a modern democracy for a highly educated population and the
particular need, in a technical age, for scientists and technologists.
At the beginning of the academic year 1957-58, there were nearly 95,000 full¬
time students at universities or university colleges in Great Britain, and 2,500 in
Northern Ireland. Although this is an increase of 90 per cent over the pre-war
number, a further increase to about 124,000 by the mid-1960s, with a still norther
10 per cent increase in the latter half of the decade, is planned for Great Britain
alone. About two-thirds of the additional students who are expected to be m t e
universities by about 1965 will be students of science or technology.
An extensive building programme is in progress to provide for the increase in
student numbers. In particular, halls of residence are being built to enable a
higher proportion of students to enjoy the intellectual, social and cultural advantages
of community life, and many new science buildings are needed to provide up-to-
date facilities for the increasing proportion of science students.
A large programme of building for science and technology was begun in the
universities in 1953. The programme includes extensions to the Imperial College
of Science and Technology in the University of London to enable the number of
students to be increased from 1,650 to 3,000 by the end of 1962, major develop¬
ments at Glasgow, Manchester, Birmingham, Leeds and Belfast Universities, and
specialised developments at other universities. In addition to the large sums
required for the expansion of Imperial College, other university buildings of all
kinds to the value of about £4-8 million were begun in 1956, and of £10-4 million in
1957. Authority has been given for building projects to the value of £12 million to
be started in each of the years 1958 and 1959, and of £15 million in each of the
four years 1960-63. These amounts are to be paid from general taxation and
exclude any further sums for building collected by the universities.
FURTHER EDUCATION
Outside the universities there is a great variety of further education, full-time
and part-time, for those of all ages who have left school. Local education authorities
are required to secure such provision either directly or by aiding voluntary bodies
and institutions. Vocational and non-vocational courses at all levels and in all
subjects are available in technical, commercial and art colleges1 and in evening
institutes. These courses may lead to a wide variety of qualifications ranging from
external university degrees and the highest technological awards to craftsman s

161
certificates, or they may offer opportunities for pursuing leisure-time interests. In
the year 1956-57 there were some 67,000 full-time students at the technical and
commercial colleges (excluding art colleges) in Great Britain and nearly 1,100,000
part-time students. An increasing number of young employees, apprentices and
others (449,000 in Great Britain in 1956-57) are released by their employers to
attend technical or general education classes during working hours. Nearly a
million other students attend evening institutes.
Technical and Technological Education
Within the field of further education, facilities for technical and technological
education have been expanded greatly since the second world war and the Govern¬
ment is promoting further development. In 1956, the Government announced a
five-year programme for the expansion of technical colleges designed to provide
for an increase of about half as many again in the number of students completing
advanced courses and to double the numbers released by their employers for part-
time courses during the day. The cost of the programme for buildings and equip¬
ment in the five years from 1956 to 1961 was estimated at nearly £100 million,
comprising £70 million to be spent on buildings and £15 million on equipment in
England and Wales, and £10 million for buildings and £2 million for equipment
in Scotland. The expansion of advanced courses is aided by a special higher rate
of grant from central Government funds, introduced in 1952.
The largest group of students attending technical colleges are young employees
and apprentices who are released by their employers for study, usually on one day
a week, supplemented often by evening study. A wide variety of craft courses is
available for young workers in various trades and occupations leading to appro¬
priate qualifications at the end of a course of three to five years. Courses of a more
professional character which are suitable for technicians or for those who aim
ultimately at membership of a professional institution are also provided, leading to
the National Certificates approved by joint committees representative of the
Education Departments and the appropriate professional body, e.g., the Institution
of Mechanical Engineers. Such courses are normally at two levels, ordinary and
higher. Most courses for the ordinary certificate last three years and students
usually follow them between the ages of 16 and 19. The higher certificate requires
a further two years’ part-time study and is generally considered to reach a level
corresponding to a pass degree in the subject concerned.
Full-time courses are taken by large numbers of younger students who leave
school to enter secretarial or clerical work and also as an introduction to apprentice¬
ship. But the most important group of full-time students are those following
advanced courses leading to an external degree of the University of London, to the
Higher National Diploma (awarded by joint committees in the same way as the
Higher National Certificates) or to the new national qualification, the Diploma in
Technology. The latter award is administered by the National Council for Techno¬
logical Awards, an autonomous body set up by the Minister of Education in 1955.
The diploma is awarded after the successful completion of an approved course in
a technical college and is intended to be equivalent in standard to a university
honours degree.
One form of advanced course which is rapidly gaining favour is the ‘sandwich
course’. This lasts from three to five years and consists of periods usually of three
or six months spent alternately in studying full-time in a technical college and in
gaining practical experience in industry. It is through a major increase in the
number of students following sandwich courses that the technical colleges are
expected to achieve a 50 per cent increase in the output of advanced students.
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
l62
There is a growing demand for courses of postgraduate standard in technical
colleges for students who have already obtained a first degree, a diploma, or a
Higher National Certificate. A wide range of advanced short courses of a very
specialised nature is also offered for senior technical staffs engaged in industry. A
considerable amount of research is also carried on in the technical colleges: the
arrangements vary very widely and frequently take the form of a contract between
the college and a local industrial concern.
Under this system there is great flexibility in the provision of courses. As a result,
young people can start courses at various ages on leaving school and can attain the
highest qualification to which their abilities entitle them.
Technical colleges in England and Wales vary greatly in size, range of subjects,
level of work and type of course. The largest has a total of some 14,000 students on
the roll. The large colleges usually offer a wide range of subjects, covering the
basic technologies and the fundamental sciences. The colleges are organised in five
broad groups:
(1) Local Colleges, providing mainly part-time courses, some (lasting two to
five years) leading directly to craftsman and technician qualifications such
as Ordinary National Certificates and City and Guilds of London Institute
Certificates;
(2) Area Colleges, providing also some advanced courses from two to four
years in duration for students starting at 18 or 19 years of age, and leading
to Higher National Certificates and Diplomas;
(3) Regional Colleges, covering wider areas than the local and area colleges, and
doing a substantial amount of advanced work, including full-time and
sandwich courses;
(4) Colleges of Advanced Technology (eight in number), which concentrate
entirely on advanced work, including postgraduate and research work; and
(5) National Colleges, of which seven have been established to provide advanced
courses for the work of particularly specialised industries. These include
the National Colleges such as those for Rubber Technology and Food
Technology and the National Foundry College; they are managed by
independent bodies with grants direct from the Ministry of Education.
At present, in England and Wales, there are over 340 technical colleges (other
than art colleges) that provide for full-time students, besides some 220 others
which take part-time students only. Over 175 technical colleges provide instruction
in one or more technologies at an advanced level, that is of Higher National
Certificate standard.
Scotland has 16 Central Institutions for further education, of which seven are
technical colleges. Five of these have full-time courses leading to their own diploma
or associateship and, in some, the greater part of the work is full-time. The full-time
courses are of three or four years’ duration and comparable in scope and standard
with university degree courses. There are close ties between the central institutions
and the universities. The central institutions, working on a regional basis, are
supported by some 50 local technical colleges, providing full-time and part-time
day courses, and by evening classes at local centres.
In Northern Ireland, the system of technical education is similar to that in
England and Wales and includes courses leading to national certificates. The
Ministry of Education for Northern Ireland awards junior and senior trade scholar¬
ships to apprentices, to enable them to follow full-time courses of study at the
SOCIAL WELFARE 163
Belfast College of Technology. The junior course lasts five months and the senior
course eight months.
The great majority of technical colleges and other further education establish¬
ments in the United Kingdom are either maintained or aided from public funds.
Tuition fees are therefore moderate, and often nominal for young people under
18 years of age. Many full-time students are helped by awards from local education
authorities. The awards are generally based on the results of the General Certificate
of Education or a corresponding examination; they are assessed to cover tuition
fees and a maintenance grant, but parents who can afford to contribute towards
the cost are required to do so. There are also some scholarships available from
endowments, and others are provided under schemes organised by particular
industries or companies for the most promising of their young workers. In England
and Wales, State scholarships (see p. 159) are available for advanced technological
courses.
Adult Education
The extra-mural departments of the universities, the Workers’ Educational
Association and a few other voluntary bodies organise cultural, non-vocational
courses for adults. These courses are grant-aided from public funds, and some
158,000 students in England and Wales attended them in the year 1956-57.
Voluntary bodies with a particular view-point, such as the National Council of
Labour Colleges and the Co-operative Union, also organise adult education courses
without grant-aid. Six residential colleges (five in England and Wales and one in
Scotland) directly aided by the Education Departments provide one-year or two-
year cultural, non-vocational courses for adult students. In addition, there are
about 30 other residential colleges where students can take short courses of a
similar kind lasting for a few days or a few weeks. Most of these latter colleges are
maintained or aided by local education authorities.
I he National Institute of Adult Education provides in London a centre of
information and research for adult education, as well as a channel of co-operation
and consultation for the many organisations in England and Wales which are
interested in the subject. It is assisted by a grant from the Ministry of Education.
1 he Scottish Institute of Adult Education performs similar functions in Edinburgh.
Local education authorities can provide community centres for urban areas; these
centres normally supply facilities for both vocational and non-vocational classes
for the further education of young people and adults. The centres are usually
managed by Community Associations, many of which are affiliated to the National
Federation of Community Associations. Similar classes in rural areas are provided
in village halls and a variety of other premises by local education authorities and
voluntary bodies.
OVERSEAS STUDENTS IN BRITAIN
Opportunities for students from overseas to come to Britain to study in univer¬
sities or other educational institutions, or to obtain specialised training in industry
or elsewhere, have greatly expanded since the second world war. There are some
35,000 overseas students in Britain, of whom about one-third are at universities,
another third at technical colleges, and the remainder training for the law, in
industry, or at hospitals as doctors or nurses. In the year 1957-58, Britain’s
universities contained 7,000 students from Commonwealth countries overseas and
164
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
nearly 4,000 students from foreign countries. About 200 British Council1 scholar¬
ships tenable usually for one year in the United Kingdom, are awarded annually
to graduates of overseas universities. Twelve Marshall Scholarships for university
study in Britain are offered annually by the United Kingdom Government to
graduates from the United States of America, and the universities and colleges
themselves offer many scholarships for which graduate students of any nationality
^ utilities and other educational institutions in the United Kingdom annually
reserve a proportion of their places for students from the United Kingdom
dependences. At the end of i957, there were 9,923 students from United Kingdom
dependencies studying in the United Kingdom, many of them at universities Of
this number, 1,298 held scholarships. The chief sources of grante are f^ds set
aside by Colonial Governments (sometimes supplemented by United Kingdom
Colonial Development and Welfare funds) and funds provided by public boards
and corporations in the territories. , . , , , . , , _ ,
A wide range of public and private fellowships and scholarships for advanced
study in Britain are awarded annually to members of Commonwealth countries
overseas. Under the Athlone Fellowship Scheme the United Kingdom Govern¬
ment has from 1951 awarded 38 fellowships a year to engineering graduates in
Canada for up to two years’ further study, training or research in institutions or
m Under the United Nations Programmes of Technical Assistance, 500 holders of
fellowship awards came to Britain in i957 for study or training a larger number
than were received in any other country. Similarly, under the Technical Co¬
operation Scheme of the Colombo Plan for Economic Devdopment in South and
South-East Asia, between 300 and 400 trainees annually come to Britain
industrial training or postgraduate research, for specialised instruction or for study
V1 Underthc^aghdad Pact, about 30 fellowship holders a year, mainly in medicine
or Veterinary science, come’to Britain; and under the British Technical Assistance
Programme for Yugoslavia, 150 trainees will come to Britain over a period o
eighteen months.
Arrangements for Overseas Students
Students from overseas are given many opportunities to get to kn™ m°rf 01
Britain in their leisure time and to make friends with Bntish people. The Brit
Council offers a wide range of interesting and instructive activities. The Couned
has overseas students' centres in London and in other
provide a varied programme of lectures, discussions and °*er activ .

arranges introductions. In the vacations, there are courses in many parts of the
United Kingdom which provide excellent opportunities for getting to know more
about British life in town and country. In term time there are visits to various
places of interest, and theatre and concert parties are arranged. The British Council
assists many students to find accommodation, particularly those from the United
Kingdom dependencies and from a number of other Commonwealth and foreign
countries. They are met on arrival and helped to settle down quickly in their new
environment.
Among many voluntary organisations which offer a welcome to overseas students
are the East and West Friendship Council, Rotary, Round Table, the Victoria
League, the Over-Seas League, the Royal Commonwealth Society, the National
Union of Students, and churches of all denominations. In some London boroughs
there are committees which help students to make contact with local residents and
organisations.
YOUTH SERVICES
The object of the youth services in Britain is to provide for the leisure-time
activities of young people and to offer them opportunities—complementary to
those of home, formal education and work—for discovering and developing their
personal resources, so that they may be better equipped to be responsible members
of a free and civilised society. There is no regimentation of young people; they are
free to join any of the youth organisations, or none, and the aim is that the facilities
for recreation, educational pursuits and social contacts offered should be sufficiently
varied to appeal to every type of boy and girl.
Responsibility for youth services is shared by the Education Departments, local
education authorities and numerous voluntary organisations. There is no attempt
to impose uniformity or to create anything in the nature of a national youth move¬
ment. Youth groups, the oldest-established of which have been active for over a
century, have been developed and financed mainly by voluntary effort. Some of
them now receive aid from public funds but all retain their independence of action.
The practice of democratic self-government has an established place in most youth
organisations and service to the community is encouraged. Over two million young
people under 21 years of age are members of voluntary youth organisations in
Britain.
Many of the youth organisations formed during the nineteenth century are
religious in origin and purpose; for example, the Young Men's Christian Association
(1844), the Young Women's Christian Association (1855), the Girls' Friendly Society
(i875)> the Boys' Brigade (1883), and the Church Lads' Brigade (1891). Later
organisations, such as the Boy Scouts and Girl Guides Associations, which, as move¬
ments, have no definite affiliation to a religious body although local groups are often
attached to a church or chapel, also recognise the importance of spiritual values in
the formation of character and seek to inculcate high ideals of personal conduct
and of service to others.
Local education authorities have been indirectly concerned with youth services
since 1918, and in 1939 the then Board of Education decided to give active en¬
couragement to youth welfare. The Board urged local education authorities to
stimulate the provision of leisure activities for young people, both by co-operating
with voluntary agencies and by establishing Youth Centres and other recreational
facilities of their own. The status of youth services as an essential part of the
educational system, thus recognised in 1939, was confirmed by the Education Act
of 1944 and the Education (Scotland) Act of 1945.
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
166
All local education authorities are required to ensure that adequate facilities for
the recreational and social needs of young people exist in their areas. In areas where
voluntary youth organisations are well established, local education authorities co¬
operate with them, for example, by making grants, by offering the use of premises
and playing fields, by lending equipment, and by employing youth organisers to
help in the development of local youth work; and where existing services are
inadequate, the authorities make provision themselves (usually in the form of youth
centres and clubs). Most local education authorities have also appointed local youth
committees or councils, on which official and voluntary bodies are represented.
In Northern Ireland, in accordance with strong local tradition, youth work is
carried out mainly by voluntary organisations, which are eligible to receive financial
assistance by way of direct grant from the Ministry of Education for Northern
Ireland under the Youth Welfare, Physical Training and Recreation Acts (Northern
Ireland), 1938-47. In practice, most of the necessary funds for the support of these
organisations are found from voluntary sources. The substantial contribution of
the local authorities under these Acts is made mainly in the provision of playing
fields, swimming baths and other facilities. In addition, the local education authori¬
ties provide further education facilities, under the Education Acts (Northern
Ireland), 1947-56, which in some respects approximate to the work of the voluntary
organisations.
Twenty-four of the largest voluntary youth organisations, each with an adolescent
membership in England and Wales of at least 10,000, belong to the Standing
Conference of National Voluntary Youth Organisations. The Conference, with which
other, smaller, youth groups are associated, was founded in 1936 as a consultative
body which takes action only in the name of its constituent members and with their
consent. Its member organisations have a common aim in the development of
character through educational and recreational interests, and in the promotion of
the physical, mental and spiritual training of their members. Scotland and Northern
Ireland have separate Standing Conferences, and there is a Regional Standing
Conference for Wales.
In addition, each of the leading political parties maintains a junior organisation;
and there are a number of bodies which, although not specifically youth organisa¬
tions, promote the welfare of young people by providing them with opportunities
for physical training, holidays, camping and travel.
Contacts with youth movements in other countries are promoted by the World
Assembly of Youth (WAY), which was founded in 1949, following a youth con¬
ference held in London in the previous year. The British National Committee of
WAY includes representatives of most of the leading youth organisations in the
United Kingdom.
Finance for youth work is provided by voluntary subscriptions from members of
youth organisations and others, by the money-raising efforts of members, by con¬
tributions from local education authorities and direct grants from the Education
Departments, and by grants from charitable trusts such as King George’s Jubilee
Trust and the King George VI Foundation.
The local education authorities finance youth work under their direct control and
also assist the local clubs and branches of voluntary youth organisations. For their
expenditure on this work they receive grant-aid from the Education Departments.
Direct grants are made by the Education Departments to some national voluntary
youth organisations towards the cost of headquarters administration and training
and towards capital expenditure incurred by local branches.
Since its inauguration in 1935, King George’s Jubilee Trust has contributed
over £1 million for youth work, and the King George VI Foundation (created in
SOCIAL WELFARE
167
JQSS) has allocated a similar sum to finance three schemes for the provision of
youth leadership training courses, national recreation centres and youth hostels.
In addition, the Foundation undertook in 1955 to provide £50,000 to finance the
five-year experimental period of a nation-wide scheme, the Duke of Edinburgh’s
Award, designed to encourage young people to attain high standards of achievement
in various spheres of endeavour, and to develop their fitness, initiative and
determination.
Some Voluntary Youth Organisations
The following examples are selected to illustrate the variety and wide scope of
the services and activities provided by voluntary organisations in Britain concerned
with the welfare of young people in their leisure hours. Among the other numerous
voluntary youth organisations are the Catholic Young Men’s Society, the Methodist
Association of Youth Clubs and other religious groups, the Co-operative Youth
Movement, and the Welsh League of Youth.
Scouts and Guides
The Boy Scouts Association and the Girl Guides Association, which were founded
by Lord Baden-Powell in 1908 and 1910 respectively, aim to develop character and
good citizenship in boys and girls by training them in habits of observation, self-
reliance, self-discipline, loyalty and consideration for others, and by promoting
physical fitness and a knowledge of useful crafts. Both associations have world¬
wide affiliations, and are undenominational and non-political in character.
In March 1958, there were 260,000 Boy Scouts (aged 11 to 15 years), Senior
Scouts (15 to 18) and Rovers (over 17! years) in the United Kingdom. This total
includes Sea Scouts and Air Scouts. There were also 247,000 Wolf Cubs (aged
8 to 11 years). At the end of 1957 there were 238,000 Girl Guides in the United
Kingdom, including Cadets and Land, Sea and Air Rangers (aged 15 to 21 years).
There were also 248,000 Brownies (aged 7i to 11 years).
■*
Other Uniformed Organisations
The Boys’ Brigade, founded in 1883, is essentially a Protestant religious organi¬
sation. Every company is attached to a church, and regular attendance at church
is a vital principle. Companies have frequent drill parades, there are club rooms
for games and other pastimes, and summer camps are held.
The Church Lads’ Brigade, founded in 1891, is a similar organisation attached to
the Anglican Church. Companies are formed in parishes under the direct control
of the incumbent. Summer camps are a special feature of the Brigade.
The Girls’ Life Brigade, founded in 1902, is an inter-denominational organisa¬
tion. Each company is connected with a church or other religious body.
The National Association of Training Corps for Girls comprises the Girls’ Train¬
ing Corps, the Girls’ Nautical Training Corps and the Women’s Junior Air Corps.
Each constituent corps, besides its special activities, gives a basic training in
physical education, health and hygiene, craftsmanship and public affairs. Cadets
are trained for responsibility through personal service.
National Associations of Clubs
The National Association of Boys’ Clubs and the National Association of Mixed
Clubs and Girls’ Clubs provide recreational facilities for young people designed to
develop their mental, physical and spiritual well-being. Discussion groups, handi¬
crafts, drama, music and many other activities are encouraged.

Pre-Service Organisations
Pre-Service organisations, which comprise the Sea Cadet Corps, the Army Cadet
Force, the Combined Cadet Force and the Air Training Corps (see pp. 116, 119 and
122), have special connections with the respective Service Departments and receive
financial grants from them. The training of boys for entry into the armed forces
provided by these organisations is linked with training to promote their social,
educational and physical development.
Young Farmers' Clubs
The National Federation of Young Farmers' Clubs (see also the Agriculture
section of Chapter IX) instructs its members in agricultural subjects and rural
crafts, and each club has the support of an advisory committee on which local
farmers are represented.
Youth Sections of Adult Organisations
Youth Sections are maintained by several adult voluntary organisations which
have a particular function; for example, the British Red Cross Society and the
St. John Ambulance Brigade train their young members in first aid and home¬
nursing.
Political Party Youth Groups
Youth groups which are junior branches of the political parties in the United
Kingdom are maintained by each of the leading parties to stimulate interest in
politics, to spread knowledge of party policy among young people, and to obtain
party recruits. Members are encouraged to form debating societies and to engage in
other social activities, and they are trained to take an active part in party politics.
These groups receive no aid from public funds.
Other Bodies Concerned with Youth Work
Outward Bound Trust
The Outward Bound Trust, founded in 1946, maintains mountain schools at
Eskdale and at Ullswater, in the Lake District, and sea schools at Aberdovey, in
North Wales, and at Burghead, Morayshire, in Scotland. In these schools it provides
four-week character-building courses for boys, mainly young employees of industrial
firms sent at their employers’ expense. The boys live as a community and are given
the opportunity to assess and develop their qualities of courage, endurance,
initiative and self-discipline in learning the techniques of sailing or of rock-
climbing, by various physical tests, and in expeditions over rough hill country
lasting several days. Similar, but modified, courses are held for girls.
Youth Hostels Associations
The Youth Hostels Association (YHA), which was founded in 1930, seeks to
promote a greater knowledge of, and love for, the countryside. It caters for young
people of limited means by providing hostels where they can stay for a small charge
when on walking or cycling tours or canoe trips. In i957> the YHA in England and
Wales had a membership of 190,000; it maintains about 270 hostels in England
and Wales. The Scottish YHA has 33,600 members and about 90 hostels, and the
Northern Ireland Association, 4,100 members and 16 hostels. The YHA is linked
closely with similar organisations in other countries and, through its International
Travel Bureau, it encourages and facilitates the exchange of visits.
SOCIAL WELFARE
169
The Central Council of Physical Recreation
The Central Council of Physical Recreation, on which the leading voluntary
youth organisations are represented and from which they receive practical and
advisory services, is grant-aided by the Ministry of Education, by the corresponding
Department in Northern Ireland, and by the King George VI Foundation. It was
established in 1935 to improve the physical and mental health of the community
through physical recreation. The Central Council arranges training courses and
provides instructors in games and athletics for young people and adults who wish
to learn new forms of physical recreation or to improve their standards under
expert tuition, and it plans and judges athletic competitions and organises demon¬
strations of sport and physical training. It also arranges training holidays for young
people in its three National Recreation Centres. The corresponding body in
Scotland, the Scottish Council of Physical Recreation, which is grant-aided by the
Scottish Education Department, maintains the Scottish Centre of Outdoor Training
and also a National Recreation Centre, which was established with funds provided
by the King George VI Foundation.
The National Playing Fields Association
The National Playing Fields Association is a central organisation, founded in
1925, with 54. affiliated county and city associations throughout England and Wales,
and branches covering Scotland and Northern Ireland. The Association encourages
the provision and preservation of public playing fields and playgrounds for the
present and future needs of all sections of the community and advises local authori¬
ties and sports organisations on the acquisition, layout, construction and use of
grounds. It also keeps a watch on all matters relating to playing fields, endeavours
to stimulate recreational activity by grants, publications and persuasion, carries out
technical research and pioneers new ideas. The Association has spent over £1 million
since its inception in providing public playing fields and playgrounds. It also
provides an information service for Commonwealth countries overseas.
V. HOUSING AND
PLANNING
PROBLEMS AND ADMINISTRATION
Britain is a small country with a large population, and a population moreover
which has increased sevenfold in the last two and a half centuries. This increase
has been accompanied by rapid industrial expansion. In consequence, the problems
of planning, in town and country alike, spring mainly from the intensity of com¬
peting demands for land and from the unplanned concentration of most of the
population in a few very large industrial areas. Similarly, the problems of housing
in large part reflect the attraction of population into industrial areas, and also the
poor quality of much of the housing erected in the nineteenth century, now in
course of replacement.
Ministerial Responsibility for Housing and Planning
The Minister of Housing and Local Government is responsible in England and
Wales for formulating housing policy, for housing standards and for general super¬
vision of the housing programme. In planning, the Minister is responsible for
implementing general policy regarding the use and development of land throughout
England and Wales, and for the direction and guidance of local planning authorities,
the New Towns Development Corporations and the National Parks Commission
in the carrying out of their planning functions.
The Secretary of State for Scotland has similar responsibilities in Scotland.
In Northern Ireland, the Minister of Health and Local Government is responsible
for housing and planning. . .
The Ministry of Works acts as production authority in Great Britain for the
building industry. The Agricultural Departments are responsible for advising on
the agricultural value of land proposed for housing or other development. The
Board of Trade is responsible for regulating the distribution of industrial develop¬
ment. An Inter-Departmental Committee on Services’ Land Requirements meets
to harmonise Service and civilian needs and proposals for land use.
HOUSING
While responsibility for housing policy and for the general execution of the
housing programme rests with the Minister (see above), local authorities have
executive responsibilities (as set out below) for housing in their areas.
HOUSING AUTHORITIES
In England and Wales and Northern Ireland, the local housing authorities are the
councils of county boroughs, boroughs (including metropolitan boroughs), urban
districts and rural districts, the London County Council and the Common Council
of the City of London. In Scotland, all town and county councils are housing
authorities.
170
HOUSING AND PLANNING
171
Housing Powers and Duties of Local Authorities
The local housing authorities are responsible for ensuring as far as possible that
housing conditions in their areas are satisfactory. They are empowered to provide
housing accommodation themselves by erecting houses on land acquired by them,
by acquisition of suitable houses, or by the conversion of existing buildings; and
they are responsible for ensuring that unfit houses are demolished or closed.
Scottish Special Housing Association
The Scottish Special Housing Association, a statutory body, assists local authori¬
ties in their housing programmes. It has built about one in eight of the permanent
post-war houses completed in Scotland. The Association is financed entirely from
Government funds and is under the general direction of the Secretary of State for
Scotland.
Northern Ireland Housing Trust
The Northern Ireland Housing Trust, a statutory body, was established in 1945
for the purpose of erecting houses for letting to supplement the activities of local
authorities. The Trust has built about a quarter of Northern Ireland’s post-war
houses.
PROGRESS AND POLICY
There are in all about is| million houses in the United Kingdom: 13^ million in
England and Wales, million in Scotland, and nearly half a million in Northern
Ireland.
Housebuilding was restarted after the second world war early in 1945. By
mid-1958, three million new permanent houses had been built in the United
Kingdom since the war, besides nearly 160,000 temporary houses (some of which
have now been replaced). Many other means have been employed to rehouse the
families needing homes, including repair and reconditioning of war-damaged and
other dilapidated property and the adaptation and conversion of old houses.
When the most pressing needs for additional accommodation had been met, the
local housing authorities were, in 1954, required to prepare proposals for dealing
with houses unfit for human habitation, in order to hasten slum clearance; and it
is on slum clearance that the main emphasis in local authority housing is now laid.
During 1956 and 1957 over 100,000 unfit dwellings in Great Britain were de¬
molished or closed pending demolition. A similar campaign was launched in
Northern Ireland at the end of 1956.
New Building
The agencies for building houses in Britain are local authorities, private builders,
New Towns Development Corporations, certain Government Departments which
need to house the families of the armed forces or other services, and housing
associations (which are non-profit-making bodies providing houses mostly for
letting rather than for sale).
Local authorities (that is, for the most part, private builders under contract to
local authorities) have built nearly three-quarters of the permanent houses com¬
pleted since the second world war. In the first post-war period, when resources
were very limited and the demand for houses urgent and widespread, local authori¬
ties were made responsible for the greater part of the programme. Since the
beginning of 1952, private enterprise has been able to build an increasing propor¬
tion of the new houses; the restrictions on private building imposed by the post-war
licensing system were finally abolished in November 1954.
I72 BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
In 1957 268,653 new houses were completed in England and Wales, 32,437 in
Scotland, and 6,500 in Northern Ireland. Of the United Kingdom total of 307,590,
55 per cent were built by housing authorities and New Towns Development
Corporations, 42 per cent by private builders, and the remainder by Government
Departments and voluntary housing associations.
Local authority houses are normally built for letting, and privately built houses
for owner-occupation. In England, Wales and Scotland, local authority houses may
be sold on certain conditions, with the consent of the Minister, to occupying tenants
or to persons in need of a house for their own use. . . .
The central Departments have issued manuals of guidance for local authorities
setting standards of space, structure, design and equipment for different types of
houses, and describing how estates can be laid out attractively while saving land
and money, by the use of new and improved types of layout.
Slum Clearance
Because of the need to concentrate on providing new houses for families without
a separate home of their own, slum clearance was virtually in abeyance for some
years after the end of the second world war, and the number of houses demolished
was relatively small. With the increase in the number of new houses it became
possible, however, to resume the campaign of slum clearance which the war had
interrupted. ,
Returns made by local housing authorities in 1955 indicated that there were about
one million slum dwellings in Great Britain which ought to be cleared. In England
and Wales, about 850,000, or 6-5 per cent of all houses, were estimated to be unfit
for habitation. In Scotland, over 150,000 houses (about 10 per cent of all houses)
were estimated to be unfit and due for demolition.
During 1956, local authorities in England and Wales demolished 35,000 unfit
houses, involving 108,000 occupants. During 1957, 44,000 houses were demolished,
involving 148,000 occupants—an increase of 26 per cent and 37 per cent respectively
over the previous year. In Scotland, the total figure of houses demolished or closed
during the two years was 21,000.
At the present rate of progress, many local authorities will have completed their
programmes by the end of i960 or soon after; in some of the larger industrial
towns, however, where there are a great number of small, obsolete dwellings, mostly
dating from the nineteenth century, completion will necessarily take much longer.
To help in those areas where the number of slum houses is so large that it would
not be practicable to replace all of them within the next few years, local authorities
are empowered to acquire houses unfit for human habitation and to repair them in
order that they may be occupied for a strictly limited period pending their demoli¬
tion. The intention is that these houses should be demolished as early as possible:
temporary repairs are not intended as an alternative to slum clearance. Exchequer
contributions are available to meet part of the costs of acquisition and essential
repairs.
Housing authorities are under a statutory obligation to see that other accommo¬
dation exists or can be provided by them for persons to be displaced from slum
clearance areas. Compensation is not payable for the demolition of a house unfit
for human habitation, but, in England and Wales, owner-occupiers and business
occupiers may, in certain circumstances, receive payments to alleviate hardship.
Payments are also awarded, where appropriate, in recognition of good maintenance.
Hardship payments are not provided in Scotland, where the basis of compensation
for unfit houses is different, but payments in recognition of good maintenance are
available as in England and Wales.
HOUSING AND PLANNING 173
An Exchequer subsidy is payable to the local authority for every dwelling built to
rehouse a family displaced from an unfit house.
Preservation of Old Houses of Distinction
Special consideration is given to safeguarding old houses of charm and distinction.
As a result of a national survey, all those of outstanding merit are listed and pro¬
tected from demolition; although, where their condition makes it necessary, they
may be closed and no longer used for habitation. Certain other buildings possessing
a degree of architectural or artistic merit, though not qualifying for inclusion on the
national list, have been saved from demolition by works of repair and reconstruc¬
tion undertaken as a result of local efforts.
HOUSING FINANCE
The average 3-bedroom house built by a local authority in England and Wales in
1957 had a superficial area of about 908 square feet and cost about £1,486 to build.
Trends affecting the cost of building in recent years have been a reduction in size
due to the adoption of space-saving designs, and improved productivity to which
the greater use of mechanical plant and better organisation and management have
contributed. These factors have helped to offset increases in wages and cost of
materials.
The initial capital cost of houses built by or for local authorities is met by raising
loans; current expenditure, including loan repayment and interest on loans, is met
from rents, rates and, where available, subsidies. Local authorities may raise loans
for housing either in the open market or by borrowing from the Public Works Loan
Board.
Funds for private enterprise housing are obtained in the main by borrowing. The
chief agencies concerned in lending money are the building societies, insurance
companies, industrial and provident societies, and local authorities.
Subsidies
blousing subsidies, at varying rates and for varying purposes, have been provided
in Britain since 1919. After the second world war, high rates of subsidy, payable
annually for 60 years, were provided for all new local authority houses. In England
and Wales, a standard rate of subsidy was paid for ordinary flats or houses built to
meet general needs, and special rates of subsidy were provided for special types of
housing (e.g., high blocks of flats and blocks of flats built on expensive sites),
houses built for special purposes (e.g., for the agricultural population) and houses
in special areas (e.g., poor areas of low rate-paying capacity).
The Housing Subsidies Act, 1956, continued the subsidies on these three special
categories of housing but it initiated a change of policy. It provided a higher rate of
subsidy (£24 a house a year) for houses built to relieve congestion in overcrowded
areas, houses built by New Towns Development Corporations and houses built
to meet the urgent needs of industry, while continuing at the same rate as before
(£22 is. a house a year) the subsidy on houses built to replace slums; but it reduced,
and provided for the abolition of, the standard subsidy on new dwellings built for
general needs. This was reduced to £10 a house a year and it was abolished as from
November 1956, except in respect of one-bedroom dwellings as an encouragement
to the provision of accommodation for elderly and single persons.
For those flats still eligible for subsidy, higher rates are payable for blocks of four
or more storeys. There is also a subsidy for residential hostels built by local
authorities or by certain other bodies. The Housing (Financial Provisions) Act,
1958, consolidates the legislation on housing subsidies in England and Wales.
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
174
Housing subsidies are separately provided for in Scotland and Northern Ireland
where the amounts are generally higher on account of the different circumstances.
Subsidy rates in Scotland were revised under the Housing and Town Development
(Scotland) Act, 1957. These include a subsidy of £24 a house a year for housing
to meet general needs, with higher rates of subsidy for special needs, particularly
houses built to meet the urgent needs of industry and to relieve congestion in
overcrowded areas. In Northern Ireland, annual subsidies are paid for 60 years to
local authorities, the Northern Ireland Housing Trust and housing associations.
The Housing Subsidy Order (Northern Ireland), 1956, altered the basis on which
subsidy is paid, and prescribed a subsidy higher than the standard rate in respect
of houses for persons displaced from slum houses. In addition ‘lump sum’ subsidies
are paid to private persons who build houses for letting or for owner-occupation.
Under the Housing on Farms Act (Northern Ireland), 1950, grants are available
for the provision of new houses and for the reconditioning of existing premises to
accommodate farmers and approved workers.
The cost of housing subsidies in the United Kingdom for the calendar year 1957
was £111 million (£80 million paid by the central Government and £31 million
paid by local authorities).
House Purchase Schemes
Loans to enable persons to buy their houses by a system of instalment purchase
are provided by many local authorities as well as by building societies, certain
insurance companies and other financial institutions.
Many local authorities also operate a scheme whereby, for a house costing up to
£2,500, they guarantee part of the loan made by a building society so that an
advance greater than normal (up to 95 Per cent °f the value of the house in some
cases) may be made to the purchaser. The Exchequer undertakes to share any
liability local authorities may incur under this scheme.
Improvement Grants
The Housing Act, 1949, provides Exchequer assistance for the improvement of
existing housing or adaptation of buildings for housing by local authorities or
private owners in England and Wales. Grants can be made by local authorities, with
Exchequer assistance, to persons converting or improving existing buildings for
housing at a cost of over £100 a dwelling. T he grants may amount to half the cost,
with a maximum grant of £400. There are certain technical conditions which the
dwellings as improved or converted must satisfy to ensure that public money is only
spent on property that will provide satisfactory accommodation for a sufficiently
long period. The Housing Repairs and Rents Act, 1954, considerably eased the
conditions attaching to these grants. Similar provisions apply in Scotland and are
contained in the Housing (Scotland) Act, I950> and the Housing (Repairs and
Rents) (Scotland) Act, 1954. In Northern Ireland, the scheme is operated under
the provisions of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) and Rent Restriction Law
(Amendment) Act (Northern Ireland), 1956.
Rent Control
The majority of the privately owned houses in Great Britain which are let are
subject to rent control. Houses owned by local authorities, New Towns Develop¬
ment Corporations, housing associations, and the Scottish Special Housing
Association are, in general, free from control, as are new houses completed since
30th August, 1954.
HOUSING AND PLANNING
175
In the autumn of 1956, the Government adopted a policy of progressive abolition
of rent control on the grounds that the existing system led to deterioration and
wasteful use of the nation’s stock of housing accommodation.
d he first Rent Restrictions Act was passed in 1915. The main Acts now in force,
either wholly or in part, are the Rent and Mortgage Interest Restrictions Acts,
1920 to 1939, the Landlord and Tenant (Rent Control) Act, 1949, the Housing
Repairs and Rents Acts, 1954, and the Rent Act, 1957.
The Rent Restrictions Acts, which apply, with few exceptions, to all unfur¬
nished dwellings below a certain rateable value, limit the rent a landlord may legally
recover from a tenant, while at the same time giving the tenant in most circum¬
stances security of tenure. The Acts also make illegal most premiums for the grant
of a tenancy of rent-controlled premises. Landlords restricted in this way are them¬
selves protected against undue increases in rates of mortgage interest and against
the calling in of mortgages so long as they pay the restricted interest due. The
Housing Repairs and Rents Acts, 1954, allowed landlords to increase their rents
to pay for repairs, subject to certain conditions and to a maximum limit.
The Rent Act, 1957, established, for houses which remain in control in England
and Wales, revised rent limits more in keeping with the current value of money and
the cost of maintenance, and permitted in Scotland an increase in controlled rents
subject to certain conditions. It provided that new unfurnished lettings should be
free of control, whether of the 4! million houses in owner-occupation when the
Act was passed, or of controlled houses which fall vacant and are re-let. In addition,
over 800,000 houses let at controlled rents were released from control by the
lowering of the limits of rateable value below which rented houses are subject
to control.1 The Act provided for the de-control from time to time of further
categories of houses by Order, subject to approval by Parliament; it also made
certain exceptions and safeguards for the protection of tenants, including a ‘stand¬
still’ period of fifteen months (up to October 1958) during which tenants of
premises decontrolled at the passing of the Act could not be compelled to quit.
The Landlord and Tenant (Temporary Provisions) Act, 1958, enables decontrolled
tenants to remain for a limited time after a notice to quit has expired, if they can
satisfy a court that they are unable to find other accommodation and would suffer
hardship. The Act is in force for three years.
In England and Wales, the rents payable for houses, or parts of houses, let fur¬
nished or in which services are provided, are controlled by the Furnished Houses
(Rent Control) Act, 1946. The Rent Act, 1957, provided that if the premises let
unfurnished would be above the rateable value limits for control, they should not,
if let furnished, come within the scope of the Act of 1946. Local rent tribunals,
appointed for the purpose, determine the rents of furnished lettings in cases referred
to them by either party or by the local authority. Similar legislation for controlling
rents of furnished lettings was passed for Scotland in 1943.
Somewhat similar measures of control apply in Northern Ireland. In 1951,
however, legislation was passed which permitted prescribed increases in the rent of
controlled houses, provided they were maintained in good repair; and the Housing
(Miscellaneous Provisions) and Rent Restriction Law (Amendment) Act (Northern
Ireland), 1956, provided for an increase of one-third in the rent levels fixed by the
1951 Act where the landlord had recently incurred expenditure of a certain amount
on repairs. The 1956 Act also released from control houses with a net annual value
of over £50 (with certain safeguards) and houses with a net annual value of over

and Scotland and £30 a year elsewhere. For definition of rateable value see p. 74.

TOWN AND COUNTRY PLANNING
The land of Britain is one of the most densely populated areas in the world and
it is therefore of vital importance in the public interest that competing claims to its
use should be settled in such a way that the necessary balance between them is
maintained.
From 1909 onwards, the idea of the planned use of land was given a degree ot
expression in successive Acts of Parliament, but because the pattern of development
over much of the country had already hardened into large unplanned urban con¬
centrations (as a result of the industrialisation processes of the previous century)
the powers granted to planning authorities by the early Acts were inadequate for
the task in hand.
The twenty years between the two world wars were decades of expansion in
industry, engineering and house-building; population was increasing, and there was
a general movement towards better standards of living, and consequently a greater
need for systematic planning than had hitherto been required. At the beginning
of the nineteen-thirties, a major effort was made to consolidate and strengthen
planning law and to extend the planning powers of central and local authorities to
the point at which they could exercise effective control. Despite this effort, which
culminated in the Town and Country Planning Act, 1932, inter-war planning
legislation had only a limited effect, mainly because it failed to deal adequately with
the question of compensation, which had always been an obstacle to satisfactory
planning. By the nineteen-twenties, the principle had been accepted that the
property of an individual might be subjected to restrictions in the public interest,
provided that he received some compensation out of public funds for any depriva¬
tion (which went beyond the requirements of good neighbourliness) that he might
suffer thereby. The method adopted for implementing this principle, however,
placed so heavy a financial burden on planning authorities that they were often
prevented from, or at least hampered in, carrying out their work. As a result, at the
time of the outbreak of the second world war, many of the outstanding problems of
land use remained unsolved.
Renewed efforts were made to deal with these problems immediately before and
during the war. Between 1937 and 1942 three expert committees were appointed to
study and report upon (1) the unregulated growth and spread of industry, (2) the
hampering of planning by the financial and administrative difficulties of compensa¬
tion and betterment and (3) the encroachment of urban development upon the
countryside. After the war, other committees studied the question of New Towns
and National Parks.
Almost all the principal planning recommendations of these committees have now
been incorporated in Acts of Parliament, as follows: the Distribution of Industry
Act, 1945; the New Towns Act, 1946; the Town and Country Planning Act, 1947 >
the Town and Country Planning (Scotland) Act, 1947 5 the National Parks and
Access to the Countryside Act, 1949; the Town Development Act, 1952; the Town
and Country Planning Act, 1953; the Town and Country Planning Act, 1954; the
Town and Country Planning (Scotland) Act, 1954; and the Housing and Town
Development (Scotland) Act, 1957. Town and country planning in Northern
Ireland is governed by the Planning and Housing Act (Northern Ireland), 19315
the Planning (Interim Development) Act (Northern Ireland), 19445 anc^ the
Planning Acts Amendment Act (Northern Ireland), 1944.
HOUSING AND PLANNING
177
Planning in Great Britain
The Town and Country Planning Act, 1947, and the Town and Country
Planning (Scotland) Act, 1947, are comprehensive and radical measures which
provide a framework or pattern of land use for the whole of Great Britain.
Their main purposes are:
1. To co-ordinate planning throughout Great Britain by means of development
plans against which day-to-day development can be considered.
2. To bring development (with certain exceptions) under control by making
it subject to the permission of a local planning authority or of a central
Government Department.
3. To extend both the powers of public authorities to acquire and develop
land for planning purposes, and the scope and scale of grants from central
funds to local authorities towards carrying out the acquisition and clearing
of land.
4. To deal with certain specific amenity problems, e.g., the preservation of
trees and woodlands and of buildings of special historic or architectural
interest, and the control of the display of advertisements.
The 1947 Acts also contained a number of financial provisions intended to solve
the compensation-betterment problem which had previously hampered effective
planning, but the system established proved unsatisfactory in operation, and amend¬
ments were therefore made in three subsequent Acts: the Town and Country
Planning Act, 1953; the Town and Country Planning Act, 1954; and the Town and
Country Planning (Scotland) Act, 1954. Under provisions of these Acts, compensa¬
tion is now payable by the State for loss of development value through the im¬
position of planning restrictions (other than restrictions in the interest of ‘good
neighbourliness’) up to the amount of any claim established under the Town and
Country Planning Acts, 1947, for development value existing in 1948. On com¬
pulsory acquisition of land by a public authority, owners receive the existing use
value of the land, and payment for any development value up to the amount of any
claim which has been established or which could have been established, if made.
This limitation of compensation enables local authorities to carry out their duties
as planning authorities free from the financial burdens which restricted the scope
of their operations during the inter-war years.
Development Plans
Under the terms of the 1947 Acts, local planning authorities in England and
Wales and in Scotland are required to prepare, and submit to the Minister of
Housing and Local Government and to the Secretary of State for Scotland respec¬
tively, development plans covering the whole of their districts, based on a survey
of physical and other resources. By 30th June, 1958, all the planning authorities in
England and Wales and 42 of the 57 in Scotland had already done so, and three-
quarters of the plans in England and Wales, and 52 plans (including 13 part-plans
and 28 amendment proposals) in Scotland, had been approved. The local planning
authorities are: in England and Wales, county councils, county borough councils,
or, in some areas, joint planning boards; and in Scotland, councils of counties and
of large burghs, and the councils of the two small burghs of St. Andrews and
Thurso. Provision is made in the Acts for a public inquiry or hearing before any
plan receives ministerial approval, so that persons whose land is affected may have
an opportunity to state their case, and for plans to be reviewed every five years.
By 30th June, 1958, in England and Wales, 11 plans had been approved without
I7g BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
the need to hold an inquiry or hearing, and 138 inquiries and two hearings had been
held, which varied in duration from one day to several weeks.
Individual plans for the reconstruction of parts of many of the large towns and
cities in Great Britain have also been drawn up and approved, and in many places
which suffered war damage, including Bristol, Coventry, Exeter, Kingston-upon-
Hull, Portsmouth, Plymouth and Southampton, considerable progress has been
made. In the City of London, projects valued at about £40 million had been
completed by the end of June 1958*
The Distribution of Industry
The Distribution of Industry Acts, 1945 and 1950, and the Town and Country
Planning Acts, 1947, contain provisions to control the location of industry through¬
out the country, which are described in the first section of Chapter IX, Industry.
General problems of industrial development are dealt with jointly by a number of
Government Departments, but the main responsibility for controlling the siting of
industry as apart from its general location rests with the local planning authorities,
for it is their duty to ensure that industrial development fits properly into existing
and expanding communities and is consistent with the best use of land.
New Towns
The New Towns Act, 1946, gives the Minister of Housing and Local Govern¬
ment and the Secretary of State for Scotland, who are the responsible ministers,
powers to make an order designating any area of land (which may include as its
nucleus the area of an existing town) as the site of a proposed new town, after
consultation with the local authorities concerned and if it is in the public interest to
do so. Once the site has been designated, the responsible minister appoints a
Development Corporation (consisting of a chairman and up to eight other members)
to be responsible for the development of the new town. One of the first tasks of the
development corporation is to prepare a master plan which becomes the basis for
development proposals, each of which covers a part of the area. Every proposal
must be submitted to the responsible minister who must consult the local planning
authority and, together with the Treasury, must be satisfied with the proposal on
economic grounds before giving approval. _ _
The development corporations have powers in general (subject to the consent of
the Minister of Housing and Local Government or the Secretary of State for
Scotland) to acquire, by agreement or compulsory purchase, any land or property
in these areas which is necessary for their purposes, and they may provide housing,
commercial and industrial premises, estate roads and other buildings or services
essential for the development of the towns. In England and Wales, the Minister of
Housing and Local Government has made a special development order to exempt
the development corporations from the necessity of obtaining planning permission
from the local planning authorities; but in Scotland, in the absence of a similar
order, permission to develop has to be obtained from the local planning authority.
The capital cost of developing the new towns is advanced to the corporations
from public funds and must be repaid on terms approved by the ministers with
the concurrence of the Treasury. The corporations must submit their reports
(which must include copies of their audited accounts) annually to the Minister or
to the Secretary of State for Scotland, who are responsible for laying them before
Parliament. . . .
Fifteen new towns are coming into being in Great Britain (see map, p. 179>
twelve in England and Wales and three in Scotland. Eight of the new towns in

Hatfield and Welwyn in Hertfordshire; Crawley in Sussex; and Bracknell in
Berkshire—are designed to help in absorbing excess population from the Greater
London area; four others—Corby in Northamptonshire; Aychffe and Peterlce in
Durham; and Cwmbran in Monmouthshire—are to serve the special needs of their
areas. Of the Scottish new towns, East Kilbride in Lanarkshire and Cumbernauld
in Dunbartonshire are being established to assist in housing the surplus population
from Glasgow; Glenrothes in Fife will also make a contribution towards the relief
of Glasgow overspill, but its primary function is to provide housing and other
facilities for miners and their families transferring to an area where mining activities
are steadily expanding. . ,
In spite of the fact that the development corporations have been somewhat
handicapped by shortages of materials and labour and for a time by restrictions on
capital investment, their work represents a notable achievement in the translation
of planning into reality. By the end of June 1958, the total population of the new
towns in England and Wales, designed to be 55°,000 when the towns are
completed, had reached an estimated total of 348,000 (including the people
previously living in the area); 62,852 houses had been built by the development
corporations, and a further 8,575 were under construction; 314 factories had been
established and a further 39 were being erected; 1,123 shops had been completed,
and 435 more were being built; 106 schools had been finished and 27 more were
under construction. Many miles of roads had been laid, and large main sewerage
works had kept pace with domestic and industrial needs.
In the Scottish new towns, by the same date, the population, eventually to be
125,000, had reached an estimated figure of just over 38,600; 7,667 houses had been
built, with a further 2,138 under construction; 90 shops had been completed and
23 were under construction; 10 new schools were in use, and the extension of
communications and public services was under way.
Under the New Towns Act of 1946, Parliament approved a consolidated fund
of £50 million to provide for advances to the development corporations for work
on the new towns. This fund was increased by subsequent Acts and, in 1958, stood
at £300 million. By the end of June 1958, £240 million of expenditure from this
amount had been approved by the Minister of Housing and Local Government
and the Secretary of State for Scotland.
National Parks and Access to the Countryside
The National Parks and Access to the Countryside Act, 1949, provided for the
designation of a number of extensive areas of beautiful country in England and
Wales as National Parks. In these areas the characteristic landscape is to be carefully
preserved, and facilities for open-air recreation may be provided or improved.
A National Parks Commission for England and Wales was set up by the Act of
1949, and by June 1958 its work had resulted in the establishment of ten of the
twelve National Parks recommended by the National Parks (England and Wales)
Committee, which reported in 1947. . . _ , • •
The established parks are: the Peak District, the Lake District, Snowdonia in
North Wales, Dartmoor in Devon, the Pembrokeshire Coast, the North York
Moors, the Yorkshire Dales, Exmoor in Devon and Somerset, Northumberland
(comprising most of the upland country from the Cheviots in the north to the
Roman Wall in the south), and the Brecon Beacons in South Wales (see map,
p. 179). These parks cover a total area of 5,254 square miles, almost one-eleventh ot
the area of England and Wales. The administrative arrangements for the parks are
as follows: the Peak District and Lake District National Parks are administered by
HOUSING AND PLANNING
181
joint planning boards; for Dartmoor, the Pembrokeshire Coast, the North York
Moors and Northumberland, special park planning committees of the respective
county councils concerned have been set up; while in Snowdonia, the Yorkshire
Dales and Exmoor (which include areas of more than one county council) there are
special park planning committees of each of the constituent county councils con¬
cerned with the parks. Each of the separate planning committees is advised by a
park joint advisory committee concerned with the whole park. All these authorities
control development in the parks and take such positive action as they deem
necessary to enhance natural beauty (e.g., by restoring derelict land, by removing
unsightly structures, and by tree planting), and to promote the enjoyment of the
area by the public (e.g., by providing car parks, camping sites or other kinds of
accommodation). Government grants of 75 per cent are available towards certain
approved expenditure.
Under the provisions of the 1949 Act, the Commission was also given authority
to select other, possibly less extensive, areas in England and Wales for designation
as ‘areas of outstanding natural beauty’ in order to keep them unspoiled. By the
end of June 1958, five such areas had been established, two others had been
designated, and proposals for a further ten were under consideration.
A Scottish National Parks Working Party has considered all five areas recom¬
mended as National Parks in Scotland—the Trossachs, Glen Affric, the Cairngorms,
Wester Ross (Loch Maree) and Glen Coe—with a view to their possible develop¬
ment under existing statutory powers, and has submitted to the Secretary of State
for Scotland a report on each of these areas.
In addition to the establishment of National Parks, the Act provided that a com¬
plete survey should be made of all footpaths and bridle-ways in England and Wales
to be a comprehensive national record of public rights of way and that long-distance
routes should be created, which by connecting existing footpaths and bridle-ways
would become continuous rights of way. Individual surveys of footpaths are being
carried out by parish and county district councils; on completion, they are collated
and published by the county councils. Responsibility for making proposals for
long-distance routes rests with the National Parks Commission; once the proposals
are approved by the Minister of Housing and Local Government, it falls to the
local authorities to give effect to them. By the end of June 1958, the National Parks
Commission’s proposals for the creation of five routes, covering some 850 miles,
had been approved (see map, p. 179); progress had been made by means of surveys,
cairn building and footpath agreements, towards their completion; and discussions
were taking place between the Commission and the relevant local authorities
regarding the establishment of several more routes of this kind.
The Act also gives local authorities the task of surveying in their areas the access
enjoyed by the public to open country, i.e. mountain, moor, heath, down, cliff or
foreshore, and empowers them to improve such access, where necessary, by means
of agreemepts with owners or by access orders. By June 1958, considerable areas of
the Peak district had been opened to the public by this means.
National Forest Parks
The Forestry Commission has opened to the public eight National Forest Parks
in Great Britain (see map, p. 179): Argyll, Glen Trool, Glen More, and Loch Ard
(renamed the Queen Elizabeth Forest Park to commemorate the Coronation) in
Scotland; Hardknott and Forest of Dean in England; Snowdonia in Wales; and
the Border Forest Park (adjoining the Northumberland National Park to the west¬
ward), which was declared in September 1955 and includes forests on the borders

The total area of the eight parks is nearly half a million acres, including planted
areas and unplantable moorland and mountains. Camping facilities are provided in
most of the parks.
Nature Conservation
The responsibility for nature conservation rests with the Nature Conservancy
(see the Science section of Chapter VII), which derives the necessary powers for
the proper discharge of its functions from the National Parks and Access to the
Countryside Act, 1949. The object of conservation, which is to influence soils,
water, vegetation and animal life, either directly or indirectly by means of research,
experiment and control, entails the acquisition and management of a representative
series of Reserves, as well as the establishment of laboratories for use in long-term
research schemes.
Sixty-five Nature Reserves, covering 128,096 acres in Great Britain, had been
declared by the end of June 1958. The Cairngorms Reserve, which covers 39,639
acres, is the largest of these; it is also one of the largest in Europe. In addition, two
Forest Nature Reserves (which are not under the control of the Nature Conser¬
vancy) have been set up, by the Forestry Commission and the Crown Estate
Commissioners, to be managed in the interest of ecological research and of timber
production.
In addition to national Nature Reserves and Forest Nature Reserves, there were,
by end-June 1958, six local Nature Reserves, established and administered by local
authorities, in consultation with the Nature Conservancy, using their own powers
under the Act.
Apart from the statutory Nature Reserves, there are also a number of non-
statutory reserves managed by societies such as the Society for the Promotion of
Nature Reserves, County Naturalists’ Trusts and the Royal Society for the Pro¬
tection of Birds. Under bird protection legislation, powers have long existed to
create statutory bird sanctuaries, where interference with birds and their eggs is
penalised.
Preservation of Amenities
Responsibility for the preservation of the historic, scenic and architectural
beauties of Great Britain is vested mainly in the Minister of Housing and Local
Government, the Secretary of State for Scotland, and the various statutory planning
authorities and commissions. The Ministry of Works is also concerned, both
because it is the Department responsible for the maintenance of royal parks and
palaces and because it is empowered by the provisions of the Historic Buildings
and Ancient Monuments Act, 1953, to assist in the preservation of historic houses
by making grants (after consultation with specially constituted Historic Buildings
Councils) for their upkeep together with their contents and their adjoining land.
By end-July 1958, grants totalling £1,650,000 had been paid towards, the cost of
urgently needed structural repairs to 546 historic buildings in England, Scotland
and Wales.
Unofficial amenity societies, wholly dependent upon the support of their mem¬
bers, include: the Council for the Preservation of Rural England, founded in 1926
to organise concerted action to secure the protection of rural scenery and of town
and country amenities from disfigurement or injury; the Association for the
Preservation of Rural Scotland, founded in 1927 for the protection of rural scenery
and the amenities of country districts and towns and villages in Scotland; the
Commons, Open Spaces and Footpaths Preservation Society; the Ramblers’ Asso¬
ciation; the Society for the Protection of Ancient Buildings; the Pilgrim Trust;

the National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty in England,
Wales and Northern Ireland; and the National Trust for Scotland. The National
Trust for England, Wales and Northern Ireland (which was founded in 1895 and
by 1958 had nearly 70,000 members) is (apart from the Crown) the largest land-
owner in the United Kingdom. It has acquired, mainly through gifts, over a
thousand properties, which it holds for the enjoyment of the public; it administers
more than 250,000 acres of land of great natural beauty; and it owns many fine
gardens. The National Trust for Scotland, an independent body, founded in 1931
to promote the preservation of places of historic or architectural interest or of
natural beauty in Scotland for the benefit of the public, now has about 12,000
members and has under its care some 60 properties, covering in all about 55,000
acres.
Planning in Northern Ireland
The Planning and Housing Act (Northern Ireland), 1931, which is the main
source from which power to prepare a planning scheme is derived, provides for the
preparation by local authorities of planning schemes for development or redevelop¬
ment of their areas, with the general object of securing proper sanitary conditions
and amenities in connection with the laying out and use of land. The Interim
Development Act of 1944 enables persons wishing to carry out development to do
so without delay, while ensuring that such development shall conform to the
provisions likely to be included in the planning scheme for the area.
The provisions of the Acts brought all land in Northern Ireland under planning
control and required every local authority to prepare a planning scheme for its area.
Interim control is exercised in accordance with the section of the 1944 Act which
requires that, where application is made to an authority for permission to develop,
the authority may grant the application conditionally or unconditionally or may
refuse it altogether. In the event of a refusal or conditional approval, the applicant
has a right to appeal to the Ministry of Health and Local Government for Northern
Ireland (which is the Department primarily responsible for the administration of
the Planning Acts) or to an independent person appointed by the Ministry.
Since 1944, all local planning authorities in Northern Ireland have made appre¬
ciable progress in the preparation of outline plans which indicate broadly the
proposals for their areas. The outline plans provide a foundation for the preparation
of more detailed plans at a later stage and also facilitate materially the work of
interim development control. Many interim development applications have been
decided by local planning authorities, and appeals lodged with the Ministry have
been relatively few.
Northern Ireland Forest Park
In May 1955, Northern Ireland’s first forest park at Tollymore Park, Newcastle,
County Down, was opened to the public. Situated at the foot of the Mountains of
Mourne, it covers an area of 1,200 acres. It contains an arboretum comprising a
wide variety of native and exotic trees, and is rich in mountain, river and parkland
scenery. Caravan facilities and a camping site for youth organisations are available.

VI. THE CHURCHES
Every person living in Britain possesses the right of religious freedom as described
in Article 18 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights: he may change his
religion at will, and may manifest his faith in teaching, worship and observance.
Churches and religious societies of all kinds may own property, conduct schools,
and propagate their beliefs in speech and in writing. ,
Freedom of conscience in religious matters was achieved gradually from the
seventeenth century onwards; in many cases, relaxation in the administration of
laws discriminating against minority religious groups preceded the repeal of the
legislation concerned. Heresy ceased to be a civil offence with the passing of the
Ecclesiastical Jurisdiction Act, 1677, and the Toleration Act of 1688 granted
freedom of worship to Protestant dissenters. In 1828, the repeal of the Test and
Corporation Acts freed nonconformists from political disabilities and made it
possible for them to be appointed to public offices; Roman Catholics gamed political
emancipation under the Roman Catholic Relief Act, i8z9; the Jewish Relief Act
181:8, enabled Jews to become members of Parliament; while religious tests that
had been imposed on prospective students and members of the academic staff of
the universities of Oxford, Cambridge and Durham were successively abolished by
Acts of 1854, 1856 and 1871. Nowadays, public offices are open without distinction
to members of all religious groups or of none. , . .
In the services administered by the State, such as the armed forces, the nationa
hospitals, and the prisons, the clergy of the established Church of England or the
Church of Scotland provide the principal ministrations and are paid a salary by the
State for this part of their work. Chaplains of the Roman Catholic Church an
ministers of other denominations may also be appointed or specially called in as
required. Voluntary schools (see the Education section of Chapter IV) provided by
churches of any religious denomination may be wholly or partly maintained from
P There is no precisely accurate or uniform method of assessing the number of
adherents to the various churches in the United Kingdom, since no inquiries are
made about religious beliefs in population censuses or other official returns, and
each church adopts different criteria in counting its members. The membership
figures given in the following sections should therefore be taken as approximate.
Church of England
The Church of England is the Established Church, and claims to be the ancient
Catholic Church of the land. At the Reformation in the sixteenth century, it
repudiated the supremacy of the Pope, but retained the historic episcopate, and the
creeds and sacraments upon which its doctrines are based; therefore it claims to be
both Catholic and Reformed. Its form of worship is embodied in the Book of
Common Prayer, which was first compiled in 1549-
Relations with the State
No single Act of Parliament defines the position of the Church of England in the
way that the Treaty of Union, 1707, for example, defines the position of the Church
1 An exception is that the Lord Chancellor may not be a Roman Catholic.
184
THE CHURCHES
185
of Scotland. In England, the relationship of Church and State is one of mutual
obligation privileges accorded to the Church which are balanced by certain duties.
T he Church is uniquely related to the Crown, in that the Sovereign, who must be
a member of the Church of England, is called ‘Defender of the Faith’ (a statutory
title as protector of the Church) and promises on his or her accession to uphold it.
The coronation of the Sovereign is performed by the Archbishop of Canterbury,
Primate of all England; prayers for the Sovereign and other members of the royal
family are said in all the statutory services of the Church; all bishops and deans are
appointed by the Sovereign on the advice of the Prime Minister; and all clergy take
the oath of allegiance to the Crown.
The Church is further linked with the State through the House of Lords, in
which the two archbishops of Canterbury and York and the twenty-four senior
diocesan bishops have seats. This makes it possible for the views of the Church
leaders to be expressed freely on any moral issue raised in connection with the
corporate conduct of the State, as well as on specifically ecclesiastical issues—a
matter of particular significance in view of the fact that clergy of the Church of
England (together with those of the Church of Scotland, the Church of Ireland
and the Roman Catholic Church) are legally disqualified from sitting in the House
of Commons.
The Church is not free to change its form of worship, as laid down in the Book of
Common Prayer, without the consent of Parliament; canon laws (Church rules)
cannot be made or amended without the consent of the Queen in Council; and the
measures of the Church Assembly (as distinct from their regulations) are not valid
without parliamentary assent.
Church Organisation and Government
The Church is organised by geographical areas, and not by congregations. There
are 43 dioceses in England, each under a bishop, which are grouped into two
provinces, each under an archbishop: Canterbury (29 dioceses) and York (14
dioceses). The dioceses are sub-divided into ecclesiastical parishes, of which there
are well over 14,000. Everyone in England is born in a parish; many more people
than regularly attend the Established Church tend to look to it for such personal
ministrations as baptism, marriage and burial; and the parish Church is expected
to play an active part in local life.
Spiritual authority in the Church rests with the bishops. The authoritative bodies
in matters of doctrine, belief and practice are the Convocations of Canterbury and
York, each presided over by its archbishop, and consisting of an upper house of
bishops, and a lower house of representatives of each cathedral chapter, arch¬
deacons and elected clergy. The Convocations meet not more than three times a
year.
The legislative and central administrative body of the Church is the National
Assembly of the Church of England, which is commonly called the Church
Assembly. It was set up by the Crown in 1919 at the request of the two Convoca¬
tions, and was given power to legislate by measure by the Church of England
Assembly (Powers) Act of 1919. It can discuss any matter connected with the
Church of England, but may not make any doctrinal statements, nor infringe upon
the rights of the Convocations. It consists of three houses: bishops, clergy and laity.
The first two houses are composed of the members of the Convocations; the house
of laity consists of men and women elected every five years by the lay members of
diocesan conferences, and the constitution allows for 10 co-opted members.
The Church Assembly usually meets three times a year. Measures, after passing
through various stages in the Assembly, are presented to an ecclesiastical committee
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
186
of both Houses of Parliament, consisting of 30 members, of whom 15 are appointed
by the Lord Chancellor and 15 by the Speaker of the House of Commons. This
committee lays the measures, together with a report upon them, before both
Houses. If both Houses so resolve, the measure is then sent to the Sovereign for
Royal Assent, after which the measure has the same force and effect as an Act of
Parliament. Parliament, though it may reject a measure, has no power to amend it.
The Assembly is the centre of an administrative system, consisting of boards and
councils dealing with various aspects of the Church’s work, such as education,
training for the ministry, social responsibility, and Church work overseas.
Parochial church councils were set up by a measure in 1921 to associate the laity
with the government of the Church in the parish. The members of these councils
are appointed by the parochial electors, i.e. persons who are baptised, are not
members of any other church, are over 17 years of age, and who have applied for
membership of the electoral roll of the parish where they habitually reside or
worship. The estimated number on the parish electoral rolls in 1958 was three
and a quarter million.  
The Church of England has its own ecclesiastical courts. Their jurisdiction, as
it is exercised today, consists almost entirely of faculty cases, with occasional cases
of discipline against clergy, either for moral or ecclesiastical offences. A faculty is
necessary for any specific alteration or addition to the fabric or ornaments of a
church or to a churchyard.
Church Finance
Each parish is responsible for its own finances, and also contributes an annual
fixed quota to diocesan funds, and each diocese similarly contributes to the Church
Assembly. In the diocese, the financial authority is the diocesan board of finance,
which administers the money contributed by the parishes, and acts as trustee on
behalf of the parochial church councils, which have only limited powers of holding
property. The Church Assembly fund and various other central funds (including
that for the training of ordination candidates) are administered by the Central
Board of Finance of the Church of England.
The Church Commissioners, a body created by measure in 1947 to replace the
former Ecclesiastical Commissioners and Queen Anne’s Bounty, administers the
endowment income of the Church. It is largely responsible for the payment of
stipends of the clergy, and it also provides finances for pensions, new churches,
parsonage houses, and church schools. The total income from investments in the
financial year 1956-57 was £11,765,096. The total annual income of the Church is
estimated to be approximately £27i million; no precise figure can be given.
The Anglican Communion
In the United Kingdom, there are unestablished Anglican Churches in Ireland,
Scotland and Wales: the Church of Ireland (disestablished in 1869) has six dioceses
in Northern Ireland (four of which are situated partly in the Irish Republic) and
some 354,000 members; the Episcopal Church in Scotland, 7 dioceses, 377 churches
and some 108,000 members; and the Church in Wales (disestablished in 1920)
6 dioceses and some 200,000 Easter communicants. _
Outside the United Kingdom the Anglican Communion exists wherever English¬
men have gone as settlers, traders and missionaries. The Protestant Episcopal
Church in the United States of America, the Church of India, Pakistan, Burma
and Ceylon, and the Anglican Churches of South Africa, Canada, Australia, New
Zealand, the West Indies, China, Japan, the Middle East, West Africa and Central
Africa are all autonomous members of the Anglican Communion, while there are
THE CHURCHES
187
21 overseas dioceses, mainly in Africa and Asia, which are under the jurisdiction
of the Archbishop of Canterbury. In addition, terms of limited inter-communion
with the Church of South India, similar to those already existing between that
Church and the Church of India, Pakistan, Burma and Ceylon, were laid down in
resolutions passed by the Convocation of Canterbury in 1955.
Since 1867, except for the war years, the Lambeth Conference has met every
tenth year as an unofficial consultation between all Anglican bishops, presided over
by the Archbishop of Canterbury; the last meeting, which was held in London
during July and August 1958, was attended by 310 bishops from all parts of the
Anglican Communion. The conference has no executive authority, but enjoys great
moral prestige, and its findings on doctrine, discipline, relations with other com¬
munions, and on the attitude of the Anglican churches to political and social
questions are widely studied.
The Church of Scotland
The established Church in Scotland is the Church of Scotland, which in govern¬
ment is presbyterian. It has been described as ‘the supreme example of a church
which is established and yet is free’. Its position, defined in the Treaty of Union,
1707, was further safeguarded by the Church of Scotland Act, 1921.
Whereas in episcopacy, church government is a hierarchy of persons, in presby-
terianism there is a hierarchy of courts. All ministers are of equal status, and each
of the 2,280 churches is governed locally by a Kirk Session, consisting of the
minister and elected elders (of whom there are over 43,000 in all): above this is the
Court of the Presbytery, then the Court of the Synod, and finally the General
Assembly, which meets annually and consists of elected ministers and elders pre¬
sided over by an elected Moderator who serves for one year. The Sovereign is
represented at the General Assembly by the Lord High Commissioner. The Church
of Scotland has fought with the utmost vigour throughout the years for complete
freedom in all spiritual matters and for the right to appoint its own officers and to
decide all matters of doctrine and discipline. This freedom is recognised by Parlia¬
ment, and the decisions of the Church of Scotland are not subject to parliamentary
debate or modification.
The thorough training of the ministry—lasting a minimum of six years—has
given the church a high reputation for scholarship and has in turn influenced the
standard of education in Scotland. The communicant membership of the Church
of Scotland in 1958 was 1,320,000.
The Free Churches
The phrase ‘Free Churches’ has now come into common use, especially to
describe in England those churches which were more generally known in the past as
Nonconformist Churches. Strictly speaking, all churches in Wales and Northern
Ireland are Free Churches, since in those countries there is no Established Church,
but the churches usually described as Free Churches are the Methodist, Baptist,
and Congregational Churches, and the Presbyterian Churches (other than the
Church of Scotland). There are other religious associations, e.g., the Society of
Friends and the Salvation Army, which have links in certain ways with the main
Free Churches.
The word ‘nonconformist’ signifies dissent from certain of the formularies and
practices of the Church of England. The Free Churches would more positively
affirm that the reason for their existence is a deep conviction about the nature of
religious worship. The Baptist, Congregational and Presbyterian Churches have
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
188
their roots in the Reformation movement, and the iVIethodist Church originated in
the evangelical revival led by John Wesley within the Church of England in the
eighteenth century. The Baptist and Congregational Churches regard their churches
as gathered covenanted communities of believers. The Presbyterian Churches lay
great stress on the doctrine of the sovereignty of God and the way in which that
should be reflected in religious observance.
The Methodist Churches
The largest of the Free Churches is the Methodist Church, the product of a
union of Methodist Churches in 1932. It has some 740,000 adult full members.
The supreme authority is the annual conference, and the system of government is
in many ways presbyterian: the Leaders’ Meeting corresponding to the Kirk
Session, with Circuit Meetings and District Synods resembling Presbytery and
Synod. One of the characteristics of Methodism is its strong emphasis on lay
leadership. There are over 23,000 trained lay preachers sharing the ministers’ work
and preaching in thousands of local churches.
Methodist Churches which did not join the union in 1932 include: the Indepen¬
dent Methodists, in which ministerial service is on a purely voluntary basis and
women (many of whom are ministers) have full equality with men; and the Wesleyan
Reform Union which, while retaining the essential Methodist doctrine, gives
autonomy to each of its 177 individual churches.
The Congregational and Baptist Churches
The Congregational and Baptist Churches are covenanted fellowships of
believers; ministers (who may be men or women) are called to special service, and
trained and recognised by the church. Local churches have formed county and
national unions, whose secretariat and assemblies have much influence, but no
compulsive authority over them, since great importance is attached to the autonomy
of local church meetings.
The Congregationalists in Britain, including Welsh Independents, number
approximately 340,000 and the Baptists 328,000 adult members. Baptists differ
from Congregationalists in practising the baptism of adult believers only; they do
not baptise infants.
The Unestablished Presbyterian Churches
The largest of the presbyterian churches outside the established Church of
Scotland is the Presbyterian Church in Ireland; in Northern Ireland, there are
26 presbyteries (five of which are situated partly in the Irish Republic) and the
membership is in the region of 410,000. The Presbyterian (or Calvinistic Methodist)
Church of Wales, which arose from the revivalist movement led by Howell Harris
in 1735, now embraces a considerable proportion of the Welsh-speaking population;
its members number some 147,000. The Presbyterian Church of England is
organised in 14 presbyteries; its highest court is the General Assembly; women
are admitted to the eldership and ministry.
Other presbyterian churches in Britain include: the Free Church of Scotland;
the United Free Church of Scotland; the Free Presbyterian Church of Scotland;
the Reformed Presbyterian Church of Scotland; the Reformed Presbyterian
Church of Ireland (which consists of 38 congregations and preaching stations, all
but five of which are in Northern Ireland); and the Non-Subscribing Presbyterian
Church of Ireland, comprising three presbyteries (two of which are in Northern
Ireland), with 30 congregations.
THE CHURCHES
189
Other Denominations
Among other Christian denominations in the United Kingdom are: the Unitarian
and Free Christian Churches, which number about 330, with a membership of
some 80,000, and are united by loyalty to the principle of freedom of thought in
religion; the Churches of Christ (known also in the United States of America as
Disciples of Christ) which have been an organised community in Great Britain
since early in the nineteenth century, and have a membership of about 8,500; the
British Province of the Moravian Church, which is an international missionary
church; the Free Church of England (or Reformed Episcopal Church), which was
formed in 1844 as a direct result of the Oxford Movement; the Society of Friends;
and the Salvation Army.
The Society of Friends, or Quakers, was founded in the middle of the seventeenth
century by George Fox. It has no ordained ministry and does not observe the
sacraments. One of the chief characteristics of the Quakers is their belief in pacifism
and their firm adherence to pacifist methods. Their influence in many parts of the
world, especially in social reform and in the relief of suffering, is very wide in
relation to their numbers. There are about 21,500 Quakers in Britain; they have
436 places of worship.
The Salvation Army, founded by William Booth, a Methodist, in 1878, is a
religious movement, composed of men and women who seek the spiritual and
social betterment of their fellows, primarily by preaching the gospel to those hitherto
untouched by religious effort. The movement, in which military rather than eccle¬
siastical terminology is used, has branches all over the world, and its social work
(particularly that connected with the welfare of members of the British armed forces
serving overseas) is well supported.
The Christian Scientists, who are in no way connected with any other church,
have over 340 branch churches and societies in Britain.
The Roman Catholic Church
The Roman Catholic hierarchy in England and Wales, which became temporarily
extinct during the sixteenth century, was restored in 1850; the Scottish hierarchy
became extinct in the early seventeenth century and was restored in 1878, while the
Irish hierarchy never became completely extinct. The normal government of the
Church, namely by territorial archbishops and bishops, is once again the rule in
the whole of the United Kingdom.
The central territorial unit of the Roman Catholic hierarchical organisation is the
province or archdiocese under the metropolitan, who is always an archbishop. The
chairman of the bench of bishops in England and Wales is the Archbishop of West¬
minster. A province normally comprises several dioceses, each under a bishop aided
by a chapter of canons and others, and by priests in charge of the parishes into
which the diocese is sub-divided. In England and Wales, in 1958, there were four
provinces and archdioceses: Westminster, Liverpool, Birmingham and Cardiff;
14 dioceses; and 2,156 parishes. In Scotland, there were two provinces and arch¬
dioceses: St. Andrews and Edinburgh, and Glasgow; six dioceses; and 380 parishes.
In Northern Ireland, there were five dioceses (several of which, since there is one
hierarchy for the whole of Ireland, have territory partly in the Republic of Ireland
and partly in Northern Ireland) all of these are in the Province of Armagh; and
about 172 parishes. In the whole of the United Kingdom, there are over four and a
half million adherents, including children, to the Roman Catholic faith.
The Roman Catholic Church attaches great importance to the education of
Roman Catholic children in their own faith, and requires that the children of
marriages between Roman Catholics and members of any other Church should be
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
IQO
brought up as Roman Catholics. Many schools for Roman Catholic children in the
United Kingdom are staffed by members of the great Religious Orders for men
and women, who also undertake other social work such as nursing, child care, and
the conduct of homes for the aged.
Jewry
Jews first settled in England at the time of the Norman conquest, but were
expelled at the beginning of the thirteenth century by an edict of Edward I. The
present Anglo-Jewish community dates from 1656, the earliest arrivals being the
Sephardi (from Spain and Portugal). At the end of the seventeenth century an
Ashkenazi community (from Germany and East Europe) was established, which
increased rapidly and spread to the principal provincial cities. By 1956, as a result
of the virtual destruction of whole Jewish communities on the Continent during
the second world war, the Anglo-Jewish community of some 400,000 had become
the largest group of Jews in Europe.
The Anglo-Jewish community is divided into two schools of thought, each of
which has its own form of worship and its own services: the Orthodox (the original
groups) and the Reform. The Reform Movement, which attaches less religious
importance to some of the ancient rituals and practices of the Jewish faith, began
in 1840. It was followed in 1901 by the establishment of the Liberal Jewish Move¬
ment which, in addition, lays emphasis on the reinterpretation of traditional
Judaism in the light of modern thought and custom. Of the Jews in Great Britain
who belong to any kind of synagogue, about 80 per cent are Orthodox. The Chief
Rabbi is the head of the largest group (Ashkenazi) within Orthodox Jewry; the
Haham is the head of the Sephardi group.
Synagogues in Britain of all sections of Jewry number approximately 445,
including 17 Liberal and 15 Reform congregations. There are a few schools which
cater exclusively for Jewish children, but the vast majority attend the ordinary
State or independent schools, and receive extra-curricular instruction in the Jewish
faith.
Other Religious Communities
Among other non-Christian communities in Britain, the Moslems are the most
widely represented. The principal mosque is the Shah Jehan Mosque at Woking,
and there are also mosques in London, Birmingham, Manchester, Cardiff and
Glasgow.
A Buddhist temple was ceremonially opened in South Kensington, London, in
May 1954; and other premises were opened in 1956 as a meeting place and dis¬
cussion centre for adherents of Buddhism.
Co-operation between the Churches
An outstanding feature of recent years has been the growth of co-operation
between the Churches. The British Council of Churches was founded in 1942 and
includes official representatives from almost all the churches of the British Isles,
with the notable exception of the Roman Catholic Church. The Council facilitates
common action between the churches and seeks to further the cause of Christian
unity. The Archbishop of Canterbury is president. In addition, most though not
all of the Free Churches in England and Wales are members of the Free Church
Federal Council (formed in 1940 by the amalgamation of the Federal Council of
Evangelical Free Churches with the National Free Church Council), the aims of
which are to promote unity and joint action between the Free Churches, and to
provide a channel through which the Free Churches can communicate and negotiate
THE CHURCHES
191
with central and local government organs as a united body. Exploratory discussions
on changes in organisation to allow of closer relations between the Church of
England, the Church of Scotland, the Episcopal Church in Scotland, and the
Presbyterian Church of England have been taking place for the last few years, and
a report containing a number of proposals was issued in 1957. Conversations on
the same subject are also being held between representatives of the Church of
England and the Methodist Church.
The Anglican, Presbyterian and Free Churches in the four countries which make
up the British Isles also participate in the World Council of Churches, which was
constituted at Amsterdam, Netherlands, in 1948, and is to hold its third assembly
in 1961 at the University of Ceylon. The Council links together 168 churches in
over 50 nations for co-operation in action and the study of common problems.
Co-operation of other Churches with the Roman Catholic Church takes place on
specific issues, but there is no machinery of continuous co-operation. The Council
of Christians and Jews works for better understanding between members of the
two religions, and deals with problems arising in the social field.
VII. PROMOTION OF THE
SCIENCES AND THE ARTS
THE PROMOTION OF THE SCIENCES
While the promotion of the sciences in the United Kingdom is largely the
concern of those learned societies and institutions devoted specifically to this end,
only a small part of the research which is vital to science is carried out directly by
them. Most of the ‘pure’ or ‘fundamental’ research is conducted in the universities,
which also play an essential part in promoting the sciences by maintaining a steady
supply of trained scientists. In practice, it has become impossible to distinguish
clearly between science and its extensive applications in everyday life, with the
result that scientific research in the widest sense has become the concern also of
industry and of various Departments of Government.
In recent years it has become an acknowledged responsibility of the Government
not only to undertake research directly but also to keep under review the facilities
for the training of scientists, to encourage fundamental research, to finance certain
research projects, and to ensure that adequate research is directed to matters of
national interest. As a result a system of collaboration has developed between the
universities, industry, the learned societies and the Government which is of great
value to the community and leaves the greatest possible measure of freedom to
individual scientists.
Though scientific research is carried out mainly under three different kinds of
administration—university, industry and Government—there is strong liaison and
close co-operation between them, while the learned societies remain free to play a
most important part in the discussion and publication of the results of research.
Important work is also undertaken by independent organisations for example,
in medical research, by the British Empire Cancer Campaign, the Imperial Cancer
Research Fund, the Nuffield Foundation, the Lister Institute of Preventive Medi¬
cine, the Wellcome Foundation and Trust, and by some large pharmaceutical firms.
The Nuffield Foundation, which was established by Lord Nuffield in 1943, has a
wider scope. Its aims are: the advancement of health and the prevention and relief
of sickness; the advancement of social well-being; the care and comfort of the aged
poor; the advancement of education; and such other charitable purposes as shall
be declared by Lord Nuffield in his lifetime and by the trustees after his death.
Prominent among the Foundation’s many activities are the promotion of medical,
scientific and social research and the development of medical services and. of
technical and commercial education. Its resources consist of a fund of £10 million
provided by Lord Nuffield and of gifts and bequests from other persons.
THE LEARNED SOCIETIES
The learned societies have had a profound and lasting influence upon the develop¬
ment and organisation of science in Britain; not only have they provided the back¬
ground for the continuity of research from the seventeenth century onwards, but
they have been a meeting ground where all scientists can foregather for the exchange
192
PROMOTION OF THE SCIENCES AND THE ARTS
193
of ideas, and a reliable source from which new ideas for the enrichment of know¬
ledge can flow. Although today the bulk of research operations is conducted under
auspices other than theirs, the learned societies have retained their traditional
function of facilitating the spread of scientific knowledge and the application of
new discoveries.
At present there are over 200 learned scientific societies in Britain with approxi¬
mately 400 scientific publications. There are also numerous technical institutions
and professional associations, many of which are playing a distinguished part in
promoting their own branches of science and are interested in the education and
professional well-being of their members. Prominent examples of these are the
British Medical Association, the Institution of Civil Engineers, the Institution of
Mechanical Engineers, the Institution of Electrical Engineers, the Institution of
Metallurgists, the Royal Institute of Chemistry, the Institute of Physics, and the
Institute of Biology.
The Royal Society (or, more fully, the Royal Society of London), founded in
1660, occupies a unique place in the country’s scientific affairs, although for two
centuries scientists were in a minority among its members, whose interests lay
mainly in history, art, archaeology or exploration. The Society has always been
independent of State control but its advice on scientific matters has frequently been
sought by the Government. Today its influence remains as strong as ever and its
Fellows serve on most of the official advisory councils and committees in the
scientific field.
Its Fellowship consists of approximately 500 eminent scientists and 50 foreign
members. Admission of the former is restricted to 25 a year, and of the latter to four
a year; a few eminent non-scientists are also elected to Fellowships. The Society
maintains a library (145,000 books of a purely scientific nature), issues a large
number of publications, including the Philosophical Transactions and the Proceed¬
ings, and convenes conferences which are attended by scientists from all countries.
In addition, the Society is responsible for the administration of many research
funds and special funds derived from various sources and a number of Government
grants. These funds and grants are used for the promotion of science through
research, publications, congresses, the award of medals, lectures, and in many other
ways. The highest honour bestowed by the Society is the Copley medal, for which
scientists of all nationalities are eligible.
The Royal Society of Arts (originally the Society for the Encouragement of Arts,
Manufactures and Commerce) was founded in 1754, and as it was the first society
of its kind its work was at first very wide, covering scientific, technical, industrial
and commercial matters on a world-wide scale. As institutions devoted to the
specialised branches of science and industry came to be established, the Society
gradually abandoned some of its earlier fields of work, but it is still a recognised
forum for the discussion of technical and other subjects.
The Royal Institution was founded in 1799 as a public body for facilitating the
introduction of useful mechanical inventions and improvements, and for teaching
the application of science to everyday life. Later it undertook the ‘promotion of
chemical science by experiments and lectures for improving arts and manufactures’,
and ‘the diffusion and extension of useful knowledge’. Its character, however, was
largely determined by the work of Sir Humphry Davy and Michael Faraday who
established a tradition of research. Today, the Institution has extensive research
laboratories, and lectures are given on the recent developments in science and other
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
194
branches of knowledge. Its library of some 70,000 books includes many early
scientific works and manuscripts.
The British Association for the Advancement of Science was founded in 1831 to
promote general interest in science and its applications. One of its chief activities
is the Annual Meeting, attended by many young students as well as by eminent
scientists. Its 13 sections cover the whole range of pure and applied science other
than medical science, and there is a division for studying the social and international
relations of science. In addition to the Annual Meeting and in order to extend its
influence, the Association plans continuous activities throughout the year, in
particular special lectures, exhibitions and discussions (some designed for young
audiences), the publication of pamphlets, the organisation of conferences, the
appointment of study groups and liaison with the Press and with sound and tele¬
vision broadcasting services. Collaboration with other scientific organisations has
always been an important function of the British Association, and it has an organised
relationship with over 150 scientific bodies and learned societies. It has also played
an important part in the development of science by taking or recommending action
to remove obstacles to the discovery and application of scientific knowledge.
UNIVERSITIES AND COLLEGES OF TECHNOLOGY
According to a survey carried out by the Ministry of Labour and National
Service, the number of qualified scientists and engineers (i.e. holders of degrees or
diplomas, or members of certain professional institutions) in employment in Great
Britain at the beginning of 1956 was 142,000, including some 7,000 engaged in
postgraduate research at universities and on National Service. Starting from these
figures the Committee on Scientific Manpower of the Advisory Council on Scientific
Policy has estimated that over the next ten to fifteen years the present annual output
of some 10,000 qualified scientists and engineers should be raised to 20,000. The
Government has accepted this figure as a reasonable goal and will support measures
to ensure that the universities and technical colleges together will be able to produce
at least this number.
The Universities
The universities carry the main responsibility for the pursuit of fundamental
research and for the training of scientists. During recent years there has also been
a considerable expansion of technological training and research facilities within the
universities, all of which now offer work in one or more technological subjects.
Eighteen of the 22 universities of the United Kingdom have faculties of
engineering; chemical and aeronautical engineering have been developed in recent
years. Universities in industrial centres have developed studies relating to their
local industries, such as metallurgy at Birmingham, Sheffield, Swansea and other
centres of the steel industry, and naval architecture and marine engineering at
Glasgow, Liverpool, Durham and Southampton. In the textile areas, Manchester
offers courses in textile chemistry and engineering and Leeds has specialised
in courses and research in connection with the wool textile industry, including
colour chemistry and dyeing. Leeds is the only university in Britain to offer courses
in the chemistry of leather manufacture, and Manchester in paper technology.
Sheffield is unique for its department of glass technology—the pioneer among such
departments in the world.
Nearly all universities and university colleges in the United Kingdom have
laboratories or research departments. Over 70 per cent of the recurrent income of
PROMOTION OF THE SCIENCES AND THE ARTS
195
the universities and virtually the whole of their money for new building comes
from Government sources. There is no direct departmental control and the method
•of administering the grant—through the University Grants Committee—is designed
to ensure academic freedom. Additional funds for the prosecution of research are
also secured in some instances by the private endowment of research fellowships
generally awarded by the universities to selected persons, or by grants from outside
bodies tenable at the universities. Examples are the Leverhulme Fellowships, the
Imperial Chemical Industries Fellowships and the research grants of the Nuffield
Foundation.
The universities are also assisted by grants from industry and commerce and
from the Government Research Councils. An example of the close co-operation
that has been achieved between several branches of industry and the research
departments of universities is the Glass Delegation of the University of Sheffield.
This is responsible for the general direction of the work of the Department of Glass
Technology and is composed of members appointed by the Council of the Univer¬
sity and representatives of firms and companies who subscribe funds for the
furtherance of training and research. Another example of co-operation between a
Government Department, an independent organisation and a university is the
world’s largest steerable pencil-beam radio telescope at Jodrell Bank, Cheshire,
financed jointly by the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research, the
Nuffield Foundation, and Manchester University, which has been responsible for
its development. The telescope is used mainly for the study of stars detectable only
from their emission of electromagnetic waves, very distant nebulae and galaxies.
Technical Colleges
The Government’s plans for a large-scale and rapid expansion of education in
advanced technology (see Cmd. 9703, issued in February 1956, and pp. 160-3)
include the increase of advanced work at technical colleges as well as at the univer¬
sities. Certain technical colleges in England and Wales, which concentrate entirely
on advanced work, including postgraduate and research work, have been designated
as ‘colleges of advanced technology’. There are so far eight in number: the Birming¬
ham College of Technology; the Bradford Institute of Technology; the Welsh
College of Advanced Technology, Cardiff; Loughborough College of Technology;
the Royal Technical College, Salford; and, in London, the Battersea, Chelsea and
Northampton Colleges of Advanced Technology. In the south-west of England,
Bristol College of Technology has been selected as a potential college of advanced
technology, and Rutherford Technical College, Newcastle upon Tyne, has been
chosen from those on the north-east coast.
In Scotland, advanced instruction in a wide range of technologies is given at
Central Institutions (see p. 162).
Most postgraduate studentships and fellowships awarded by the Government
Research Councils may be held at colleges of advanced technology and technical
colleges as well as at universities.
RESEARCH IN INDUSTRY
Industrial research in Britain is conducted by individual industrial firms and
organisations independently of Government aid, by co-operative Research Associa¬
tions which are assisted in varying degrees by the Government, by sponsored
research institutes, and by universities and some of the major technical colleges.
The main nationalised industries have their own research establishments and also
give financial support to organisations concerned with research into matters of
interest to them.
196 BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Research Associations
A scheme to form Research Associations, by which the Government associated
itself with groups of firms having similar interests, was started in 1915, on the
recommendation of the then newly formed Advisory Council for Scientific and
Industrial Research. In 1958 there were 46 such Research Associations with a com¬
bined income of £4 million, of which about one-third is contributed by the Govern¬
ment through the Industrial Grants Committee of the Department of Scientific and
Industrial Research. The amounts of the Government grants are related to the
contributions made by the industries concerned.
The Research Associations are autonomous bodies, governed by their own.
councils, the large majority of whose members are representatives of industry. The-
councils are advised by research committees in the preparation of research pro¬
grammes. The Research Associations make the results of their work known to their
industries by a variety of methods, among which are bulletins, publications, lectures,,
films, training classes, exhibitions and mobile demonstration units.
Sponsored Research Institutes. A number of sponsored research institutes have-
been established to meet the needs of private firms which are unable to maintain
fully equipped research laboratories. In these institutes research can be carried out
confidentially so that the results and any patents which may arise are retained as the
property of the sponsoring body. The principal institutes of this type are the
Fulmer Research Institute and the Sondes Place Research Institute.
National Research Development Corporation. The National Research Develop¬
ment Corporation (NRDC) was set up by the Board of Trade in 1948. Its primary
function is to develop, in the public interest, inventions resulting from research
carried out by Government Departments and other public bodies. Under the
Development of Inventions Act, 1954, however, NRDC is allowed, on certain
conditions, to initiate research as well as to develop inventions resulting from
research. It is an independent body, subject only to general direction by the Board
of Trade, with powers to borrow from Government funds up to £5 million in the
first ten years of its life. Projects selected for development include electronic digital
computers, Merton diffraction gratings, a lightweight power unit, a potato harvester^
printed electrical circuits, and towed flexible oil barges.
GOVERNMENT RESEARCH ORGANISATION
Early Developments
Although the active participation by the Government in scientific effort is, for the
most part, a twentieth century development, its association with science dates from,
a much earlier time. Interest in navigation led Charles II in 1675 to establish
Britain’s first State-supported institution—the Royal Observatory at Greenwich,
now transferred to Herstmonceux, Sussex—for the purpose of correcting the tables
of the positions of the moon and fixed stars ‘for the use of his seamen’. The Geo¬
logical Survey of Great Britain—the first national institution of its kind in the
world—originated in 1835. In 1842 the Department of the Government Chemist
was founded, and in 1854 the Meteorological Office was established by the Board of
Trade ‘for the safe-guarding of seamen’. All these Government Departments were
using scientific knowledge but there was little organised effort towards the applica¬
tion of the discoveries made in pure science. Government scientific organisation,
like many British institutions, evolved gradually in response to the changing social
and economic circumstances of the times.
The need for research in physics and engineering, and particularly into methods
PROMOTION OF THE SCIENCES AND THE ARTS
197
of precise measurement, led to the establishment of the National Physical Labora¬
tory under the control of the Royal Society in 1900, with a modest grant from the
Treasury towards equipment and a yearly grant towards upkeep.
From 1909, however, the Government assumed a wider responsibility for pro¬
moting and encouraging scientific research and since that time its assistance has
been adapted to meet the rapidly changing conditions in industry and education.
The Development Commission, appointed in 1909 by the Government, recom¬
mended that financial aid should be made available from the Development Fund
to ‘aid and develop agriculture and rural industries by promoting scientific research’.
In 1911 the Development Fund was used to establish a scheme which led to the
formation of most of the present-day agricultural research institutes.
In 1913 a Medical Research Committee (the forerunner of the Medical Research
Council) was appointed to administer the research funds provided under the
National Health Insurance Act of 1911.
Up to the outbreak of the first world war, the Government’s contribution to
scientific research was made directly through such organisations as these, and
indirectly through grants administered on its behalf by such bodies as the Royal
Society and the Imperial College of Science and Technology in London.
The recognition of the importance of scientific research and of the application of
scientific knowledge to commerce and industry led to the establishment of the
Department of Scientific and Industrial Research (DSIR) as a separate Government
Department in 1916.
In 1918 financial responsibility for the National Physical Laboratory was trans¬
ferred from the Royal Society to the DSIR, although the Royal Society continued
to advise on the scientific direction of the Laboratory.
The Forestry Commissioners were appointed in 1919 with powers to undertake
and aid research for the promotion of forestry.
In 1920 the Government established the Medical Research Council with a grant-
in-aid provided directly by Parliament. The Agricultural Research Council was
established in 1931. In addition to its duties as adviser to the Development Com¬
missioners and the Agricultural Departments (for England and Wales and for
Scotland), the Council was given funds of its own from which grants could be made
for special research projects. The Nature Conservancy was set up in 1949.
During the second world war a Scientific Advisory Committee to the War
Cabinet was created, with the object of co-ordinating defence research and civil
research.
The Lord President of the Council, as the Minister responsible for the Research
Councils and as President of the Scientific Advisory Committee, came to be re¬
garded as the member of the Cabinet responsible for the direction of Government
scientific organisation.
Post-war Developments
In 1947, the Government established an Advisory Council on Scientific Policy
‘to advise the Lord President of the Council in the exercise of his responsibility for
the formulation and execution of Government scientific policy’. The 15 members of
the Advisory Council, who are appointed by the Lord President, include eminent
scientists drawn from the universities, industry and Government service, and senior
Government officials.
In the same year the Defence Research Policy Committee was established ‘to
advise the Minister of Defence and Chiefs of Staff on matters connected with the
formulation of scientific policy in the defence field’.
These two bodies replaced the Scientific Advisory Committee to the War Cabinet.
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
198
In order to give adequate attention to each of the subjects within its wide range
of interest, the Advisory Council has established the following standing committees:
the Committee on Scientific Manpower;
the Scientific Library and Technical Information Committee; and
the Committee on Overseas Scientific Relations.
Government Machinery for Civil Scientific Research
The principles underlying Government scientific organisation are briefly as
follows:
1. The Lord President of the Council is responsible for the formulation and
execution of Government scientific policy and is advised by the Advisory
Council on Scientific Policy on general questions which relate to the whole
field of civil science.
2. The Lord President is the Minister responsible to Parliament for the
Council for Scientific and Industrial Research, the Medical Research
Council, the Agricultural Research Council, and the Nature Conservancy,
and is chairman of the four Privy Council Committees to which they report
—the Committees for Scientific and Industrial Research, Medical Research,
Agricultural Research, and Nature Conservation.
3. The Prime Minister is the Minister responsible to Parliament for general
oversight of the development of atomic energy, and appoints the members
of the Atomic Energy Authority.
4. Other Ministers are responsible for the scientific establishments within
their own Departments.
5. The Research Councils are not subject to departmental control, but their
advice is at the disposal of the executive Departments and there is close
liaison between them.
Department of Scientific and Industrial Research
The DSIR is responsible to the Committee of the Privy Council for Scientific
and Industrial Research of which the Lord President is chairman. Since DSIR was
set up in 1916, this Committee has been advised by an Advisory Council for
Scientific and Industrial Research, which included in its membership eminent
scientists and leading industrialists, two members closely connected with organised
labour and assessors appointed by Government Departments. But, in 1955, with
the large increase in the Department’s work, the Government set up a Committee
of Inquiry into its organisation.
The report of this Committee was accepted by the Government and its recom¬
mendations embodied in the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research Act,
1956. The first and main purpose of this Act was to replace the existing Advisory
Council by an Executive Council for Scientific and Industrial Research; the second,
to provide in a specific Act of Parliament for the expenditure of the Department
to be met out of funds provided by Parliament.
The Council, which consists of a chairman and 12 members, is charged with the
organisation, development and encouragement of scientific and industrial research
and with the dissemination of the results of such research. In particular, it may:
(1) encourage and support scientific research in universities, technical colleges
and other institutions;
(2) establish or develop institutions or departments of institutions for investi¬
gation and research relating to the advancement of trade and industry; and
PROMOTION OF THE SCIENCES AND THE ARTS
199
(3) take steps to further the practical application of the results of scientific and
industrial research.
The DSIR discharges these functions through 13 national research organisations
under its own control and direction and financed from its own Vote, and one, the
Joint Fire Research Organisation, which is maintained by the Department and the
Fire Offices’ Committee; and also through the autonomous Research Associations.
The Council may also make grants for these purposes and grants for postgraduate
instruction in science and technology to individual workers or to institutions.
The close contacts maintained between the DSIR and other Government Depart¬
ments, Research Associations and other bodies help to ensure that the scientific
resources of the Department are applied to the solution of problems which are of
most importance to the national economy and are used to make the maximum
contribution to improving industrial efficiency.
Under a five-year plan covering the years 1953 to 1958, DSIR’s staff is being
increased by about 800, and new buildings are being provided. Plans for the period
I959 t° 1964 are in preparation.
Medical Research Council
The Medical Research Council (MRC), the successor of the Medical Research
Committee, was incorporated under its present title by Royal Charter in 1920.
The MRC is responsible to the Committee of the Privy Council for Medical
Research, of which the Lord President is chairman and the Secretaries of State for
the Home Department, Scotland, Commonwealth Relations, and the Colonies, and
the Ministers of Health and of Labour and National Service are members.
The members of the Council, appointed by the Committee of the Privy Council
for a period normally of four years, are twelve in number. Nine members, repre¬
senting the different branches of medical knowledge and the fundamental sciences
on which these are based, are appointed after consultation with the President of
the Royal Society and with the Council. On retirement these scientific members are
not eligible for immediate reappointment. Of the three lay members of the Council,
one must be a member of the Flouse of Lords and one a member of the House of
Commons.
The Council’s chief function is to promote scientific investigations to obtain new
knowledge likely to be of value in the field of curative and preventive medicine. In
planning and carrying out its research programme, the Council is often assisted by
special committees which it appoints to advise on particular subjects. The arrange¬
ments for the support of research fall under three main headings:
(1) investigations by members of the Council’s scientific staff, mostly working
in the Council’s own research establishments;
(2) temporary research grants to independent investigators in universities and
elsewhere; and
(3) research fellowships and scholarships for tenure both at home and abroad.
The Council’s own research activities are mainly undertaken in the National
Institute for Medical Research, at Mill Hill and Hampstead, London, and in some
60 smaller establishments, generally known as Research Units or Groups, which
are attached in most cases to universities and hospitals. In 1951, the Council
assumed the major financial responsibility for the Institute of Cancer Research,
which has continued to receive substantial support from the British Empire Cancer
Campaign. The Council also undertakes medical research overseas and, with ad¬
ditional support from Colonial Development and Welfare funds, maintains labora¬
tories in the Gambia and units in Uganda and Jamaica.

The MRC administers the Public Health Laboratory Service on behalf of the
Ministry of Health.
Agricultural Research Council
The Agricultural Research Council (ARC) was established by Royal Charter in
1931. It is responsible to the Committee of the Privy Council for Agricultural
Research, consisting of the Lord President of the Council, the Minister of
Agriculture, Fisheries and Food and the Secretary of State for Scotland.
Under the Agricultural Research Act, 1956, the ARC was charged with the
organisation and development of agricultural research, and an Agricultural Research
Fund was established, into which are paid the Parliamentary grant-in-aid and other
sums received by the Council, and out of which are met all expenses incurred by the
Council under the Act or in accordance with the terms of its Charter. The accounts
of the Fund are audited by the Comptroller and Auditor General.
The Council consists of not more than 18 nor fewer than 15 members, five of
whom are appointed for their general experience of and interest in agriculture.
Others are appointed by the Committee of the Privy Council, after consultation
with the President of the Royal Society, on account of their qualifications in one or
other of the sciences relating to agriculture. Included in the Council’s membership
are the Chief Scientific Adviser (Agriculture) and the Chief Veterinary Officer of
the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, also one member appointed by
the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food and one by the Secretary of State
for Scotland. The Council has 19 research stations and units under its direct control
in Great Britain.
Since 1st April, 1956, when the Agricultural Research Act came into force,
responsibility for the administration and financing of the independent research
institutes in England and Wales (but not in Scotland) was transferred to the Council
from the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food. The programmes of all these
institutes are co-ordinated and approved by the Council and are integrated with
those of the independent research institutes in Scotland and of the institutes and
units directly controlled and financed by the Council.
The Council makes grants to universities and other recognised research institu¬
tions for special investigations, and awards research fellowships and postgraduate
studentships in agricultural and veterinary science, agricultural and dairy engineer¬
ing and statistics.
Nature Conservancy
The Nature Conservancy was established by Royal Charter in 1949 and is
directly responsible to the Lord President of the Council as Chairman of the Privy
Council Committee for Nature Conservation. Its functions, as summarised in the
charter, are ‘to provide scientific advice on the conservation and control of the
natural flora and fauna of Great Britain; to establish, maintain and manage nature
reserves in Great Britain, including the maintenance of physical features of scientific
interest; and to organise and develop the research and scientific service related
thereto’.
Research stations have been set up by the Conservancy at Merlewood, Grange-
over-Sands in Lancashire, and Furzebrook, Wareham in Dorset, and field stations
at Moor House, Westmorland, and at Anancaun, Ross-shire, where long-term
ecological research is undertaken into such problems as the relation of vegetation
to soils and climates, peat growth, effects of grazing and of moor burning, coastal
erosion, roadside spraying and the spread of myxomatosis. Grants are made for
research, and the Conservancy awards a number of postgraduate studentships
annually.
PROMOTION OF THE SCIENCES AND THE ARTS 201
Responsibility for Atomic Energy
Before 1946 the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research was responsible
for atomic energy research and development.
From 1946 to the end of 1953 this responsibility rested with the Minister of
Supply. By April 1953, however, because of its growing industrial applications, the
Government had decided in principle to transfer responsibility for atomic energy
from the Minister of Supply to a non-departmental organisation. On 1st January,
1954, ministerial responsibility was transferred to the Lord President of the Council,
and, as an interim measure, a Department of Atomic Energy was set up to take over
the functions of the Ministry of Supply in respect of atomic energy with the
exception of weapons production.
The United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority (UKAEA), established on
1 st August, 1954, under the Atomic Energy Authority Act, 1954, took over responsi¬
bility, under the Lord President, for the Department of Atomic Energy. On
1st April, 1957, the Prime Minister assumed, by Order in Council, general
responsibility for atomic energy in place of the Lord President.
The present position is that general responsibility for atomic energy research and
development lies with the Prime Minister assisted by a small staff constituting the
Atomic Energy Office, which is responsible among other things for international
aspects of atomic energy in co-operation with the Foreign Office and Common¬
wealth Relations Office. The Minister of Supply is responsible for the development
and production of atomic weapons for the Services in accordance with agreed
defence policy; in practice, however, the Atomic Energy Authority produces the
explosive nuclear material and the assemblies for atomic weapons under contract
and carries out weapon research. The Minister of Power (in Scotland the Secretary
of State) has a general responsibility for the civil nuclear programme; the power
stations are being built and will be operated by the electricity authorities. The
Admiralty is concerned (in close collaboration with the Authority) in the develop¬
ment of nuclear power for naval propulsion, and has a general responsibility for
the application of nuclear propulsion in merchant ships; although practical develop¬
ment work is at present undertaken mainly by the Authority.
A number of other Government Departments are concerned with health and
safety in the atomic energy field.
The Government is provided with expert advice on radiation hazards by the
Medical and Agricultural Research Councils and by the Radioactive Substances
Advisory Committee. This Committee advises Ministers on the administration of
the Radioactive Substances Act, 1948, which deals with the restrictions necessary
on the use of radioactive substances and apparatus producing radiation.
The Atomic Energy Authority
The Atomic Energy Authority, members of which are appointed by the Prime
Minister, may consist of not fewer than eight and not more than eleven members,
including the chairman.
The Authority, like other statutory public corporations, is free from day-to-day
Government control (subject to the power given to the responsible Minister to
issue directions to the Authority in matters of over-riding national importance), but
differs from them in that the bulk of its revenue is derived from money voted by
Parliament and in that its accounts are certified by the Comptroller and Auditor
General.
The organisation is divided into three groups (see overleaf) controlling various
establishments (see map p. 203), and has a London office which is responsible for
202 BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
central financial, administrative and establishment matters, and for raw material
procurement.
The Research Group, centred at Harwell, Berkshire, conducts research into all
aspects of atomic energy. Much of its work is of a fundamental nature without
direct regard to particular applications. In addition to numerous research reactors,
Harwell houses Hermes—the largest isotope separator in Europe—and Zeta (Zero
Energy Thermonuclear Assembly), with which remarkable progress towards the
achievement of controlled thermonuclear reactions (the fusion process) was made
when, in November 1957, temperatures of 5 million degrees centigrade were
registered in the apparatus. Work has been started on designs for an advanced
version {Zeta II) which the UKAEA hopes will produce much higher temperatures.
This might open up the possibility of obtaining almost unlimited supplies of
energy from ordinary water. Most of the applied research at Harwell is now devoted
to peaceful uses of nuclear energy, although some assistance is given on specific
problems relating to weapons.
Construction has started on a second main research centre at Winfrith Heath in
Dorset, which will be concerned mainly with research into reactor design and
development. It will function as an out-station of Harwell, from which all controlled
thermonuclear work will be transferred to it during 1961-63. The Research Group
is concerned with preparing and distributing radioisotopes and other radioactive
substances; much of this work is done at the Radiochemical Centre, Amersham,
Buckinghamshire, which has been enlarged to meet a demand for radioactive
products which has more than trebled in the last three years. Harwell also runs
an Isotope School, started in April 1951, and a Reactor School, started in
September 1954, which provide training for home and overseas students.
The Industrial Group conducts the main production activities of the Authority.
With headquarters at Risley, Lancashire, it has factories at Springfields, Lancashire
(for uranium metal production and the manufacture of reactor fuel elements),
Capenhurst, Cheshire (for the production of enriched uranium); Windscale, Cum¬
berland (for the production of plutonium and the chemical processing of used fuel),
where, although reactor No. 1 is out of action as a result of an accident in October
I957» the chemical separation plant is being enlarged; and Calder Hall, Cumberland
(for the production of plutonium and electricity), where two pairs of reactors
were expected to be in operation by the end of 1958- A similar plant to Calder Hall
is under construction at Chapelcross, Dumfriesshire. The Industrial Group has a
large research and development branch which carries out much of the applied
research needed for factory design and operation. It is responsible for experimental
stations at Dounreay, housing an experimental fast-breeder reactor, a materials
testing reactor, and a prototype, land-based submarine reactor, and for research and
development laboratories at Springfields, Windscale, Capenhurst, Culcheth and
Dounreay. A Reactor Operation School was established at Calder Hall in 1957.
The Weapons Group, centred at Aldermaston, Berkshire, conducts research on
and development of nuclear weapons, including the explosion of test weapons,
both under Ministry of Supply contract and in its own right. The group also carries
out research work on controlled thermonuclear reactions.
National Institute for Research in Nuclear Science
In February 1957, the Government set up a National Institute for Research in
Nuclear Science, which provides, for common use by universities and others,
facilities and equipment which are beyond the scope of individual universities and
institutions carrying out research in the nuclear field. It does not replace the

research already being done in individual universities with assistance from Govern¬
ment funds; nor does it affect the Government’s participation in the international
scheme for common facilities set up in Geneva under the auspices of the European
Organisation for Nuclear Research (CERN). The Institute is financed in the main
by grants through the Atomic Energy Authority from the Atomic Energy Vote.
Work has started on the Rutherford High Energy Laboratory at Harwell which
will house the Institute’s proton synchrotron (particle accelerator). This 7,000
million electron volt apparatus will be one of the largest such machines in the world.
Other Government-sponsored Scientific Research
All Departments rely on one or other of the Government Research Councils for
scientific advice. While some use these bodies as their main source of scientific
information, a few have set up supplementary research organisations of their own.
Defence Research with Civil Applications
Research and development undertaken by the Admiralty is primarily directed to
meeting the requirements of the Royal Navy, but a substantial amount of this work
has important civil applications. For instance, the Admiralty is sponsoring research
into nuclear propulsion for ships both for the Royal and Merchant Navies. Further¬
more, the Admiralty is responsible through the Royal Naval Scientific Service for
inter-Service electronic valve research and development. The research activities of
the Royal Greenwich Observatory and the National Institute of Oceanography,
which are mainly in the civil field, are also administered by the Admiralty.
The Ministry of Supply carries out research needed to meet the technical require¬
ments of defence and is also responsible for research in some civilian fields, e.g., at
the Royal Aircraft Establishment, the National Gas Turbine Establishment at Farn-
borough, and the Royal Radar Establishment at Malvern. Some fundamental
research is also carried out for the Ministry by universities and industrial
organisations.
The Air Ministry is responsible for the Meteorological Office, where the research
carried out has many applications on the civil side.
Agriculture
Apart from research at the grant-aided Institutes and the centres financed by the
Agricultural Research Council and the Department of Agriculture for Scotland, the
Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food conducts research in its own Veterinary
Laboratories at Weybridge, Surrey, and at Lasswade, Midlothian, Scotland, and
also at its Plant Pathology Laboratory at Harpenden, Hertfordshire; and its In¬
festation Control Division at Tolworth, Surrey, conducts research into problems
affecting the destruction and control of insect pests of stored food, rodent pests
and other animal and bird pests. Limited research in entomology and helminthology
is carried out by the Department of Agriculture for Scotland at its plant pathology
laboratory in Edinburgh. In Northern Ireland, research in all the major agricultural
sciences is carried out directly by the Ministry of Agriculture.
Fisheries
The authorities concerned with fisheries research are: the Ministry of Agricul¬
ture, Fisheries and Food, which maintains four laboratories for marine, shell-fish,
salmon and freshwater fisheries research, and four research vessels; the Scottish
Home Department, which maintains a marine research laboratory, four research
ships at Aberdeen, and a freshwater research laboratory at Pitlochry; and the
Development Commissioners.
PROMOTION OF THE SCIENCES AND THE ARTS
205
The Development Commissioners, through their Advisory Committee on
Fishery Research, co-ordinate all fishery research. From the Development Fund
a number of independent institutions receive grants for marine and freshwater
research.1
Food
The Division of the Chief Scientific Adviser (Food) of the Ministry of Agricul¬
ture, Fisheries and Food advises the Minister on all scientific and technical aspects
of departmental food policy, identifies problems in food procurement, processing,
utilisation and distribution which require investigation, and arranges for such
investigations to be made. It also promotes the application of the results of research
either directly or in co-operation with the food industries concerned. To help in
doing so, it has experimental laboratories and kitchens in London and an experi¬
mental factory at Aberdeen. The Division is grouped into three sections dealing
with nutrition, food technology and food in relation to defence.
Forestry
The Forestry Commission undertakes experimental work relating to silvicultural
and allied problems. By means of grants, it also aids forest research work under¬
taken by various universities and other institutions, including the Imperial Forestry
Institute, Oxford.
Fuel and Pozver
The Ministry of Power has responsibility for research on safety in mines, and
plays a direct part in research such as that into the development of coal-consuming
gas turbines, underground gasification and total gasification. There is close colla¬
boration between the Ministry, the Scientific Departments of the National Coal
Board, the Electricity Council and Scottish Electricity Boards, the Gas Council,
and the Fuel Research Station of the Department of Scientific and Industrial
Research, all of which are responsible for research in their own fields.
Transport
The Ministry of Transport and Civil Aviation is concerned with research into
aspects of marine navigation, road construction and airport operations, but most
of the basic work is carried out for the Ministry by the Admiralty, the Department
of Scientific and Industrial Research and the Ministry of Supply. Research on
radio aids for marine navigation, for instance, is undertaken by the Admiralty.
Land Use and Planning
The Ministry of Housing and Local Government is responsible for policy relating
to the use and development of land in England and Wales. Through its Technical
Services Directorate, the Ministry deals with technical planning and geographical,
geological, economic and sociological research. Similar arrangements are made for
Scotland by the Department of Health for Scotland. The Ministry of Health and
Local Government is responsible for the general administration of the planning
legislation in Northern Ireland.
Building
The Ministry of Works is responsible for reviewing the whole field of research
and technical development of the building industry and for ensuring that the results
of research are made available to the industry.

BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Communications
The Post Office undertakes scientific research on a wide range of subjects relating
to telephone, telegraph and radio systems which is carried out by the Research
Branch of the Engineering Department. Examples of such research are the gradual
introduction of automatic dialling for long-distance telephone calls, starting with
the Bristol exchange in 1958, and the progressive mechanisation of postal operations.
It also undertakes the experimental development of radio transmitters and receivers
for Post Office services and other Government Departments. Development in the
application of electronics for the telephone services is being planned in conjunction
with industry through the Joint Electronic Research Committee. The Post Office
keeps in close touch with the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) and the
Independent Television Authority (ITA) in connection with the development of
broadcasting techniques.
Analytical Chemistry
The Department of the Government Chemist is responsible for providing
analytical services to all Government Departments that may require them. It carries
out special investigations, e.g., in connection with nutritional and physiological
surveys, and conducts fundamental research in infra-red spectrography, chroma¬
tography and X-ray study of crystals.
Medicine and Health
In addition to the work carried on under the aegis of the Medical Research
Council, the Ministry of Health may conduct and promote research into the cause,
prevention and treatment of illness or mental defectiveness.
The Department of Health for Scotland has similar responsibilities, in the
discharge of which it is advised by its Advisory Committee on Medical Research;
liaison with the Medical Research Council is also maintained.
In Northern Ireland, the Hospitals Authority (a statutory body set up by the
Minister of Health and Local Government) has power to conduct or assist medical
research. In addition, it has a statutory duty to provide adequate bacteriological
and pathological services.
The General Register Office carries out research in four main fields: (1) analysis
and interpretation of statistics of causes of death; (2) statistical inquiry into the
treatment of cancer and its results; (3) morbidity as revealed in hospital statistics;
and (4) mental health.
Colonial Research
The bulk of the research work relating to Colonial development is done in the
Colonial territories, but much of it requires close collaboration with research
institutes and laboratories in Britain. It is the function of the Colonial Research
Council to co-ordinate the work of the specialist committees and to advise on
general questions relating to policy. The specialist bodies concerned deal with
research into such subjects as agriculture, animal health, forestry, medicine, social
science and colonial products.
Anti-Locust Research
Since 1929, the Government has financed an Anti-Locust Research Centre in
London which, since 1931, has been internationally adopted as the world centre
for locust research. This organisation has during the past twenty years received
and co-ordinated information on locust movements and breeding from some 40
countries, undertaken scientific research into the life-history and habits of the
different species, and investigated and developed methods for their control and
destruction.
PROMOTION OF THE SCIENCES AND THE ARTS 207
Other Research Work
There are a number of scientific institutions administered by Government
Departments which undertake a certain amount of research work in addition to
their other scientific activities. These include the Royal Botanic Gardens (Kew)
and the Ordnance Survey Department, both now administered by the Ministry of
Agriculture, Fisheries and Food. The main library at Kew Gardens, attached to
the Herbarium, one of the amenities offered to research workers, was founded in
1853 and consists of more than 50,000 botanical books, including a section of books
on botanical exploration. The library is classified both by subject and geographic¬
ally, and contains a valuable collection of prints and drawings of plants. Two
branch libraries at Kew comprise books on gardening and on economic botany
respectively. The Ordnance Survey was founded in 1791 to prepare a map of Great
Britain mainly for defence purposes. The present work of the Survey is chiefly
civil in character (see p. 47).
Scientific Museums
The British Museum (Natural History)—an independent section of the British
Museum—contains one of the world’s largest collections of natural history material
and is recognised as a leading research institution.
The Science Museum illustrates the development of pure and applied science
in all countries, but chiefly in Great Britain which has always held a leading place
in engineering, agriculture, navigation, mining, aeronautics, and in the development
of industrial machinery and processes, all of which are represented in the Museum’s
collections. The geology of Britain is known in more exact detail than that of any
other country in the world, and the Geological Survey (since 1919 an establishment
of DSIR), responsible for this work, has an outstanding collection of exhibits in
its Geological Museum. These three museums are in South Kensington, London.
Important collections outside London are the Museum of Science and Industry,
Birmingham, and the Museum of the History of Science, Oxford.
The Parliamentary and Scientific Committee
The Parliamentary and Scientific Committee was founded at the end of 1939 by
members of the House of Commons and replaced the former Parliamentary Science
Committee. It is one of a number of informal, unofficial, all-party parliamentary
groups which have grown up spontaneously and have a varying degree of influence.
Membership is open to members of Parliament of any party and in both Houses,
and also to nominated representatives of such non-profit-making scientific and
technological organisations in Britain as may be affiliated under its constitution.
Membership in 1957 comprised 180 members of Parliament and representatives of
103 scientific and technological institutions.
Broadly speaking, the activities of the committee are to provide, as far as possible,
for a regular exchange of information between members of Parliament and scientists,
and to endeavour to ensure that action is taken to correct matters seen to be wrong
in the light of such information.
Scientific Liaison Overseas
The history of scientific progress is essentially a story involving many nations;
the organisation of a country’s scientific research would be incomplete without
provision for adequate liaison with other countries.
Before the second world war, international scientific collaboration took place
through the exchange of university staffs, the awards of scholarships and fellow¬
ships, the close relations existing between the learned societies in Britain and their
equivalent bodies abroad, and through international conferences and congresses.
2o8
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
The war and the post-war period saw the emergence of a number of new develop¬
ments in overseas scientific collaboration, including the exchange of scientific
information. Well-known examples are the specialised agencies of the United
Nations Organisation, e.g., the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural
Organisation, the World Health Organisation, the Food and Agriculture Organisa¬
tion, and those concerned with nuclear energy, e.g., the International Atomic
Energy Agency, the European Organisation for Nuclear Research (CERN) and
the European Nuclear Energy Agency, in all of which the United Kingdom is
playing a full part.
Among the various channels through which scientific liaison is conducted are:
1. The British Commonwealth Scientific Offices. A feature of the war-time pattern
of scientific collaboration was the establishment of Scientific Missions, in London
by the United States and the Commonwealth countries, and in Washington by the
United Kingdom and the other Commonwealth countries; the latter subsequently
joined together as the British Commonwealth Scientific Office in Washington.
Since 1948 the Scientific Offices in London of the Commonwealth countries, set
up after the war, have been located in the same building, and are closely associated
with the Overseas Liaison Division of the DSIR.
2. The Standing Committee on Overseas Scientific Relations. This is a committee
of the Advisory Council, on Scientific Policy which was set up after the war to
consider and advise on United Kingdom Government policy on matters of overseas
scientific relations. The chairman of the Advisory Council on Scientific Policy acts
as its chairman, and its secretariat is provided jointly by the Office of the Lord
President of the Council and the Overseas Liaison Division of the DSIR.
3. The Overseas Liaison Division of the DSIR. This Division, in addition to its
executive work for the Committee on Overseas Scientific Relations, is also respon¬
sible for the administration of the United Kingdom Scientific Missions in Washing¬
ton and Bonn, the Offices of the Scientific Attaches in Paris and Stockholm, and
any further posts wLich may be created, and for ensuring that information collected
by them is effectively disseminated in the United Kingdom. Both the Missions and
Attaches and the Overseas Liaison Division itself have interdepartmental responsi¬
bilities. although the Overseas Liaison Division is placed within the DSIR for
convenience of organisation.
4. Commomvealth Agricultural Bureaux. Machinery exists in the Commonwealth
Agricultural Bureaux for liaison in the field of agricultural science between coun¬
tries of the Commonwealth. In the United Kingdom there are ten Bureaux,
specialising in various branches of agricultural science, and two Institutes—the
Commonwealth Mycological Institute and the Commonwealth Institute of Ento¬
mology. A third Institute, the Commonwealth Institute of Biological Control, has
its headquarters in Ottawa, Canada. The Bureaux collect, collate and disseminate
information resulting from agricultural research.
5. The British Council. The aims of the British Council in the pure and applied
sciences are to foster closer co-operation between British scientists and scientists of
other countries, and to promote a better understanding of Britain among overseas
specialists by disseminating a knowledge of British activities and achievements.
Under the first objective the exchange of visits between scientists in the United
Kingdom and other countries is of prime importance. Besides arranging lecture or
advisory tours overseas by eminent British scientists, the British Council, among
many activities of a similar nature, brings to the United Kingdom every year a
PROMOTION OF THE SCIENCES AND THE ARTS
209
number of senior overseas specialists, postgraduate students and technicians on
visits of varying duration, for the purpose of study in British universities and other
institutions, or for discussion with British experts. In addition to publishing the
British Medical Bulletin, intended primarily to keep overseas specialists informed of
progress in medical research in Britain, the Council maintains an extensive and
much used specialist information service. In the 66 countries in which the British
Council is represented, libraries are maintained and in many instances these have
strong sections of scientific and technological literature.
The British Council maintains at its headquarters specialist departments for
medicine and science (including agriculture and engineering), while in some coun¬
tries scientists are attached to its overseas representatives. The Council is advised by
eminent scientists who serve on its Science Advisory Committee and on specialist
panels for the different subjects.
Contribution to the International Geophysical Year
The United Kingdom has taken a leading part in the International Geophysical
Year (IGY), which started on 1st July, 1957, and continued for eighteen months
until the end of 1958. During this period, scientists of some 60 nations participated
in an internationally planned and co-ordinated attempt to extend and intensify
observation of the physical phenomena of the Earth.
A number of important posts connected with this project, including that of
president of the special committee controlling all IGY operations, were held by
United Kingdom scientists.
The Royal Society of London planned a co-ordinated research effort by Govern¬
ment Departments, universities and other institutions. It obtained Government
grants, totalling about £650,000, to cover costs of additional expenditure on IGY.
Nearly half the United Kingdom contribution was spent on the IGY Antarctic
Expedition, and other work included studies of the upper atmosphere from stations
in the United Kingdom and its dependent territories. A Commonwealth Trans-
Antarctic Expedition, financed partly by the various Commonwealth Governments
and partly privately, was planned independently of the IGY but coincided with
it and contributed to it. On 2nd March, 1958, the expedition reached Scott Base,
Ross Island, after a journey of 99 days—the first occasion on which Antarctica had
been crossed by land. British-built instruments were used all over the world during
the IGY; and in Britain itself, the Jodrell Bank radio telescope, among many other
instruments, was used to provide data.
Expenditure on Research and Development
A review of the pattern of the research and development effort in Great Britain,
published in the Annual Report of the Advisory Council on Scientific Policy for
i956-57> Cmnd. 278, indicated that in the year 1955-56 Britain spent about £300
million on research and development (though this figure is subject to a margin of
error). Of the total expenditure, some £185 million was spent by private industry,
mainly by aircraft, electrical engineering and chemical firms, which together spent
about 75 per cent.
Further details are shown in Table 8.
The survey also showed that, according to the most reliable estimates available,
about 46,600 professionally qualified scientists and engineers were engaged on
research and development in the United Kingdom, including about 2,200 research
workers in agriculture and medicine. About half of these are employed by private
industry and slightly more than one-tenth by the defence Departments.

THE PROMOTION OF THE ARTS
The preservation of Britain’s cultural heritage and the promotion of literature
and the arts are the active concern of a number of official and unofficial bodies.
There is no Ministry of Fine Arts or equivalent organisation to formulate or
administer policy in the arts, though bodies such as the Standing Commission on
Museums and Galleries (appointed 1931) and the Royal Fine Art Commissions for
England and for Scotland (appointed in 1924 and 1927, respectively) act in an
advisory capacity. Government interest in the arts is expressed mainly through the
provision of grants to such bodies as the Arts Council, the British Council (see
p. 164), the British Film Institute (see p. 221), and the Council of Industrial Design
PROMOTION OF THE SCIENCES AND THE ARTS
211
(see p. 214), and also to the national museums and art galleries. For the year 1958-59
Government expenditure on the arts (which, in 1938-39, amounted to a little more
than £900,000) is estimated at over £6-8 million. Of this total, nearly £3 million
is the cost of the national art collections, over £1 million the amount of the grant
to the Arts Council, and more than £1 million is expenditure on preserving
historic houses and their contents. In addition, under the Local Government Act,
1948, local authorities may use part of the revenue from the rates for the encourage¬
ment of the arts. Local education authorities also make grants to some schools of
art, music and drama.
The Arts Council of Great Britain was established under a Royal Charter in 1946.
It consists of not more than 16 honorary members appointed by the Chancellor of
the Exchequer in consultation with the Minister of Education and the Secretary of
State for Scotland. Its main duties are to increase the accessibility of the fine arts to
the public, to improve the standard of execution in the fine arts, and to advise and
to co-operate with Government Departments, local authorities and other organisa¬
tions on any matter connected directly or indirectly with these objects. The corre¬
sponding body in Northern Ireland is the Council for the Encouragement of Music
and the Arts (CEMA).
Unofficial institutions concerned with the promotion of the arts include many
charitable trusts and foundations, e.g., the Carnegie United Kingdom Trust, the
Pilgrim Trust, the United Kingdom branch of the Calouste Gulbenkian Founda¬
tion and a large number of societies, associations and other organisations concerned
with separate aspects of the arts, some of which are mentioned later in this chapter.
The Carnegie United Kingdom Trust was founded in 1913 by the late Andrew
Carnegie. It was incorporated under Royal Charter in 1917. The Trust, which was
initially founded for ‘the improvement of the well-being of the masses of the people
of Great Britain and Ireland’, consists of 25 life trustees, 6 trustees nominated by
the Corporation of Dunfermline and 3 trustees nominated by the Fife County
Council. Its cultural policies include the support of adult amateur activities in
music, drama and the visual arts. It also supports non-national museums. Grants
totalling approximately £20,864 were made for these purposes during the year
ended 31st December, 1957.
The Pilgrim Trust was founded in 1930 by the late Edward Stephen Harkness, an
American citizen. The Trust, which has an income of about £150,000 a year, is
administered by a body of trustees who are empowered to make grants towards
any legally charitable object within the United Kingdom. In fact, the greater part
of the Trust’s income is at present being used to help to preserve the nation’s
heritage of architecture and history, and for the advancement of learning and the
arts. The grants made for these objects during 1957 amounted to £132,185.
The Calouste Gulbenkian Foundation of Lisbon was established under the will of
the late Calouste Gulbenkian who died in 1955. The Foundation has a branch in
the United Kingdom, which is responsible for the Foundation’s activities in Britain
and in other Commonwealth countries. During 1957, grants totalling £296,655
were made in the United Kingdom, of which £172,325 represented grants for the
arts. The Foundation has asked a small private committee, under the chairmanship
of Lord Bridges, to examine the needs of the arts in Britain and report to the
trustees.
It was announced in June 1958 that the Independent Television programme
companies (see Chapter XIV) are to spend £100,000 a year on the encouragement
of the arts. A co-ordinating committee is being set up to ensure that the donations
of the individual companies do not overlap.

VISUAL ARTS
There are at present a number of British painters and sculptors of international
repute as well as younger artists of great promise; and interest in their work and
that of their contemporaries overseas, as well as in that of British and foreign artists
of the past, is most marked in all sections of the community. This wider interest
in visual art has not stopped at appreciation. There is evidence of this fact in the
large numbers attending evening art classes, the growth of local art groups and
local exhibitions, and the support given to holiday painting schools.
The fine arts of painting and sculpture in Britain receive State support by grants
to national institutions and, indirectly, through grants made to the Arts Council,
to municipal art galleries and museums, and to local education authorities for art
schools and other means of promoting education in art.
In the year April 1957 to the end of March 1958 the Arts Council arranged 81
separate art exhibitions in Great Britain; 336 showings of these exhibitions were
given in 172 different centres. Knowledge of Britain’s fine arts is fostered overseas
by the British Council by means of exhibitions, the dissemination of reproductions
and photographs, lectures, and the provision of information and advice to inquirers
abroad and to visitors in Britain. In the year ended March 1958, 29 fine art exhi¬
bitions organised by the Council were shown in 40 countries. The Council was also
responsible for British participation in seven international exhibitions. Since 1948,
twenty international awards have been won by British artists.
Museums and Art Galleries
There are in all about 800 museums and art galleries open to the public in the
United Kingdom, though many are only small collections or merely a few rooms
set aside in a public building for the display of local treasures.
The national museums and art galleries in London probably contain between
them the most comprehensive collection of objects of artistic, archaeological,
scientific, historical and general interest ever to exist within one city. The British
Museum, which celebrated its bicentenary in 1953, has unparalleled collections of
archaeological and ethnographical material from every part of the world, in addi¬
tion to housing the national library of printed books, manuscripts, newspapers and
periodicals; its Department of Prints and Drawings also possesses collections of the
widest extent and richness. The Victoria and Albert Museum contains works of
fine and applied art of all countries and periods, arranged mainly according to
material, though since the war primary collections have been arranged to bring
together, by style, period or nationality, masterpieces of all the arts. The National
Gallery presents paintings by almost all the greatest European masters. The Tate
Gallery embodies two collections: the British school from the eighteenth century
onwards, with a few earlier works, and modern foreign schools since 1850. Both
sections include modern sculpture. Frequent loan exhibitions are held in the gallery.
Other important collections in London are at the National Portrait Gallery, the
Imperial War Museum, the National Maritime Museum at Greenwich, the London
Museum (reopened in Kensington Palace in 1951), which illustrates the history of
the capital, and Hertford House, where the Wallace Collection (furniture, armour,
objets d’art and paintings, mainly French of the seventeenth and eighteenth
centuries) is housed.
The Ministry of Education is responsible for the administration of the Victoria
and Albert Museum and the Science Museum.1 The other national institutions
have their own Boards of Trustees, but all receive Treasury grants.
For information on the scientific museums, see p. 207.
PROMOTION OF THE SCIENCES AND THE ARTS
213
There are five national museums and art galleries in Edinburgh: the National
Museum of Antiquities of Scotland, the National Gallery of Scotland, the Royal
Scottish Museum, the National Portrait Gallery of Scotland, and the Scottish
United Services Museum; and in Cardiff is the National Museum of Wales with
its branch at St. Fagan’s Castle where the Welsh Folk Museum is housed. A
Northern Irish Folk Museum is being established in Belfast. The Belfast Museum
and Art Gallery is municipally owned, but serves unofficially as a national institu¬
tion for the whole of Northern Ireland.
Almost every city and large town has a museum devoted to art, archaeology and
natural history, usually owned by the municipal authority but sometimes by a local
learned society or privately by individuals or trustees to whom some rich collector
in the past has bequeathed his treasures. Both Oxford and Cambridge are rich in
museums—the Ashmolean Museum in Oxford, founded in 1683, is the oldest in the
country and the Fitzwilliam Museum in Cambridge has fine art galleries and a
notable collection of engravings, manuscripts and book's bequeathed by its founder
on his death in 1861. Other universities have important collections, primarily for
teaching purposes but also open to the public. Other cities with important museums
and art galleries are Birmingham, Bristol, Glasgow, Leeds, Leicester, Liverpool,
Manchester, Norwich, Southampton, and York where the Castle Museum, with
its complete reconstruction of an eighteenth-century street of shops, offers a most
interesting historical display. In recent years there has been a notable development
of ‘period-house museums’, in which outstanding examples of the private residences
of former times have been taken over by national and municipal authorities for this
purpose, as at Temple Newsam, Leeds; Aston Hall, Birmingham; and the Royal
Pavilion, Brighton. Private art collections are to be seen in the historic family
mansions (including many in the ownership of the National Trust) which are now
open to the public at certain times.
Temporary exhibitions produced by the Arts Council, the Art Exhibitions
Bureau, and the Circulation Department of the Victoria and Albert Museum, are
a regular feature of many museums.
The Museums Association, founded in 1889, is an independent organisation to
which museums and art galleries and members of their staffs throughout the
country belong; there are also many overseas members. The Association serves as
the central body for the collection of information and the discussion of matters
relating to museum administration and practice, and as a training and examining
body for professional qualifications. It also produces directories, a monthly journal,
and other publications.
Financial assistance for improving the displays of the smaller museums is among
the functions of the Carnegie United Kingdom Trust, which has done much to
encourage the growth of the museum movement during the past thirty years, and
at present expends an average of £10,000 a year in this field.
The various national art exhibiting societies include the Royal Academy, which,
in summer, holds exhibitions of works by members and non-members and, in
winter, exhibitions usually devoted to national schools of painting; the Royal
Society of British Artists; the Royal Institute of Oil Painters; the Royal Society
of Painters in Water Colours; the Royal Society of Portrait Painters; the
Women’s International Art Club; and the London Group (all the foregoing are
associations of professional painters); and the Institute of Contemporary Arts.
Some of these societies, notably the Royal Academy at Burlington House, have their
own galleries in London. There are also an increasing number of amateur art
societies throughout the United Kingdom which hold local exhibitions and
encourage local interest in the fine arts in a variety of ways. The Contemporary Art
214
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Society uses its members’ subscriptions to buy modern works which it presents to
the public galleries.
Exhibitions of works by old masters and living artists are held throughout the
year in the galleries of the art dealers of Bond Street and other parts of the West
End of London. The Whitechapel Art Gallery shows a series of exhibitions in the
East End of London; and the London County Council has shown an exhibition
of modern sculpture in one of its parks every third year since the second world war.
There are also exhibitions of children’s art, including the Children’s Royal
Academy Exhibition (which, in 1958, was held at the Guildhall in London).
Art Education
There are 15 colleges of art in the United Kingdom, each serving a region, all
of which offer courses in most branches of art and a varying range of crafts; and
there are schools of art in nearly all the larger towns. In London, the most notable
of these schools and colleges are the Royal College of Art (a national college) and
the Central School of Arts and Crafts of the London County Council, in both of
which the emphasis is on industrial design, and the Slade School of Fine Arts in
the University of London. At the Royal Academy Schools, founded in 1768, all
instruction is provided free by Royal Academicians.
The leading academic institutions for the teaching and study of the history of art
are the Courtauld Institute of the University of London, the Department of
Classical Art and Archaeology in University College, London, and the Warburg
Institute (also a part of London University) which provides facilities for research
on the character and history of the classical tradition.
Art has a place in the curriculum of every type of school and the Society for
Education through Art encourages the purchase by schools of original works of art.
Industrial Design
The Council of Industrial Design was set up in 1944 by the President of the
Board of Trade as a grant-aided body with the purpose of promoting the improve¬
ment of design in the products of British industry. The Council has 24 members, a
majority being prominent industrialists, and there is a separate Scottish Committee.
The Council runs a permanent exhibition, at The Design Centre, in the Hay-
market, London. This is a selective, changing display of well-designed British
consumer goods in current production. To supplement this display, an illustrated
record of good design, known as Design Index, is also maintained at the Centre.
In addition, the Council organises conferences and courses, and maintains a record
of designers and a photographic and reference library on industrial design. It has an
education section and a retail section and publishes a monthly magazine, Design.
Other bodies concerned with industrial design include the Royal Society of Arts
(see p. 193), the Society of Industrial Artists, which is the representative pro¬
fessional body in Great Britain of designers engaged in industry and commerce,
and the Design and Industries Association (DIA), founded in 1914. The DIA is a
voluntary association of industrial companies, designers, and other bodies and
individuals interested in the promotion of good design in industry.
Architecture
The Government’s responsibility towards the nation’s architecture is exercised
on the one hand in encouraging the best and seeking to prevent the worst in new
building and, on the other, in preserving the best that has been inherited from the
past.
The Government Departments chiefly concerned with domestic architecture are
the Ministry of Housing and Local Government, the Department of Health for
PROMOTION OF THE SCIENCES AND THE ARTS 2X5
Scotland, and the Northern Ireland Ministry of Health and Local Government,
which are responsible in their respective countries for approving the layout and
design of local authority housing schemes, and which issue reports and circulars
setting standards for local authority housing. The Ministry of Housing and Local
Government also encourages high standards by offering, each year, medals for the
best-designed houses. The Education Departments are responsible for the super¬
vision of building for the public education service. The Ministry of Works is the
Department concerned with the construction and maintenance of Government
buildings and also with the preservation of historic buildings and ancient monu¬
ments in Great Britain. In Northern Ireland, responsibility for the preservation of
ancient buildings is vested in the Ministry of Finance. All these Departments have
architects on their staffs.
A number of professional, advisory and other societies and institutions exist to
further the interests of architecture and the preservation of buildings of aesthetic
value or historic interest.
Several State-sponsored organisations are concerned with special aspects of
architecture. The Royal Fine Art Commission and the Royal Fine Art Commission
for Scotland, both bodies of experts appointed by Royal Warrant, advise Govern¬
ment Departments and other public and quasi-public bodies on questions of public
amenity or artistic importance. The National Buildings Record maintains a library
(open to the public for consultation) of photographs of English and Welsh archi¬
tecture and an index of architectural records in public and private possession. The
Royal Commissions on Ancient and Historical Monuments for England, for Wales
and Monmouthshire, and for Scotland, record in detail all ancient and historical
remains in their countries and publish a series of surveys, designed ultimately to
cover the whole of Great Britain. The Ancient Monuments Boards for England,
Scotland, and Wales, set up under the Ancient Monuments Acts, consider which
monuments should be listed in accordance with those Acts and advise the Minister
of Works on any questions concerning ancient monuments. The Historic Buildings
Councils for England, Scotland, and Wales, which were constituted under the
Historic Buildings and Ancient Monuments Act, 1953, advise the Minister on the
provision of grants towards the repair and maintenance of such buildings and their
contents. An Historic Buildings Bureau finds new uses for unoccupied historic
buildings of outstanding interest.
The leading professional architectural institution in the United Kingdom is the
Royal Institute of British Architects (RIBA), which holds meetings at which papers
are read and discussed, publishes a Journal, holds exhibitions, promotes and
controls the training of architects through its Board of Architectural Education,
and has one of the largest and most important architectural libraries in the world,
housing over 65,000 books, periodicals and drawings. There are also the Incor¬
porated Association of Architects and Surveyors, the Institute of Registered
Architects and the Royal Incorporation of Architects in Scotland. Other societies
include the Architectural Association, the Architecture Club, and a number of
societies interested in particular aspects of architecture, such as the Modular
Society.
Among the preservation societies are the Georgian Group, which is a society
designed to awaken interest in Georgian architecture and to save Georgian buildings
from destruction; the Society for the Protection of Ancient Buildings; the National
Trust in England, Wales and Northern Ireland and the National Trust for Scot¬
land, which together own more than a hundred houses of historic or architectural
interest, many of which contain pictures and other works of art which are on view
to the public; and the Historic Churches Preservation Trust, formed in 1952, under
P
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
2l6
the chairmanship of the Archbishop of Canterbury. The Trust aims to raise £4
million to supplement the efforts of parishes to put their churches into good repair,
and by the end of 1957 had made grants totalling over £327,000 to 727 churches
and chapels.
Education in architecture is given at 21 schools of architecture recognised for
exemption from the RIBA Intermediate and Final Examinations and 5 schools of
architecture recognised for exemption from the Intermediate Examination only.
There are also 45 schools of art and technical institutions (9 full-time) with facilities
for the instruction of intending architects, which prepare students for taking
externally the examinations of the RIBA. It is against the law for any person to
practise or carry out work under any name, style or title containing the word
‘architect’ unless he or she is registered. The statutory body which regulates
registration is the Architects’ Registration Council of the United Kingdom.
LITERATURE
A knowledge of literature is fostered in the United Kingdom by the schools,
colleges and universities of the country, in all of which English literature is taught
either as part of a general course or as a specialist subject. Interest in the subject is
thereafter maintained by the libraries, by the very large number of private literary
societies (both national and local), by book reviews in the press, and on the radio,
and by the numerous periodicals concerned in whole or in part with literature, of
which the best-known critical weekly is The Times Literary Supplement. State
support for literature is given through the Arts Council, which assists poetry—
especially poetry readings—in Great Britain. The British Council is active in
encouraging a knowledge of English literature abroad. Recognition of outstanding
literary merit is given in the form of literary prizes, a number of which are awarded
annually, e.g., the two James Tait Black Memorial prizes for biography and
literature, the John Llewellyn Rhys Memorial prize for young writers of promise,
the Hawthornden prize for imaginative writing, the Library Association Carnegie
Medal for an outstanding book for children, the Kate Greenaway Medal for the
best children’s book illustration and the Somerset Maugham award for young
writers.
Libraries
The largest library in Britain is that of the British Museum in London (more
than s million volumes). The National Library of Scotland (nearly 2 million
volumes) is in Edinburgh, and that of Wales in Aberystwyth (more than ij million
volumes). Together with the Bodleian Library in Oxford (over 2 million volumes)
and the Cambridge University Library (some 2 million volumes) these comprise the
‘copyright’ libraries of the country and are entitled to receive a copy of each new
book published in Britain: the British Museum Library must receive a copy, the
other libraries may claim one.
Other great libraries include1 2: the University of London Central Library-, the
libraries of the universities of Edinburgh, Glasgow and St. Andrews, and Queen s
University Library, Belfast; London Library (the largest public subscription
library) and the John Rylands Library, Manchester; the Science Museum Library,
1 This list provides only an arbitrary selection of some of the largest libraries. Unless
otherwise stated these libraries are in London where there are more than 500 libraries;
and see also pp. 193-4.
2 The total holding of all the libraries (college and special) of London University is over
2J million volumes.
PROMOTION OF THE SCIENCES AND THE ARTS
217
the Victoria and Albert Museum Art Library and the British Museum (Natural
History) Library; the Patent Office Library, the India Office Library and the Public
Record Office Library (which contains the National Archives and the National
Register of Archives, a register and summary of local and private collections of
records); the libraries of the Royal Institute of International Affairs, the Royal
Commonwealth Society, the Commonwealth Institute, the Royal Geographical
Society, the British Drama League, the Royal Institute of British Architects, the
Royal College of Music and the Royal Academy of Music; the Central Music
Library; and the National Library for the Blind. The Arts Council has founded a
reference library of modem English poetry, which is housed with the National
Book League.
An important feature of library services in Britain is the co-operation within the
closely knit network of libraries which greatly increases the value of the service.
Library co-operation is organised regionally in the first instance, through Regional
Library Bureaux, and is finally centralised in the National Central Library with
its widespread system of outlier libraries (public, university and special) giving
access to a total stock of some 21 million books.
The public libraries of Britain maintain a service throughout the country,
administered by 597 public library authorities (county councils, county borough
councils, municipal borough councils and urban district councils). Together these
authorities provide more than 32,160 service points; they hold over 66 million
books and make more than 419 million loans a year. A feature of the service in
rural areas is the travelling van, which is an itinerant library.
In addition to lending books, music scores and gramophone records, and pro¬
viding special libraries for, among others, children, patients in hospitals and
prisoners, public libraries engage in many kinds of extension activities, such as play
readings, lectures, film shows, music circles and co-operation in University Exten¬
sion adult education.
In 1957, the Minister of Education set up a committee, on which local authorities,
national, special and university libraries are represented, to consider the structure
of the public library in England and Wales and to advise ‘what changes should be
made in administrative arrangements, regard being had to the relation of public
libraries to other libraries’.
The two principal organisations to which librarians belong are the Library
Association and the Association of Special Libraries and Information Bureaux
(ASLIB). The Library Association endeavours to unite librarians and governors of
libraries throughout the world and, through its many meetings, conferences,
personal service and publications, including its official journal The Library Associa¬
tion Record, to provide for their general and specialised professional interests.
ASLIB, which is a documentation centre and is financed by the Department of
Scientific and Industrial Research, operates in a more specialised field. One of its
activities, for example, is the maintenance of an index of translations, especially
from Russian and German, which have been or are being made in Britain.
Books
New books constitute the large majority of all books published annually in
Britain—in 1957, f°r example, British publishers issued a total of 20,719 separate
titles, of which only 5,921 were reprints or new editions. In that year, the annual
figures for new titles under literary subject headings were: bibliography and literary
history, 358; biography, 563; essays, 114; fiction, 3,737; poetry and drama, 568.
Some classes of books are produced as Government publications by Her Majesty’s
Stationery Office, which is the largest publishing organisation in Britain; the great
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
2l8
majority of books, however, are produced by some 350 commercial publishers,
including the university presses, notably the Cambridge University Press and the
Clarendon Press (Oxford), which publish many outstanding learned works. The
Clarendon Press is part of the Oxford University Press, which also has a publishing
department in London.
Leading organisations representing the interests of those concerned with book
production and distribution are the Publishers’ Association, the Booksellers’
Association, and the Society of Authors.
Literary and Philological Societies and Institutions
Societies and institutions concerned with the promotion of literature in its various
forms include: the National Book League, which encourages the reading of and an
interest in books, and which holds exhibitions, including the widely popular annual
exhibitions of book design; the English Association, which aims at upholding the
standard of English writing and speech; and the Royal Society of Literature,
which is concerned with the advancement of literature. Both the Royal Society of
Edinburgh, which promotes science and literature, and the British Academy, which
is an organisation concerned with humanistic studies and has a section dealing with
literature and philology, receive grants from the Treasury.
Interest in poetry is encouraged by the Poetry Society; by the annual National
Eisteddfod—the bardic festival held in Wales, the origins of which date back to the
seventh century; and by the Apollo Society, which, supported by the Arts Council,
presents a number of poetry readings in which music as well as poetry forms part
of the programme
Among the specialist societies are the Early English Text Society, the Biblio¬
graphical Society, the Harleian Society, the Saltire Society, and several societies
devoted to particular authors, of which the largest is the Dickens Fellowship.
There are also a number of clubs and societies, such as the Book Society, which
exist to distribute selected new books to their members. The most recently estab¬
lished is the Poetry Book Society, which was set up in 1954 under the auspices of
the Arts Council.
DRAMA
State patronage of the drama is expressed through the Arts Council, which grants
subsidies to certain theatrical managements operating on a non-profit-making basis
(i.e. using profits to finance future productions), provided that such managements
have given evidence of serious aims and of consistently high standards of practical
competence; and through the British Council, which is responsible for making the
British theatre better known abroad by organising and sponsoring international
tours by important companies, including the Old Vic Theatre Company aud the
Shakespeare Memorial Theatre Company, and by sending overseas exhibitions of
theatrical design and lecturers on drama. The Treasury is empowered, under the
National Theatre Act, 1949, to support the scheme for a national theatre by con¬
tributing £1 million to the cost of building and equipping a theatre, in London,
which would operate under public auspices.
Professional Theatre
The centre of the professional theatre is in London, where there are some 40
principal theatres and a number of suburban and ‘little’ theatres. These are let to
producing managements on a commercial basis for every type of theatrical enter¬
tainment. There are also theatres in Scotland, Northern Ireland and in the pro¬
vinces of England and Wales, which are served by productions touring either before
PROMOTION OF THE SCIENCES AND THE ARTS
219
or after London presentation, by companies specially formed for touring, and by
local repertory companies. In 1958, the first full scale theatre to be built by a civic
authority was opened in Coventry; this was also the first new public theatre to be
built in Great Britain since 1939.
In addition to managements which rent theatres for limited or long runs, there
are a few companies which produce plays in theatres of their own. Among the
older and better known of these organisations are the Old Vic Theatre Company in
London and the Shakespeare Memorial Theatre Company at Stratford-upon-Avon.
In 1956, the English Stage Company was established at the Royal Court Theatre in
Sloane Square, London, where it presents a series of contemporary plays. Local
repertory companies (some of which are assisted financially and otherwise by the
Arts Council or, in Northern Ireland, by CEMA) may have the use of their own
established repertory theatres, e.g., the Bristol Old Vic Company at the historic
Theatre Royal in Bristol, or they may tour the various towns and villages in the
locality, playing from one to several nights in each place and using any building
which can be made suitable for the purpose. The English Children’s Theatre, a
non-profit-making organisation, presents children’s plays in London and the
provinces. The Open Air Theatre in Regent’s Park, London, has been used for
many summer seasons of repertory, mainly of Shakespeare and other poetic drama.
The Ulster Group Theatre in Belfast specialises in Irish drama. Inevitably, the
work of repertory companies varies in quality but, generally speaking, the standard
of both production and acting is high; many of the leading dramatists, producers,
actors and actresses in the United Kingdom started their careers in repertory.
Theatre clubs for regular patrons are run in connection with some of these
company-owned theatres. Where seats are sold only to theatre club members (e.g.,
the Arts Theatre, London, and the New Shakespeare Theatre, Liverpool) the plays
are not subject to the normal requirement that they must be passed by the Lord
Chamberlain1 before presentation.
The Theatres Act, 1843, which deals with the licensing of theatres and plays,
requires all new plays to be approved by the Lord Chamberlain, who may forbid
the presentation of any play ‘for the preservation of good manners, decorum, or of
the public peace’. The number of plays for which a licence is refused amounts to
little over one per cent.
Both in London and in the provinces, most managers and artists are members of
one or another of the professional organisations which exist to maintain the stan¬
dards of the professional theatre, to regulate the industry and to promote and safe¬
guard the welfare of those who work in it. Organisations of this kind include the
London Theatre Council, the Provincial Theatre Council, the Society of West
End Managers, the Theatrical Managers’ Association, the Council of Repertory
Theatres, British Actors’ Equity (the actors’ trade union), and the League of
Dramatists. The trade union of theatre staffs is the National Association of
Theatrical and Kine Employees.
The Society for Theatre Research brings together those interested in the history
and technique of the British theatre.
Amateur Theatre
The amateur dramatic movement is widespread throughout the United Kingdom;
there are thousands of amateur dramatic societies. The movement is sponsored and
fostered by local education authorities, by other public bodies, and by four special

officer of the Royal Household. His functions include the licensing of theatres in London
and certain towns, and the licensing of plays for public performance.

organisations—the British Drama League, the Standing Conference of Drama
Associations, the Scottish Community Drama Association, and the Ulster Drama
League. .
The British Drama League, which was founded in 1919, operates on a basis ot
affiliation and individual membership. Its many services to its members include the
arrangement of courses, lectures and competitions in dramatic work; the provision
of an information bureau; and advice on many matters connected with the stage,
e.g., play-writing, production, stage management and the organisation of drama
festivals. The work of the Standing Conference is mainly that of co-ordination
between the various bodies concerned in the amateur dramatic movement; while
the Scottish Community Drama Association fulfils, in Scotland, the functions of
both the League and the Conference and is supported by the Scottish Education
Department.
The Universities of Oxford and Cambridge have famous dramatic societies, and
there are drama clubs and societies in many other universities and colleges.
Dramatic Training
Dramatic training is provided mainly in the large number of dramatic schools
and institutions of all kinds which have been established throughout the United
Kingdom. Among the most important of such institutions are the Royal Academy
of Dramatic Art (which was founded in 1904 and is now grant-aided, and which
provides a two-year course in all branches of stage work), the Central School of
Speech Training and Dramatic Art, the Rose Bruford School and the London
Academy of Music and Dramatic Art, all of which are in or near London; and
there are also the Old Vic School in Bristol and the Northern Theatre School in
Bradford.
Some form of education in drama is also provided in many of the schools and
youth clubs of Britain, and a varying degree of recognition is given to the subject
in the universities. Bristol University leads in this direction in that it has created a
Department of Drama offering a course which an Arts student may take as part of
a general degree course.
FILMS
The British public possibly visits the cinema more frequently than any other
people in the world. Although cinema attendance has been declining in recent years
(in 1957, the annual average of 18 attendances per head of population was 17 Per
cent below the 1956 level) and the net figure of closures of cinemas in Great Britain
in the two years 1956 and 1957 was 3^7) there were, in 1958, about 4>IO° cinemas
in Great Britain (with a total of over 34 million seats) and another 130 cinemas in
Northern Ireland.
The first cinematograph exhibition in Britain was given in 1896 and within ten
years Britain was in the forefront of film production. This early ascendancy did not
survive the impact of the first world war and since i9I4 British films have had to
contend with keen American competition. Legislation, first introduced in 1927 and
continued by the Cinematograph Films Acts of 1938 and 1948, has given some
assistance by means of the quota system, under which a certain pioportion of
British films must be shown in British cinemas each year. The proportion is fixed
annually by Board of Trade Order, after consultation with the Cinematograph
Films Council, and is subject to confirmation by Parliament. For first feature films
it has stood at 30 per cent since 1950. The Cinematograph Films Act, I957>
renewed the quota provisions for a further ten years.
PROMOTION OF THE SCIENCES AND THE ARTS
221
During the second world war the British cinema re-emerged with new vitality
and began again to exert an important influence on film development by the pro¬
duction of many notable feature films depicting Britain’s ordeals and achievements
in the war. These films were based on the documentary technique which had been
developed since 1929 for the making of factual informative films sponsored by the
Government or by commercial organisations. British feature films in the post-war
years have been influenced by this trend, and realistic treatment is now a character¬
istic of British feature production, both in dramatic films and in the light-hearted
satirical comedies that have won acclaim in recent years.
The development of the film as an art is promoted by the British Film Institute,
founded in 1933, which is financed partly by an Exchequer grant and is responsible
to the Privy Council. The Institute encourages the making and showing of good
films and helps the public to appreciate good films. It administers the National
Film Theatre in London and the National Film Archive, runs an annual summer
school, and maintains a film distribution library from which films may be hired,
a library of books on the film and an Information Service. The Institute also makes
grants to the Scottish Film Council, the Scientific Film Association, the University
Film Council and the Society of Film Teachers, and administers a fund for the
production of experimental films.
The National Film Archive contains over 7,000 films, besides scripts, art designs,
posters and 120,000 photographic stills, selected to illustrate the history and the
art of the film and as significant social and historical records.
The National Film Theatre shows films of outstanding historical, artistic or
technical interest; it holds a unique position as a cinema offering regular pro¬
grammes which are unrestricted by commercial considerations or by the age or
nationality of the films shown. Its new building, erected in 1957, is the first per¬
manent national film theatre in the world.
The British Film Academy, founded in 1947, is a private organisation, repre¬
sentative of senior film-makers, which exists to foster the making of creative films.
It provides a meeting ground for artists and technicians and gives annual awards
for films, for technical achievements and for film acting.
Financial Aid for Film Production
The art of film production is a costly one which depends upon a commercially
prosperous industry for its development and well-being, and needs adequate finan¬
cial backing combined with freedom for the film-maker to experiment and to express
his own ideas. There is no State-owned film production unit in Britain, but the
National Film Finance Corporation, a statutory body set up in 1949, is empowered
to lend money for film production. Its members—a chairman, a managing director,
and three to five others—are appointed by the Board of Trade. Its funds (limited
by statute to £8 million) are provided, up to £6 million, by advances from the
Board of Trade; the remaining £2 million may be borrowed from non-Govern-
mental sources. The Corporation is financially concerned with about half the films
being made in British studios.
There is a levy on cinema admissions to provide a film production fund. This
levy is quite separate from the Entertainments Duty which is a tax charged on
cinema admissions (the rate of Entertainments Duty was reduced in 1957 and again
reduced, by one-half, in 1958). The money raised by the levy is paid out as a per¬
centage of a film’s takings, so that the more successful a film is at the box office, the
more it receives from the fund. The fund was started in September 1950 on a non-
statutory basis as the British Film Production Fund, known as the Eady Fund. It
was based on a renewable agreement between the various trade associations, subject
222
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
to Board of Trade approval. When this agreement lapsed in October 1957, the
voluntary scheme was replaced by a statutory scheme with the same purpose.
The Cinematograph Films Act, 1957, gave the President of the Board of Trade
powers to make regulations governing the collection, by the Customs and Excise
Department, of a levy from exhibitors, and the distribution of the proceeds for the
benefit of British film production. A new body, the British Film Fund Agency,
undertakes the distribution.
Some 25 per cent of British first feature films are produced by the two large
amalgams, the Rank Organisation and the Associated British Picture Corporation,
which have companies for production, distribution and exhibition. There are
numerous companies (many of them only small) which produce short films. Most
producers who are independent of either group make films in association with other
film distributors.
Cinema Licensing and Film Censorship
The State takes no part in the censorship of films in Britain, but, by virtue of
their power to grant licences, the local licensing authorities act as the final arbiters
of films proposed for showing in their areas. There are over 700 licensing
authorities; they are local authorities or, in some areas, magistrates. The Cinemato¬
graph Act of 1909 required, for reasons of safety, that inflammable films should
be shown only on premises licensed for the purpose; it was subsequently established
that licensing authorities had the right to supervise the character of the films
exhibited. In judging the suitability of films for public showing, licensing authorities
rely on the judgment of an independent body, the British Board of Film Censors,
to which are submitted all films (other than newsreels) intended for public showing.
The British Board of Film Censors was set up in 1912 on the initiative of the
cinema industry, which wished to ensure that a proper standard was maintained
in the films offered to the public. It consists of a president, a secretary, and seven
examiners; the latter, who include three women, are appointed by the president.
The president is elected by a trade committee and is usually a man prominent in
public life.
The Board, which does not use any written code of censorship, may require cuts
to be made before it will grant a certificate to a film; more rarely, it will refuse a
certificate. Films passed by the Board are placed in one of three categories: ‘U’
(suitable for universal showing); ‘A’ (more suitable for adults than children) and
‘X’ (suitable only for adults). A child or young person under 16 years of age may
be admitted to a cinema showing an ‘A’ film only if accompanied by a responsible
adult, and may not be admitted on any condition if an ‘X’ film is being shown.
Children and the Cinema
The Cinematograph Act, 1952, which came into force in January 1956, extended
the scope of the 1909 Act and provided for the making of regulations by the Home
Secretary to protect the health and welfare of children in relation to their attendance
at film shows. Cinemas which give children’s shows require a special licence from
the licensing authority and the authority is able to impose special conditions on
such cinemas. The British Board of Film Censors publishes at intervals a list of
films particularly suitable for children and for exhibition at children s matinees.
One of the women examiners is appointed for her special knowledge of children s
needs.
Children’s cinema clubs, providing special children’s programmes on Saturday
mornings, are widely organised by the cinema groups and have become very popu¬
lar. An important contribution to these programmes is made by the Children’s
PROMOTION OF THE SCIENCES AND THE ARTS
223
Film Foundation, which produces and distributes entertainment films specially
designed for children. The Foundation is a non-profit-making body set up by the
British film industry in 1951 and provision is made in the Cinematograph Act,
1957, for the Foundation to receive grants from the British Film Fund Agency.
MUSIC, OPERA AND BALLET
In Britain today, music in all its forms is drawing large audiences; and orchestral
concerts, choral singing, music festivals, opera and ballet are important features of
British cultural life.
The British Council has done much to make British music and ballet companies
more widely known throughout the world. Tours of British orchestras, soloists and
opera and ballet companies are arranged, recordings of works by British composers
are sponsored, and libraries of British music (recorded and in printed score) are
maintained in 59 countries overseas. At the Council’s headquarters in London, a
central music reference library of music literature, scores and recorded music is
maintained for the use of visitors. Distinguished musicians from overseas are
invited to Britain as guests of the Council to gain some first-hand experience of
British music and musicians, and extensive arrangements are made to cover each
individual interest.
Music
Seasons of orchestral concerts are promoted every year in all the large towns and
cities of Britain, some of which have well-known concert halls. In London, the
principal concert halls are the Royal Festival Hall on the South Bank of the Thames,
which was opened in 1951 in connection with the Festival of Britain; the Royal
Albert Hall, Kensington; and the Wigmore Hall, which is the principal recital
centre.
Among the leading British orchestras are the London Symphony, the BBC
Symphony, the London Philharmonic, the Royal Philharmonic, the Philharmonia,
the Halle (Manchester), the Royal Liverpool Philharmonic, the City of Birming¬
ham, the Bournemouth Symphony, the Scottish National and the BBC Scottish.
There are also the specialised string and chamber orchestras such as the Philo-
musica of London (formerly known as the Boyd Neel Orchestra), the Jacques
Orchestra and the London Mozart Players; and a number of new orchestras which
have been formed during the past few years. Many of these receive financial aid
from the Arts Council and local authorities to help with the cost of maintaining
ensembles, of presenting new or unfamiliar works, and of improving standards
generally. The City of Belfast Orchestra is financed jointly by the Belfast Corpora¬
tion and CEMA.
The principal choral societies in Britain are the Royal Choral, the BBC Choral,
the Huddersfield Choral, the Halle Choir, the Liverpool Philharmonic Choir, the
London Philharmonic Choir, and the Bach Choir. These and many other choral
societies are associated with famous orchestras in major choral works; most of them,
together with hundreds of similar choral and orchestral societies and music clubs,
are affiliated to the National Federation of Music Societies, through which they are
supported with funds provided by the Arts Council. Membership of the National
Federation has risen to 784 societies.
Music festivals in Britain, originating with the Three Choirs Festival held
annually in Gloucester, Worcester or Hereford in rotation, have been in existence
for over 200 years. The festival idea has developed considerably in recent years, and
festivals of music and other arts are now held annually in many cities and towns
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
224
throughout the United Kingdom. They range from the famous Edinburgh Inter¬
national Festival of Music and Drama, which lasts three weeks and attracts many
thousands of visitors, to those, such as the Aldeburgh Festival, lasting a week or
less. Among the better known are the Llangollen International Eisteddfod; the
National Eisteddfod of Wales, which in 1958 formed part of the first Festival of
Wales; the National Gaelic Mod, held at a different place in Scotland each year;
the Cheltenham Festival, devoted to contemporary British music; the York Mystery
Plays and Festival; and the Leeds and Norwich Festivals of choral music, which
are held on a triennial basis. An annual international festival of folk song and
dancing is held by the English Folk Dance and Song Society.
Interest in amateur music-making is increasing. It is encouraged by the work of
County Music Committees,1 which are aided by the Carnegie United Kingdom
Trust and united in the Standing Conference of Music Committees. The Rural
Music Schools Association is concerned with music-making by amateurs in country
districts; it brings together professional musicians, teachers, administrators and
amateurs.
Professional organisations, which look after the interests of music and musicians,
include the Musicians’ Union, the Incorporated Society of Musicians, the Com¬
posers’ Guild, and the Songwriters’ Guild.
Specialised education in music is given at Colleges of Music, of which the most
prominent are the Royal Academy of Music and the Royal College of Music in
London, the Royal Manchester College, and the Royal Scottish Academy in
Glasgow, all of which receive grants-in-aid. There are also the Trinity College of
Music, the Guildhall School of Music and Drama in London and the School of
Music in Birmingham. Youth orchestras are strongly encouraged, and children’s
concerts, given by symphony orchestras directed by prominent conductors, are a
regular feature of the country’s musical activities and have helped to develop among
the youth of the community an appreciation of the world’s greatest music. The
National Youth Orchestra, made up of the most promising members of school
orchestras, is noted for its high standard of performance, as is the Students’
Orchestra of Great Britain, formed in July 1958, which consists of music students.
In schools, more children are learning to play musical instruments; and some
110,000 candidates a year (children and other students) take the examinations of
the Associated Board of the Royal Schools of Music, the largest proportion (nearly
80,000) choosing the piano as their instrument.
The increase in musical appreciation among the general public during recent
years is shown not only by the size of the audiences for concerts and for the BBC s
music programmes, but also by the number of gramophone records of classical
music sold, which rose to some 11 million in 1957- The National Federation of
Gramophone Societies has 350 affiliated societies.
Opera and Ballet
Regular seasons of opera and ballet are given at the Royal Opera House, Covent
Garden, which is leased by the Government2 to the Covent Garden Opera Trust,
which was formed in 1944 to make the famous opera house the home of a national
opera and ballet, and which receives a Government grant through the Arts Council.
The Royal Opera House has its own resident opera company and ballet company
1 Some of these are voluntary committees and some are local education authority
sub-committees.

which give performances both in London and elsewhere. The opera company,
which numbers about 200 and has a permanent orchestra, makes an annual tour
of provincial centres. The ballet company, which in January 1957 was incorporated
with the Sadler’s Wells Theatre Ballet and the Sadler’s Wells School to form the
Royal Ballet, has a high international reputation gained as the Sadler’s Wells Ballet
during its visits in recent years to Canada and the United States and its European
tours, arranged by the British Council.
Seasons of opera and ballet are also given at the Sadler’s Wells Theatre in
London; and at Glyndebourne in Sussex, an opera season, for which a company
is specially assembled, is held every year. Other opera companies include the Carl
Rosa, one of the oldest opera organisations in Britain; the English Opera Group,
formed in 1947, and noted for its performances of operas by Benjamin Britten;
Intimate Opera, which performs eighteenth and twentieth century works for
small casts in any hall available, and the Welsh National Opera Company. The
Arts Council manages a small operatic group (Opera for All) which specialises in
introducing opera to audiences who hitherto have been unfamiliar with it. There
are also a number of amateur opera clubs both in London and in the provinces.
Among the ballet companies are the Ballet Rambert, Britain’s oldest ballet company,
which has discovered many distinguished dancers and choreographers, and the
Festival Ballet.
The Royal (formerly Sadler’s Wells), the Arts Educational, and the Rambert
Ballet Training Schools and the Royal Academy of Dancing are among the teaching
institutions which have played an important part in raising British ballet to its
present high standard.
VIII. THE NATIONAL
ECONOMY
BACKGROUND
The United Kingdom ranks about 75 th in size among the countries of the world,
with about o-i8 per cent of the world’s land area. In population, with about 2 per
cent of the world’s inhabitants, it ranks ninth. In density of population it is fourth:
of the major countries, only Japan, Belgium and the Netherlands are more crowded;
and there are eleven times as many people to the square mile in the United King¬
dom as in the United States. In world trade, it ranks second, accounting for more
than 10 per cent of the total. It takes about a fifth of the world’s exports of primary
products, and provides about a fifth of the world’s exports of manufactured goods.
The United Kingdom, from its own soil, provides only half of the food it needs;
and—apart from coal and some low-grade iron ore—it has few natural resources;
thus it is the world’s largest importer of such products as wheat, meat, butter,
fodder grains, citrus fruits, tea, tobacco, wool, and hard timber. In return, it
is one of the world’s largest exporters of ships, aircraft, locomotives, motor vehicles,
electrical equipment, chemicals, textiles and most types of machinery. Few countries
in the world have such a high proportion of the population living in towns (80 per
cent) or such a small proportion of the working population engaged in agriculture
(only about 4 per cent).
The United Kingdom is also the central banker of the Sterling Area, an area with
a quarter of the world’s population. Many countries outside the sterling area use
sterling in their international transactions; nearly half the world’s trade is con¬
ducted in sterling. By its membership of the European Payments Union of the
Organisation for European Economic Co-operation, the United Kingdom provides
a payments link between the sterling area and the countries of Western Europe.
The Economy before 1939
During the nineteenth century Britain secured a leading position as world
manufacturer, merchant, carrier, banker, and investor and so was able to support
a rapidly increasing population at a rising standard of living. It was Britain s
commerce in cotton goods, above all, which gave it the leading position in world
trade ; cotton cloth provided 40 per cent of its exports in 1851. It was in this
period also that the country became so largely dependent on imports: it has been
estimated1 that retained imports, which were only 12 per cent of net national
income at factor cost (i.e. cost after discounting the effect of indirect taxes and sub¬
sidies), in 1820, rose to 28 per cent in 1870. (The 1957 figure was 23 per cent.)
The period from 1870 to 1890 was the high-water mark of British industrial
expansion as compared with that of other countries. Between 1890 and 1914 growing
industrial competition from Europe and North America began to make itself
felt, but its effects on Britain’s staple export industries, particularly cotton textiles
and coal, were offset by the general rise in world trade, by the continued demand
1 Prof. E. A. G. Robinson, Economic Journal, September i954> P- 458.
226
THE NATIONAL ECONOMY
227
for British textiles from India and other eastern countries, and by the continued
high level of overseas investment.
The new problems confronting British industry and trade in the twentieth
century became apparent after the first world war. Textiles from India and Japan,
where labour costs were lower, established themselves firmly in the large eastern
markets, to a great extent replacing the higher-priced and often higher quality
British product. The extension of the world demand for coal was slowed down by
the increasing use of oil, while coal from the new European mines competed
severely with British coal.
In the old-established branches of the vehicles and engineering group of indus¬
tries (e.g., locomotives, ships and textile machinery) world demand fell away after
a brief post-war boom, and Britain failed at first to gain a compensating share of
the expanding world trade in the new types of engineering products (e.g., cars and
electrical goods). Most countries were tending towards self-sufficiency, and some
sought deliberately to protect nascent and even established industries by sheltering
them behind tariffs and (later) quotas and exchange restrictions.
Income from overseas investments and a substantial improvement in the terms of
trade (the price of exports relative to the price of imports) cushioned the effect of a
fall in the volume of exports, and imports remained high. The loss of export
markets led, however, to a contraction of Britain’s staple industries—coal, cotton,
iron and steel, and the older branches of engineering. The result was heavy
unemployment, the general rate of which averaged 14 per cent in the years 1921-39,
reaching a peak of 22 per cent in 1932, when the slump in world trade was at its
worst. In districts relying mainly on one of the staple industries, the rate was much
higher.
After 1932 an improvement in the levels of production and employment took
place, stimulated by an increase in home investment, by some revival in world
trade and, after 1935, by the armament programme.
Effects of the Second World War
The second world war is estimated to have run down British domestic capital by
about £3,000 million, through shipping losses, bomb damage, and arrears of
industrial maintenance and replacements. It also resulted in a considerable altera¬
tion in Britain’s financial and trading position, which may be summarised thus:
1. Loss of overseas assets. Over £ 1,000 million worth of overseas investments—
including £428 million in North America—were sold to pay for war supplies.
The income from these assets had paid for a substantial part of pre-war
imports into the United Kingdom.
2. New overseas debts. New external debts, totalling £3,000 million, were
accumulated.
3. Terms of trade. The price of imported raw materials rose sharply after the
war, and by 1948 about one-fifth more goods had to be exported than in
1938 to bring in the same quantity of imports.
4. Reduced exports. By 1944, exports, curtailed as part of the war effort, had
fallen to less than one-third of their 1938 volume.
5. Smaller reserves. The real value of the gold and dollar reserves was reduced
to about half the pre-war level.
6. World dollar shortage. The physical destruction of the war led to an increased
dependence on the part of Britain, the rest of the sterling area and many
other countries, on supplies of all kinds from North America. Dollar
earnings by non-dollar countries were inadequate to pay for these supplies.
228
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Post-war Developments
Since the war, the economy of the United Kingdom has experienced a period of
almost uninterrupted prosperity with a constantly increasing supply of goods and
services and a virtual absence of unemployment. Invention and technological
advance have combined with adaptation to world demands to produce some radical
changes in the British industrial scene. Industries built on new techniques, notably
in the electrical engineering, aircraft, motor and chemicals industries, are now
contributing a significantly larger share of output—itself much expanded—and
providing wider employment opportunities for an increasingly skilled labour force
and a growing contribution to the expanding export trade.
At the same time, the United Kingdom has had to deal with some persistent
economic problems; in particular, to fulfil its overseas obligations and to maintain
its traditional role in world commerce and finance it has needed to achieve and
maintain a substantial balance of payments surplus, and to halt the almost con¬
tinuous rise in internal prices. In the initial post-war years Marshall Aid and loans
from the United States and Canada helped to overcome the serious deficit in the
balance of payments pending the full recovery of exports. The strong expansion in
exports in recent years has resulted in a substantial surplus in the balance of pay¬
ments, but it was not until the first half of 1958 that this reached a level fully
commensurate with Britain’s overseas commitments.
The trend in prices is in part a reflection of rapid economic expansion and the
consequent pressure upon resources in the form of a large increase in exports, the
re-equipment and expansion of productive capacity, the raising of living standards
at home, the supply of investment funds for the development of countries in the
Commonwealth and elsewhere, and also a substantial contribution to the defence
effort of the Western World. The Government has made the stability of prices
a cardinal aim of its economic policy and has introduced to this end a series of
corrective measures.
THE STRUCTURE OF THE ECONOMY
The following sections sketch briefly the salient features of the national income
and expenditure of the United Kingdom, with particular reference to two factors—
the balance of payments problems and the prevention of inflation. The sources of
Tables 9 to 13 are National Income and Expenditure, I957> and Economic Survey,
1958, Cmnd. 394.
National Income and Employment
Between 1948 and 1957, the United Kingdom gross national product (the
measure of total goods and services produced at home plus net income from abroad)
is estimated to have risen by 85 per cent, from £10,368 million to £19,188 million.
In real terms, that is after allowing for price changes, the increase has amounted to
30 per cent over the same period; this is equivalent to an average annual advance
of about 3 per cent. In comparison with other countries, the United Kingdom’s
national income per head is below that of the United States and Canada and ranks
roughly on a par with that of Australia, New Zealand, the Scandinavian countries
and Switzerland.
Table 9, and the diagram on p. 229, show the distribution of total supplies of
goods and services in 1935 and 1956, by use, divided between consumers, public
authorities, investment and exports.

Manufacturing industry in 1957 contributed nearly 40 per cent to the total
output of goods and services, and together with mining and quarrying, building
and contracting and public utilities (gas, electricity and water), made up over half
the total; agriculture, forestry and fisheries accounted for less than 5 per cent,
transport and communications, together with the distributive trades, for a further
21 per cent. The composition of the supply of goods and services in 1935 and 1956,
by source, is shown in the diagram on p. 229.
The expansion of output in manufacturing and in industry as a whole since
1948—industrial production having risen by 38 per cent over the ten years—has
made it possible to achieve an appreciable improvement in living standards and
progressively to raise to record levels the proportion of the national resources
devoted to investment. This has been accomplished during a period when over
9 per cent of the gross national product has been required for defence expenditure
and also without impairing the most urgent task—the expansion of exports. In
real terms, between 1948 and 1957, gross capital formation has risen by about
62 per cent, consumption by 18 per cent, and public authorities’ current
expenditure by 26 per cent.
The diagram on p. 229 shows production and national income trends from
1900 to 1957.
Unemployment has remained very low, on average less than 2 per cent of the
working population being out of work from 1948 to 1957 as compared with
14 per cent between the two world wars. During the past ten years the number of
unemployed has never reached 500,000; and when resources were stretched to the
utmost, as for example, in 1951 and again in 1955, the number of unfilled vacancies
was double that of registered unemployed. As the population of working age has
been virtually static and the numbers of those at work has risen only very slowly,
the growth of the national income is mainly the result of higher productivity.
Investment
Since the end of the war gross fixed investment has been rising steadily, with a
sharp rise in the rate of increase from 1953. In 1938, fixed investment in the United
Kingdom was about i2-|- per cent of the gross national product; in 1948, 14 per cent;
in 1957, over 17 per cent. Up to 1953, investment in oil refineries, chemicals, and
iron and steel, and in the housing programmes of local authorities increased
particularly rapidly. Since 1953, industrial investment as a whole has risen to
record levels, while investment in housing has declined since 1954. In 1957. the
volume of fixed capital formation by manufacturing industry, as shown in Table 10,
was 81 per cent higher than in 1948, and accounted for more than a quarter of the

total; in the fuel and power industries the rate of increase has been similar. The
general pattern of gross investment expenditure between 1948 and 1956 is shown
in the diagram on p. 231.
Government policy has aimed at achieving the highest volume of investment
consistent with the avoidance of inflation. In September 1957, as part of the series
of anti-inflationary measures, the Government announced its intention to hold the
total of public investment in each of the next two years to the 1957-58 level of
about £1,500 million; this level is, however, half as high again as in 1951. Other
measures (relaxed during 1958) affecting private investment included higher
interest rates and the stabilisation of bank advances.

Savings and the Financing of Investment
The growth of investment has been assisted, and indeed made possible, by a
marked expansion of personal savings (see Table 11 and diagram on p. 231). During
the early post-war years, personal savings were very small, as people were making
good war-time arrears of expenditure on necessities such as clothing and household
goods, and most of the funds available for investment were derived from the
Government’s Budget surpluses and the gross profits of companies. But the next
few7 years brought a remarkable growth in private savings, and in 1957 they exceeded
£1,600 million, equivalent to 40 per cent of total savings. In the period 1948-51,
on average only about 2 per cent of disposable personal income w7as saved, but by
1957 the proportion had risen to between 10 and 11 per cent.
The rise in personal savings has taken various forms. A substantial volume has
come from life assurance premiums and pension funds, and contributions through
the National Savings movement, the banks and the building societies have also been
significant; the trend towards house purchase by means of mortgages reflects
the growth of private house ownership. Insurance companies, pension funds, trust

funds and similar institutions have become progressively more important as sources
of new capital for United Kingdom trade and industry and also for Commonwealth
Governments and private companies raising loans on the London market.

Expenditure by the central Government, local authorities and the National
Insurance Fund has expanded appreciably in comparison with pre-war years. The
main factors in this trend are the growth of the social services, the housing pro¬
grammes of the local authorities, and, since 1950, a high level of defence expendi¬
ture. As a percentage of the gross national product, however, the Government’s share
has dropped from 30 per cent in 1948 to 25 per cent in 1957.

Personal Incomes and Consumer Expenditure
The narrowing of earned income differentials and the re-distribution of incomes
by taxation have resulted in the concentration of personal incomes after tax in the
range of £250 to £1,000 a year. In contrast, less than one per cent of the total
number of incomes after tax lie in the range of £2,000 and upwards and this
proportion accounts for less than 5 per cent of aggregate personal income. There
has at the same time been a marked change in the distribution of personal income
by source. Incomes from employment in 1957 totalled £12,920 million (as compared
with £9,105 million in 1952), and accounted for about 72 per cent of total personal
incomes as against 60 per cent in 1938; for rent, dividends and interest the
corresponding percentages are 22 and 11.
Consumer expenditure has been rising in real terms, i.e. after discounting the
effect of price changes. In 1957, the volume of consumer expenditure was 11 per cent
higher than in 1953 (as shown in Table 13) and 30 per cent higher than in 1948.
The principal long-term trend is the rise in expenditure on durable goods and
motoring; in 1957, these two groups accounted for nearly one-eighth of consumer
expenditure. The amount spent on food, where the trend is towards greater
consumption of higher quality foodstuffs, was about one-third of the total when
calculated at current market prices. Using 1948 market prices, however, the
proportion spent on food was only about 26 per cent, the difference in part arising
from the reduction in food subsidies. The distribution of personal expenditure is
also influenced by the incidence of indirect taxes, particularly the heavy taxes on
drink and tobacco. If the effects of taxes and subsidies (mainly to agriculture) are
excluded, the proportion spent on food would be about 40 per cent, and that spent
on drink and tobacco about 6 per cent.

Incomes and Prices
Between 1945 and the end of 1957, the cost of living in the United Kingdom rose
almost without interruption, though at varying rates of increase. The most rapid
THE NATIONAL ECONOMY
235
rise, roughly xo per cent, was between 1950 and 1951; the lowest, about 2 per cent,
between 1953 and 1954. Over the period 1948 to 1957 the rise was between 50 and
60 per cent, while wages and salaries increased by 90 per cent, and rents, dividends
and interest by 70 per cent.
In the six years after the war, the general upward movement of costs and prices
was in part the result of the rapid increase in import prices, no less than 50 per
cent between 1948 and 1951. This upward trend continued, however, after 1951,
although import prices fell. Over the whole period since the war, it is clear that the
main immediate cause of the rise in prices has been the tendency of incomes to
rise faster than production. The underlying causes of this trend are less easy to
identify.
Steps have been taken by the United Kingdom Government throughout the
period to counter this gradual inflation. The main weapons consistently used have
been Budget surpluses and appeals for voluntary restraint in increases in wages
and profits. Up to 1950 a number of physical controls were also employed, and
latterly increased use has been made of monetary policy, the pruning of Government
expenditure and the restriction of credit. Nevertheless, the over-rapid growth of
money incomes continued until 1957 and has contributed on occasions to lack of
confidence in, and occasional speculation against, sterling.
Speculation of this type was a factor in the heavy loss of gold and dollar reserves
in the third quarter of 1957. Counter measures were therefore taken to stop the
upward drift in costs and prices, including a ceiling on public investment, a ceiling
on bank advances and a sharp increase in the Bank Rate. Restoration of confidence
in sterling followed quickly and a strong recovery in the gold and dollar reserves
took place over the next nine months. Since the spring of 1958, the Bank Rate
has been reduced by stages, and progressive relaxations have been made in other
restrictions on borrowing and investment.
In August 1957, the Government set up an independent body, the Council on
Prices, Productivity and Incomes (the Cohen Council), to make periodic reports to
the public (not to the Government), on changes in prices, productivity and the
level of incomes. Its first report, published in February 1958, aroused widespread
discussion. One of its conclusions was that an abnormal pressure of monetary
demand for goods and services of all types had been the main cause of rising prices
and money incomes. A second report was issued in August 1958.
Overseas Trade and Payments
The overseas trade of the United Kingdom has undergone a radical transforma¬
tion since 1945. Exports have expanded rapidly: the pre-war volume was almost
regained in 1946; since then it has doubled. At the same time both the commodity
composition of exports and their geographical distribution has changed. Metals,
engineering and vehicles industries, in which there has been a rapid development
of new processes and products, in 1957 provided 52 per cent of total exports as
compared with 38 per cent in 1938. The dollar area now receives 16 per cent of
exports as compared with 11 per cent in 1938.
Between 1954 and 1957 the volume of imports rose by 15 per cent and that of
exports by 16 per cent, while the terms of trade (the relation of export prices to
import prices), which had become much more adverse than before the war,
became more favourable, without, however, restoring the 1938 relationship.
Invisible earnings from shipping, commerce, tourism, investment income and other
sources have also improved greatly and the net surpluses on current account in
1956 and 1957 were the highest for several years, averaging about £250 million
despite the disturbances resulting from the Suez crisis.
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
236
The United Kingdom Government, however, considers surpluses of this order
insufficient. Its ultimate aim is an average annual surplus of at least £350 million
in order to meet all its overseas commitments and obligations (e.g., the repayment
of the United States and Canadian post-war loans and the drawing upon sterling
balances by overseas Commonwealth countries for development purposes), and to
maintain and increase long-term investment overseas, particularly in the Common¬
wealth. Traditionally, Britain has been a heavy exporter of capital and, since 1945,
despite severe burdens on resources strained by war, the outflow has been main¬
tained at a high level. In the years 1954-57, net overseas investment has averaged
about £200 million a year, or some ii per cent of the national income. A second
objective is a strengthening of the gold and foreign currency reserves, to a level
commensurate with the importance of sterling in financing world trade. In addition,
the repayment of short-term and medium-term borrowing from the International
Monetary Fund and the United States Export-Import Bank, undertaken in 1956
and 1957 to reinforce the reserves, will make additional calls upon the United
Kingdom’s foreign exchange resources. Rapid progress was made in the first half
of 1958 towards building up the gold and dollar reserves, and by the end of June
the reserves had reached their highest level since the end of the war, apart from a
brief period in 1951 when commodity prices were at their peak as a result of the
war in Korea.
IX. INDUSTRY
ORGANISATION AND PRODUCTION
The United Kingdom was the first country in the world to become highly
industrialised. Eleven people work in mining, manufacturing and building for every
one in agriculture. The United Kingdom is one of the world’s largest exporters of
manufactured goods per head of population and the range of its industrial manufac¬
tures reflects its position as an outstanding workshop of the world.
Location
The factors that have influenced the location of industry in Britain are many and
various. During the rapid industrialisation of the nineteenth century, one of the
most important influences was the proximity of coal, the major source of power,
particularly when it was associated with ease of access to other raw materials
such as iron ore in the West Midlands and salt (for chemicals) in Cheshire, and to
the coast which in turn offered easy access to imported raw materials and a quick
outlet for exports. In the course of the past hundred years, the pull exercised by
coal has been progressively weakened as improved means of communication and
an alternative source of power in electricity have been developed and have enabled
advantage to be taken of other sites—e.g., those near to big consumer markets and
plentiful supplies of labour. During the inter-war period there was a tendency for
the ‘new’ industries such as those manufacturing motor vehicles, electrical goods
and rubber products to develop rapidly in the South (especially in and around
Greater London) and the Midlands. On the other hand, this period was one of acute
depression and mass unemployment for the older industrial areas which specialised
in the great staple industries—coalmining, steel, shipbuilding, marine engineering
and cotton manufacture. These conditions prompted official action (which has been
intensified since the second world war) aimed at encouraging new industrial
development and diversification in the areas concerned (known as Development
Areas, see pp. 241-2) where labour and other resources are to be found, and
discouraging further industrialisation in congested areas such as Greater London and
Greater Birmingham. A considerable expansion and diversification of industry has,
in fact, taken place in the Development Areas as a result of these policies, allied
to the war-time dispersal of industry and the widespread demand for new factory
premises over the past decade.
Although industry is today widely dispersed, the main areas of industrial con¬
centration are still, with one exception (London), the areas which saw the beginning
of Britain’s industrial greatness and which, with two exceptions (London and
Belfast), are on or near coalfields. These areas and their main industries are listed
below (see also map, pp. 238-9). Four of them—Lancashire, South Wales, Tyneside,
and Central Scotland—contain Development Areas where, as in Northern Ireland,
considerable success has been achieved by Government action to diversify the
industrial structure.
Greater London. London is the main centre in Britain of the clothing and food
and drink industries, of printing, of film production, and of the manufacture of
furniture, materials for the arts, precision instruments and many other specialised

goods. Small firms predominate in all these industries, and the average size of
manufacturing firms in London is well below the national average. London is also
an important centre for light engineering and chemicals, and has some heavy
engineering plants. Indeed, London is so large and its industries so diverse that
it is a main centre for many of the broad groups of manufacturing industries, with
the notable exception of textiles and metal manufacture.
Midlands. The main Midland industrial area consists of the great conurbation
centred on Birmingham and Wolverhampton (which includes portions of Stafford¬
shire, Worcestershire and Warwickshire) where there is a wide variety of industry,
including notably the manufacture of metals, electrical and engineering goods and
vehicles, and also jewellery, rubber products and domestic metalware. The smaller
adjacent conurbation of North Staffordshire, centred on Stoke-on-Trent, may be
considered as a separate industrial area and is devoted chiefly to the manufacture
of pottery and china and to the mining of coal. Leicester, Coventry, Rugby, Derby
and Nottingham are the principal industrial towns in the rest of the Midland area.
One of the richest coalfields in the country is situated in the north-east of the area
and continues into Yorkshire.
Yorkshire. The West Riding of Yorkshire still contains much the biggest section
of the British woollen and worsted industry, the principal towns being Bradford,
Halifax (which also specialises in carpets) and Huddersfield. Leeds, the largest
city, is more concerned with clothing and engineering products. York is an
important centre for chocolate and sugar confectionery. The city of Sheffield, in
the extreme south of Yorkshire, is famous for its high-quality steel, its cutlery,
plate and tool industry and its heavy engineering. There are extensive coalfields
in the West Riding of Yorkshire. Hull is one of the world’s largest fishing ports.
South-east Lancashire. Manchester is the commercial centre of the cotton textile
industry. Most cotton yarn is spun in towns within a ten-mile radius of Manchester,
but weaving is mainly carried on somewhat farther to the north, in the Preston,
Burnley, Nelson, Blackburn and Colne areas. Manchester itself, besides having the
variety of industry typical of a large city, is one of Britain’s chief centres of electrical
and heavy engineering and dyestuffs. There are also coalfields in the Manchester
area. The Manchester Ship Canal, which carries a substantial volume of overseas
trade, links Manchester with Merseyside. It passes through important industrial
towns such as Warrington with its metal industries, Widnes with its chemicals, and
Ellesmere Port with its oil refinery installations, before reaching the Mersey estuary.
Liverpool is one of Britain’s main ports and commercial centres and, after London,
the greatest centre for food processing. Among its older industries is ship repairing;
shipbuilding is a major industry across the river at Birkenhead. In recent years
many new industries, including electrical engineering and the manufacture of other
heavy industrial equipment, have been rapidly assuming a place of importance in
the Liverpool area.
South Wales. Coalmining, including the production of such special coals as steam
coal and anthracite, has been and remains the chief industry of South Wales. The
other basic industry is steel, including tinplate, in which extensive modernisation
is in progress. Since 1934, new manufacturing industries have been introduced
into Wales to ensure diversity of employment, and these now provide capital and
consumer goods on an extensive scale. The new industries include the manufacture
of plastics, chemicals, textiles, aircraft and a variety of light engineering and
electrical products.
INDUSTRY
241
Tyneside and Tees-side. In Northumberland and Durham, but not in north York¬
shire, coalmining is the principal industry. The region is also a centre for the iron
and steel industry, the chemical and engineering industries and is of increasing
importance for lighter industries; it is second only to Clydeside as a shipbuilding
and ship-repairing area. Most of the shipyards are on the lower reaches of the
rivers Tyne, Wear and Tees.
Central Scotland. The largest shipbuilding centre in Britain is on Clydeside. It
has a marine engineering industry and important neighbouring coalfields in the
Lothians, Fife and Lanark, although activity in this last-named field is now declining
as the seams become worked out. There is also a flourishing iron and steel industry.
The commercial importance of Glasgow and the size and varied appointments of
the great ships built on Clydeside have assured for this area a variety of manu¬
factures. The whole of the central lowlands of Scotland from the Clyde to the
Forth is industrialised.
Northern Ireland. One of the largest shipyards in the United Kingdom is located
at Belfast, where there is also a large aircraft construction establishment. Northern
Ireland has, in addition to marine engineering, a range of other engineering in¬
dustries, and traditional industries of the area include linen, shirt-making, ropes,
cigarettes and tobacco.
Other Centres. A number of towns and cities outside the main industrial areas
are also important manufacturing centres. Scunthorpe, in Lincolnshire, and Corby,
in Northamptonshire, are two of the largest steel-making centres. Peterborough,
also in Northamptonshire, has several important engineering plants. Bristol, the
largest city in south-west England and a leading port, is noted for the building of
aircraft, the tobacco industry and the manufacture of confectionery. Barrow, in
north-west Lancashire, is known for shipbuilding and marine engineering, and the
jute industry is concentrated at Dundee, in Scotland.
Distribution of Industry Policy
/ Government policy is particularly concerned with the distribution of industry.
The Government cannot direct a firm to go to any particular area or site, but the
Board of Trade has statutory powers under the Town and Country Planning Acts,
1947, to ensure that new industrial development throughout Great Britain is carried
out consistently with the proper distribution of industry. A certificate to this effect
from the Board of Trade is necessary before planning consent may be given by a
local planning authority for a new industrial building or extension with an area
exceeding 5,000 square feet. One use of these powers has been to discourage the
expansion of industry in congested areas such as Greater London or Birmingham.
Moreover, areas in Great Britain where there is likely to be a special danger of
unemployment may be scheduled by the Board of Trade as Development Areas
under the Distribution of Industry Act, 1945. The purpose of this Act, and of the
Distribution of Industry Act, 1950, is to promote the growth of new industry and
the expansion of existing industry in the Development Areas. The main advantages
which these Acts give to Development Areas are that the Board of Trade may build
factories for letting to suitable industries and the Treasury may help by making
loans or grants to undertakings which are unable to secure finance through normal
channels. The Board of Trade factories are built and managed by Industrial Estate
Companies. The directors of these companies are unpaid and are appointed by the
Board of Trade, and their capital is provided from Government sources. The
companies include North-Western Industrial Estates Ltd., North-Eastern Trading
Estates Ltd., Scottish Industrial Estates Ltd., Wales and Monmouthshire Industrial
Estates Ltd., and the West Cumberland Industrial Development Company Ltd.
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
242
There are Development Areas in the following parts of England and Wales: the
mining and coastal areas of Northumberland and Durham; West Cumberland;
South Wales and Monmouthshire; Wrexham; South Lancashire; Merseyside;
and North-East Lancashire. In Scotland, the industrial area in and around the
Clyde Valley, the Dundee area, and part of the Highlands have been scheduled as
the Scottish Development Area.
New industrial buildings and extensions to existing buildings, both of over
5,000 square feet, completed in Great Britain between the beginning of 1945 and
the end of 1957 totalled over 350 million square feet. Of this total, rather less than
30 per cent was in the Development Areas which have, by contrast, some 18 per
cent of the country’s insured workers in manufacturing industry.
Government assistance is not limited to Development Areas: the Board of Trade
gives attention to the needs of other areas of persistent unemployment and
tries to steer suitable new industry to them. In some of these places, and in
new towns or expanded towns (intended to receive population and industry moving
from London, Glasgow and other congested centres) factories may be built by
local authorities. In rural and fishing areas (for example, the Buckie-Peterhead
Area in north-east Scotland) which need a small amount of manufacturing industry,
the Development Commission has financed the building of several factories for
industrialists prepared to go there. The Government has recently acquired new
powers, under the Distribution of Industry (Industrial Finance) Act, 1958, to
enable financial assistance to be given to undertakings which will provide employ¬
ment in places, whether within or outside the Development Areas, where there
is a high rate of unemployment.
The Distribution of Industry Acts do not apply to Northern Ireland because,
under the Northern Ireland constitution, the matters they deal with are the con¬
cern of the Northern Ireland Parliament, which has passed its own legislation to
encourage industrial expansion and diversification. The Northern Ireland Govern¬
ment builds factories for renting or purchasing on favourable terms and provides
grants and loans for new industrial undertakings, and the Board of Trade gives
Northern Ireland priority as if it were a Development Area for the purposes of
encouraging and guiding new or expanding industrial development. As a result,
since 1945, more than 130 firms have started production for the first time in
Northern Ireland and 90 schemes of expansion have been put into effect. These
new firms and expansion schemes are already providing employment for 32,000
people. The United Kingdom Government also gives manufacturers in Northern
Ireland, as in Development Areas in Great Britain, some preference in placing
Government contracts.
Development Councils
In Scotland, the Scottish Council {Development and Industry), with a wide mem¬
bership including local authorities, trade associations, trade unions, Chambers of
Commerce, co-operative societies and banks, is concerned with the economic
development of Scotland. It assists the expansion of existing industry, fosters the
growth of new industries especially in areas requiring development, encourages
exports, organises exhibitions and publicises Scottish trade and industry.
In Wales, a body corresponding to the Scottish Council in aims and constitution
is the National Industrial Development Council of Wales and Monmouthshire.
The Northern Ireland Development Council was established in 1955 to promote the
creation of new industries and to reduce unemployment. The Council makes more
widely known in Great Britain, the United States and elsewhere, the facilities
INDUSTRY 243
offered by Northern Ireland to new undertakings. It also advises the Northern
Ireland Government on matters connected with industrial development.
The Structure of Industry
The pattern of ownership and organisation in industry is varied. Personal, cor¬
porate, co-operative and public enterprise all assume a number of different forms,
and all are important in the economy. Industrial enterprises vary from the many
small workshops to vast organisations such as the National Coal Board, a public
corporation with some 700,000 employees; Imperial Chemical Industries Ltd., a
limited liability company which, with its subsidiaries, employs some 115,000
persons in the United Kingdom; and the Co-operative Wholesale Society Ltd., a
co-operative society with some 50,000 employees.
Role of Public Enterprise
Throughout the first half of the twentieth century, the growth of the social
services, especially health, education and housing, led to the progressively greater
influence of the public sector of the economy. There was also an increase in
the State’s direct participation in productive economic activities, particularly in
the decade 1940-50. Since 1951, however, most of the steel industry and the road
haulage services of the British Transport Commission have been returned from
public to private ownership. State participation is effected mainly through special
statutory bodies set up to deal with a particular activity. Such bodies, though not
part of a Government Department, are under a considerable but varying degree
of public control (see pp. 248-9). The most important of these statutory bodies
are the public corporations which operate major industries and services in the
public interest.
The public corporation in its twentieth-century form is, generally speaking, a
public body having a clearly defined and specific task. Its board of directors and
its staff are chosen for their experience and competence in a particular field; they
are not civil servants, and although they are accountable to Parliament for their
actions in a variety of ways, it is they and not the Ministers of the sponsoring
Departments who are responsible for the management of the corporations. Certain
of the corporations are self-supporting; others receive Exchequer grants to help
them in carrying out the duties with which they have been charged.
Before the second world war, a number of public corporations were established1
in those industries and services where it was considered that the national interest
required co-ordination or control by a public authority. Their constitutions had no
standard pattern and their governing bodies differed in the method of appointment
and in composition.
Immediately after the second world war, the Nationalisation Acts set up public
corporations to run certain major industries and services, including coalmining,
1 The principal corporations appointed before the second world war were: (1) the
Central Electricity Board, established by the Electricity Supply Act, 1926, to rationalise
electricity generation and build and operate a main transmission system; (2) the British
Broadcasting Corporation, established in 1927 by Royal Charter to provide a national
broadcasting service; (3) the Electricity Board for Northern Ireland, established by the
Electricity (Supply) Act (Northern Ireland), 1931, to develop electricity supplies in
Northern Ireland outside the two County Boroughs, Belfast and Londonderry; (4) the
London Passenger Transport Board, established by Act of Parliament in 1933, to operate
the public transport system of the London Metropolitan area; (5) the Northern Ireland
Road Transport Board, established by the Road and Rail Transport Act (Northern Ireland),
1935, to acquire public road transport services in Northern Ireland outside the County
Boroughs; (6) the British Overseas Airways Corporation, established by the British Over¬
seas Airways Act, 1939, to take over the operation of the two main existing air transport
companies—Imperial Airways and British Airways.

244
inland transport, gas supply, electricity generation and supply, and civil air
transport. These post-war corporations are less varied in the structure of their
governing bodies, which are appointed by the responsible Minister, who has full
powers of dismissal.
The following corporations, the organisation and functions of which are described
in later chapters, are now operating or controlling industries or services:
The Bank of England.
The British Broadcasting Corporation.
Cable & Wireless Limited.
The British Transport Commission.
The Ulster Transport Authority.
The British Overseas Airways Corporation.
British European Airways.
The National Coal Board.
The Gas Council and Area Gas Boards.
The Electricity Council and the Central Electricity Generating Board.
The Electricity Board for Northern Ireland.
The North of Scotland Hydro-Electric Board.
The South of Scotland Electricity Board.
The United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority.
Mining and Quarrying
Much the most important of the British extractive industries is coalmining. The
coalmining industry of Great Britain is operated as a single co-ordinated enterprise
under the direction of the National Coal Board. For an account of the coal industry
see pp. 285-90.
All other mining and quarrying (e.g., iron ore, sand, gravel, chalk, limestone,
salt, tin, slate, oil shale and china clay) is undertaken by private enterprise, usually
owned and operated by limited liability companies. About 80,000 workers are
employed in the mining industries other than coalmining.
Manufacturing
Most manufacturing is in the hands of private enterprise. Some exceptions are
locomotives and rolling-stock for use on British Railways, built in workshops
owned and operated by the British Transport Commission, a considerable quantity
of arms and military equipment made in Royal Ordnance factories and other
factories operated by the Ministry of Supply, and some fighting ships built in naval
dockyards operated by the Admiralty. Printing and bookbinding is undertaken by
staffs of the Stationery Office, while the repair, and to a limited extent the con¬
struction, of Post Office equipment is carried on in factories run by the Post Office.
Surveys of the size of all manufacturing establishments employing more than
10 persons are made periodically by the Ministry of Labour and National Service;
the results of the most recent of these surveys, based on returns rendered by
employers in December 1955, show that about a third of all employees in manu¬
facturing industries are in establishments employing from 100 to 500 persons. A
high proportion of the biggest establishments are in the heavy industries, while the
average size of establishments in industries making consumer goods is smaller than
in manufacturing industries as a whole. Comparisons with results obtained in
earlier surveys on similar lines suggest that there is a slow but significant trend
towards an increase in the average size of manufacturing establishments: in 1955?
establishments with 1,000 or more employees were found to employ 2,640,000
persons, over ten per cent more than two years previously and more than twice as
many as in 1935.
INDUSTRY
245
The size of establishments is not in itself an indication of the size of manufacturing
firms, as a single firm may own several establishments. There are no general surveys
of the size of manufacturing firms comparable with the survey of establishments.
It is known, however, that in a few industries a small number of big companies
are responsible for most of the total production. Shares in these companies are
usually distributed among a great number of holders and it is unusual for a few
large holders to have a controlling interest.
T he way in which the work of production is divided within and between different
firms varies from industry to industry. In the cotton industry, for example, it is
usual for different firms to undertake the various main processes of production
(spinning, weaving, finishing), while in the woollen section of the wool textile
industry all these processes are commonly undertaken within the same firm. Some
of the leading establishments in the vehicles group of industries are primarily
engaged on the assembly of parts, many of which have been built for them under
contract by specialist firms.
An account of some of the principal manufacturing industries is given on
pp. 308-34.
Building and Civil Engineering
In building and civil engineering large-scale work is usually carried out by private
contractors. Since the end of the second world war, most new houses have been
built by firms under contract to local authorities, but an increasing number are
now built under contract to persons or companies, or for sale.
Building firms may be divided into those undertaking general building and civil
engineering work and those concerned with highly specialised work, many of
which operate outside as well as inside the building industry. Building is an industry
of small firms; more than half of the firms employ fewrer than twenty employees.
For a fuller account of the building and civil engineering industries see pp. 305—8.
Industrial Association
From the middle of the nineteenth century, private industrial undertakings have
increasingly entered into voluntary association for a number of different purposes.
Some of the more important of these purposes may be classified as follows:
1. The provision of common services, the exchange of infonnation, liaison
with Government, and representation of their members’ point of view.
2. The regulation of trading practices.
3. Negotiation with trade unions on wages and conditions of work.
Associations for the first and third of these purposes cover, with varying com¬
pleteness, most of British industry but there are wide sectors of industry where
there is no collective agreement to regulate trading practices. Associations which
deal with labour matters usually consist of firms engaged in the same type of
operation or manufacturing process. Organisations mainly concerned with repre¬
sentations to the Government, provision of common services or the regulation of
prices are built up round a product or an allied group of products. In an industrial
sector concerned wholly with an allied group of products, a single association may
undertake all the required functions.
There are about 270 national federations and probably about 1,600 other em¬
ployers’ organisations (mostly regional or local, and members or branches of the
national federations) all concerned with negotiation of wages and conditions of
work. Most of the national federations are in turn affiliated to the British Employers'
Confederation, the national body representing employers on labour questions
affecting industry generally (see Chapter XI).

The number of manufacturers’ associations concerned with providing common
services and regulating prices and trading methods is not known precisely, but
according to a survey carried out by Political and Economic Planning between
1953 and 1956, some 1,300 are in existence, varying greatly in importance, structure
and activities. Membership of the Federation of British Industries (FBI), the national
body recognised as the spokesman for British industry on economic, commercial
and production (as distinct from labour) matters, consists of more than 7,600
individual firms and nearly 300 national trade organisations, with a total affiliated
membership of some 40,000 to 45,000 firms. The FBI has offices in the main
industrial centres in the United Kingdom and is widely represented abroad. It has
a wholly owned subsidiary company, British Overseas Fairs Limited, which is
responsible for the organisation of British trade fairs overseas.
A number of the organisations affiliated to the FBI also deal with labour matters
and are affiliated to the British Employers’ Confederation. The two organisations
work closely together on matters of common interest.
Other important national associations of employers are the National Union of
Manufacturers (NUM) and the Association of British Chambers of Commerce. The
members of NUM are over 5,000 manufacturing firms, mainly small or medium
sized, and some 70 trade associations are affiliated to it. Like the FBI it has regional
branches. The Association of British Chambers of Commerce is the central organi¬
sation to which about 100 local Chambers of Commerce are affiliated. In Scotland,
there is also a central organisation, the Council of Scottish Chambers of Commerce.
These bodies are open to all kinds of producers and traders and exist for promoting
the interests of local industry and commerce. The FBI, the NUM and the Chambers
of Commerce often act jointly in matters of common concern.
Relations with Government
The Government is able to influence industry in a number of ways—through
fiscal and monetary policy, by means of physical controls and inducements, as well
as by providing information and advice.
A system has grown up whereby a particular Government Department acts as
the main point of contact, a ‘production department’ for each major industry.
The Department through which the Government’s relations with trade and
industry are chiefly conducted is the Board of Trade, and the Board’s responsibili¬
ties cover a wide range of industries and materials. Certain industries and services,
however, are the responsibility of other Departments, as production departments:
Ministry of Supply
Admiralty
Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and
Food
Ministry of Power
Ministry of Transport and Civil
Aviation
Ministry of Works
Aircraft, radio and light metal indus¬
tries and explosives. (The primary
task of the Ministry is to supply the
armed forces.)
Shipbuilding and ship-repairing.
Farming, horticulture, agricultural
machinery, fisheries, and food pro¬
cessing.
Coal, oil, gas, electricity (including
nuclear power), iron and steel.
Transport services (including civil
aviation), roadmaking, and certain
sections of the quarrying industry.
Building, civil engineering and build¬
ing materials.
INDUSTRY
247
Ministry of Housing and Local House-building.
Government
Ministry of Health .. . . . . Medical and surgical goods.
The Treasury is responsible for overall economic policy, and specifically for
fiscal and monetary policy through which it is able to influence the level of economic
activity and the utilisation of the nation’s resources, in particular the volume of
investment. The Ministry of Labour and National Service is the channel through
which manpower policy is conducted.
There are separate Departments of the Northern Ireland Government for matters
within the competence of the Northern Ireland Parliament. The Ministry of
Commerce deals with industry, including the encouragement of industrial
development.
During and after the second world war, many operations of industry and com¬
merce were subject to Government control. Most of these controls have been
relaxed, but some remain. Thus, the consent of the Treasury is required for the
issue of new capital in excess of £50,000; and that of the Board of Trade for the
import or export of certain goods. The powers of the Board of Trade to influence
the location of industry have been mentioned earlier in this chapter, and those of
the Ministry of Housing and Local Government, acting through local planning
authorities, to control the use of land are described on pp. 177-81.
The Central Statistical Office, which is attached to the Cabinet Office, was
established in 1940 to provide a comprehensive statistical service to assist the
authorities in framing economic and financial policy. Although Departments
themselves compile statistics relating to their particular responsibilities, and may
publish them in their own standard publications, the comprehensive publications,
the Monthly Digest of Statistics and the Annual Abstract of Statistics, are prepared
by the Central Statistical Office. It is also the source of the annual estimates of
national income and expenditure published in the annual Economic Survey of the
United Kingdom, issued before the Budget statement, and in The National Income
and Expenditure issued later in the year. A Digest of Scottish Statistics is published
half-yearly by the Scottish Statistical Office.
All Departments which are production authorities, and some others, including
the Treasury, the Ministry of Labour and National Service, and the Department
of Scientific and Industrial Research (see p. 251) have a responsibility for promoting
increased productivity and efficiency in industry. The Board of Trade, besides
being the major production department, is responsible for co-ordinating official
activities for the promotion of productivity. A fuller account of official and private
action for the promotion of productivity is given on pp. 249-52.
To ensure that industry is fully aware of Government policy and also that policy
is framed with a full knowledge of industry’s needs and difficulties, a number of
consultative bodies have been set up representing Government, employers’ associa¬
tions and trade unions. Among the more important of these are the National Pro¬
duction Advisory Council on Industry (NPACI) and the National Joint Advisory
Council (NJAC). The NJAC consists of representatives of private employers, the
boards of nationalised industries and trade unionists, under the chairmanship of
the Minister of Labour and National Service, and is concerned with matters affecting
the relations between employers and workers. The NPACI, which covers the wider
problems of industrial production, is under the chairmanship of the Chancellor of
the Exchequer and includes representatives of the Regional Boards for Industry
(see overleaf) and of certain Government Departments as well as of employers and
workers. Northern Ireland has its own Production Council, corresponding to the
NPACI, to the meetings of which it sends two representatives as observers.

An important body, which is purely advisory to the Government rather than a
channel of communication with industry, is the Economic Planning Board. It was
established in 1947 to advise on economic policy; its proceedings are confidential.
The chairman of the Board is one of the two Permanent Secretaries to the Treasury,
and its membership includes representatives of the Treasury, the Board of Trade,
the Ministry of Power and the Ministry of Labour and National Service, and
nominees of the Trades Union Congress, the Federation of British Industries and
the British Employers’ Confederation.
These consultative bodies approach the study of problems from a broad national
point of view. There are, in addition, consultative bodies concerned with the special
problems of Scotland and Wales and of the English regions. The most important
of these are the Regional Boards for Industry and the corresponding Scottish and
Welsh Boards for Industry, whose main functions are to keep the Government
informed on industrial conditions in the nine English regions and in Wales and
Scotland, and to provide a link between central Government and local industry.
Government and the Nationalised Industries
The extent to which the responsible Minister has power over the working of
the Boards which have been set up to run the nationalised industries varies from
industry to industry, but two features are common to almost all of them. First, the
Minister appoints the chairman and members of each Board, and secondly, he has
power to give general directions as to how the industry should be run, but does not
interfere in day-to-day management. It is usually also laid down that the Board
shall give to the Minister any information, statistics and financial accounts which
he may require. In practice, as the responsible Minister is kept fully informed and
major policy decisions are reached in consultation with him, there is very seldom
occasion for him to issue a formal directive, and, in fact, only two such directives
have been issued.
The Minister also has financial powers and responsibilities. The usual financial
arrangement is that the Board is required to conduct its business so that receipts
at least balance outgoings over a period of years. The responsible Minister is
usually empowered (subject to Treasury approval) to say what shall be done with
any surplus should the Boards make a profit. As regards finance of capital expendi¬
ture, the present system is that such finance is provided, in the form of interest¬
earning loans, by the Minister from the Exchequer, bank advances being used only
for normal requirements of short-term capital once outstanding loans have been
repaid.
The Minister responsible for each nationalised industry must take steps to see
that the interests of the industry’s customers are protected. This is usually done
by the establishment of representative consumers’ councils to consider complaints
and suggestions made to them, and to advise the Board or the Minister on the
changes they think desirable. It is recognised that these arrangements are still to
a great extent experimental.
Government policy towards these industries is subject to the approval of
Parliament. Opportunities for parliamentary discussion are afforded by debates,
including debates on their annual reports and accounts, and by answers to
parliamentary questions, which, in principle, are only admissible if concerned with
policy rather than details of administration.
In order to ensure that parliamentary discussion of the nationalised industries is
informed and effective, a House of Commons Select Committee on the Nationalised
Industries was established in March 1957- The terms of reference of the
Committee are to examine the reports and accounts of the nationalised industries
INDUSTRY
249
established by statute, whose controlling Boards are appointed by Ministers of the
Crown and whose annual receipts are not wholly or mainly derived from money
provided by Parliament or advanced by the Exchequer. The first report of the
Select Committee, published in May 1958, related to the coalmining industry, and
was debated in the House of Commons in July 1958, together with the annual
report of the National Coal Board.
In most other respects these industries under public ownership have the same
relations with the Departments responsible for them as do the private industries;
they look to them for sponsorship and advice on productivity, and are subject to the
same controls.
Legislation on Monopolies and Restrictive Practices
Competition may be limited either by agreements (whether formal or informal)
among several parties or as a result of monopoly or other restrictive trade practices.
There are separate legislation and procedures for the two forms of impairment of
competition.
The Restrictive Trade Practices Act, 1956, provides for the registration of
restrictive trading agreements (including those relating to common prices, approved
lists of dealers and restriction of production) by the Registrar of Restrictive Trading
Agreements. Agreements relating exclusively to exports are not registrable but
have to be notified to the Board of Trade. The Registrar has two main functions.
First, he maintains the register of agreements which may be inspected by the
public. Secondly, he is responsible for bringing agreements before the Restrictive
Practices Court, set up by the Act, which has power to determine whether such
agreements are in the public interest. Each division of the Court consists of a High
Court judge and two lay members. Agreements are presumed to be against the
public interest unless the parties can show that they afford one or more of certain
advantages and that the degree of restriction is not unreasonable. If this cannot
be shown, such agreements are void and, moreover, the Court can make orders to
prevent the agreement, or any other like it, from being continued or enforced.
Monopolies and other arrangements which are not within the scope of the Court
may be referred by the Board of Trade to the Monopolies Commission for investiga¬
tion and report. Production Departments take appropriate action on the basis of
these reports.
The 1956 Act also makes unlawful the maintenance of resale prices by collective
action to withhold supplies or by other collectively enforced discriminatory
arrangements; at the same time the Act strengthens the powers of individual
suppliers to enforce their retail prices through the civil courts.
Prior to the passing of the 1956 Act, a Monopolies and Restrictive Practices
Commission, established under the Monopolies and Restrictive Practices (Inquiry
and Control) Act, 1948, had investigated a number of industries. Several industries
modified their practices in accordance with its recommendations.
Production and Productivity
Industrial production (mining and quarrying, manufacturing, building and
contracting, and gas, electricity and water) which, in 1957, was more than 50 per
cent greater than before the war, increased rapidly in the immediate post-war years
as industry was turned over from war production and manpower was released from
the armed forces. It had regained the pre-war level by 1946 and was 15 per cent
greater by 1948. The course of production, employment and productivity since
1948 is shown in Table 14.

From 1948 to 1957, industrial production rose by 38 per cent. The numbers
employed in industry rose by only 12 per cent, giving an increase in output
per man of 24 per cent. This rise in productivity was the result of greater efficiency
through the introduction of improved methods and processes. Production showed
only a small change in 1955-58, mainly because of measures taken to check
inflationary tendencies. ...
Since the war, the greatest increases in production have been in the engineering,
shipbuilding and electrical goods group, the vehicles group, the chemicals group,
the paper and printing group, and the gas, electricity and water group, with
increases between 1948 and 1957 of approximately 55 per cent, 65 per cent, 92 per
cent, 69 per cent and 63 per cent respectively. Consumption of electric power by
factories and other industrial establishments doubled between 1948 and 1957.
The increase of productivity has been a constant concern of Government and
industry. Production authorities, for example, encourage the establishment, within
each industry and within individual undertakings, of joint councils and committees
in which representatives of employers and workers discuss together improvements
in methods and techniques. They also work with and through various statutory
and voluntary bodies concerned with the same ends and make grants to them.
Such bodies include employers’ associations and trade unions; the British
Productivity Council (BPC), a voluntary body representing employers and trade
unions; the various management and professional associations, including the
British Institute of Management; the Council of Industrial Design; and the
Development Councils for the cotton industry (The Cotton Board) and for the
furniture industry.
The British Productivity Council was formally established in November 1952,
and has continued and developed the work of the Anglo-American Productivity
Council which, between 1948 and 1952, helped to promote productivity by sending
productivity teams, made up of representatives of management, technicians and
operatives from many British industries, to study techniques and methods in the
United States. The BPC is an independent body on which the following organisa¬
tions are represented: the British Employers’ Confederation, the Federation of
British Industries, the Trades Union Congress, the Association of British Chambers
INDUSTRY
251
of Commerce, the National Union of Manufacturers and the nationalised industries.
It operates through 74 local productivity committees, 33 local productivity associa¬
tions and a work study unit, set up in 1954 to stimulate a wider appreciation of
work study. Its activities include the publication of a monthly bulletin and a large
number of booklets and pamphlets and also the making of productivity films.
The Board of Trade, as the Department co-ordinating productivity promotion,
has responsibilities additional to those of other production departments. It conducts
information services bearing on the efficiency of British industry and, in particular,
on methods of increasing industrial productivity. It is responsible jointly with the
Ministry of Labour and National Service for the editorial policy of Target, a
monthly productivity bulletin circulated to firms and trade unions. During the
years 1953-57 it administered, in consultation with other Departments and with
the United States International Co-operation Administration, the sterling counter¬
part funds of United States Conditional Aid, which at that time formed an important
part of the public funds used to further higher productivity in trade, industry and
agriculture. The funds were used to establish and expand technical information
and advisory services, to promote technological studies, to provide films and books,
to finance studies on the improvement of efficiency, and to establish revolving
funds totalling £1 million to make loans available to small and medium-sized
firms in industry and to agricultural interests. The Conditional Aid Scheme is now
completed, but many of the activities to which it gave rise are being continued
independently.
The Department of Scientific and Industrial Research (DSIR), whose chief
purpose is to promote the researches which are the main basis of the long-term
growth of efficiency, is also concerned directly with the research into factors
immediately affecting productivity and with the provision of a technical advisory
service.
Technical advice is also available for those firms which ask for it through such
services as the National Agricultural Advisory Service of the Ministry of Agricul¬
ture, Fisheries and Food, and the Personnel Management Advisory Service of
the Ministry of Labour and National Service.
The British Standards Institution, a voluntary non-profit-making body
incorporated by Royal Charter, seeks to promote industrial efficiency by voluntary
standardisation, i.e. by getting manufacturers to agree to substitute a defined
number of sizes and qualities of a product, where there exists an unnecessary
variety. It is governed by a General Council, consisting of representatives of the
main organisations of employers and workers, professional institutions and the
larger Government Departments. It receives a Government grant.
An important contribution to higher productivity lies in the increasing use
of automation equipment—the adoption of techniques of greater mechanisation by
transfer machines or the linking of machine tools in automatic production lines,
the application of automatic control over manufacturing processes and the use of
electronic data processing equipment. Most types of automation equipment are
already manufactured in the United Kingdom, and over the next five years British
firms plan to introduce automation on a large scale.
Management
A factor contributing to the growth of productivity in British industry has been
the development of new methods of management. During the present century, and
particularly during and since the second world war, there has emerged in the
United Kingdom, as elsewhere, a growing awareness of the importance of manage¬
ment as a subject requiring special skills and knowledge; this has been stimulated
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
252
partly by the need to raise productivity in order to compete successfully in world
markets, and partly by the conditions of full employment and pressure upon
supplies of basic commodities such as steel, all combining to require the most
effective employment of men, materials and machinery. Thus, there is now in the
United Kingdom a considerable body of information about, and interest in, such
subjects as production methods (including work study, work simplification,
plant layout and planned maintenance), the financial tools of management, such
as cost accounting, and the techniques of such matters as production planning and
product standardisation. In addition, increased attention is being paid to human
relations in industry, and to the importance of communication between management
and labour.
A number of specialised management associations have come into being, requiring
educational and other qualifications for membership, while, since the first world
war, the professional engineering institutions have included industrial administra¬
tion in the syllabus of their qualifying examinations.
During the second world war, the need was recognised for a central institution
to co-ordinate education, information and research in management subjects. Soon
after the end of the war, a committee was appointed by the President of the Board
of Trade to formulate precise proposals for such an institution, and, following its
report, the British Institute of Management (BIM) was formed in 1947. Although the
Institute has received financial support from the Government and the Conditional
Aid Programme, its main source of income is subscriptions from companies who are
corporate subscribers.
Interest in scientific management is widespread, and facilities for management
training at all levels have been much extended, one of the most recent developments
being the growth of work study courses. Education for management is developing
mainly in four ways:
(1) a national scheme operated by the BIM in conjunction with technical and
commercial colleges, under which intermediate certificates and final
diplomas are granted on the basis of examinations;
(2) independent courses organised by universities, other educational establish¬
ments, and professional organisations;
(3) training courses organised by employers’ associations, trade unions and
various voluntary bodies; and
(4) formal courses and informal training for executives organised within
individual firms.
There are probably between 400,000 and 500,000 persons who hold managerial
posts in industry and commerce in the United Kingdom, and only a minority of
them are as yet members of any management body or have received systematic
training in the principles of management.
AGRICULTURE
Although Britain is a densely populated, industrialised country relying on imports
for half its food supply, agriculture remains one of its largest and most important
industries. It occupies nearly one million people, or over 4 per cent of those in
civil employment, and provides about 4 per cent of the gross national product, using
48 million of the 60 million acres of land.
THE LAND AND ITS USES
The land in general is highly fertile, and current agricultural practices, founded
upon an age-old tradition of good husbandry improved by the application of modern
INDUSTRY
253
scientific methods, result in some of the world’s finest pedigree livestock and most
successful varieties of seeds. Thus, Britain is the largest exporter of pedigree
animals for breeding purposes; of twenty breeds of cattle, sheep, pigs and farm
horses of world-wide reputation, all but five or six originated in Britain. United
Kingdom seeds have won world championships at the Canadian Royal Agricultural
Winter Fairs at Toronto every year but one since first entered in 1952.
The agricultural industry in Britain is less subject to serious dislocation caused
by extreme climatic conditions than it is in some other countries; crops and live¬
stock, for example, are seldom subjected to the dangers of drought, or floods, or
severe cold. Nevertheless, abnormal climatic conditions do sometimes occur such
as, in recent years, the severe winter of 1946-47, the East Coast floods of 1953, and
the wet summers of 1954, 1956 and 1958.
Farms: Numbers and Ownership
There are about 523,000 agricultural holdings (excluding holdings consisting
entirely of rough grazings) in the United Kingdom: 316,000 in England; 55,000 in
Wales; 71,000 in Scotland; and 81,000 in Northern Ireland. About three-fifths of
the total holdings are under 50 acres in size (crops and grass, excluding any area of
rough grazings), but 97,000 (18 per cent) are over 100 acres and 16,000 (3 per cent)
over 300 acres.
Of nearly a million people employed in agriculture, about one-third are farmers,
the rest being paid employees or members of the farmers’ families.
Many farmers own their own land freehold, but the more usual arrangement is
for a tenant farmer (who has a measure of security of tenure) to operate the farm
and own the stock, crops and movable equipment, while the landlord owns the
land, buildings, and fixed equipment, and is responsible for their maintenance and
improvement. Returns made in 1950, for the purpose of the United Nations Food
and Agriculture Organisation’s World Census, showed that about 36 per cent of
holdings in England and Wales were wholly owned by the occupier; 49 per cent
were wholly rented and 15 per cent were part-owned and part-rented. The propor¬
tion of owner-occupiers was substantially higher in the case of holdings of under
five acres, but did not vary appreciably from size group to size group in the case
of the larger holdings. In Scotland, about 36 per cent of all holdings are wholly
owner-occupied, 60 per cent are wholly rented and 4 per cent are part-owned and
part-rented. In Northern Ireland, all farmers either own their holdings or are in
the process of becoming owners. In general, farms in Britain are run as businesses,
each by a single manager, usually the farmer himself. Most farmers belong to one
or more of the various organisations, such as the National Farmers’ Unions, which
exist to represent their collective interests, and also to agricultural co-operative
societies, which provide them with bulk-purchase and bulk-selling facilities.
Types of Farming
Types of farming vary with differences of soil and climate. Most of the better
farming land is in the lowland areas of Britain.
In England and Wales, out of a total of 29-6 million acres of agricultural land,
24-5 million acres are under crops and grass, the remainder being rough grazings.
Most farms are mixed farms, but in general the eastern half of England is devoted
predominantly to arable, and the western half of England, together with Wales,
to dairy farming. Pasture farming accounts for 37 per cent of agricultural land,
arable for 22 per cent and mixed farming for 29 per cent, the remainder being
unclassifiable or of little agricultural value. The chief crops are wheat, barley, oats,
potatoes, sugar beet and fodder crops. Market gardens are usually found near
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
254
towns, but much of the vegetable production is now on arable and mixed farms.
Fattening of animals for food is widespread but is carried on particularly in the
south-eastern and eastern counties and the Midlands; stock-rearing is prevalent
in Wales and in the North of England.
In Scotland, out of a total of about 15 million acres of agricultural land, 4^ million
acres are under crops and grass, the rest being rough hill grazings. The chief crop
is oats; next come root crops for stock-feeding; potatoes, especially seed potatoes,
and barley are also important crops. The area under wheat is small. In the south¬
west, dairying is the chief branch of the industry, while cropping and fattening
cattle are carried on mainly in the east. The rearing of stock (especially sheep) is
of importance in the hill areas.
In Northern Ireland, the total of 2'89 million acres of agricultural land in 1957
included 2’15 million acres under crops and pasture. The land is intensively
farmed, the chief crops being oats, potatoes, barley and ryegrass for seed. Between
80 and 85 per cent of Northern Ireland’s agricultural income is derived from live¬
stock and livestock products.
The use of agricultural land for the various crops (see also map) and the numbers
of livestock on farms in the United Kingdom since 1939 are shown in Tables 15
and 16.

Horticulture
In June 1957, apart from private gardens and allotments, 733,000 acres in the
United Kingdom were under horticultural crops in the open (not including
potatoes), 300,000 acres being devoted to fruit, 399,000 acres to vegetables and
29,000 acres to flowers. The area of crops growing in glasshouses was nearly 5,000
acres. The value of output in the crop year 1956-57 was estimated at £123 million,
or about 1 / i ith of the value of the total agricultural output of the United Kingdom.
Although horticultural produce of one kind or another is grown on some 70,000
holdings, included in this number are many farms in the western counties of
England on which cider apples are the only horticultural crop, while many arable
farms in the eastern and south-eastern counties are growing one or more vegetable
crops as part of the rotation. The number of holdings on which horticulture is the
main interest is therefore very much less than 70,000.
Most of the principal growing areas are within easy reach of the large industrial
towns, the main centres of market gardening being in the Vale of Evesham (in
Worcestershire), Bedfordshire, Kent, Essex and Lancashire. Farm production of
peas and the coarser types of vegetables, such as carrots and winter cabbages, is
mainly in the Eastern counties from Yorkshire to Essex. Glasshouse production is
widespread, but the main centres are in the Lea Valley (north of London), in
Sussex and in Lancashire. Kent is the chief county for fruit, though East Anglia,
Worcestershire and the area around Wisbech are also important fruit areas.
Early vegetables come from Cornwall and the Channel Islands, and early
flowers (grown in the open) come from the Isles of Scilly.
Smallholdings and Allotments
There are some 19,000 smallholdings in England and Wales provided by county
councils and county borough councils and by the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries
and Food. Of these, some 11,000 are capable of providing a full-time occupation
for the tenant. These smallholdings are let only to people with practical experience
in agriculture, preferably agricultural workers, with the object of affording them
an opportunity to become farmers on their own account. Loans may be made to
the tenants of up to 75 per cent of the working capital they require.
Of the smallholdings provided by the Ministry, approximately 1,000 situated
on 18 different estates are managed by the Land Settlement Association Limited,
which was originally formed in 1934 to develop smallholdings for unemployed
men from industrial areas. The Association provides centrally on each estate
INDUSTRY
257
various services for the tenants’ use, including the supply of agricultural stores
and requisites, the operation of a machinery pool, and the packing and marketing
of produce.
The Welsh Land Settlement Society, which was also formed to assist in the
settlement on the land of unemployed industrial workers, created one estate similar
to those of the Land Settlement Association and a number of profit-sharing farms,
which still operate.
Land settlement in Scotland has always been carried out by the central Govern¬
ment, which now owns and maintains some 432,000 acres of Land Settlement
Estates with over 4,000 holdings.
There are also nearly one million allotments in the United Kingdom; most of
these are allotment gardens1 and about half are permanent statutory allotments
provided by local authorities who, under the Allotments Acts, have the duty to
provide allotments, if practicable, wherever there is a need.
The growing of vegetables and fruit and the keeping of small livestock such as
poultry, rabbits, bees, pigs and goats by gardeners and allotment-holders is wide¬
spread in Britain. Voluntary organisations exist to provide advice, guidance and
trading facilities and generally to assist those interested in such activities. The
National Council for Domestic Food Production, formed in 1951 by the Minister of
Agriculture, co-ordinates the work of these organisations and encourages the
development of domestic food production as a form of self-help, providing social
and recreational benefits.
Changes since 1870
In the middle of the nineteenth century Britain was largely self-sufficient in
agricultural production. Then, wool, grain and, later, meat—all produced cheaply
from virgin lands overseas—were increasingly imported and, as a result, the
farming industry had to adapt itself to the changing conditions by concentrating
much more on milk, eggs, pigs and horticultural produce. These changes in pro¬
duction and types of farming, in successive attempts to meet changes of fortune,
resulted in a continuous trend away from an agricultural industry based mainly
on grain to one based more on livestock and livestock products and, among crops,
an increasing emphasis on vegetables.
The arable area in Britain declined continuously from 1872 until 1939, except
during the first world war; the meat, dairy and poultry industries becoming in¬
creasingly dependent on imported feedingstuffs. The outbreak of the second world
war was, however, followed by an immediate reversal of farming practice, for shortage
of shipping space for imports demanded a greatly increased home production of
crops for direct human consumption, such as wheat and potatoes, largely at the
expense of livestock and livestock products other than milk. The post-war world
food shortage and Britain’s balance of payments problems made it necessary for
Britain to maintain increased grain production, but since 1947 an expansion of
output of livestock, livestock products and animal feedingstuffs has been encouraged
concurrently with the maintenance of a high level of production of grain and other
crops.
PRODUCTION
Before the second world war, Britain produced about 31 per cent of its food
supply (in terms of calories for human consumption). By 1957 this had risen to
1 An allotment garden is a piece of land not bigger than a quarter of an acre which is

for consumption in his own home.

258
nearly 40 per cent, and in terms of value represented about one-half compared
with a little over one-third before the war. Imports of food and feedingstuffs
(including oils and oilseeds) accounted for 45 per cent of total imports pre-war
and 38 per cent in 1957. The percentages by weight of total supplies of certain
foods provided by home production in post-war years compared with the pre-war
average are shown in Table 17*

Production trends since the war for some of the main agricultural products are
shown in Table 18. An increase in agricultural production of over 60 per cent since
pre-war has been achieved in spite of a slow decline in the agricultural labour force
since the war. There has, in fact, been a very large increase in productivity, due to
improved crop and livestock varieties, more intensive use of fertilisers, pesticides
and fungicides, and greatly increased mechanisation, which has made it possible to
work much larger acreages of arable land. Higher agricultural production and
productivity has been a major objective of Government policy, and has been
fostered by assurances, inducements, advisory services, controls and other measures.
The output per acre of horticultural produce is also considerably higher than it
was before the second world war. About 85 per cent of total supplies of vegetables
and 50 per cent of fruit are home grown. In 1957) output was estimated at 2,339,000
tons of vegetables and 725,000 tons of fruit.
Mechanisation
The estimated number of tractors (excluding small market-garden types) in the
United Kingdom in 1925 was about 21,000, in 1939 about 55,000, and in 1957
about 444,000. Britain and Western Germany have the greatest tractor densities in
the world, one tractor per 38 acres of arable land. The increase in some of the
INDUSTRY
259
newer types of agricultural machines has been even more notable; thus it is
estimated that over 37,000 combined harvester-threshers were in use in the 1957
harvest; in 1939 there were only 150. In a climate such as Britain s, the widespread
use of these combines gives rise to the need for extensive drying and storage
facilities for grain.
Considerable, but as yet not complete, success has attended intensive efforts to
solve the problem of mechanising the cultivation and harvesting of root crops,
especially potatoes and sugar beet, with their heavy seasonal labour requirements.
Great strides have been made in the development of a wide range of equipment
to assist the production of grass in the various forms silage, hay and dried grass—
upon which British farm livestock very largely depends for winter fodder.
Milking machines have gained rapidly in popularity in recent years and con¬
siderable use is made of mechanical handling equipment for milk. About two-thirds
of the farms in Great Britain are supplied with electricity.

BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
GOVERNMENT POLICY
The Government has wide functions in relation to agriculture, most of them
exercised by the Agricultural Ministers, i.e. the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries
and Food in England and Wales, the Secretary of State for Scotland, and the
Minister of Agriculture for Northern Ireland.
The severe agricultural depression which followed the fall in the general price
level after 1920 resulted in the introduction of forms of protection and financial
assistance for agriculture. Commodity commissions were set up for sugar beet,
wheat and livestock, with the responsibility of administering Government subsidies
or other forms of direct financial assistance for the production of those commodities.
In addition, producer-controlled marketing boards were established with powers
to regulate the marketing of milk, pigs and bacon, hops and potatoes and, in 1937,
the Government assumed powers to pay acreage subsidies to assist producers of
barley and oats.
During the second world war and the immediate post-war years, agricultural
production and marketing were closely controlled by the State, and County War
Agricultural Executive Committees, composed of local representatives of agricultural
interests, acted as the Government’s local agents, as did similar committees during
the first world war. As a result of Government control, the functions of marketing
boards and commodity commissions were largely suspended. Most of these organi¬
sations have now had their powers restored to them or their functions have been
superseded by other arrangements.
The main objective of United Kingdom agricultural policy continues to be that
set out in Section I of the Agriculture Act, 1947, namely—‘a stable and efficient
agricultural industry capable of producing such part of the nation’s food and other
agricultural produce as in the national interest it is desirable to produce in the
United Kingdom, and of producing it at minimum prices consistent with proper
remuneration and living conditions for farmers and workers in agriculture and an
adequate return on capital invested in the industry’. To this end, the Government
is empowered to provide guaranteed prices for the main agricultural products and
to afford a measure of security of tenure to tenant farmers. In return, farmers and
landowners are expected to maintain efficiency in husbandry and estate management.
The Agricultural Ministers had powers, exercised through the Agricultural
Executive Committees, see p. 261 (but repealed in 1958), to enforce minimum
standards of efficiency by supervision and direction and eventually by dispossession.
The Government promotes efficiency by providing technical advisory services, and
also various grants to farmers and landowners in respect of certain operations and
requisites designed to improve productivity.
The Agriculture Act, 1947, was introduced at a time of food shortage and was
administered at first in conjunction with a system of State purchase of food, far-
reaching controls over agricultural production and marketing, and food rationing.
Agricultural policy was aimed primarily at increasing output, which in fact by
1952 was 50 per cent above the pre-war level. As world supplies of food and Britain’s
own agricultural production and trading position improved, the Government
gradually restored to private business both the import of food and all domestic
trading in food. All consumer rationing of food ended in Britain on 3rd July, 1954-
With the ending of the period of scarcity, policy objectives have undergone a
change of emphasis. In recent years stress has been laid on the need for more
economic production adapted to market requirements, increased technical efficiency,
and economies in the use of imported feedingstuffs, rather than on an indiscriminate
expansion of production.
INDUSTRY 261
In 1958, after its annual review of the industry the Government’s view was that
development should proceed in the following directions:
(1) the maintenance of a large arable acreage of about the current size but with
more emphasis on feed crops than on wheat;
(2) greater reliance on home-produced feed for livestock;
(3) production of more beef and lamb of the quality wanted by the market;
and
(4) the production of less milk, pigmeat and eggs.
The Government’s long-term objective is to achieve a steady improvement in
the competitive position of the industry.
County Agricultural Executive Committees
In England and Wales, County Agricultural Executive Committees (CAECs),
which superseded the County War Agricultural Executive Committees, were set
up under the provision of the Agriculture Act, 1947. In Scotland, 11 similar bodies,
now known as Agricultural Executive Committees, were set up, while in Northern
Ireland each county has a Committee of Agriculture which acts mainly in an
advisory capacity to the Northern Ireland Ministry of Agriculture. An Agricultural
Executive Officer, working directly under the Northern Ireland Ministry of Agri¬
culture, is responsible for carrying out the Government’s agricultural policy in each
county.
Each County Agricultural Executive Committee in England and Wales consists
of 12 members. Five are appointed directly by the Minister, and seven from panels
nominated by the interests concerned, three being farmers, two landowners and
two agricultural workers. The Committees, most of which are represented locally
by District Committees, are charged with promoting agricultural development and
efficiency. In the past, they were partly concerned with the administration of
controls, partly wdth the administration of trading services, subsidies and routine
executive work, and partly with technical advice to farmers. Some of these functions
have now lapsed, and the administration of trading services, subsidies and routine
executive work is left to officials. Their main tasks are now to assist the technical
services of the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food in promoting technical
development; to give advice and assistance on local agricultural problems; and to
advise on the administration of certain grant and subsidy schemes and on the
development and local application of policy. They also retain certain statutory and
executive functions, the chief of which are the registration and licensing of milk
producers, and the control of land and bird pests.
The Crofters Commission
In the seven Scottish counties known as crofting counties—Argyll, Caithness,
Inverness, Orkney, Ross and Cromarty, Sutherland and Shetland much of the
land is farmed by crofters, tenant farmers whose holdings are either rented at not
more than £50 a year or have an area not exceeding 50 acres.
In 1947, there were in these counties nearly 21,000 crofts, which produced about
half the total agricultural output of the area. The special problems of the crofting
counties, which had for some time been suffering from a declining population and
falling agricultural production, led to the setting up, under the Crofters (Scotland)
Act, 1955, of a Crofters Commission whose functions are to reorganise, develop
and regulate crofting in the crofting counties, to promote the interests of crofters
and to keep under review matters relating to crofting. When a croft becomes vacant,
the landlord must advise the Crofters Commission of his proposals for letting the
262
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
croft; the Commission has power to approve or veto these proposals, to require
that a vacant croft be let as an enlargement to another croft, and generally to ensure
that all vacant crofts are let in the best interest of the crofting communities. For
the same purpose the Commission has power to dispossess absentee tenants who
are, however, able to retain their croft houses in certain circumstances. It may
authorise the granting of feus (pieces of land held on a perpetual lease at a fixed
rent) to aged and infirm crofters who wish to give up their land but to retain their
houses. The Commission has power to carry out reorganisation schemes in derelict
or decaying ‘townships’, if a majority of the resident crofters agree, by reallocating
the land in a way which, in the Commission’s opinion, would lead to the proper
and efficient use of the land and the general benefit of the township. The Com¬
mission has powers to ensure that crofters work their crofts according to the rules
of good husbandry, and it is responsible for approving regulations governing the
use of common grazings. It acts as agent for the Secretary of State for Scotland in
the administration of schemes of loans and grants for the development of agri¬
cultural production on crofts, and collaborates with other bodies in carrying out
measures for economic development and social improvement in crofting areas.
The Agricultural Land Commission
The Agricultural Land Commission was set up under the Agriculture Act, i947>
to manage lands vested in the then Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries, or land
for which he has become responsible, and to advise and assist the Minister in matters
relating to the management of agricultural land. The Commission’s functions in
Wales are delegated to the Welsh Agricultural Land Sub-Commission. Early in
1954 the Minister decided, after consultation with the Commission, to sell land
managed by it wherever that could suitably be done. At 31st March, 1958, 183,237
acres were under the control of the Commission and almost all of this land was let to
private farmers. Rather more than half of the land was agricultural land intermixed
with other land used by the Forestry Commission. About one-eighth consisted of
disused airfields and other land formerly held by various Government Depart¬
ments; another fifth comprised an estate accepted by the Government in lieu of
death duties; and the remainder was mostly land acquired by the Minister to
ensure its full and efficient use for agriculture.
In Scotland, the management of lands vested in the Secretary of State and the
duty of advising him on management matters are carried out by the Department
of Agriculture.
Security of Tenure
Successful farming is a long-term business, and adequate security of tenure
helps the good farmer to plan ahead. The effect of the legislation passed after the
war was to give the farming tenant a considerable measure of security.
In England and Wales, the Agricultural Holdings Act, 1923, had required that
normally at least twelve months’ notice should be given to quit an agricultural
holding and gave the tenant a right to claim compensation for disturbance, but
not to contest the notice to quit. The Agricultural Holdings Act, 1948, gave the
tenant the right in most cases to contest a notice to quit, which could then be
enforced only with the consent of a County Agricultural Executive Committee
(acting for the Minister); there was a right of appeal by either party to an Agri¬
cultural Land Tribunal (an independent judicial body appointed by the Lord
Chancellor and composed of a chairman and two members representing landowners
and farmers respectively). The parallel Scottish Act applied similar provisions to
Scotland, with a right of appeal to the Scottish Land Court. The Agriculture Act,
INDUSTRY
263
1958, transferred the adjudicatory functions of the County Agricultural Executive
Committees to the Agricultural Land Tribunals and the Scottish Land Court, and
made amendments to the law on notice to quit, designed to make it less difficult
for the landlord to obtain possession of a holding from an indifferent tenant while
continuing to give security to the good farmer. At the same time the Act gave
tenants, in England and Wales, an important new right by enabling them in most
cases to apply to the Agricultural Land Tribunal for a direction to the landlord
to provide equipment necessary to enable the tenant to comply with statutory
requirements such as the safety, health and welfare regulations.
Rents are normally fixed by agreement between the landlord and tenant; where
agreement cannot be reached, the Minister has power, on the application of either
party, to appoint an arbitrator, who is required to fix a sum in accordance with the
rent at which the holding might reasonably be expected to be let by a willing
landlord in the open market to a willing tenant. The arbitrator must, however,
ignore any improvements or dilapidations caused by the tenant and any landlord s
improvements in so far as grants have been made from public funds.
IMPROVEMENT OF CROPS AND LIVESTOCK
Crops and Grass
Improved varieties, the use of new insecticides, fungicides and herbicides,
together with advances in methods of husbandry have led to a steady improvement
in the yield of cereals.
New varieties of crops and seeds are tested at the National Institute of Agri¬
cultural Botany, Cambridge, maintained by the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries
and Food.
Research at the Grassland Research Institute (Hurley, Berkshire) and elsewhere
has directly influenced agricultural practice in the production and use of grass.
Improved management of both permanent grass and temporary grass leys and the
more effective utilisation of grass by means of ensilage or drying, together with the
extended use of fodder crops, such as kale, help to economise in the use of purchased
feedingstuffs.
Cattle and Sheep
Britain is noted for its exports of pedigree livestock and since the end of the
second world war there has been a marked recovery of the export trade in livestock
of high quality.
It is mainly the beef breeds of cattle (particularly Shorthorns, Herefords and
Aberdeen Angus) which have made a reputation overseas, but interest in British
dairy stock (e.g., Guernsey, Jersey and Ayrshire) is increasing. At home, the rise
in milk consumption since 1940 resulted for a time in concentration on dairy breeds,
but many breeds have maintained the dual-purpose type of qualifications. In
Scotland, while milk production has expanded, an even greater increase in numbers
of beef cattle has taken place. In areas of small farms, grants are provided for
approved sires, and there are special schemes in the Highlands and Islands for the
loan or hire of bulls and rams to communities of smallholders. Cattle and sheep
rearing in the United Kingdom is encouraged by subsidies on calves to be reared
for beef and on hill cows and sheep.
In order to ensure sound breeding, bulls have to be licensed. Artificial Insemina¬
tion (AI) Centres, which are also licensed, cover the whole of England and Wales,
the majority are operated by the Milk Marketing Board (see p. 267), others by
local breeders’ associations and a few by the Ministry of Agriculture. One calf in
s
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
264
every two born in England and Wales is the result of AI. Licensed centres also
operate in Scotland. In Northern Ireland, AI is carried out at centres under the
control of the Northern Ireland Ministry of Agriculture.
Development of the Pig Industry
In September 1957, a Pig Industry Development Authority was set up in Great
Britain under the Agriculture Act, 1957, to promote improvements in the pro¬
duction, processing and distribution of pigs and of pigmeat. The Authority consists
of 17 members appointed by the Agricultural Ministers, of whom three (including
the chairman) are independent, and the remainder are appointed to represent
various interests in the industry. The Authority is empowered to promote schemes
to improve pig production, including the development of an artificial insemination
service for pigs; to sponsor research and development work, including market
intelligence; and to encourage the adoption of grading standards for pigs and pig
products. To finance its activities, which are expected to cost rather less than
£500,000 annually in the early years, the Authority has, with the approval of
Parliament, introduced a scheme imposing a levy on the industry. In Northern
Ireland, the Ministry of Agriculture (Northern Ireland) in consultation with the
Pig Advisory Committee—a statutory body—is responsible for functions similar to
those of the Authority in Great Britain.

To raise the standard of poultry stock there is a Poultry Stock Improvement Plan
in England and Wales under which breeding stations and hatcheries are accredited
and approved. There are three official poultry progeny testing stations in
England and Wales, and one in Scotland, which has its own accreditation scheme
for breeders and hatcheries. A similar scheme is operated in Northern Ireland.
Control of Animal Diseases
Under a plan introduced in October 1950 for the eradication of bovine tubercu¬
losis on an area basis, many areas have already been cleared. It is expected that by
the end of 1959 Scotland and Wales will be fully attested. The whole of Great
Britain should be an attested area by 1961, and Northern Ireland, which has had an
Attested Herds Scheme in operation since 1949, expects to achieve a similar
position soon afterwards.
The Diseases of Animals Act, 1950, gives the Government wide powers for the
control of diseases. This control may take the form of regulation of internal move¬
ments of stock, or of compulsory slaughter of animals and poultry affected by
certain notifiable diseases (e.g., foot-and-mouth disease and fowl pest). Compensa¬
tion is generally payable for stock slaughtered, although there are exceptions. The
Act, and Orders made under it, also restrict the import of certain types of livestock,
animal products, and veterinary therapeutic substances. Research into animal
diseases is carried on at several centres, including one at Pirbright, Surrey, which
has the world’s largest collection of foot-and-mouth disease virus.
MARKETING
During the second world war, marketing of nearly all farm crops was closely
controlled by the Government. Most of the controls over marketing have been
progressively removed and free markets now exist for most agricultural products.
Farmers continue the traditional practice of bringing crops and livestock to the
weekly market in the local market town, though an increasing amount of business
INDUSTRY
265
is also done by telephone and correspondence, or through co-operative marketing
societies. Such societies are an appreciable factor in the marketing of grain and
potatoes, horticultural produce, eggs, bacon and livestock. There are about 250
agricultural and horticultural co-operatives with a total annual turnover of more
than £120 million.
For certain commodities, however, statutory marketing arrangements have been
established, for example, through the setting-up of marketing boards, while for
all the main agricultural products (but not for horticultural produce) the Govern¬
ment operates a system of price guarantees (see pp. 266-8).
There are many statutory regulations designed to improve marketing methods,
to ensure that the producer of the best quality produce gets the best return for his
efforts, and to protect the consumer.
Control is exercised in some cases through statutory marketing boards and some¬
times by other arrangements.
Marketing Boards
Marketing boards set up under the Agricultural Marketing Acts, 1931 to 1949,
are producers’ organisations with compulsory powers to regulate the marketing of
particular agricultural products by producers. The schemes under which they are
constituted and operated must be approved by Parliament and confirmed by poll
of the producers concerned. A marketing board must normally consist of from eight
to twenty-four members; not fewer than two and not more than one-fifth of the
total number must be appointed by the Minister or Ministers concerned.
In general, the Government has declared that it will consider sympathetically
proposals for producer marketing boards, although each commodity is considered
separately on its merits. In appropriate cases the Government is also prepared to
allow the price guarantees to be operated through marketing boards.
The British Wool Marketing Board is responsible for the marketing of all fleece
wool (wool shorn from live sheep) produced in the United Kingdom, except
Shetland. Marketing powers were restored in 1954 to the Milk Marketing Boards
(see p. 267) set up under pre-war schemes, although as long as there remains an
element of consumer subsidy the Government will continue to control retail prices
and distributors’ profit margins for milk. A Potato Marketing Scheme for Great
Britain came into force in May 1955; it re-enacts and revises the pre-war scheme.
The Hops Marketing Board is responsible (in England only) for the marketing of
all hops, while the Tomato and Cucumber Marketing Board has only limited
regulatory powers. The pre-war Pigs and Bacon Marketing Schemes, which had
been suspended since the outbreak of the second world war, were revoked in
December 1957, after the Pig Industry Development Authority had been set up
(see p. 264).
The British Egg Marketing Scheme, which came into force in 1957, applies to
the whole United Kingdom and covers all producers with more than 50 head of
live poultry over the age of six months. Registered producers must sell their eggs
to the British Egg Marketing Board through packing stations where the eggs are
graded, tested and stamped, but producers who wish to sell eggs direct to consumers
or retailers are entitled to a licence authorising them to do so, subject to certain
limited conditions which the Board may impose. Only eggs sold to the Board
qualify for the price guarantee (see p. 267).
Under Northern Ireland legislation, schemes for the marketing of two products,
pigs and milk, are at present in operation.
Statutory Consumers’ Committees represent the consumers’ interest in regard to
the operation of marketing schemes, and Committees of Investigation consider
266
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
reports of the Consumers’ Committees and complaints from persons other than
consumers affected by the operation of marketing schemes.
Regulation of Milk Distribution
Milk distributors in Great Britain must be registered, and regulations lay down
conditions under which milk is produced, handled, treated, stored and distributed.
Subject to licence, milk may be sold under special designations—‘Pasteurised’,
‘Sterilised’, ‘Tuberculin Tested’ (TT) and also, in Scotland only, ‘Certified’.
In areas specified by Orders it is obligatory to retail only specially designated
milk, and milk which is not sold as Tuberculin Tested (or, in addition, as Certified
in Scotland) must be heat-treated. In Great Britain, 90 per cent of the population
now drink tuberculin tested, pasteurised or sterilised milk. The whole of Northern
Ireland is now a ‘safe milk’ area. Retail prices of milk and distributors’ profit-
margins are controlled by the Government throughout the United Kingdom.
Horticulture
In July 1958, the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food appointed an
interim Horticultural Marketing Advisory Council for England and Wales to
advise him on the work of his Department on horticultural marketing, to consider
plans for a permanent Horticultural Marketing Council representing all sections
of the horticultural industry, and to report annually.
The establishment of such a Council had been recommended in the report of
the Committee on Plorticultural Marketing (the Runciman Committee) published
in January 1957.
Fatstock
Although no statutory scheme has been adopted for fatstock marketing, a
Fatstock Marketing Corporation was set up in 1954 under the sponsorship of the
farmers’ unions, as an alternative to the auction system; the Corporation buys and
sells cattle, sheep, pigs and poultry. Besides its London organisation, it has ten
area organisations and more than 100 sales centres throughout Britain; its governing
body has about 36 members, over 30 of whom are farmers.
PRICE GUARANTEES
In accordance with the provisions of Part I of the Agriculture Act, 1947, the
Agricultural Ministers, in consultation with the farmers’ representatives, hold
annual reviews of the economic condition and prospects of the agricultural industry.
In the light of these reviews, guaranteed prices are determined for the major
agricultural products, and decisions are taken on any changes to be made in pro¬
duction grants. The Act also provides for a special review to be held at any time
if the Ministers concerned consider that it is warranted by a sudden change in the
economic conditions of the industry, such as a substantial alteration in production
costs. In addition, long-term assurances for agriculture were provided by the
Agriculture Act, 1957, following recognition by the Government at the 1956 Annual
Review that price guarantees based on annual reviews were too short-term to afford
an adequate basis for the forward planning necessary for efficiency.
Price guarantees in various forms are provided for the following farm produce:
cereals, fatstock, milk, eggs, potatoes, wool and sugar beet. (There are no price
guarantees for horticultural products, for which tariffs are the general form of
protection.) Annual reviews are held normally in February and March, and the
resulting guarantees apply to livestock and livestock products for the ensuing twelve
INDUSTRY
267
months and (since 1957) to crops to be harvested in the current year. The Govern¬
ment’s conclusions from each annual review and its decisions on changes in price
guarantees and production grants are published in a White Paper (the most recent
is Annual Review and Determination of Guarantees, 1958, Cmnd. 390).
The long-term assurances provided for in the 1957 Act require that the total
value of the price guarantees and relevant production grants in any year shall be
maintained at not less than 97-5 per cent of their value in the preceding year, after
allowing for changes that have occurred in the cost of review commodities since
the last annual review. In addition, the guaranteed price (adjusted for any change
in the basis of the guarantee) for each review commodity must be maintained at
not less than 96 per cent of that of the previous year, with a provision, in the case of
livestock and livestock products, that, in any period of three years, reductions in
the guaranteed price for a particular commodity will not total more than 9 per cent.
The general policy of the Government is to avoid direct intervention in the market
and therefore to use methods of agricultural support that leave the ordinary channels
of trade to operate freely. The form of price guarantee most generally used is the
deficiency payments system, under which the Government makes payments to
producers, equal to the difference between the average market price realised and
the guaranteed (or standard) price, in respect of output eligible for the guarantee.
The detailed arrangements vary from commodity to commodity, and in suitable
cases the Government uses producers’ marketing boards as the instruments for
giving effect to the guarantees.
Deficiency payments schemes, administered directly by Government Depart¬
ments, are in operation for cereals and fatstock. Under the cereals scheme, de¬
ficiency payments are made on the quantity of millable wheat or rye sold and
delivered by individual growers to authorised merchants; for wheat the guaranteed
average standard price varies seasonally. For barley and oats any deficiency between
the guaranteed price and the average market price is converted to a rate per acre
and payments are made according to individual growers’ acreages. Under the fat-
stock guarantee scheme, standard prices apply to fat cattle (steers and heifers), fat
sheep (including lambs) and fat pigs. Guarantee payments are made weekly on
individual certified sales of stock, and in the case of cattle and sheep the guaranteed
price varies according to a weekly scale.
The guarantee for milk is implemented through the five Milk Marketing Boards
in the United Kingdom (one for England and Wales, three for Scotland and one for
Northern Ireland). The Government pays each Board any deficit between its net
commercial returns and its entitlement under the guarantee, subject to a profit and
loss sharing arrangement designed to encourage efficient marketing. The retail price
of milk for liquid consumption is controlled by the Government, but for the
considerable surplus of milk which is sold for manufacturing purposes (e.g., for
butter, cheese and dried milk) the Miilk Marketing Boards are left free to secure the
best possible return. The price for milk guaranteed to each Board applies only to a
standard quantity, and sales in excess of the standard quantity reduce the average
return to producers.
For eggs, the guarantee is implemented by means of a flat rate subsidy payable
to the British Egg Marketing Board in respect of eggs sold to the Board through
packing stations. The rates of subsidy are calculated by subtracting from the
guaranteed price (determined after the Annual Review), the average price which
it is estimated that the Board will receive from its sales of fresh eggs in the ensuing
year. There is also a profit and loss sharing arrangement, under which the subsidy
rates are adjusted if the average prices realised by the Board vary by more than
2d. either side of the estimate.
268
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
The wool guarantee is operated through the Wool Marketing Board; a guaranteed
price to the Board for each pound of wool it handles enables it to fix producers’
prices in advance, after making an allowance for its marketing costs. Receipts in
excess of the guarantee are paid into a Price Stabilisation Fund and only a part of
the excess is retained by the Board.
The guarantee for potatoes is at present implemented through a support price
system, under which the Potato Marketing Board in Great Britain (acting for the
Government) and the Ministry of Agriculture for Northern Ireland stand ready to
buy at the appropriate guaranteed price any potatoes offered to them by producers.
Potatoes so bought are re-sold at a loss for processing or stock feed and, except
for a small proportion in Great Britain which falls on the Potato Marketing Board,
the loss is borne by the Government. For the 1959 potato crop, however, the
Government has decided to introduce a new guarantee system. If in any crop year
the actual return to the industry from the market for potatoes for human consump¬
tion falls below the guaranteed return, the deficiency will be made good from
Exchequer funds. In Great Britain the Government proposes that the amount due
should be paid to the Potato Marketing Board for the benefit of producers;
separate arrangements would be necessary in Northern Ireland where there is no
potato marketing board.
Sugar beet is the only commodity for which the Government continues to
guarantee a fixed price to the producer. The British Sugar Corporation buys beet
according to a scale of fixed prices related to the sugar content.
PRODUCTION GRANTS AND LOAN FACILITIES
In addition to providing financial stability by means of price guarantees to
farmers, the State promotes efficiency by various other subsidies and grants for
specific operations and farm requisites. The estimated total cost of subsidies and
grants for agriculture in 1957-58, including the subsidies and trading deficits
wholly attributable to guarantees under the Agriculture Act, 1957, is given in
Table 19.

Drainage and Water Schemes
The State makes substantial contributions towards the cost of land drainage
and water supply. In England and Wales, for example, under various Acts, grants
for farm drainage may be up to 50 per cent of the approved cost; for main river
drainage they can range up to 80 per cent. Farm water supply grants are at the
rate of 25 per cent of the approved cost where the connection is to a public main,
and 40 per cent where a private source is utilised. Separate legislation provides
grants for these services in Scotland and Northern Ireland.
Marginal Production Schemes
Under the Agriculture Act, 1947, and the Scottish Act of 1948, marginal pro¬
duction schemes provide financial assistance to farmers to cany out programmes of
land improvement and reclamation which they cannot reasonably meet out of farm
income, because, owing to poor soil or other factors beyond their control, they have
no margin of profit to invest.
Improvement of Livestock Rearing Land in Upland Areas
The Hill Farming and Livestock Rearing Acts provide for grants for owners and
occupiers of livestock rearing land in upland areas who wish to put their farms into
sound working order. The Acts also apply to some areas, e.g., Orkney and Caith¬
ness, which are not much above sea level. The object is to encourage the breeding

and rearing of store cattle and store sheep (i.e. cattle and sheep for further fattening,
not for immediate slaughter). Grants are at the rate of 50 per cent of the cost of
work done. The total amount available for grant in the United Kingdom is £25
million and this can be increased by £2 million if necessary.
Grants for Crofters
Special schemes of assistance for developing agricultural production on crofts
were announced in July 1956. These are the Crofters Agricultural Grants (Scotland)
Scheme, 1956, and the Crofters Livestock Purchase Loans (Scotland) Scheme,
1956, both of which are administered by the Crofters Commission. Under the first
scheme, grants ranging up to 85 per cent are available for a wide range of agri¬
cultural operations and improvement to land equipment. The second scheme
enables loans of from £100 to £500 at an initial interest of 6J per cent to be given,
for the purchase of livestock, to incoming tenants of crofts or to crofters who have
enlarged their crofts or their shares in sheep stocks held in common. Other schemes
operated by the Department of Agriculture for Scotland provide grants and loans
to crofters for erecting and improving houses and farm buildings, and loans to
incoming tenants to enable them to take over their crofts.
Farm Improvement Scheme
The Agriculture Act, 1957, provides for a farm improvement scheme, under
which, grants towards the cost of farm improvements and amalgamations of un¬
economic holdings are available for ten years up to a maximum of £50 million.
This period may be extended to twelve years and the amount to £55 million, if
Parliament approves. The rate of grant for improvements is 33^ per cent, and the
grants cover the provision or alteration of farm buildings and fixed equipment,
the construction of farm roads, the supply of electricity, and long-term improve¬
ments to agricultural land.
Fertilisers and Lime
Schemes under the Agriculture (Fertilisers) Act, 1952, provide grants to assist
farmers in the purchase of nitrogenous and phosphatic fertilisers. Farmers can also
obtain a refund of more than half their costs of liming land to improve soil fertility.
Crops and Grass
The aim of the Government is to see on each farm the most profitable balance
between crop and grass production, with, for the country as a whole, the main¬
tenance of a large arable acreage. Ploughing grants are available for land that has
been continuously under grass for three years, to encourage the maintenance of a
high tillage area and the regular ploughing up and extended use of leys.
Silo Grants
Grants amounting to about half the cost of approved projects, up to a maximum
of £250 a farm, are available under the Agriculture (Silo Subsidies) Act, 1956, for
constructing and improving silos.
Premiums for Cattle and Sheep Farmers
Premiums are paid to producers of tuberculin tested (TT) milk and in respect
of attested herds. Subsidies are given on calves to be reared for beef, and on hill
cows and hill sheep in breeding herds.
INDUSTRY
271
Loan Facilities
Short-term finance for farmers and landlords is usually provided by the
commercial banks and long-term finance by the raising of mortgages.
In England and Wales, long-term finance for agricultural properties is provided
by the Agricultural Mortgage Corporation Limited, a company established under
the provisions of the Agricultural Credits Acts, 1928 and 1932, principally for the
purpose of making loans up to 60 years on first mortgages of agricultural or farming
estates, properties or lands, to enable landowners or prospective landowners to
purchase or improve agricultural lands and buildings. The Corporation’s funds are
derived mainly from the proceeds of various issues of debenture stocks which are
subscribed by the public and are repaid by the operation of sinking funds. The
Corporation’s reserves include a guarantee fund for which it receives Exchequer
support under the Agricultural Credits Act, 1928, the Agriculture (Miscellaneous
Provisions) Act, 1944, and the Agricultural Mortgage Corporation Act, 1956, in
the form of interest-free loans up to a total of £3‘25 million. It also receives grants
to meet operating deficiencies under the Agriculture (Miscellaneous Provisions)
Act, 1944.
Landowners in England and Wales also obtain loans for the purpose of carrying
out improvements to agricultural land and buildings in accordance with the Im¬
provement of Lands Acts, 1864 and 1899. The amount of the loan is charged on
the land improved in the form of a terminable rent charge payable half-yearly for
a period not exceeding 40 years. This type of improvement loan requires the
sanction of the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food but the Ministry does
not itself provide the necessary funds. These loans are provided by the Agricultural
Mortgage Corporation and by the Lands Improvement Company, an older institution,
whose funds are provided privately either by way of general loans or against the
assignment of specific rent charges.
In Scotland, loans on favourable terms for agricultural purposes on the security
of agricultural land in Scotland are granted by the Scottish Agricultural Securities
Corporation Limited, which was set up in accordance with the provisions of the
Agricultural Credits (Scotland) Act, 1929. Both the Corporations at present receive
grants from the Treasury towards any deficit in their respective annual Profit and
Loss Accounts.
In Northern Ireland, loans are available to farmers for a wide range of purposes
from the Agricultural Loans Fund set up under the Development Loans Act
(Northern Ireland), 1945, and administered by the Northern Ireland Ministry of
Agriculture. The Fund is financed out of the Consolidated Fund, subject to a
statutory limit of £2 million. The bulk of the loans issued are for short-term periods
up to five years for such items as agricultural machinery, but in the case of buildings
the period may be extended to thirty years. No loans are advanced for land pur¬
chased. Any deficiency in the income on the Fund is financed by the Northern
Ireland Parliament.
AGRICULTURAL ADVISORY SERVICES
There are a number of agricultural advisory services which operate under
Government auspices.
The National Agricultural Advisory Service
Free technical advice on all agricultural and horticultural matters is available to
every farmer and grower in England and Wales through the Ministry of Agri¬
culture’s National Agricultural Advisory Service (NAAS).
272
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Every county has a County Agricultural Officer in charge of advisory work and
is divided into districts in each of which there is a District Officer who can call on
an extensive system of specialist advisers. Advisers in livestock husbandry, milk
production, farm machinery, poultry husbandry, and horticulture are available in
each county; at the 12 provincial centres and sub-centres there are senior advisers
in these subjects and also in crop and grassland husbandry, besides specialists in
animal nutrition, bacteriology, soil chemistry, plant diseases, and plant pests.
These centres are equipped with laboratories for the analysis of soils and feeding-
stuffs, and for the diagnosis of crop pests and diseases. The advisers work in close
consultation with the Ministry’s Plant Pathology Laboratory at Harpenden,
Hertfordshire.
In Scotland, the advisory services, similar in scope to the NAAS, are based on
the three agricultural colleges. Northern Ireland has its own separate advisory
service which is closely linked with the research and experimental divisions.
Facilities are provided at the NAAS Experimental Farms and Horticultural
Stations in England and Wales and at Agricultural College Centres in Scotland for
field-scale extensions of research work and investigations of local problems.
Experiments are also carried out at provincial advisory centres and on commercial
farms.
Agricultural Improvement Councils
The Agricultural Improvement Council (AIC) for England and Wales and the
Scottish Agricultural Improvement Council advise the Agricultural Departments on
the application of the results of scientific investigation to farming practice and on
problems requiring investigation. The AIC is also concerned with the problems of
estate management, including buildings and fixed equipment.
The Agricultural Land Service
The main functions of this service, which operates in England and Wales, are:
(1) to advise owners of agricultural land, whether landlords or owner-
occupiers, on estate management matters, including farm buildings and
other fixed equipment;
(2) to provide professional advice and services to the Minister, the Agricultural
Land Commission and County Agricultural Executive Committees on all
matters relating to agricultural land, including: the purchase and sale of
land by the Minister; the management of land owned by or in the posses¬
sion of the Minister; the exercise of the Minister’s powers for securing
good estate management and good husbandry and of his functions under
the Agricultural Holdings Act, 1948; the provision of grant-aid under the
Hill Farming and Livestock Rearing Acts and of marginal production
assistance; and the provision and management of smallholdings and allot¬
ments by local authorities; and
(3) to advise the Minister and local planning authorities on the agricultural
aspects of planning and the release of agricultural land for other develop¬
ment, including afforestation.
In Scotland, similar duties are carried out by officers of the Department of
Agriculture.
Veterinary Services
There is a comprehensive State Veterinary Service which, in Great Britain, is
administered by the Animal Health Division of the Ministry of Agriculture,
Fisheries and Food and the Department of Agriculture for Scotland, and in
INDUSTRY
273
Northern Ireland by the Northern Ireland Ministry of Agriculture. It consists of
a field staff, research workers, and an investigation service which acts as a link
between the field staff, veterinary surgeons in private practice and the research
laboratories. The investigation service in Scotland is linked with agricultural
teaching institutions and is not part of the Government service.
RESEARCH AND EDUCATION
Agricultural research in Britain is planned and co-ordinated by the Agricultural
Research Council and is largely financed by the State. (The composition and
functions of the Council are described on page 200.) The Council has 19 research
stations and units under its direct control and is responsible for the admini¬
stration of Government grants to 15 independent research institutions in England
and Wales; in Scotland, 8 independent research organisations receive grants through
the Department of Agriculture for Scotland. The Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries
and Food and the Department of Agriculture for Scotland also have their own
research laboratories (see p. 204). Grants are also made by the Agricultural Research
Council to a number of universities which have important research establishments
and to other recognised research institutions.
Many of the independent research organisations grant-aided by the Council have
achieved an international reputation for their contributions to agricultural progress.
The Rothamsted Experimental Station at Harpenden, Hertfordshire, founded in
1843, was the first such institute in the world and is still a leading authority for
research on soils, fertilisers and crop husbandry. Others of outstanding importance
include the Macaulay Institute for Soil Research, Aberdeen; the Rowett Research
Institute, Aberdeen, which specialises in problems of livestock breeding ; the
Research Institute at Pirbright, Surrey, for animal virus diseases; the East Mailing
Research Station, in Kent, and the Long Ashton Research Station, Bristol Univer¬
sity, for fruit research; the John Innes Horticultural Institution, Bayfordbury,
Hertfordshire; and the National Institute for Research in Dairying, Reading,
Berkshire.
Information on research is exchanged with other Commonwealth countries
through the machinery of the Commonwealth Agricultural Bureaux and Institutes
(ten Bureaux and two Institutes in the United Kingdom and one Institute in
Canada).
In England and Wales, research and advice are combined in the Provincial
Agricultural Economics Service, attached to the universities and organised in ten
economic advisory centres. In Scotland, agricultural economists are on the staff
of the three Agricultural Colleges, and the Department of Agriculture has a Farm
Economics Branch.
The Northern Ireland Ministry of Agriculture, which also has its Farm Econo¬
mics Branch, has, in addition, its own research divisions investigating problems of
animal and crop production. The research divisions work in close touch with the
Ministry’s county advisory staffs and with the Queen’s University of Belfast, and
also provide technical advisory services for the farmer. The Plant Disease Division
controls the disinfection of all flax seed sown in Northern Ireland, and the Dairy
Bacteriology Division maintains the hygienic standards laid down for the produc¬
tion and handling of milk. At Hillsborough, in County Down, the Northern Ireland
Agricultural Research Institute owns and operates a farm of some 500 acres. The
Institute is endowed from public funds, and the officers of the Ministry’s research
divisions are afforded facilities for carrying out their field experiments. The
Ministry of Agriculture maintains a Horticultural Centre at Loughgall, County
Armagh, at which problems of special interest to Northern Ireland are investigated.
274
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Industrial concerns manufacturing such products as weed-killers, insecticides and
fertilisers undertake research on a considerable scale and have been responsible
for developing new and improved products in their particular spheres. There are
also other non-governmental research establishments such as the Nuffield Founda¬
tion’s ‘working laboratory’ at Great Leigh Farm, Teign Valley, Devonshire.
There are three types of institutions which provide full-time training in agri¬
cultural subjects—Universities, Agricultural Colleges and, in England and Wales,
County Farm Institutes. Eight universities in England and Wales (Cambridge,
Durham, Leeds, London, Nottingham, Oxford, Reading, and the University of
Wales), and three in Scotland (Edinburgh, Glasgow, and Aberdeen) provide degree
courses in agriculture, which are of particular value for intending research workers,
advisory officers, teachers and other specialists. The University of Bristol offers
postgraduate diploma courses. In Northern Ireland, a degree course is provided
at Queen’s University, Belfast.
Two-year diploma courses are given at five Agricultural Colleges and at two of
the County Farm Institutes in England and Wales (see below); three Agricultural
Colleges in Scotland give two-year to three-year diploma courses. These are
intended mainly for farmers and farm managers, and are a preparation for the
national diplomas in agriculture, dairying, horticulture, poultry husbandry and
agricultural engineering. In Northern Ireland, there are three Agricultural Colleges.
There are 32 County Farm Institutes in England and 5 in Wales run by local
education authorities. They provide residential courses in general agriculture,
dairying, horticulture and poultry husbandry. These courses, which are usually for
one year of about 36 working weeks, are designed for those wishing to become
skilled workers in the industry. Local education authorities also provide a wide
range of short courses and classes for farmers, farmworkers, horticulturists and
domestic producers.
An important means of voluntary informal education in agriculture is provided
by Young Farmers' Clubs, which flourish in villages and towns throughout the
United Kingdom. There are over 1,800 clubs in Britain with well over 80,000
members, mostly under the age of 25. Each club is self-governing but has the
support of an advisory committee of farmers and other adults. Clubs are combined
in county federations and in National Federations for England and Wales (founded
in 1932), Scotland (in 1937), and Northern Ireland (in 1929).
Government assistance is given to develop rural crafts and industries. The
Development Commission, a non-departmental organisation consisting of eight Com¬
missioners appointed by the Crown, was set up under the Development and Road
Improvement Fund Acts of 1909 and 1910 to advise the Treasury on advances
from the Development Fund. The purposes of this Fund are now confined to the
development of rural industries and amenities, the construction and improvement
of fishery harbours and the development and improvement of fisheries. The main
agencies helping the Commissioners to carry out this work in regard to rural
industries are, in England and Wales, the voluntary Rural Community Councils
with their Rural Industries Committees, the Government-financed Rural Industries
Bureau founded in 1921, and Rural Industries Loan Fund Ltd., started in 1940. On
the recommendation of the Rural Community Councils, the Rural Industries
Bureau provides technical advice and instruction to assist craftsmen, who may be
granted loans from the Loan Fund to help them to increase their efficiency. In
Scotland, the body corresponding to the Rural Industries Bureau is the Scottish
Country Industries Development Trust, founded in 1935, which, in the absence of
Rural Community Councils in Scotland, exercises more direct control over rural
development.

Since the Government of Ireland Act, 1920, schemes in Northern Ireland are
no longer eligible for grants from the Development Fund.
A Museum of English Rural Life was established by the University of Reading in
1951 as a national centre for the study of material connected with the history of the
countryside. It was opened to the public in April 1955-
A large number of Agricultural Shows held annually throughout Britain focus
attention on modern farming methods and equipment. The chief ones are the Royal
Show, held since 1839 by the Royal Agricultural Society of England; the Bath and
West Show, held since 1780 by the Bath and West and Southern Counties Agri¬
cultural Society; the Royal Highland Show, held since 1822 by the Royal Highland
and Agricultural Society of Scotland; the Royal Ulster Show, held by the Royal
Ulster Agricultural Society; and the Royal Welsh Show, held by the Royal Welsh
Agricultural Society. The Smithfield Show, held annually in London, which was
originally concerned only with livestock, has now become, in addition, the largest
agricultural machinery exhibition in Britain.
FISHERIES
Britain’s sea fishing industry falls into two main divisions, concerned respectively
with white fish and herring. White fish, such as cod, haddock, plaice, turbot and
sole are demersal fish which live on or near the sea-bed. Herring and similar species,
such as pilchard, mackerel and sprats, are pelagic fish which live in intermediate
waters or near the surface.
The white fish section of the industry is made up of three distinct groups: the
distant water, the near and middle water, and the inshore fisheries. The distant
waters are those off Iceland, Greenland and the north coast of Norway, and the
Barents Sea; the middle water grounds lie around the Faroe Islands; and the
near water grounds are those in the North Sea, the Irish Sea and in the coastal
areas around Britain. The herring fishing grounds are mainly within 60 miles of
land. The inshore waters also yield considerable quantities of shell fish.
Fishing Ports
The principal fishing ports in England and Wales are Hull, Grimsby, Fleetwood,
Milford Haven and Lowestoft for white fish, and Great Yarmouth and Lowestoft
for herring; in Scotland, the chief centres for white fish are Aberdeen, Leith, the
Moray Firth ports, Shetland, the west coast and the Clyde, and for herring they
are Fraserburgh, Peterhead, Aberdeen, Inverness, and Stornoway, as well as
Shetland, the west coast and the Clyde; those in Northern Ireland are Ardglass,
Portavogie and Kilkeel.
Methods of Sea Fishing
The chief methods of catching fish are by trawling, seining, lining, and drift and
ring netting. In trawling, a funnel-shaped net of heavy twine is towed along the
sea bed. In deep sea seining, a funnel-shaped net with long wings and made of
relatively light material is slowly hauled towards the vessel, driving the fish into
the path of the net. Deep sea lining can be carried out on grounds too rough for
trawling, as well as on smooth grounds. A limited number of Scottish vessels are
engaged in this fishery. Lining also provides employment, in autumn, winter and
early spring, for a large number of inshore fishermen fishing for cod, whiting and
haddock; long lines are made up with baited hooks at regular intervals and are laid
over a considerable area. Ring netting, mainly used by Scottish fishermen, is an
efficient method of encircling shoals of pelagic fish, such as pilchard or herring.
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
2.76
In drift net fishing, a number of finely meshed nets, attached to each other, form
a vertical curtain of netting so that fish swimming against them are caught by the
gills. The vessel drifts with the wind and tide for several hours, usually from dusk
to dawn, before hauling.
Trawling is carried out in the distant, near and middle waters for all species of
demersal fish throughout the year. Seining is also dependent upon demersal fish
and is operated all the year round. An increasing number of English, Scottish and
Northern Irish vessels depend on seining for a living, the main areas of operation
being in the North Sea and the Irish Sea. There are about 800 Scottish and
Northern Irish seiners, and about 200 operate from English ports.
The pelagic fisheries are seasonal. There is a summer fishery for herring based
on the Shetlands, the east coast ports of Scotland, and the north-east coast ports of
England, and an autumn fishery off East Anglia based on Lowestoft and Yarmouth.
Other seasonal fisheries take place off the west coast of Scotland and off Southern
Ireland. The inshore fisheries comprise a great diversity of types of vessels and
methods of capture; trawling, seining, lining, and drift net fishing are employed;
in addition, there are extensive fisheries for crabs, lobsters, prawns, cockles and
oysters, and, off Scotland and Northern Ireland, there is a fishery for ‘Norway
lobsters’ (nephrops).
The Fishing Fleet
Distant water vessels, which operate mainly from Hull, Grimsby and Fleetwood,
numbered 247 at the end of 1957. They are over 140 feet and up to 185 feet in
length and make voyages of 17 to 23 days to fishing grounds in the Arctic Circle.
At the same date, near water vessels numbered 547; they are under 130 feet long
and work near home, making voyages of 8 to 10 days. Middle water vessels num¬
bered 55; they are 130 to 140 feet in length and undertake voyages of about two
weeks. Included in the near water group are vessels engaged in drift net fishing,
which usually make daily voyages. The inshore group consists mainly of vessels of
under 70 feet which are seldom at sea for longer than two days and more usually
make daily landings, often fishing within sight of land.
In the United Kingdom fishing industry in 1957 there were 24,418 fishermen in
regular employment and 3,385 occasionally employed; 10,472 of the former and
1,151 of the latter were from Scottish ports. In Northern Ireland there were 420
regular fishermen.
Supplies
In the year ended 31st December, 1957, landings of fish, both demersal and
pelagic, in the United Kingdom by British fishing vessels totalled 873,000 tons
(741,000 tons of demersal fish and 132,000 tons of pelagic), valued at about £47*6
million. Landings at British ports by foreign vessels totalled about 105,000 tons of
fresh and frozen fish (including 52,000 tons brought direct from the fishing grounds)
to a value of about £9 million. British landings of shellfish yielded million.
Cod accounted for 40 per cent of the total value of wet fish (i.e. fish other than
shellfish) landed by British vessels; haddock (19 per cent) and plaice (9 per cent)
were the other most important sources of earnings to the industry.
Net imports of all types of fish (fresh, frozen, salted or canned) into the United
Kingdom in 1957 amounted to about 173,000 tons valued at over £33 million,
including 20,000 tons of canned salmon to the value of £11 million and other
canned fish worth £9 million.
Weekly consumption of fresh, frozen and cured fish (excluding shellfish and
imported canned fish) in the United Kingdom averaged 16,500 tons landed weight
INDUSTRY
277
in 1957. On an edible (fillet) weight basis, United Kingdom consumption has been
estimated provisionally at 18-7 pounds per head in 1957, compared with 28-7
pounds in 1948 and an annual average of 21-8 pounds from 1934-38.
Northern Ireland consumes about one-third of the catch landed there by British
vessels (7,139 tons in 1957) and exports the rest to Great Britain and to the Republic
of Ireland.
Sea Fish Processing
Processing and packaging of fish—curing, kippering, canning and quick-freezing
for consumer packs—are the subject of continuing research and development. For
example, the production of quick-frozen fish more than doubled between 1953
and 1955. With the increase in quick-freezing, new export outlets have opened up
for white fish and fish products; these accounted for about £2-6 million of the total
British exports of fish, valued at £5-5 million in 1957. Markets abroad for quick-
frozen fish, mainly in Europe and the Commonwealth, and for salted cod, mainly
in Latin America and the West Indies, have continued to expand, but exports
of herrings, for which Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union have been large
customers, have declined.
By-products
A valuable by-product of the industry is the manufacture of fish meal for animal
food and to a much lesser degree for fertilisers. Home production of white fish meal
in 1957 fell from 79,300 tons to 76,700 tons; a large percentage of the fish meal is
obtained from offal and most of the remainder from unsold catches. Imports of
fish meal of all kinds in 1957 totalled 109,326 tons. The preparation of vitamin oils
from fish livers is also a source of additional earnings. The extraction of the oil
takes place at sea as soon as the fish are caught.
Freshwater Fisheries
The main commercial freshwater catches are salmon, sea-trout and eels. In
Scotland and Northern Ireland, fixed nets along the coast and sweep or draught
nets in rivers and estuaries are used; in England, drift nets are used for catching
salmon in the sea, and draught nets and fixed traps in estuaries. In England and
Wales, the value of the salmon catch is approximately £250,000 a year, in Scotland
it amounts to about £1 million, and in Northern Ireland to some £200,000. In
Northern Ireland, eels worth £80,000 a year are captured by long lines and by eel
nets placed in river weirs.
Fishing for sport by rod and line in rivers, lakes, streams and canals is wide¬
spread. Salmon, grilse and sea-trout are the most important catches, and the fishing
rights command high rentals. There are also extensive fishings for brown trout.
Other freshwater fish taken, particularly in England, include roach, rudd, perch and
dace. Fishing for freshwater fish other than salmon and trout is of minor importance;
figures of catches are not available.
Distribution System
The principal inland wholesale distributing centre for fish is Billingsgate Market
in London, which handles about 400 tons a day, but other large cities also have
central fish markets. The principal method of distribution is through wholesalers,
located at the ports, who buy at the auctions and sell to inland wholesalers; the port
wholesalers prepare the fish for onward shipment. Some sixty special express fish
trains transport the catch daily from the ports to inland centres, but increasing use
is being made of road transport. Retail sales are handled by 17,000 fishmongers and
nearly 18,000 fish friers; the latter use more than a third of the landings of white fish.

Promotion and Regulation of the Industry-
Laws in Britain relating to fisheries and fish are principally directed to the follow¬
ing purposes: (1) protection of supply by measures against over-fishing, e.g., the
Sea Fisheries Regulation Act, 1888, the Sea-Fishing Industry Act, 1933, and the
Sea Fish Industry Act, 1938; (2) promotion of the prosperity of the industry, e.g.,
the Herring Industry Acts, 1935 to 1957, the White Fish Industry Acts, 1951 to
1957, and the Fisheries Act, 1955; (3) protection of the quality of the product, e.g.,
the Food and Drugs Act, 1955. The Government Departments mainly responsible
for the administration of laws in the first two categories and for the development of
every branch of the fishing industry are the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and
Food, the Scottish Home Department, and the Ministry of Commerce for Northern
Ireland; the Ministry of Health and the Department of Health for Scotland are
concerned with questions of nutrition and hygiene affecting fish and fish products.
The safety and welfare of crews of fishing vessels are provided for under the
Merchant Shipping Acts, which are administered by the Ministry of Transport and
Civil Aviation.
The authorities concerned with fisheries research are the Ministry of Agriculture,
Fisheries and Food, the Scottish Home Department, the White Fish Authority, the
Herring Industry Board, and the Development Commissioners; and, on food
investigation, the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research.
A Committee of Inquiry into the Fishing Industry was appointed in November,
I957> t° assess, in relation to developments in fishing and the marketing of fish, the
size and pattern of an economic fishing industry in the United Kingdom.
The Herring Industry Board
The Herring Industry Board was set up under the Herring Industry Act of 1935
to reorganise, develop and regulate the herring industry; subsequent amending
Acts have also been passed. The Board consists of a chairman and two other mem¬
bers, all part-time and independent of the industry, who are appointed jointly by
the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, the Secretary of State for Scotland
and the Home Secretary. The Board, whose activities are financed partly by
Government grants and loans and partly by levies and licence fees, is advised by the
Herring Industry Advisory Council, consisting of representatives of the catching and
shore sections of the industry. The functions of the Board include the promotion of
sales of herring, both at home and abroad, and the provision of grants and loans for
the purchasing of new boats, nets and gear, and the reconditioning of existing boats.
The Board is particularly active in developing new and wider markets for herring,
and applying the benefits of technical progress to the industry, including the
adoption of new fishing methods, and the construction of new processing plants for
quick-freezing and kippering. The Board buys all herring not sold for other
purposes for reduction to oil and meal, and, with the aid of Government grants, has
built a number of processing factories for this purpose.
A Government subsidy has been paid to herring fishermen since May 1957; in
the year ended 31st March, 1958, £325,000 was made available.
The White Fish Authority
The White Fish Authority was set up under the Sea Fish Industry Act, 1951, to
reorganise, develop and regulate the white fish industry. It is composed of five
independent members, appointed jointly by the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries
and Food, the Secretary of State for Scotland and the Home Secretary, and works
in consultation with the industry and consumers through the White Fish Industry
Advisory Council. The authority’s activities are financed partly by Government
INDUSTRY
2?9
grants and loans and partly by a levy on first-hand sales and by registration fees.
The Authority has powers similar to those of the Herring Board; it makes loans and
grants for the purchase of new vessels and engines and for the conversion of coal-
fired vessels to oil-firing, and makes loans for the reconditioning of old vessels to
further the modernisation of the fishing fleet. Up to 31st March, 1958, nearly
£13 million in loans and nearly £5-2 million in grants were approved for this
purpose by the Authority.
Since 1950, a subsidy from public funds has been paid to near and middle water
vessels and to inshore vessels engaged in the white fish industry in the United
Kingdom. In 1957-58, £2-71 million was made available; a large proportion of
this sum was used to assist steam vessels.
Whaling
Whaling is mainly conducted by expeditions, each consisting of a large floating
factory ship accompanied by its attendant whale catchers and tankers, which
operate mainly in the Antarctic Ocean. It is regulated by the International Whaling
Commission, set up under the International Whaling Convention of 1946, which
controls the dates of the season and sets a limit on the Antarctic catch of whales.
The offices of the Commission are in London.
The United Kingdom ranks third (after Norway and Japan) in the extent to which
it engages in whaling, sending three expeditions to the Antarctic each year.
In addition, whaling is also undertaken from land stations on South Georgia, a
British island in the South Atlantic. The volume of the whale oil (the most impor¬
tant product) obtained by the British expeditions in the 1956-57 season amounted
to about 420,000 barrels. The value of the products of British whaling expeditions
landed in the United Kingdom totalled £6-6 million in 1956 and £7-2 million in
1957-
FORESTRY
The total woodland area of Great Britain is nearly 4 million acres, or between
6 and 7 per cent of the total land area. Timber and its products are of great impor¬
tance to the economy of the country, and large quantities of industrial timber (i.e.
wood other than that used for domestic fuel) are needed to meet all demands; but,
except for the period of the second world war when, of necessity, much over-felling
took place, the home timber industry has not been in a position to make more than
a small contribution to the nation’s timber requirements. At present, Great Britain
imports about 85 per cent of her needs of timber and wood products. The Govern¬
ment is, however, devoting continuous effort through the Forestry Commission to
the long-term task of increasing the country’s timber resources.
Forest Areas
The last census of woodlands (1947—49) shows that 54 per cent of the total wood¬
land area of Great Britain lies in England, 37 per cent in Scotland, and 9 per cent
in Wales. The greatest density of woodland in Great Britain is in the north and
east of Scotland—for example, Moray has 21'6 per cent of its land area under
woodland and Nairn has 19-1 per cent. Another region of high density lies in the
south-east of England—Sussex, Surrey, Hampshire, Kent and Berkshire. Mon¬
mouthshire, on the Welsh border, has io-7 per cent of its land area under woodland.
The classification of forest area showing type and ownership in 1955 is given in
Table 20.

(a) Forest owned by private individuals and bodies; in this classification a small area of
communal forest is included, i.e. forest owned by public bodies such as local authorities
and water supply undertakings.
Woodlands include areas of high forest (consisting of coniferous and broad¬
leaved trees), coppice, scrub, and devastated and felled areas. Of the broadleaved
species, the most common tree is the oak, with beech, ash, birch, sycamore and
elm following in that order. Of the coniferous species, Scots pine is the most
common, but Norway and Sitka spruces are plentiful.
Volume of Timber
At the end of 1955, the volume of standing timber, excluding hedgerow timber
and woods of not more than one acre, was estimated to be 3,460 million cubic feet.
This included 1,530 million cubic feet of softwood and 1,930 million cubic feet of
hardwood. The net annual increment (the year’s growth minus losses due to fire,
decay, or similar causes) was 118 million cubic feet. The climate and soil of Great
Britain are favourable to the growth of timber; the annual rate of growth which
can be obtained in Great Britain under systematic management compares most
favourably with that achieved in other European countries.
Forest Policy
From the early Middle Ages there was a continuous process of deforestation in
Great Britain. Woodlands were cleared for agriculture, and timber was used for a
variety of domestic and industrial purposes, for instance, as charcoal in iron¬
smelting, for fuel, housebuilding, domestic and agricultural equipment, and ship¬
building. Occasionally, from the sixteenth century onwards, Governments have
encouraged the planting of high forest as an insurance against the blockade of war,
but in times of normal trading it was the practice to buy timber from abroad.
Following the Industrial Revolution, cheap and easily workable timber began to be
required in ever-increasing amounts for a variety of new industrial uses. Home
woodlands contained neither the types nor the quantities of timber to meet this
demand and the importation of timber, principally of softwoods (timber derived
from coniferous tree species), expanded greatly. By 1914 the trade in imported
INDUSTRY
28l
timber had grown, and the contribution from home woodlands had shrunk, to a point
where no more than 7 per cent of the country’s total requirements were being met
from home sources. The sudden demands of the first world war, however, brought
about a realisation of the need for a national forest policy. The Forestry Commis¬
sion (see below) was established under the Forestry Act, 1919, to give effect to such
a policy, but, although some progress was made, the devastation of the country’s
woodlands caused by extensive felling during the second world war showed clearly
that larger scale measures were needed.
In 1943, the Forestry Commissioners recommended, in their Report on Post-
War Forest Policy, that the nation should aim at having at least 5 million acres of
productive forest, of which 2 million acres would be secured from the rehabilitation
of existing woodlands and 3 million acres obtained by the afforestation of bare land.
The Government accepted this as a programme to be achieved by the end of the
century, by the State and private owners of woodlands working together; although
the afforestation of bare land would fall mainly on the State. While it provided for
the conservation of existing stocks of standing timber through statutory controls on
felling, the programme also called for a marketing policy that would maintain a
healthy and efficient home timber trade. The acreage of woodland proposed would,
it was estimated, produce ultimately a volume of timber equivalent to about one-
third of the country’s needs. On this basis, forestry would become a major industry
which, in addition to its economic value, would help to arrest the depopulation of
rural areas.
Future developments are likely to include the encouragement of still greater
integration of forestry and agriculture in the marginal hill areas. A recommendation
to this effect, made in the Report on Forestry, Agriculture and Marginal Land, by
the Natural Resources (Technical) Committee, published in March 1957, has been
accepted by the Government. As an example of such integration, the Committee
cites among others the ‘Strathoykell’ scheme which is proceeding in adjoining
sheep farming areas in Ross-shire and Sutherlandshire in Scotland. In this area
over 4,000 acres have been planted by the Forestry Commission, houses have been
built, grant-aided farm improvements to a value of over £,35>000 have been made,
and stocks of sheep and cattle have been increased.
The Forestry Commission
The Forestry Commission was established as a national forest authority; it has
the general duty of promoting the interests of forestry, the development of afforesta¬
tion and the production and supply of timber in the United Kingdom. The Com¬
mission consists of a chairman and not more than nine commissioners who are
appointed by the Crown; they are required, in exercising their functions, to comply
with such directions as may be given to them by the Minister of Agriculture,
Fisheries and Food and the Secretary of State for Scotland. The Forestry Act, 1951,
placed responsibility for the maintenance of an adequate reserve of growing trees in
Great Britain on the Forestry Commissioners and gave them powers to regulate the
felling of trees by the issue of licences. Besides conducting its own forest operations,
the Commission represents the interests of British forestry at inter-governmental
meetings, gives encouragement to private forestry and performs a wide range of
general forestry duties such as research and education and the publication of
technical and other literature on forestry. In the administration of its duties in
relation to private forestry there is continual contact between the Commission s
staff and private land-owners, and the staff gives advice, free of charge, on silvi¬
cultural and management problems; substantial grants for planting and other
forestry activities are paid to woodland owners (see overleaf). The Commission has
2g2 BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
also played an important part in encouraging the establishment of several new
timber-using industries. _ .
During the years 1919-571 the Forestry Commission acquired land through the
Forestry Fund (see below), under the Forestry (Transfer of Woods) Act, 1923, and
by gifts which, after taking account of disposals, totalled 2,253,800 acres. This total
comprises 1,443,500 acres classified as ‘forest land’, of which 1 million acres had
been planted by 1956 and the rest would be planted in due course, and 810,300
acres of ‘other land’ which includes forest nurseries, rough grazing, agricultural
land and land unsuitable for planting, such as the tops of mountains. The total
number of Commission forests in Great Britain at 3°th September, i957> was aJS)
of which 221 were in England, 206 in Scotland and 86 in Wales. The peak year for
planting was 1954, when the area planted was 70,400 acres. The area planted
decreased to 67,900 acres in 1955, in 1956 to 62,400 acres, and in 1957 to 57,900
acres, owing to the continuing difficulty of acquiring sufficient plantable land.
In July 1958, the Government announced its conclusion, reached after a review
of forestry policy, that the planting programmes of the Forestry Commission should
be fixed for periods of ten years at a time. For the five-year period 1959 to 1963 the
programme would be about 300»00° acres. For the period 1964 to 1968 the planting
programme would be reduced to about 23 5 >000 acres, when the Forestry
Commission’s existing plantations would begin to come into full production. The
size of the subsequent programme is to be reviewed in 1963. In deciding where
planting shall take place, special attention is to be paid to the upland areas, particu¬
larly in Scotland and Wales, where expansion of forestry would provide, among
other benefits, new opportunities for employment.
All the Commission’s forests are covered by management plans, which provide
for such work as planting, road construction, thinning and fire protection. Besides
forest officers, the Commission employs two groups of specialist officers, estate
officers and engineers. During the years i95°~57> the engineers constructed 2,423
miles of new roads, and the estate officers were responsible for the building of
1,694 new houses.
Finance
The Forestry Fund was established by the Forestry Act, i9:9 > from it is paid
all the expenditure of the Forestry Commissioners and into it are paid their receipts
from sales of produce, rentals and other sources, together with the amounts voted
annually by Parliament. From 1920 to 1957, parliamentary grants totalled
£88,620,800 and receipts from other sources £29,073,440. Expenditure during
these years totalled £117,275,037- Actual expenditure during the year ended 30th
September, 1957, totalled £10,223,000, of which £821,000 represented various
grants to private forestry.
Private Forestry
Privately owned woods in 1955 comprised 71 Per cent of the total forest area in
Great Britain (as shown in Table 20), and contain most of the mature and semi-
mature timber. The size of woodlands in individual ownership ranges from a few
acres to several thousand acres, and a high proportion of the privately owned
woodland area belongs to small owners (i.e. owners of woods of up to about
250 acres). .
Impetus has been given to the effective management of private woodlands by
the introduction, under the Forestry Act, 1947, °f the Dedication of Woodlands
Scheme. Under this scheme, owners are invited to put their land permanently to
1 To the end of the Forest Year 1957 (30th September).
INDUSTRY

timber production and to manage their woods in accordance with a plan agreed
with the Forestry Commission, in return for the provision of financial and technical
assistance. By September 1957, the total area dedicated was 485,436 acres. It was
announced in July 1958 that a graduated scale of grant per acre would be substituted
for the former flat rate, increasing considerably the value of the grants to owners;
in particular, to those owning smaller woodlands. In addition, there are the
woodlands covered by the Approved Woodlands Scheme in which a planting grant,
but no management grant, is made; and these bring the total area managed under
an agreed plan to over 625,000 acres. This does not take into account other estates
that are already working to a plan but have not been put forward for inclusion in
either scheme.
The Forestry Commissioners have been much in favour of the development of
co-operative forestry schemes and have made loans available. The co-operative
societies provide for landowners and farmers the services of skilled staff, centralised
purchasing facilities, and a central agency for the disposal of forest produce. The
whole of Scotland, much of Wales and several districts in England, are now served
by such societies. The Commission also co-operates with the principal forestry
societies, such as the Royal Forestry Society of England and Wales and the Royal
Scottish Forestry Society, in spreading technical knowledge; many of its technical
staff are members of such societies. In i948> the United Kingdom Forestry Com¬
mittee was formed, bringing together representatives of the Country Landowners’
Association, the Scottish Landowners’ Federation and the two Royal Forestry
Societies, with additional members possessing experience of land agency, forest
economics and timber trade. This committee has been accepted in forestry negotia¬
tions as the body which represents the collective interests of owners of private
woodlands.
The total area estimated to have been planted annually by private owners has
risen from 9,000 acres in 1947 to 31,600 acres in 1957; this compares with a pre¬
war average of 6,000 to 7,000 acres. The problems restricting planting by private
owners are shortages of labour, skilled staff and finance.
Consultative Machinery
The Forestry Act, 1945, established for each country (England, Scotland and
Wales) a National Committee, composed partly of Forestry Commissioners and
partly of persons outside the Commission. These Committees, working directly
under the authority of the Commissioners, supervise certain aspects of the Com¬
mission’s work, including particularly the acquisition and management of land and
the promotion of private forestry; in the latter task they are required to maintain
direct contact with the Regional Advisory Committees which have been set up in
each of the Commission’s Conservancies with the purpose of providing a link with
all those in the Conservancy who are interested in forestry. On all proposals for
acquisition of land, the Commission consults the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries
and Food and the Department of Agriculture for Scotland. Other consultative
bodies have been set up to provide for consultation on the marketing of home grown
timber.
Marketing of Home Grown Timber
The Home Grown Timber Advisory Committee, set up by the Forestry Com¬
missioners in 1939, consists of representatives of the Commission, the Board of
Trade and associations of landowners and timber merchants; it meets quarterly to
discuss various matters affecting the marketing of home grown timber. In 1949,
the Commissioners set up the Advisory Committee on Utilisation of Home Grown
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
284
Timber to advise landowners and to undertake research into problems connected
with the marketing of timber from the Commission’s own forests. Among the
members of this Committee are representatives of the Forest Products Research
Laboratory (see below), the Rural Industries Bureau (see p. 274) and the Timber
Development Association.
In May 1954, the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries and the Secretary of
State for Scotland appointed a Committee on Marketing of Woodland Produce to
consider what measures might be taken in order to improve the arrangements for
marketing produce from privately owned woodlands. The Committee’s two main
recommendations, contained in its Report published in December 1956, were the
establishment of a central consultative body representing all the main interests in
the timber industry and of an effective association of private woodlands owners.
The Government has accepted this last recommendation, and has made the increase
of grants to private owners contingent on the formation of such an association.
Forestry Education and Research
The Commission maintains four Forester Training Schools: in England, at
Parkend in the Forest of Dean, Gloucestershire; in Wales, near Bettws-y-Coed in
Caernarvonshire; and in Scotland at Benmore, Argyllshire, and Faskally, near
Pitlochry in Perthshire. Northerwood House in the New Forest, Hampshire, is the
Commission’s educational centre, and is used for practical courses for university
students, landowners and agents, planning officers, school teachers and others
connected with, or interested in, forestry.
Higher education in forestry is provided at several universities; a proportion of
suitable graduates are recruited by the Commission as forest officers.
The Commission’s Forest Research Station at Alice Holt Lodge, near Farnham,
Surrey, was opened in 1946. Expenditure on research work at this station and in
experimental areas in many forests in Great Britain amounted to £300,000 in 1957.
The Commission takes an active part in the work of the International Union of
Forest Research Organisations, whose twelfth congress was held at Oxford in July
1956. The Commission makes grants for special forestry research work to various
institutions and to university departments, including the Imperial Forestry Institute
at Oxford, which is also financed by the University, the Colonial Office, and Colonial
Governments. Research into the qualities of home grown timber is carried out by
the Forest Products Research Laboratory at Princes Risborough, which is one of
the establishments of the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research, and
by other grant-aided research associations.
Forestry in Northern Ireland
When the Government of Northern Ireland was fonned in 1922, the new
Ministry of Agriculture became the forest authority working with similar powers
and duties to those conferred on the Forestry Commission by the Forestry Act,
1919. At that time the Ministry took over some 4,000 acres for afforestation of
which 700 acres had been planted by the Forestry Commission.
State forest policy is implemented under the Forestry Act (Northern Ireland),
I953) which has replaced earlier legislation. This Act provides the Ministry with
powers to acquire and manage land, and to provide financial and technical assistance
for private planting, and it introduces measures for the protection of all woodlands,
whether owned by the State or privately owned, against destruction by over-cutting,
fire or depredation by animals.
The State forest area has grown steadily and at a greatly accelerated pace since
the end of the second world war. By 31st March, 1958, some 92,000 acres had been
INDUSTRY
285
acquired, of which over 46,000 acres had been planted. The present afforestation
programme provides for the creation as soon as possible of an area of 150,000 acres
of productive State forest with a sustained yield roughly equal to the present yearly
consumption of timber in Northern Ireland, i.e. some 30,000 standards (one
standard is 165 true cubic feet of sawn timber). To reach this objective, a minimum
annual planting rate of 3,500 acres, increasing to 4,000 acres within the next two
years, has been set.
Financial provision is made by sums voted annually by Parliament and receipts
from forest produce, rentals and other sources. From 1922 to 31st March, 1958,
expenditure totalled £5,165,000, and receipts, other than parliamentary grants, were
£1,691,000. Output and employment are growing steadily. The area of exploitable
private woodlands is at present some 20,000 acres, and private planting, which is
gaining impetus, is assisted by schemes for the supply, at a low cost, of young trees
from the Ministry’s nurseries, by grants towards the cost of the establishment of
new plantations, and by free technical advice.
FUEL AND POWER
The main primary sources of energy in Britain are coal, petroleum and, to a
small extent, water power ; secondary sources, produced from these, are electricity
and coal gas.
Britain’s annual energy requirements are expected to rise from 250 million
to 300 million tons coal equivalent by 1965. Coal, mined within the country, supplies
some 85 per cent of this energy and it will remain the principal source for many years
to come. But it is unlikely that production of coal can be increased sufficiently, even
by the very large investments planned, to satisfy the additional needs. For supplies
of crude petroleum Britain is almost entirely dependent on imports; water power
resources are small. A large-scale programme for the construction of nuclear
power stations has, therefore, been inaugurated, and by 1966-67 nuclear energy,
it is estimated, may account for about 6 per cent of total energy requirements and
some 22 per cent of electricity consumption. The fuel and power industries, with
the exception of the petroleum industry, are under public ownership.
The Government’s fuel and power policy has two principal objectives. The first
is to ensure that power supplies are adequate to meet the rapidly growing demands
of industry and of the domestic consumer in a country with an expanding national
income. The second is to make the maximum possible use of indigenous resources
and so lighten the load on the balance of payments.
The Government also aims to reduce air pollution. The Clean Air Act, 1956,
which came fully into force on 1st June, 1958, makes it an offence to emit dark
smoke or to fail to provide industrial premises with equipment to arrest grit
and dirt, and empowers local authorities, subject to the approval of the Minister
of Housing and Local Government, to declare ‘smoke control areas’, in which the
emission of smoke from chimneys will constitute an offence; provision is made for
the payment of grants by local authorities and the Exchequer towards the costs
incurred by owners and occupiers of premises in these areas in making necessary
changes to appliances. A Clean Air Council, to review progress and to advise the
Minister, was set up in May 1957-
COAL
Coal has been worked in Britain for over 700 years and an organised coalmining
industry has been in existence for over 300 years, some 200 years longer than in
any other European country. British coal exports dominated the world coal market
286
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
until about 1910. By 1913—the peak production year—the industry was producing
287 million tons of coal, exporting 94 million tons and employing 1,107,000 workers.
The very fact that the British coalmining industry was developed so early has
meant that many of the best seams of coal are now worked out; every year coal has
to be mined from deeper and thinner seams and productivity can be maintained
only by a high level of investment.
The industry declined during the first world war owing to a shortage of man¬
power and to the shortage of plant and materials necessary for undertaking any
mechanical improvement. Moreover, alternative sources of energy and lower prices
in Continental countries led to a later decline in exports, which had fallen to 67
million tons in 1925.
Attempts at securing economies through amalgamation date from the Sankey
Commission of 1919. In 1930, a Coal Mines Act established commissioners to
bring about the formation of larger and more efficient units. The Coal Act of 1938
transferred ownership of mineral coal to the State and made it the statutory
responsibility of a Coal Commission to accelerate the integration of the industry
by reducing still further the number of separate undertakings. At the outbreak of
the second world war in 1939, however, this process was not far advanced.
The National Coal Board
In 1942, the Government assumed full control of the industry’s operations,
though the colliery undertakings continued to own the coal mines. In May 1946,
the Coal Industry Nationalisation Act received the Royal Assent. On 1st January,
1947, the assets of the industry were vested in the National Coal Board, which was
appointed by the then Minister of Fuel and Power and became responsible for the
industry’s management. Under the Act, the Board consisted of a chairman and eight
other members, but this provision was amended by the Coal Industry Act, 1949,
and the Board now consists of a chairman and not fewer than eight or more than
11 other members; the number of full-time members must not exceed eight and
there must be one, and may be two, deputy chairmen.
The Board’s main duties are:
(1) to work and get the coal in Great Britain to the exclusion of any other
person;
(2) to secure the efficient development of the coalmining industry; and
(3) to make supplies of coal available of such qualities and sizes and in such
quantities and at such prices as may seem to it best calculated to further
the public interest.
The Board is also charged with securing the safety, health and welfare of its
employees. The Board’s policies must be directed to ensure that its revenues shall
be not less than its outgoings properly chargeable to revenue account, taking one
year with another.
There are minor exceptions to the Board’s exclusive monopoly to work coal in
Britain: for example, it may license private enterprise to work small mines in which
the number of underground workers does not greatly exceed 30. Production on
opencast sites, which had been the responsibility of the Ministry of Fuel and
Power, was transferred to the Board on 1st April, 1952.
The Board is responsible for its own regional organisation. The collieries,
numbering about 850, are grouped into 50 Areas which are the basic units for
commercial management. The size of the Areas varies according to geological,
geographical and other technical considerations. The Areas are grouped into nine
Divisions which roughly correspond to the main coal-bearing regions. A Divisional
Board for each Division supervises and co-ordinates the work of the Areas within
INDUSTRY
287
the Division (except in the small South Eastern Division, which is administered by
a General Manager), formulates divisional policy, and is answerable to the National
Coal Board, which is responsible for questions of national policy, finance and the
co-ordinating of major schemes of development. The day-to-day work of running
the collieries is under the direction of colliery managers.
Two Coal Consumers’ Councils were set up under the 1946 Act: the Industrial
Coal Consumers' Council, members of which represent consumers, merchants and
suppliers of coal, coke and manufactured fuel for industrial and other purposes,
involving supply in bulk \ and the Domestic Coal Consumers Council, members of
which represent similar groups concerned with coal for domestic use. The most
important function of the Councils, which are responsible to the Minister of Power,
is the general consideration of the commercial arrangements and activities of the
National Coal Board, to ensure that this monopoly undertaking shall have the
maximum practical regard for consumers’ interests.
At the end of 1947 (its first year), the National Coal Board showed a deficit of
£23-3 million, after paying compensation to the former mine-owners and interest
on borrowed capital. In the years 1948, 1949 and 195° there were surpluses of £1 ‘7
million, £9-5 million and £8-3 million respectively. There were deficits of £i-8
million and £8-2 million in 1951 and 1952, a surplus of £°‘4 million in 1953,
deficits of £3-6 million in 1954 and £19-6 million in 1955, a surplus of £12-8
million in 1956, and a deficit of £5-3 million in 1957.
The National Coal Board raises capital by long-term borrowing direct from the
Exchequer, instead of through the issue of stock. There is a statutory limit of £650
million at present on such borrowing and special authorisation is needed for
borrowing, in any one year, more than £75 million in excess of the highest level of
aggregate advances in the preceding year.
Production
It has been estimated that Britain’s workable reserves of coal will last for about
400 to 500 years at current rates of consumption. But certain types such as high
quality coking coal will be exhausted long before then unless they are eked out by
blending with other types of coal.
The main coal-bearing areas are: (1) the Yorkshire, Derbyshire and Nottingham¬
shire field, which produces about 45 per cent of the total output, (2) the Durham
and Northumberland field, (3) the South Wales field, and (4) the Scottish field.
Other important coal-bearing areas are those of Lancashire and the West Midlands
(Staffordshire and Warwickshire). There are no coal-bearing areas in Northern
Ireland.
In the early years following nationalisation, the National Coal Board was able
to secure quick increases in production and productivity by reorganisation, by a
wider application of improved working methods and by increased mechanisation
of cutting and conveying. As a result, deepmined production increased from 187
million tons in 1947 to 214 million tons in 1954, despite a fall of 4,000 in average
manpower. Production has since remained roughly stationary, and in 1957 totalled
210 million tons. Output in tons per man-shift worked at the coal face has increased
gradually, and in 1957 reached 3’36 tons as compared with 3’22 tons in 1953 and
3-00 tons in 1938. In addition, output from opencast workings, which are operated
by civil engineering contractors on behalf of the Board, totalled 13'6 million tons
in 1957, the highest level recorded since this method of exploiting the shallower
deposits of coal started in 1942.
Future progress depends on bringing new mines into production, the develop¬
ment of machines for power-loading the coal at the face on to the face-conveyor belt
288
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
and the reorganisation of the haulage systems. The National Coal Board has
launched a large programme of major reconstruction and new sinkings.
Until 1957 the coal industry suffered from a shortage of manpower. In 1957
manpower averaged 710,000, of whom 285,000 were workers at the coal face.
Marketing
Although the Board, as sole producer, makes the first sales of coal it has no
monopoly of distribution. In many cases it acts as a wholesaler and in a few areas
makes direct retail sales. Retail distribution is, for the most part, carried on by
private firms which, since the end of rationing of domestic coal in July 1958, after
nineteen years, have been free to sell in any quantity to any consumer, on a competi¬
tive basis without price restriction. Distribution of industrial coal has, for a number
of years, also been the subject of an allocation scheme, but this is being brought to
an end leaving the trade to operate on normal commercial lines.
Consumption and Overseas Trade
Coal consumption in Britain increased by an average annual rate of 3 million
tons between 1947 and 1956, and, to cover requirements, supplies had to be im¬
ported from the United States in certain years. In 1957, however, sales declined
by 5 million tons, mainly because of exceptional weather conditions, but also
reflecting increased efficiency in the use of fuel and the check to industrial produc¬
tion in the early part of the year. Imports fell to 2-9 million tons in 1957 from 11 -5
million tons in 1955, and no further contracts for imported coal have been placed.
Table 21 summarises the pattern of coal consumption in Britain in the years
1955-57. The electricity authorities took more than one-fifth of total supplies,
much of it in the form of small coal not suitable for other uses. Higher production
of pig iron has raised the requirements of coke ovens, which in 1957 absorbed
about 15 per cent of total supplies.

Exports have been reduced substantially in relation to pre-war as a result of
the large increase in internal consumption. In 1957, they amounted to 6-6 million
tons, the principal markets being Denmark, the Irish Republic, France and the
Netherlands. Including coke and briquettes, the value of exports in that year was
£61-8 million.
INDUSTRY
289
Labour Relations
Negotiations on wages and conditions of service in the coal industry are conducted
through a Joint National Negotiating Committee, consisting of 16 members
appointed by the National Coal Board and not more than 16 members of the
National Union of Mineworkers. Disputed issues are referred to a National Refer¬
ence Tribunal consisting of three permanent independent members and four
assessors without voting rights, two representing labour and two management.
There are also District Joint Negotiating Committees, which deal with the applica¬
tion of national agreements, settle any difficulties and differences that may arise at
district level and refer unresolved differences to the national committee.
The Coal Industry Nationalisation Act requires the Board to enter into joint
consultation with its employees to discuss such matters as production, safety, health
and welfare. At almost every colliery there is a Consultative Committee in which
the workmen’s representatives are elected by secret ballot. The colliery manager is
chairman, and he nominates three colliery officials to be members of the committee.
There are also Consultative Councils at the area, divisional and national levels on
which the Board and the four staff organisations in the industry—the National
Association of Colliery Managers, the British Association of Colliery Management,
the National Association of Colliery Overmen, Deputies and Shot-firers, and the
National Union of Mineworkers—are represented.
Safety, Health and Welfare
The safety, health and welfare of miners are safeguarded by comprehensive
legislation, which was consolidated and brought up to date by the Mines and
Quarries Act, 1954. Responsibility for the enforcement of safety regulations lies
with the Mines and Quarries Inspectorate of the Ministry of Power.
The National Coal Board has its own safety organisation and, in accordance with
the Nationalisation Act, follows a policy directed towards securing the safety,
health and welfare of its employees; examples of voluntary action by the Board
to reduce risks are the installation of fire-resistant conveyor belts, the replacement
of light alloy supports (which had been found to be liable to produce dangerous
sparks) and the widespread introduction of courses of training for various classes
of officials and workmen. The Board has also continued to strengthen the medical
services which existed before nationalisation. Chief Divisional and Area Medical
Officers have been appointed and Assistant Medical Officers are being appointed
in areas with a labour force of more than 15,000 men. Medical centres are being
set up at the pit head.
The Board is responsible for its employees’ welfare at their work-places, for
example, by the provision of pit-head baths and canteens, while the social welfare
of coalminers and their families has, since 1952, been the responsibility of the Coal
Industry Social Welfare Organisation, which is controlled by the Board and the
miners’ trade unions. .
Research into problems of safety and health is carried out also at the Ministry
of Power’s Safety in Mines Research Establishment, which maintains a close liaison
with the Mines Inspectorate and the National Coal Board s research organisation.
Development and Research
Contraction and curtailment of development in the industry since the peak year,
1913, had led to a position in which less than one-third of current output was
coming from pits started in the twentieth century. Large-scale development was
therefore essential.
In 1950, the National Coal Board announced its long-term plan of development
290
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
for the industry, involving the reorganisation and increased mechanisation of
existing mines and the sinking of new ones. The plan is not rigid, and a revised
version, taking account of changing circumstances and new knowledge, was issued
in May 1956. It is expected that annual output will total 240 million tons by i960,
but it is not thought possible to reach 250 million before 1970. Opencast production
is expected to continue at a rate of about 10 million tons a year. Actual capital
expenditure in the years 1950-55 totalled £387 million, and over the period 1956-65
is expected to amount to £1,000 million, of which some £410 million would be
spent between 1961-65. A total of £103 million was invested in 1957, and about
£100 million is planned for 1958. In the ten-year period to 1965, it is estimated
that £860 million will be required for collieries and associated activities, including
work on major schemes to be completed after 1965, and £140 million for ancillary
works. Manpower requirements are estimated at 682,000 with an output-per-man-
year of 319 tons in i960, and 672,000 with an output-per-man-year of 342 tons in
1965, when four-fifths of Britain’s coal output will be coming from virtually new
mines.
The mechanical cutting and conveying of coal are now the general practice: in
1957, 88 per cent of total deep-mined output was mechanically cut and 94 per cent
was mechanically conveyed. The loading of coal at the working face offers, at
present, the next most important possibility for increased coalface mechanisation.
Each man on a power-loaded face produces an average of nearly 6 tons compared
with about 3J tons on conventional faces. In 1957, 54 million tons were power-
loaded, compared with 13 million tons in 1953 and 5 million tons in 1947.
In 1947, the National Coal Board took over, with other assets, the Coal Survey,
a national organisation for surveying coal resources within Britain, and 70 labora¬
tories in the various coalfields, which it has since extended and modernised.
In 1948, the Board established a central research organisation at Stoke Orchard,
near Cheltenham, Gloucestershire, to provide facilities for fundamental research in
the coalmining industry, as distinct from the day-to-day scientific control exercised
by the divisional and area scientific organisation. This is now known as the Coal
Research Establishment. A second central research organisation for the investiga¬
tion of underground problems, known as the Mining Research Establishment, was
formed in 1952 by the Board at Isleworth, Middlesex, and a Central Engineering
Establishment is now operating near Bretby, in Derbyshire, for developing new
machines and testing equipment.
The Board also subscribes to a number of autonomous research associations in
receipt of grants from the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research (DSIR),
including the British Coal Utilisation Research Association, the British Coke
Research Association and the Coal Tar Research Association. In addition, much of
the work of other bodies, such as the Safety in Mines Research Establishment of
the Ministry of Power and the Fuel Research Station of DSIR, is closely related to
the Board’s problems. A new Fuel Research Station at Stevenage, Hertfordshire,
to replace the existing one at Greenwich and to undertake certain other investiga¬
tions, was opened towards the end of 1958.
In 1956, the National Coal Board and the Central Electricity Authority accepted
responsibility for the planning and construction of a pilot plant for the underground
gasification of coal. This is a process for converting coal in the ground into gas for
use in generating electricity and it has reached the stage of being demonstrated on
a small scale after years of work by the Ministry of Power (and its predecessor) in
co-operation with the National Coal Board. Exploitation of the process on a
commercial scale is being undertaken. The National Coal Board has set up an
Underground Gasification Executive to carry out its part in the project.
INDUSTRY
291
PETROLEUM
The petroleum industry in Britain dates back to 1850, when Dr. James Young, a
Glasgow chemist, succeeded in obtaining lamp oil and lubricants from natural
mineral oil occurring in the Derbyshire coal measures. The Scottish shale deposits,
yielding similar products, were first worked in 1858.
Indigenous Production
Sources of crude oil within Britain (including shale oil) supply altogether less
than one per cent of total United Kingdom requirements, the remainder being
imported from overseas.
Current output of shale oil is drawn from seven shale mines and one opencast
quarry, retorted in four crude oil works, and the crude products are refined in a
central refinery at Pumpherston, near Edinburgh. Output of shale reached a peak
of 3-4 million tons in 1913, but the cost of the processes and other economic
difficulties led to a reduction of output. Production amounted to over 902,000 tons
in 1957, yielding over 71,000 tons of crude shale oil. From the latter, some 68,000
tons of refined products were obtained. In I957> about 8,900 tons of motor spirit
were obtained from coal by hydrogenation, and 5>600 tons by low temperature
carbonisation. Some 319,500 tons of refined benzole were derived from coke ovens
and gas works. Prospecting for crude petroleum has so far led to the establishment
of two oilfields in Nottinghamshire (Eakring and Egmanton), one in Lancashire
(Formby) and one in Leicestershire (Plungar). Production of crude oil from
indigenous oilfields in 1957 was 82,000 tons. In 1958, further oil has been found at
Langar and Bothansall, Nottinghamshire, and near Corringham, Lincolnshire.
International Trade
British and British-Dutch oil companies have been responsible for developing
the oil resources of many countries to mutual advantage, especially in the Middle
East, Far East and Caribbean areas.
Today these companies produce one-third of all oil entering into international
trade, with a tanker fleet (part owned by them and part on charter) amounting to
nearly one-third of the world’s tanker tonnage. (United Kingdom registered
tanker tonnage is nearly one-fifth of the world’s total.)
In 1957, the United Kingdom imported 29 million tons of crude oil, more than
half coming from Kuwait, the other largest suppliers being Venezuela, Iran, the
United States, Iraq and Bahrain, in that order. The pattern of imports was distorted
in 1957 by the situation in the Middle East; only negligible quantities are drawn
from the United States, and in normal years Iraq is a larger supplier than Venezuela.
Consumption
In 1957, the rationing of motor spirit and other restrictions on oil consumption,
as a result of the Suez emergency, caused a break in the upward trend of oil con¬
sumption in the United Kingdom. Total delivery for consumption was about 24"7
million tons, compared with 25-2 million tons in 1956, and 23-2 million tons in
1955. Of the 1957 total, 5-7 million tons represented motor spirit and 6-9 million
tons fuel oil. Consumption of fuel oil has been expanding rapidly as a result of its
increasing use in industry. The upward trend in consumption was resumed in
1958, and in the first five months of the year deliveries were at an annual rate of
over 30 million tons, of which about 10 million tons were accounted for by fuel
oil.
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
292
Refineries
Up to 1939, three-quarters of the United Kingdom’s supply of petroleum
products was refined overseas, in accordance with the view, commonly held in the
world oil industry at that time, that it was more economical to refine at the source
of production. Since the second world war, however, the industry has come to
favour the siting of refineries in the consuming areas. The expansion programme
in the United Kingdom carried out by the major oil companies was a substantial
one, costing over the years 1947 to 1954 very nearly £200 million.
At the end of 1957, refinery capacity in the United Kingdom amounted to about
31 million tons a year. Of the 14 refineries in operation, six had a capacity of under
0-2 million tons. By the end of 1958, capacity had been increased to nearly 40
million tons, the largest refineries being situated at Fawley (10-5 million tons) near
Southampton, Shellhaven (8 million tons) and Isle of Grain (7 million tons), both
in the Thames Estuary, and Stanlow (5 million tons), in Cheshire. A new plant at
Milford Haven, in Pembrokeshire, with a capacity of 5 million tons is expected to
be ready by i960. Production of refined products rose from about 5 million tons
in 1948-49 to 27-8 million tons in 1957. There is a substantial external trade in
refined products which tends to follow trading and seasonal requirements and the
commercial arrangements of the oil companies. United Kingdom exports, mainly
in the form of heavier products to European countries, were valued at £83 million
in 1957. Imports of refined products were valued at £120 million in 1956 and £154
million in 1957.
Research
Research into problems of petroleum technology is carried out mainly by the
leading oil companies, which have also endowed research at the universities on a
substantial scale. Some work on the production of oil products from coal is done
at the Fuel Research Station of the Department of Scientific and Industrial
Research.
The British Petroleum Company has a large research centre at Sunbury-on-
Thames, which deals with chemical and physical research, process development,
petroleum and petroleum chemical products, engine research in relation to fuels
and lubricants and general analytical problems.
At the Shell Group’s main centre at Thornton, Cheshire, research into applica¬
tions of petroleum products for all marketing areas, except North America, is
undertaken. Another of the Shell Group’s centres, at Woodstock, near Sitting-
bourne, Kent, conducts research into the agricultural application of petroleum
derivatives, and the centre at Egham, Surrey, concentrates on consumer research
related to products such as detergents.
The Esso group (United States) has a research station at Abingdon, Berkshire,
concerned mainly with work on engine fuels and lubricants.
ELECTRICITY SUPPLY
Public supply of electricity was first provided at Godaiming, Surrey, in 1881,
though there were earlier demonstrations of its use to consumers, such as the
former Metropolitan Board of Works, in the lighting of the Thames Embankment.
From the earliest days a measure of public control has been a feature of the industry,
and the Electric Lighting Act of 1882 authorised the Board of Trade to grant
licences for the establishment of electricity undertakings by local authorities or by
companies (which the local authorities might compulsorily purchase after a given
period of time) to supply consumers in given areas. By the turn of the century,
INDUSTRY
293
technical developments, including the introduction of the electric motor as a source
of motive power, had led to a large increase in the scale of distribution of electricity,
and a variety of independent supply systems had grown up all over the country.
It was not until after the first world war that steps were taken to reorganise the
industry on a national scale in order to realise the benefits of concentration, integra¬
tion and standardisation in electricity supply. In 1919, the Electricity Commis¬
sioners were set up as a supervisory body and to promote reorganisation dirougb
voluntary agreement. Then, in 1926, the Central Electricity Board was established
to co-ordinate more efficiently the generation of electricity. Its main duties were to
concentrate the output of electricity in certain stations, selected for their efficiency
and low operating costs, and to connect these selected stations with one another and
with local distribution undertakings by means of a national system of main trans¬
mission lines, known as the Grid. Thenceforward, steady progress was made in
putting this plan into effect and, by March 1948, 143 selected stations, out of some
300, were supplying 95 per cent of the electricity generated for public supply.
Organisation under Public Ownership
Under the Electricity Act of 1947, a central authority, then known as the British
Electricity Authority, and 14 Area Electricity Boards, took over in April 1948 the
assets of former municipal and private electricity supply undertakings throughout
Great Britain, except in the area already served by the North of Scotland Hydro-
Electric Board (see p. 294). Under the Electricity Reorganisation (Scotland) Act of
1954, the Authority’s functions in Scotland were taken over in April 1955 by the
South of Scotland Electricity Board (see p. 294). The name of the Authority was
changed from British Electricity Authority to Central Electricity Authority and the
number of Area Boards was reduced to twelve.
On 1 st January, 1958, under the Electricity Act, 1957, the Central Electricity
Authority was dissolved and replaced by two new bodies, the Electricity Council
and the Central Electricity Generating Board.
The present organisation in the various parts of the United Kingdom is described
below.
England and Wales
The Electricity Council, the central body of the industry, is composed of a chair¬
man, two deputy chairmen, up to three other persons, and the chairman and two
other members of the Central Electricity Generating Board, and, ex officio, the
twelve chairmen of the Area Electricity Boards. The main functions of the Council
are to advise the Minister of Power on matters relating to the electricity supply
industry and to promote and assist the maintenance and development by Electricity
Boards in England and Wales of an efficient co-ordinated and economical system
of electricity supply. More specifically the Council is responsible for a number of
common services, including capital financing and research.
The Central Electricity Generating Board consists of a chairman and not fewer
than seven, nor more than nine, other members. The Board has taken over the
main executive functions of the former Central Electricity Authority in England
and Wales: i.e. to generate or acquire supplies of electricity and to provide bulk
supplies to the Area Boards.
The Area Boards (of which there are at present 12) are responsible for the
distribution of electricity in England and Wales. Each consists of a full-time chair¬
man and deputy chairman and four to six part-time members, appointed by the
Minister of Power.
294
BRITAIN*. AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Area Consultative Councils were set up under the Electricity Act, 1947, in the
area of each Area Board to represent the interests of consumers. They each consist
of between 20 and 30 members, of whom between 40 and 60 per cent are nominated
by local authority associations. The chairman of each Area Consultative Council
is an ex officio member of the corresponding Area Board. These arrangements
continue under the Act of 1957.
The most important functions of the Minister of Power in England and Wales,
under the new arrangements, are: to appoint the chairmen, deputy chairmen and
members of the Electricity Council and the Central Electricity Generating Board;
to approve each Area Board’s capital development plans and the industry’s research
programme; and to approve, in consultation with the Treasury, the Board’s
borrowing requirements, having regard to the development programmes submitted
by the industry. The Minister also has power to issue general directions to the
Council and the Boards if he considers this necessary in the national interest.
Over 200,000 people are employed in the electricity supply industry.
The Central Authority and Area Boards, taken together, have made a consoli¬
dated net surplus on their operations in each of the years since they were established.
Up to and including the financial year 1956-57, these surpluses amounted in the
aggregate to over £82 million. Under the 1957 Act, each Electricity Board, as
distinct from the industry as a whole, must pay its own way, taking one year with
another.
Under the Electricity Act of 1957, the Electricity Council is required to devise
a satisfactory procedure for collective bargaining and joint consultation with em¬
ployees in the industry. In each of the three main groups of workers (administrative,
technical and manual), there is a separate National Joint Industrial Council or
Board, which negotiates terms and conditions of employment. A National Joint
Advisory Council, drawn from management and employees, has been set up to
discuss the health, welfare and safety of all groups of employees. There are also
separate district councils and local works and advisory committees forming part of
the negotiating and conciliatory machinery.
Scotland
The North of Scotland Hydro-Electric Board was set up in 1943 as a public cor¬
poration to develop the water power resources of the Highlands and Islands and
to distribute electricity in the more sparsely populated parts of Scotland not
covered by existing undertakings. The Board consists of a chairman, a deputy
chairman and not fewer than four nor more than eight other members, appointed
by the Secretary of State for Scotland.
The Act of 1947 made the North of Scotland Hydro-Electric Board solely
responsible to the Secretary of State for Scotland for ail generation and distribution
in its area. This area was extended under the Act to include that part of Scotland
north and west of a line running roughly from Dumbarton on the Firth of Clyde
to Newburgh on the Firth of Tay.
On 1st April, 1955, the South of Scotland Electricity Board, answerable to the
Secretary of State for Scotland, took over the then British Electricity Authority’s
functions in Scotland, and also the functions of the two Area Boards in the south
of Scotland, which were dissolved. The Board consists of a chairman, deputy
chairman, and not fewer than four nor more then eight other members, appointed
by the Secretary of State for Scotland.
Under the Electricity Reorganisation (Scotland) Act, 1954, the then Minister of
Fuel and Power retained only three functions in regard to electricity in Scotland,
INDUSTRY
295
namely, to act jointly with the Secretary of State in regard to staff pensions and ta
safety measures, and to remain solely responsible for the certification of meters.
A Consultative Council has been appointed for the District of each Board by the
Secretary of State, to represent the interests of consumers. The constitutions of
these councils are similar to those of the Area Consultative Councils, and the chair¬
man of each is a member of the appropriate Board.
Northern Ireland
In Northern Ireland, electricity is generated at power stations in Belfast, Bally-
lumford, Larne and Londonderry. Those in Belfast are owned and operated by
the Belfast Corporation, and the next two by the Electricity Board for Northern
Ireland. Generation at these three is co-ordinated by the Northern Ireland Joint
Electricity Committee, set up by Statute in 1948, which purchases their output and
resells it to distributors—Belfast Corporation, for Belfast and district, and the
Electricity Board for the rest of Northern Ireland except Londonderry. In London¬
derry the City Council both generates and distributes electricity independently of
the Joint Committee.
Generation
Almost the whole of Britain’s electricity is produced in coal-fired steam generating
stations. Abundant supplies of coal, together with good rail and water transport
for moving it, in contrast with the remote and scattered location of relatively small
water power resources, led to this preponderant development of electricity supplies
from thermal generating stations. The development of hydro-electricity on any
scale is comparatively recent.
The installed generating capacity of the electricity authorities (including the
North of Scotland Hydro-Electric Board) in Great Britain at the end of 1957
totalled 26,611 megawatts (MW)—maximum continuous rating—compared with
12,546 MW at the end of 1948.
Sales of electricity in Northern Ireland (where the total generating capacity of
383 MW is in coal-fired thermal stations) amounted to 1,009 million kilowatt-hours
in 1957, when the maximum load sustained was 348 MW.
In 1957, 88,728 million units (one unit — one kilowatt-hour), or slightly under
98 per cent of the public supply in Great Britain, was generated at thermal stations,
2,100 million units, or about 2 per cent, from water power, and 144 million units
by other means, e.g., diesel and waste heat and refuse destruction. The high rate
of expansion of output, which has been a feature of the industry since its earliest
years, has been continued since the war. Total production in 1957 was more than
eight times what it was in 1930, and has increased by 40 per cent since 1953.
Thermal. The electricity authorities are the largest consumers of primary fuel
in Britain, and, in 1957, used 46-5 million tons of coal and about 1-5 million tons
of coke and oil. Average thermal efficiency of steam stations (i.e. the ratio of power
output to the coal consumed) rose from 20-91 per cent in 1947-48 to 25-51 per cent
in 1957-58 as new plant was brought into use. Twenty stations containing much of
the newest plant had an average efficiency of 29-14 per cent in that year.
The Central Electricity Generating Board plans to have in commission by 1962
a generating set of 275 MW capacity, and, a year later, a 550 MW set is due to be
commissioned at Thorpe Marsh, near Doncaster. The latter is much larger than
any now in operation, or, as far as is known, than any at present projected anywhere
in the world. These large machines will show substantial economies in capital
cost, in fuel consumption and in operational costs. At present the largest size of
generating set installed in Britain is 105 MW.

Hydro-Electric. The setting up of the North of Scotland Hydro-Electric Board
in 1943 marked the beginning of a new era of intensive water power development
in the Highlands of Scotland. A development scheme drawn up by the Board in
1944, showing the water power resources which it proposed to examine, listed
102 hydro-electric projects with an estimated annual output of 6,274 million units
of electricity. The ultimate output of hydro-electric power is expected to be
substantially higher and eventually may exceed 10,000 million units. In 1957, 1,625
million units were generated from water power compared with 322 million in 1949.
Hydro-electric schemes with a total capacity of 780 MW were under promotion or
survey at the end of 1957.
Alternative Fuels. To meet increasing demands for electricity and to save coal,
generation from alternative fuels is being promoted. The chief alternatives are oil
and nuclear energy. As regards oil, dual firing apparatus able to use either coal or
oil has been fitted to a new power station at Marchwood, on Southampton Water,
and similar apparatus is being installed in other power stations also situated
on river estuaries and thus able to be fed conveniently from nearby oil refineries.
Another alternative, used in Scotland, is peat; a pilot project at Altnabreac, Caith¬
ness, is in operation, and the peat is used in the peat-burning gas turbine developed
by a Scottish firm assisted financially by the Development Fund.
Nuclear Power Stations
As an extension of its experimental work and to produce plutonium the United
Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority (UKAEA), has built and is building a number
of reactors which also produce electricity (see map p. 203). The Calder Hall
nuclear energy establishment in Cumberland, which was officially opened by
the Queen on 17th October, 1956, is the first large-scale nuclear power station in
the world to supply electricity to a national electricity network. Calder Hall A,
consisting of two reactors, has an installed capacity of 92 MW; Calder Hall B,
due for completion in 1958, will double the installed capacity. Four more similar
reactors are being built at Chapelcross, near Annan in Dumfriesshire, Scotland.
A further establishment at Dounreay, in Caithness, Scotland, includes a fast-breeder
reactor due to start working in 1959, which will produce electricity.
The main commercial power stations under the Government’s nuclear power
programme are being built for the electricity authorities by groups of manufac¬
turers specially organised for the construction of nuclear power plants. The revised
Government programme, announced in March 1957, provides for between 5,000
and 6,000 MW capacity for the generation of electricity from nuclear energy to be
brought into operation between 1961 and 1966, instead of the 1,500 to 2,000 MW
capacity planned in the provisional programme announced in February 1955. In
October 1957, the Government decided that the target date for the completion of the
programme should be extended to 1966-67, by which time nuclear energy will be
contributing some 22 per cent of total electricity consumption, assuming operation
at not less than 75 per cent load factor. It will be producing the equivalent of 18
million tons of coal (or 10 million tons of oil) required by conventional stations for
a similar output. The total cost of the programme is estimated at about £900
million, including £I7° million for the initial charges of uranium fuel.
Special factors have to be taken into account in the siting of the nuclear power
stations, notably the need for firm rock foundations to bear the great weight of
the reactors and their supporting structure, and a location distant from heavily
built-up areas. Work on two stations—at Bradwell in Essex (300 MW installed
capacity) and at Berkeley in Gloucestershire (275 MW)—started in January 1957,
and is due for completion by 1961. Two further stations at Hunterston (360 MW),
INDUSTRY
297
in Ayrshire, Scotland, and at Hinkley Point (500 MW), in Somerset—so far the
largest nuclear station being built in the world—will be ready in 1961 and 1962.
Sites in Wales (one at Trawsfynydd, in North Wales, for which the Minister’s
consent has been obtained) and at Dungeness, in Kent, are being considered for
further stations, and the Northern Ireland Electricity Board is planning to build
a 150 MW station on a site as yet undetermined.
A series of engineering advances are enabling nuclear power stations with greatly
improved output to be constructed, and the possibility of plants with an output of
up to 1,000 MW is under discussion. As a result, it is expected that not more than
14 stations will be required for the 6,000 MW programme.
In order that nuclear power stations with their higher capital costs and lower
operating costs should be run as continuously as possible, pumped storage schemes
are being developed. Construction started at Blaenau Ffestiniog, North Wales,
in 1956, of a 300 MW pumped storage scheme (the world’s largest) and suitable
sites for further such schemes are being investigated, including one at Loch Awe
in the North of Scotland district.
Transmission and Distribution
Main electricity transmission lines—the Grid—cover most of the country.
In 1957, those of the then Central Electricity Authority totalled some 5,500 route
miles (8,602 circuit miles), of which 569 miles were operated at 275,000 volts,
4,745 miles were operated at 132,000 volts and the remainder at 66,000 volts and
below. In Scotland, there were 2,385 circuit miles of main transmission lines at the
end of 1957, all operated at 132,000 volts. Control of energy movements on the
Grid in England and Wales is managed through the eight operational areas, set up
for that purpose and distinct from the divisions in which the generating side of the
industry is organised; each area has a separate control, and the operations are
co-ordinated by a national control station in London. The Grid in Scotland is
operated from the North of Scotland control centre at Tummel Bridge and the
South of Scotland control centre at Glasgow.
The new Supergrid of main transmission lines at 275,000 volts will assist in
meeting the growing demand for electricity during the next 20 years with the
greatest economy and will make the British electricity supply the most closely
integrated power network in the world. The first stage was reached in 1954 and
the whole project is due to be completed by i960. A scheme for interchange of
energy by direct current by means of a single cross-Channel cable link capable
of transmitting up to 160 MW at 200,000 volts (direct current) received the approval
of the United Kingdom and French Governments late in i957> an<i is expected to
be in operation by 1960—61. It is estimated to cost £4 million. The object of the
scheme is to take advantage of the differences in the incidence of peak loads in the
two countries.
In England and Wales, the Area Electricity Boards distribute to consumers
electricity acquired mainly from the Central Electricity Generating Board, but in
part from other sources, e.g., collieries. There are i4'8 million consumers, an
increase of about 5 million on those supplied in December I939* Industrial concerns
are the biggest users of electricity and their demands are increasing rapidly. The
principal domestic uses of electricity are for lighting, cooking, and for space and
water heating, but the demand for numerous other domestic purposes is increasing.
The North of Scotland Hydro-Electric Board has also pressed ahead with the
distribution of electricity to consumers in the North of Scotland. At the end of
I957> there were 364,000 consumers of electricity in the Board s district and 60 per
cent of the farms and crofts had a supply of electricity. The South of Scotland
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
298
Electricity Board then supplied 1,296,650 consumers, including 80 per cent of the
farmers in the area.
Capital Investment
About 8 per cent of the annual gross fixed capital formation of the United King¬
dom is attributable to the electricity supply industry. Capital expenditure by the
industry over the eleven years 1956-67 is estimated at about £3,300 million,
broadly made up as follows: transmission and distribution, £1,400 million; con¬
struction of conventional stations, £835 million; nuclear power stations, £900
million.
The borrowing powders of the Central Electricity Authority and Area Electricity
Boards wrere originally limited to a maximum of £700 million, but in 1954 were
extended to £1,400 million. Capital expenditure during 1957 by the Authority
and Area Boards was about £235 million and approved expenditure by the Council
and the Boards for 1958 amounted to £239 million. Under the 1957 Act any
Electricity Board, as well as the Electricity Council, may borrow by issuing its own
stock with the consent of the Minister of Power and the approval of the Treasury.
Borrowing by the North of Scotland Hydro-Electric Board is limited by the
Electricity Act, 1947, as amended by the Hydro-Electric Development (Scotland)
Act, 1952, to a maximum of £200 million. The Board’s capital expenditure up to
the end of 1957 totalled £177 million, of which £121 million was on account of
hydro-electric schemes. Borrowing by the South of Scotland Electricity Board is
limited by the Electricity Reorganisation (Scotland) Act, 1954, to a maximum of
£75 million; the Board had spent £27 million by the end of 1957.
Research
The Electricity Council undertakes research on its own account and helps to
finance research through its membership of the British Electrical and Allied
Industries Research Association, an organisation to which manufacturing firms and
large consumers of electricity also belong and which was established before the
supply industry passed into public ownership. This Association is one of the
autonomous research associations in receipt of grants from the Department of
Scientific and Industrial Research. The Electricity Council also has an Electricity
Supply Research Council including independent experts to advise it and the Area
Boards, and can consult the Minister of Power’s Scientific Advisory Council on
problems affecting the supply and use of electricity. Direct research on a laboratory
scale is carried on by the Central Electricity Generating Board at the Electricity
Council’s laboratories at Leatherhead, Surrey. Examples of research in progress
include gas turbine generation and experiments in the use of wind power for
generation.
GAS SUPPLY
Public supply of gas in Britain dates from 1807, when Pall Mall, London, was
first lighted with gas. In 1812 the London and Westminster Gas Light and Coke
Company received a Royal Charter to supply gaslight in London. In the early years
of the industry, gas was used almost exclusively for lighting and was provided by
a growing number of company and municipal undertakings. Then, after the middle
of the century and the invention of the Bunsen burner in 1855, gas was used in¬
creasingly as a source of heat for many purposes, such as domestic cooking and
space and water heating, in addition to a number of industrial uses. After 1880,
however, gas for lighting purposes was subjected to increasing competition from
INDUSTRY
299
the new electricity supply industry; but the invention of the Welsbach incandes¬
cent mantle in 1887, which raised the efficiency of gas lighting very considerably,
enabled the industry to hold its own while the supply of gas for purposes other
than lighting increased.
The gas industry in its present form developed in the main during the period
between the wars when increasing competition from electricity had to be met and
when changes in social habits and outlook were taking place. The industry under¬
took a large-scale programme of modernisation of production and distribution and
launched widespread sales promotion campaigns, especially for the numerous uses
of gas in the home. By 1939 the industry had become mainly a supplier of heating
instead of a supplier of lighting.
Organisation under Public Ownership
Under the Gas Act, 1948, the gas industry was brought under public ownership
and control on 1st May, 1949. The assets of 991 undertakings, of which 269
belonged to local authorities, were vested in 12 Area Gas Boards. Together they
cover the whole of Great Britain and are charged with a statutory duty to develop
and maintain an efficient, co-ordinated and economical system of gas supply to
domestic, industrial and other consumers. The national body is the Gas Council
which is appointed by the Minister of Power and is responsible inter alia for advising
him on questions affecting the gas industry. It is a co-ordinating council, not a
trading body. It consists of a full-time chairman and deputy chairman and the
twelve chairmen of the Area Boards.
The Area Gas Boards, which have a large measure of financial and operational
responsibility and are similar in most respects to the central bodies of the other
publicly owned corporations, are charged inter alia with the responsibility of manu¬
facturing and distributing gas to consumers. Each of the Area Gas Boards which,
like the Gas Council, are appointed by the Minister of Power, consists of a full¬
time chairman and deputy chairman, in some cases one, and in one case two, full¬
time members, and always five or six part-time members including the chairman
of the Area Consultative Council. There is no common pattern of organisation;
each Board is fully independent and has devised its own subordinate structure.
A link between the industry and the consuming public was established under
the nationalisation scheme by the creation of a Consultative Council in each board
area. These councils consist of not fewer than 20 and not more than 30 members,
of whom between 50 and 75 per cent are chosen from panels of persons nominated
by the local authority associations.
In Northern Ireland, the gas supply industry remains in the hands of a number
of municipal undertakings and statutory and non-statutory companies.
Although the Gas Council is not a trading body, the operations of the Area
Boards have resulted, in the eight years up to 31st March, 1957, in an aggregate
disposable surplus of approximately £20 million before taxation.
Labour Relations
Under the Gas Act, 1948, the Gas Council is responsible for arranging satisfac-
tory procedures of collective bargaining and a system of joint consultation with its
employees. There are separate Joint Industrial Councils at the national level for
manual workers and salaried staffs, and subordinate regional councils and local
committees. At national and regional levels the councils combine negotiating and
consultative functions, but there are in some cases separate Consultative Commit¬
tees at the local level.
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK

Production
In 1957, in Great Britain, 26 million tons of coal were carbonised by gas under¬
takings and 30-7 million tons by coke ovens operated outside the gas industry.
About one-quarter of the output of gas from coke ovens is sold to gas undertakings
for general distribution; the remainder is mainly consumed at the ovens or at
collieries or steelworks.
In 1921, 250,300 million cubic feet of gas was manufactured by authorised gas
undertakings or acquired from coke ovens, and the number of consumers was 7-6
million. By 1957, gas manufactured and acquired from coke ovens for distribution
had risen to 601,000 million cubic feet and the number of consumers had risen to
over 12-9 million, an increase of 140 per cent in the volume of gas available and
of about 70 per cent in the number of consumers.
In 1957, the quantity of gas produced in Northern Ireland was 7>444 million
cubic feet, most of it for household use.
The total number of persons employed in the gas industry in Great Britain in
1957 was about 136,000.
Consumption
Half of all gas produced is sold for household use and the remainder for industry,
commerce and public services.
Domestic Use. While an accurate statistical analysis of the domestic load is not
possible, evidence given before the Ridley Committee (on Fuel and Power Policy),
appointed by the then Minister of Fuel and Power in 1951, suggested that about
70 per cent of the domestic load was used for cooking, the remaining 30 per cent
being spread over space heating, water heating and other installations. Most homes
in Britain are now supplied with gas, except in some rural areas where, owing to
difficulties in storage and transmission, gas is not economic. These difficulties have
been overcome to some extent by the use of local high-pressure storage tanks but
this development is unlikely to grow, owing to the steady extension of rural elec¬
tricity supplies. Bottled gas, derived from petroleum, is widely used in rural areas.
Industrial and Commercial Use. Gas is used extensively in industries which re¬
quire a single control of temperature to a fine degree of accuracy. Among such
industries are pottery and certain processes in the manufacture of iron and steel
products. By 1957, industrial consumption reached 163,400 million cubic feet.
By-products
With the rapid increase in the volume of gas produced, the problems of the
disposal of substances which were regarded originally as the ‘waste’ products of
the carbonisation of coal (notably tar, benzole, sulphur and ammonia) became
increasingly important.
Production of coke at gas works in 1957 was 11 - 8 million tons, and at coke ovens
20-4 million tons. The gas industry and coke ovens jointly produce over 2-9 million
tons of crude coal tar and about 120 million gallons of crude benzole a year. These
products, together with those of the sulphur and ammonia type, provide a source
for the manufacture of a long and ever-growing list of essential derivatives which
include dyestuffs (of which Britain now produces most of its own requirements),
fertilisers, plastics, germicides (the sulphonamides and sulphanilamides), insecti¬
cides, refrigerants, perfumes, and synthetic yarns.
With further research and development, more especially in the field of organic
chemistry, the production of coal carbonisation derivatives is becoming of increasing
importance to the industry.

Development and Research
The chief objects of capital expenditure in the years immediately after the war
were to overtake arrears of plant renewal. Plans for further expansion were approved
by the then Minister of Fuel and Power in 1954 and are outlined in the Gas
Council’s publication Fuel for the Nation.
Under the Gas Act, 1948, borrowing by the Gas Council and the Area Gas
Boards was limited to £250 million. The Gas and Electricity (Borrowing Powers)
Act, 1954, extended these borrowing powers to £450 million.
The industry in recent years has been spending more than £50 million a year
on capital investment. Estimated capital expenditure in 1957 totalled £57 million
and a further £53-5 million has been approved for 1958.
The post-war structure of the industry has already permitted considerable inte¬
gration by the linking of undertakings for the transmission of gas (through gas
grids and long-distance mains), enabling production to be concentrated in the most
efficient units. Progress is also being made in interconnections for the reception
of gas from coke ovens, notably in Wales, Durham and Yorkshire.
Supplies of suitable coal are becoming more difficult to obtain. The Scottish Gas
Board is, however, building a Lurgi plant in Fife to make town gas from low-grade
opencast coal by a complete gasification process. It will cost about £8-5 million.
Alternative sources of gas are being developed by the Gas Council. Gases from oil
refineries (butane or propane) are used in several installations in smaller towns
remote from large gas works or the grid systems. Progress has also been made
with the use of methane, drained from coal mines. A scheme for using methane
from Point of Ayr Colliery in North Wales is being introduced. A new process for
the hydrogenation of petroleum fuels evolved by the Gas Council’s Midland
Research Station at Solihull, near Birmingham, is to be applied in a £2 million
pilot plant to be built at Partington, near Manchester.
Some 39 oil gasification plants are due to be completed by March 1959, and it
is estimated that they will save about one million tons of coal annually. These
include a plant, jointly constructed by the South Eastern Gas Board and the
British Petroleum Company, to convert petroleum products from the Company’s
Kent oil refinery to gas of acceptable quality. The installation, which will convert
some 50,000 tons of petroleum products a year to gas and will have a daily output
of 18 million cubic feet of gas, began operating in the summer of 1958.
Early in 1959, experimental shipments of deep-frozen, liquefied natural gas are
to be made in special tankers from the United States Gulf Coast by the Gas
Council. On arrival in Britain the natural gas is to be stored and later re-gasified.
The research organisation established by the Gas Council consists of a research
committee which advises the Council on initiation and implementation of research
policy, and two research stations, one in London and one at Solihull. Research is
also carried out on behalf of the Gas Council at Leeds University and by the
British Ceramic Research Association (an autonomous research association grant-
aided by the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research).
FUEL EFFICIENCY
The Government has for a number of years sought to promote efficiency in the
use of fuel, among both industrial and domestic users, and has been assisted by
various bodies representative of producers and consumers.
The Coal Utilisation Council consists of representatives of the National Coal
Board, coal distributors and coal appliance manufacturers. It was formed in 1932
to give information and advice on the best use of solid fuel, including the choice
302
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
of installation and operation of solid fuel appliances, to domestic consumers and to
retailers of appliances. During the second world war, the reduction in coal produc¬
tion and the demands of war industry made economy imperative. When the Minis¬
try of Fuel and Power was formed in 1942, an industrial fuel advisory service with
regional branches was incorporated within it. In 1943 the Women’s Advisory
Council on Solid Fuel, consisting mainly of representatives of appliance manufac¬
turers, women’s organisations and others interested in the housewife’s point of
view on domestic fuel arrangements, was formed to advise women on the use of
solid fuel for heating and cooking.
Further measures have been taken during the last few years. Under a scheme
introduced in 1952, loans on favourable terms are available from the Exchequer to
industrial firms for financing approved fuel-saving schemes. At present the loans
are interest-free for the first two years, repayment may be spread over a maximum
period of twenty years and no security is required. In October 1953, a non-profit-
making company, known as the National Industrial Fuel Efficiency Service, and
sponsored by the British Productivity Council, was formed to promote fuel-saving
in industry. This company, which largely replaced the industrial fuel advisory
service of the then Ministry of Fuel and Power, came into operation on 1st May,
1954. It provides advice and services to all non-domestic fuel users in a variety of
forms, from ‘spot’ inspection to full-scale heat and power surveys and regular visits
on a contract basis. A survey of the generation and use of steam carried out by the
Ministry has been employed to show the possibilities in the increased uses of back¬
pressure steam in the generation of electricity. The electricity and gas industries,
the largest consumers of primary fuel, are succeeding each year in obtaining more
energy from each ton of coal they use, by increasing the thermal efficiency of their
plants. The campaign for fuel efficiency is closely linked with the campaign for the
reduction of smoke.
In 1958, a committee was set up by the Government to consider ways of improv¬
ing co-operation between the Electricity and Gas Area Boards.
V/ATER SUPPLY
Britain’s water resources are, in general, sufficient for domestic and industrial
requirements. The sources of water, however, are often distant from the areas
where supplies are needed, and water undertakings are therefore mainly concerned
with abstraction, storage, treatment and distribution. Supplies are obtained partly
from surface sources such as mountain lakes, streams impounded in upland gather¬
ing grounds and river intakes, and partly from underground sources by means of
wells, adits and boreholes. Unlike other public services in Great Britain, such as
electricity and gas, water supply remains in the hands of a large number of under¬
takings of different kinds. Ministerial responsibility for national water policy rests
with the Minister of Housing and Local Government in England and Wales, with
the Secretary of State for Scotland in Scotland and with the Minister of Flealth and
Local Government in Northern Ireland.
Development of Water Supply in England and Wales
It was not until the nineteenth century that the provision of water supplies
became a general public service and then only after long and bitter controversy.
It was largely due to the efforts of Edwin Chadwick and his colleagues, who
demonstrated the dangers arising from inadequate water supply and sanitation, that
the Public Health Act, 1848, became law in England and Wales and laid the basis
for a long series of statutes dealing with public health.
INDUSTRY
3°3
From the middle of the nineteenth century onwards a number of separate large
water undertakings were set up to provide adequate supplies of pure water to the
expanding urban population, and the water supply system developed rapidly,
although in piecemeal fashion and with some overlapping and waste.
Organisation of Water Supply in England and Wales
Local authorities have a duty as sanitary authorities to ensure that water supplies
are adequate for the needs of their areas, and they may do this either by operating
a water undertaking themselves or by ensuring that other bodies are providing an
adequate supply. The householder receives his domestic water supply at a com¬
paratively small charge, varying in different areas, which he usually pays by way of
a water rate levied, like other rates, on the value of his house.
By the Water Act, 1945, the Minister of Housing and Local Government has a
duty to promote the conservation and proper use of water supplies in England and
Wales. The same Act provided for a statutory Central Advisory Water Committee
(replacing the previous non-statutory committee) to advise the Minister on general
questions relating to water and to deal with the local organisation of water supplies
and the powers and duties of local authorities and other water concerns. Local
authorities were required, in extension of the duties placed on them under the
Public Health Acts, to secure piped wholesome water in every part of their districts
where there were houses or schools, unless it was impracticable to do so at reasonable
cost.
In the years between the passing of the Water Act and 1958, 260 smaller water
authorities in England and Wales were absorbed by larger authorities or by the
creation of joint boards. The principal object of such amalgamation is the constitu¬
tion of more efficient units in the water supply industry, and efforts to reduce the
number have recently been intensified.
In March 1958, there were, in England and Wales, 863 local authority water
undertakings, 63 joint water boards (including bulk supply boards) and 13 joint
water committees, 83 statutory water companies, 21 non-statutory water companies,
and 3 private proprietors with statutory powers. A considerable number of private
proprietors without statutory powers also provide small supplies. Water under¬
takings vary greatly in size; about half the population is served by the 55 largest
undertakings, and the other half by nearly 1,000 smaller ones.
The Metropolitan Water Board, which is probably the largest single water
undertaking in the world, supplies about 335 million gallons daily to about 6-5
million people in the London area. The Board was established in 1903, and in the
following year took over the undertakings of eight water companies which were
supplying the London area. It now consists of 88 part-time members who are the
elected representatives of the various local authorities within the Board s area of
operations, together with one representative each from the Thames and Lee Con¬
servancies. The chairman and vice-chairman are chosen by members of the Board.
Present Supplies in England and Wales
Today, piped water supplies reach some 97 per cent of the total population of
England and Wales. More than 90 per cent of households in rural areas have piped
water supplies or are within easy reach of water mains.
About £20 million a year is spent on capital development, financed mainly by
loans, the interest on which, together with running costs, is paid by the water under¬
takings from annual income. This income is derived from local water rates levied
on domestic consumers and from charges for supplies as recorded by meter in the
304
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
case of most industrial users. In addition to supplies from water undertakings, large
quantities of water are taken by industry from rivers or underground sources.
The provision of piped supplies for rural districts has been assisted by grants
under the Rural Water Supplies Act, 1934, and under the Rural Water Supplies
and Sewerage Acts, 1944 to 1955. By March 1958, schemes costing £68 million
had been completed or were in progress with the aid of grants under these Acts.
The steady growth of towns in England and Wales has meant increased demands
for water, and in so far as such growth involves covering the ground with imper¬
vious material, so that water which previously would have percolated through to
underground natural reservoirs is now carried off in drains and rivers, some
diminution in water supplies may result. On the other hand, improved methods of
purification in recent years have resulted in greater use being made of water drawn
from the lower reaches of rivers.
Water Supply in Scotland and Northern Ireland
In Scotland, public water undertakings are carried on entirely by local authori¬
ties, either separately or in combination with each other; they supply over 95 per
cent of the total population. The water problem in Scotland is broadly similar to
that in England and Wales save that less reliance needs to be placed on underground
sources. Scotland has separate legislation. The Water (Scotland) Acts, 1946 and
1949, among other provisions, impose a general duty on the Secretary of State to
promote the conservation of water resources in Scotland; require local authorities
to provide supplies of wholesome water everywhere in their districts, where this
can be done at reasonable cost; and provide for a uniform system of rating for
water throughout the country. The Rural Water Supplies and Sewerage Acts,
1944 to 1955, make available to Scottish local authorities grant assistance up to a
maximum of £30 million towards the cost of water supplies and sewerage schemes
in rural areas. By December 1957, water schemes for rural areas costing £11-i
million had been completed with the aid of such grants, and schemes worth £11-8
million were in progress.
Northern Ireland has abundant supplies of water. The Water Supplies and
Sewerage Act (Northern Ireland), 1945, in addition to making provision for
the payment of Government grants to all water supply authorities, places upon
them statutory obligations with regard to the supply of water to houses and
schools. Since 1945, a piped water supply has been, or is being, provided for every
town, and in rural areas piped water supplies are being extended. Progress has been
very rapid, and at 30th September, 1957, £17-5 million had been expended,
towards which grants of £7-5 million had been made available.
River Management
The 32 River Boards set up under the River Boards Act, 1948, carry out the
functions and co-ordinate the various aspects of river management in England and
Wales previously performed by a large number of separate authorities.
Each River Board covers a River Board Area. The River Board Areas together
comprise the whole of England and Wales, except the Thames and Lee Catchment
Areas (which are under the jurisdiction of the Thames and Lee Conservancy
Boards1 respectively), the administrative County of London, and areas adjoining
that county not included in any catchment area.
1 The Thames and Lee Conservancy Boards are similar in constitution and powers to
the River Boards; because London draws most of its water supplies from these two rivers,
however, they have long been regulated under powers granted by Acts of Parliament of
purely local application.
INDUSTRY
3°5
River Boards are composite bodies representing local government, agricultural
and fishery interests, and most of their expenses are apportioned among the councils
of the counties or county boroughs concerned, in proportion to the rateable values
of property in the River Board Area.
River management in Scotland and Northern Ireland has not been concentrated
to the same extent.
It is an offence for any person to permit any polluting matter, solid or liquid,
to enter a river. The Rivers (Prevention of Pollution) Act, 1951, revised and
strengthened previous legislation for the prevention of river pollution in England
and Wales. Enforcement of the Act is vested in the River Boards, the Thames and
Lee Conservators, and, in London and adjacent areas, in the councils of the metro¬
politan boroughs, counties, and county boroughs concerned. There is a similar Act
for Scotland under which nine River Purification Boards have been set up to pro¬
mote the cleanliness of the rivers in their areas.
Measurement of Water Resources
Information on the yield, behaviour and quantity of the nation’s surface water
resources is provided in the Surface Water Year Book of Great Britain, published
annually by H.M. Stationery Office. This publication contains particulars of the
run-off and related rainfall from a large number of rivers, streams and reservoired
areas. The Surface Water Survey Centre of the Ministry of Housing and Local
Government is responsible for the promotion of gauging, the collection of hydro-
logical information, and the publication of the Year Book. The field work of surface
water measurement is carried out by river boards, water undertakings and other
bodies. General information as to rainfall, published annually in British Rainfall,
is the responsibility of the Meteorological Office, while the subject of ground water
comes under the Geological Survey and Museum. In special cases the Hydraulics
Research Station of the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research carries
out research into problems of the design and calibration of gauging weirs and flumes
for the measurement of surface water. A close liaison is maintained between these
organisations.
Water Pollution Research
The Water Pollution Research Laboratory of the Department of Scientific and
Industrial Research is engaged in investigating problems connected with the treat¬
ment of water for domestic and industrial supply, the treatment and disposal of
sewage and industrial waste water, and the effects and prevention of pollution of
surface water and underground water. The Laboratory maintains close contact
with other interested Government Departments, with municipal and other public
authorities and with industry. Research is carried out with general supervision and
advice from the Water Pollution Research Board of the Department of Scientific
and Industrial Research. The Board was set up in 1927 and its members are
appointed by the Lord President of the Council.
BUILDING AND CONTRACTING
The building and contracting industry is concerned primarily with the con¬
struction and repair of houses, hospitals, schools, shops and factories, and with civil
engineering works such as bridges, docks, harbours, railways, airports, power
stations, hydro-electric schemes, irrigation systems and atomic energy establish¬
ments. In all, the industry employs some 1,400,000 persons (including 50,000
women) and provides about 6 per cent of the gross domestic output of goods and
services. It also makes an important contribution to overseas development.
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
306
Structure
Over four-fifths of the industry is in the hands of private concerns. The typical
firm is small or medium-sized. Over 30 per cent of the firms in the industry are one-
man businesses engaged in such trades as house painting or plumbing, and nearly
60 per cent employ fewer than nineteen persons. At the other end of the scale there
are fewer than a dozen firms of building and civil engineering contractors, each
employing more than 5,000 persons on its permanent staff. Some of these are
integrated concerns owning quarries as well as workshops, extensive stocks of
mechanical plant, and the standard stores and tackle of builders’ yards: they also
undertake large-scale constructional contracts overseas.
There are also about 200 United Kingdom firms of consulting engineers which
undertake detailed investigations of constructional projects, report on the type of
work recommended and materials required, provide estimates of the time and cost
of construction, obtain competitive tenders from contracting firms and supervise
the carrying out of the work by the contractor.
In addition, there are hundreds of firms of architects and quantity surveyors
which are concerned with the design, planning and costing of building and civil
engineering projects.
The building and civil engineering industries participate in industrial groups
which undertake large-scale constructional work, such as the building of nuclear
power stations (see pp. 296-7).
Value of Output
The value of the annual output of the industry has been rising fairly steadily
since 1945, and the total for Great Britain in 1957 is estimated to amount to £2,144
million. Of this total, £354 million represented building work carried out by the
staffs employed directly by the public authorities (including Government Depart¬
ments, local authorities and certain public utilities), while the balance of £1,790
million represented the output of private firms (new work, £1,387 million, and
other work, £403 million).
Housing Construction
In the post-war period most new houses in Britain have been built by private
firms working under contract to local authorities, but the proportion built by private
firms for private owners has increased appreciably since 1951. About 15 per cent of
local authorities employ direct labour in housing construction, while about 64 per
cent use their own labour for repair and maintenance. In 1957, the value of new
housing built in Great Britain by private firms was £553 million, of which £246
million was for private owners and £307 million for public authorities.
Between 1945 and 1957, over 2,900,000 new permanent houses and other dwell¬
ings and some 160,000 temporary houses were built in the United Kingdom.
Prefabricated Buildings
Prefabrication is generally taken to mean factory production of most of
the component parts of buildings for transport to, and rapid erection on, a site.
Techniques of prefabrication have been developed in Britain over a period of at
least 150 years. A notable early example was the Crystal Palace, originally erected
in Hyde Park, London, from component parts made in Birmingham, for the Great
Exhibition of 1851.
Considerable advances in technology were made during the second world war
when greater use was made of lightweight materials, including aluminium alloys,
INDUSTRY
3°7
light strip steel and asbestos cement panels. In the earlier post-war years, prefabri¬
cation techniques were used extensively in the construction of temporary houses,
156,000 of which were provided up to 1949 by the Ministry of Works for erection
on sites made available by local authorities. These new techniques are also used
in the construction of permanent houses, and are being developed and applied in
the building of schools, hospitals, offices and shops.
The industry has made useful contributions to the post-war need for houses and
other forms of accommodation overseas. In 1957, exports of prefabricated buildings
were valued at £3'3 million.
Civil Engineering and Industrial Building
Britain was the first country to develop civil engineering as a large-scale modern
industry and the first to provide techniques, finance and equipment to carry out
major civil engineering projects throughout the world. Prominent figures in the
early development of civil engineering included: James Brindley (1716-1772),
builder of canals; John Loudon McAdam (1756-1836), pioneer in road construc¬
tion; Thomas Telford (1757-1834), builder of roads, docks and bridges; and George
Stephenson (1781-1848), Robert Stephenson (1803-1859), Joseph Locke (1805-
1860), Isambard Kingdom Brunei (1806—1859) and Thomas Brassey (1805—1870)*
builders of railways.
Within the United Kingdom the industry has been occupied since the war with
large-scale reconstruction and development schemes. These have included work
on the repair, modernisation and electrification of railways, road and dock develop¬
ment schemes, airports, sea defence works, thermo-electric and hydro-electric
power stations, improved water supplies, and drainage and sewerage systems.
In 1958, the civil engineering programme of work under way within the United
Kingdom included: £140 million on work for the National Coal Board; £3°°
million for the British Transport Commission for railways; and over £50 million
for the Central Electricity Generating Board; work estimated at £10 million
on the Forth Bridge; £5 million on the Whiteinch Tunnel, under the river Clyde at
Glasgow; £10 million on the Dartford Tunnel under the Thames, linking Kent and
Essex; £20 million on steelworks; £5 million on docks and harbours; £10 million
on hydro-electric works; and £10 million on oil refineries.
In Great Britain since the war, more than 16,000 industrial buildings of over
5,000 sq. ft. (with a total area of over 350 million sq. ft.) and many smaller factories
have been erected.
Overseas Constructional Work
Constructional work carried out overseas by British firms has included railways
in most parts of the world; large-scale irrigation works in India, Pakistan, Egypt
and Greece; and canals, roads, docks, harbours, power stations, airfields, hydro¬
electric schemes and industrial and housing estates in several countries. British
conditions of contract for international civil engineering work have been widely
adopted as standard throughout the world.
Examples of more recent contracts include: hydro-electric schemes at Owen
Falls (Uganda), and Hirfanli (Turkey);.dock extensions at Calcutta and Bombay
(India); major harbour works at Takoradi and Tema (Ghana), and Aden; a new
port at Salaverry (Peru); thermal power stations at Pretoria and Johannesburg
(South Africa); a geothermal power station at Wairakei (New Zealand); dry docks
at Karachi (Pakistan); houses, airfields, roads and bridges in Iraq; modernisation
of the trunk road system in Iran; 14-storey blocks of flats in Toronto (Canada) and
3°8
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
large-scale industrial estate development in Annacis Island (Canada); a new engi¬
neering college in Rangoon (Burma); the Auckland harbour bridge (New Zealand);
and the Adomi bridge across the river Volta (Ghana).
It has been estimated that the value of work done during the year ended March
1958 by some 62 principal British building and civil engineering firms, operating
in some 50 countries, was over £114 million, compared with £102 million in the
previous year; and the value of contracts obtained rose from £92 million in 1956-57
to £119 million in 1957-58. Most of the work done was in the sterling area, but the
share of work done in the dollar area remained at 20 per cent as in 1956-57.
Among the major projects on which British consulting engineers have been
engaged in recent years are the hydro-electric scheme at Kariba and the power
development, irrigation and flood control project in Shire Valley (Federation of
Rhodesia and Nyasaland).
Research and Development
Research into various aspects of civil engineering is undertaken by the Depart¬
ment of Scientific and Industrial Research (DSIR), the Admiralty, various
universities and technical colleges, and by individual firms and trade associations.
The civil engineering research work of DSIR is carried out through several
research laboratories, including the National Physical Laboratory, the Building
Research Station, the Road Research Laboratory, the Forest Products Research
Laboratory, the Geological Survey and Museum, the Water Pollution Research
Laboratory, the Fire Research Station and the Hydraulics Research Station.
One notable example of this work is the research conducted during the past
twenty years on concrete manufacture by the Building Research Station and the
Road Research Laboratory in conjunction with United Kingdom universities and
the Cement and Concrete Association. Another is the research carried out at the
National Physical Laboratory into the effect of wind-pressure on bridges. This
work has been in progress since 1946, with the aid of wind-tunnels for the scale
models, and led to the discovery of two types of aerodynamic instability—an up
and down motion of the whole platform and oscillations of a twisting character.
Methods were evolved to modify or eliminate this instability. At the Imperial
College of Science and Technology, London, important research has been carried
out to discover the manner in which waves exert shock pressure on walls—a matter
of considerable importance to civil engineers, especially for maritime structures.
The principal professional body in the civil engineering industry is the Institution
of Civil Engineers, incorporated in 1828 by Royal Charter.
Some major advances in technology and materials have been made in recent
years, for example, in the mechanisation of earth excavating and site clearance, the
development of mobile hoists, improvements in road-making techniques, new
methods of welding, the introduction of unit construction processes for bridge
building, and progress in concrete mixing and prefabrication.
MANUFACTURING INDUSTRIES
The United Kingdom’s manufacturing industries provide an exceedingly wide
range of products many of which play a major role in world trade. In terms of net
output and exports the most important groups of industries are those concerned
with the manufacture of metals and metal products, though the textile and chemical
industries are also of considerable significance. Some impression of the relative
importance of the different groups in terms of net output is given in Table 22,
which is based on the results of the Census of Production for 1954 and the pro¬
visional results for 1956.

(a) Provisional figures.
An important feature in the expansion of United Kingdom exports since the
second world war has been the development of new types of commodities to meet
changing needs. In some cases, the industries concerned are based on inventions
or discoveries made during or after the war; in others, the basic research had been
done before the war, but production on a commercial scale was not undertaken
until later. Gas-turbine aircraft, radar and man-made fibres are outstanding
examples of the products of these new industries.
METAL MANUFACTURE
The metal manufacturing industries employed 585,000 persons in 1957- Nearly
four-fifths of these were engaged in the iron and steel industry.
Iron and Steel
Britain pioneered the application of coal to the smelting of iron ore from the
seventeenth century onwards and British inventors were responsible for the series
of discoveries which led to the great expansion of steelmaking in the second half
of the nineteenth century. Today, Britain is one of the world s four largest pro¬
ducers of steel and is renowned for the quality of its special and alloy steels.
Production of crude steel, which in 1946 totalled 12-7 million ingot tons, rose to
21-7 million ingot tons in 1957, and capacity is available to produce about 23-5
million ingot tons in 1958. Pig iron production has risen from 7-8 million tons in
1946 to 14-3 million tons in 1957. In 1957, direct exports of iron and steel amounted
to 3-9 million ingot tons valued at £213 million, in addition to indirect exports,
estimated in 1957 to amount to the equivalent of 4-4 million ingot tons, in the form
of sales by the steel-consuming industries; exports of the machinery, shipbuilding
and vehicle industries, which are major consumers of steel, amounted to about
£925 million in 1957.
3i°
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
South Wales and the north-east coast of England are the United Kingdom’s two
largest steel-producing areas, together responsible for an annual crude steel pro¬
duction of nearly 9-5 million ingot tons, or more than 40 per cent of the total
output. South Wales is engaged mainly in the production of flat products, and is
especially noted for tinplate. In the north-east coast area of England, production
is concentrated on heavy sections and rails, and plates for the shipbuilding industry.
Scotland, with an annual production of 2-5 million ingot tons, finds its chief internal
markets in the shipbuilding and engineering industries of the Clyde valley. Sheffield
is known throughout the world for its special alloy steels. Britain possesses some
of the most up-to-date steel plants in Europe; for example, the £18 million uni¬
versal beam mill near Middlesbrough, in the north-east of Yorkshire, for the
production of structural steel which came into operation in 1958, the new steelworks
at Ravenscraig near Motherwell, Scotland, completed in 1957 at a cost of £22-5
million, and the integrated strip mill at Margam in South Wales.
The iron and steel industry has been subject to some form of public supervision
since 1932, when a Government-appointed body, the Import Duties Advisory
Committee, gave special attention to the reorganisation of the industry. In
February 1951, the greater part of the industry came under public ownership by
virtue of the Iron and Steel Act, 1949. The 1949 Act was repealed by the Iron and
Steel Act, 1953, which established an Iron and Steel Holding and Realisation
Agency with the duty of returning the companies to private ownership. By
September 1957, there remained 16 companies, of which two are major companies,
in which the Agency had direct holdings, representing about one-sixth of the total
steel production of the United Kingdom.
The 1953 Act also provided for the establishment of the Iron and Steel Board
to exercise a general supervision over the iron and steel industry with a view to
promoting, under competitive conditions, the efficient, economic and adequate
supply of iron and steel products. The Board is responsible to the Minister of
Power and includes, in addition to the chairman and two other full-time members,
a number of part-time members drawn from steel producers, steel consumers and
trade unions.
Since 1945, modernisation and development on a large scale have been under¬
taken. It is planned to raise productive capacity for crude steel to nearly 28 million
tons by 1963, of which 5 million tons are expected to be required for exports. Plans
in hand for expansion and further modernisation of the industry, ranging from iron
ore mining to finishing capacity, are estimated to cost £600 million. The industry
plans to increase its consumption of home ore from nearly 17 million tons in
1957 to 22 million tons by 1962, and that of foreign ores from nearly 16 million
tons to between 22 and 24 million tons.
About 460,000 people were employed in 1957 in those industries classified as
iron and steel manufacture. Of these, 238,000 were engaged in iron and steel
smelting and rolling, 23,000 in blast furnaces and 118,000 in iron foundries.
Non-ferrous Metals
The non-ferrous metals industry in Britain, employing about 120,000 persons,
is the largest in Europe and contributes about £150 million to the net national
output.
Nowadays the mining in Britain of non-ferrous ores is confined to the working
of lead, zinc, tin and tungsten ores on a small scale. However, the United Kingdom
is a large consumer of non-ferrous metals, being second only to the United States
among Western countries in its consumption of aluminium, copper, lead, tin and
zinc. The industry consists of factories for smelting, casting and fabrication by
INDUSTRY
311
rolling, extrusion and drawing of these metals and of nickel and magnesium.
The techniques of powder metallurgy and pressure diecasting are also employed
where appropriate. Some of the non-ferrous metals such as nickel, molybdenum
and tungsten are largely used in steel alloys. New uses for non-ferrous metals with
special properties have emerged with the growth of new industries having their
own particular requirements, as, for example, production of nuclear energy
(uranium, zirconium), jet aircraft (niobium, magnesium, titanium) and electronic
apparatus (selenium, tungsten, germanium).
In 1957, direct exports of non-ferrous base metals (including semi-fabricated
products) were valued at £96 million, of which copper and its alloys accounted for
£54 million and aluminium and its alloys for £16 million. In addition, there was a
further substantial export of non-ferrous metals in many fabricated forms.
SHIPBUILDING AND MARINE ENGINEERING
Britain has for centuries been one of the most important shipbuilding countries.
Modern shipbuilding dates from the middle of the nineteenth century, when the
iron and steam-driven vessel replaced the earlier sailing ship. Britain led the way
in the substitution of steel for iron and in the development of the steam turbine.
Between 1890 and 1913 Britain produced more than half the world’s new tonnage,
and in 1920 launched over two million tons, still the peace-time record for the
industry. In the inter-war years the problem of surplus capacity, common to all
shipbuilding countries, caused a substantial fall in activity and periodic heavy
unemployment. During the second world war the industry was fully occupied in
building and repairing warships and merchant ships of all kinds, and a high level
of activity in the building and repair of merchant ships has been maintained since
1945.
Shipbuilding is mainly an assembly trade, and Britain’s economy is well equipped
to meet this demand, with a highly developed iron and steel industry to provide
plates and sections, a modern marine engineering industry, and a widely diversified
pattern of general industry to supply the numerous components that go to the
making of a ship.
Well over three-quarters of the tonnage of ships built in the United Kingdom
comes from four areas:
1. On the river Clyde in Scotland (where the Queen Mary and Queen Elizabeth,
the world’s largest ships, were built in the inter-war years).
2. On the north-east coast of England—along the lower reaches of the rivers
Tyne, Wear and Tees, and at West Hartlepool, and Blyth.
3. On the north-west coast of England—on the river Mersey and at Barrow-
in-Furness.
4. At Belfast, in Northern Ireland, where the largest individual shipyard is
situated. A 45,000-ton luxury liner of revolutionary design, the Canberra,
the largest passenger vessel to be built in Britain since the Queen Elizabeth,
is under construction at Belfast for the P. and O. Company.
In each of these areas there is capacity for building warships and all types of
merchant ships from large passenger liners and tankers to small sea-going ships
such as coasters and cross-Channel steamers. Ships are also built in the Southamp¬
ton area, in the Isle of Wight, and along the estuaries of the rivers Forth and Tay,
in Scotland, while numerous places along the coast build fishing vessels, yachts,
harbour craft and barges. Repair yards and dry docks are situated in all the great
ports and there are extensive repair facilities in all the shipbuilding areas.
x
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
313
Between 1945 and 1957, British shipyards launched over 15 million tons of
shipping, including 4 million tons for foreign owners.
Output has been held back on account of shortages of steel, skilled labour and
components, and launchings in 1957, at 1-4 million gross tons, represented about
three-quarters of full capacity; 38 per cent of the ships launched in 1957 were oil
tankers and about 19 per cent were for overseas. The value of exports of ships and
boats in 1957 totalled £79 million. Orders held by United Kingdom shipyards at
the end of 1957 amounted to 6-75 million gross tons with an estimated value of
£1,000 million; 2-3 million gross tons were under construction. British yards are
building 11 of the 18 passenger liners on order in the world.
In 1957 there were about 230,000 employees in the shipbuilding and ship¬
repairing industries, including those employed in naval dockyards.
Over the past fifteen years, traditional methods of shipbuilding have undergone
radical changes, primarily due to advances in welding technique. These have led
to the production of ships in large units, 50 to 60 tons in weight, prefabricated
under cover and rapidly assembled for launching. The industry is spending large
sums on the modernisation and mechanisation of yards; £50 million was invested
in the period 1946-57 and it is planned to spend about £70 million in the following
five years, including the cost of constructing berths for the building of tankers of
up to 100,000 gross tons.
The British Shipbuilding Research Association (BSRA) and the Parsons and
Marine Engineering Turbine Research and Development Association (Pametrada)
are developing gas turbines and improving the efficiency of diesel and steam units.
The Admiralty, the BSRA, the Atomic Energy Authority and private firms are
working on plans for the use of nuclear reactors for propulsion of merchant ships,
especially large tankers.
MECHANICAL ENGINEERING
Mechanical engineering comprises a vast range of products including agricultural
machinery, boilers and boilerhouse plant, machine tools, stationary engines, textile
machinery and accessories, ordnance and small arms, fabricated steelwork, office
machinery, cranes, conveyors and many other kinds of mechanical handling plant.
The total number of persons employed in mechanical engineering in 1957 was
about 1,142,000, and the value of exports in 1957 exceeded £500 million.
Agricultural Machinery
The agricultural machinery industry employs about 50,000 people and, in 1957,
its annual output, including both machinery and tractors, was valued at about £150
million. In the same year, its production included 185,000 tractors (compared with
a previous record of 175,000 in i955)> 29,000 mouldboard ploughs, 8,800 disc
harrows, 18,500 mowers, 6,800 combine harvesters, and 8,200 milking machines.
Britain, where production dates virtually from 1933, has the largest annual output
of tractors in Europe and the second largest in the world; it exports the greater
proportion of its output and is the largest exporter of tractors in the world. At
Coventry and Dagenham it has two of the most up-to-date manufacturing plants.
Exports of agricultural machinery in 1957 reached the record level of nearly
£72 million, made up of £54'6 million for agricultural tractors (but excluding
£4-5 million for track-laying tractors) and £i7'1 million for other equipment;
113,000 tractors were shipped abroad, nearly half to Commonwealth countries
overseas. In 1947, exports of tractors amounted to £5-2 million, and those of other
agricultural machinery to £4 5 million.
INDUSTRY
313
Metal-Working Machine Tools
The efficiency of a nation’s manufacturing industries depends to a very large
extent on the vitality of its machine tool industry. Britain was the birthplace of the
machine tool industry, and by the early 1830s had developed to an advanced stage
the boring machine and screw cutting lathe, as well as other machine tools. The
industry’s output now ranges from transfer lines for motor vehicle manufacture to
electronically controlled machine tools giving accuracies of one ten-thousandth
part of an inch.
The 20 largest firms together account for about half the output, but the majority
of the 350 firms in the industry are relatively small and show a high degree of
specialisation adapted to the differing needs of a varied range of users. About
50,000 workers are employed. The industry is centred mainly in the Midlands,
Yorkshire and Lancashire, and to a lesser extent near London and Glasgow. The
Machine Tool Trades Association of Great Britain is the representative body of
most of the machine tool manufacturers and importers and is responsible for the
International Machine Tool Exhibitions held in Britain every four years; the next
exhibition is due to take place in i960.
The value of deliveries of metal-working machine tools has risen from £6 million
in 1935 to £85 million in 1956 and to £95 million in 1957. Deliveries for export
in 1957 amounted to £24-5 million, while orders on hand at the end of 1957 totalled
nearly £80 million, of which nearly one-quarter were for export.
Substantial expenditures on plant and buildings have been made in recent years;
it is estimated that the value of the capital employed in the industry trebled between
1948 and 1957, and about £9 million will be spent on research and development
in the three years ending in i960.
Industrial Engines
United Kingdom manufacturers have a world-wide reputation for small marine
and industrial internal combustion engines. The number delivered, including small
marine engines, has risen from about 250,000 in 1948 to the record level of 430,000
in 1955, falling back to 360,000 in 1957. In the latter year, the value of output
amounted to nearly £49 million, of which about £20 million was for export.
Production of parts and accessories accounted for a further £15 million.
Textile Machinery
One of the oldest of Britain’s mechanical engineering industries is the textile
machinery industry which developed rapidly after the introduction of mechanical
spinning and weaving towards the end of the eighteenth century. The industry
now gives employment to about 58,000 people and comprises about 450 firms,
situated largely in Lancashire, Yorkshire, Northern Ireland, Dundee, Leicester and
Nottingham, making every kind of machine and accessory for the manufacture and
processing of yarns and fabrics from all types of natural and man-made fibres,
including bast and leaf fibre machinery of which the United Kingdom is still by
far the world’s largest supplier.
The industry enjoys a world-wide reputation, not only for the high quality of
its products but also because it offers a complete and modern range of equipment
consisting of: spinning machinery, including machinery for all the preparatory
processes; winding machinery and machinery for other processes prior to weaving;
weaving machinery; knitting, hosiery and lace machinery; printing, dyeing and
other finishing machinery; and all types of mill stores and textile machinery
accessories. In 1957, exports were valued at £43 million, or about two-thirds of
total deliveries.
314
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
To maintain its place in the forefront of world suppliers of textile machinery,
the research and design departments of the industry are continuously engaged in
research into new and improved methods of textile processing, and in the develop¬
ment of machines to speed up production and to improve the quality of an ever
increasing variety of yarns and fabrics.
Contractors’ Plant and Quarrying Machinery
Production of contractors’ plant in the United Kingdom before the war was
mainly concerned with small excavators, concrete mixing machinery and road
surfacing plant, including road rollers. But now many new machines, especially
machinery for earth-moving, are in production. Examples are industrial crawler
tractors, motor graders, scrapers, trenchers, dozer equipment, dumpers, rippers
and rooters.
Whereas output in 1935 was valued at only £2 million, in 1957 it reached nearly
£80 million, of which half was for export. Increased exports have been mainly in
the form of earth-moving machinery, road rollers, and crushing and screening plant.
Office Machinery
The United Kingdom office machinery industry is now second in size only to
that of the United States, and since 1946 has expanded at a remarkable rate. In
1957, the value of deliveries of office machinery (such as accounting and similar
machinery—excluding electronic computers—typewriters, and dictating machines)
was nearly £49 million, of which £19 million worth was exported, including
more than £3 million worth to dollar markets. British typewriters to the value of
£1-4 million were exported to North America. The industry, in association with
the electronics industry, is developing the manufacture of electronic computers on
a considerable scale.
Refrigeration Machinery
The United Kingdom industry makes a wide range of equipment and appliances
extending from refrigerators of varying sizes suitable for domestic and commercial
use, to industrial refrigeration equipment for cold stores, manufacture of chemicals
and other products, ice-making plant and refrigeration plant for ships. Production
of commercial and industrial refrigeration machinery was well established before
the second world war, but the present large production of domestic refrigerators
has been built up since 1946.
The value of the annual deliveries of refrigeration machinery in 1957 totalled
over £34 million compared with £24 million in 1953. Deliveries for export totalled
£13 million, or some 40 per cent of output.
Industrial Valves
Industrial valves controlling the movement of liquids and gases are a vital
component in many industrial processes, particularly in the chemicals, oil and
electric power industries. About 90 per cent of the United Kingdom production,
in 1957 worth about £37 million, is made by 63 firms. Chief centres of production
are the Midlands, Glasgow and the north of England, and some 15,000 persons
are employed in this branch of the engineering industry.
The value of deliveries for export more than doubled between 1949 and i957>
when they were valued at £12 million or about one-third of total deliveries. The
United Kingdom ranks second to the United States in world exports of industrial
valves, and accounts for about one-fifth of the total.
INDUSTRY
315
Boilers and Boilerhouse Plant
Boilers and boilerhouse plant manufactured in the United Kingdom have many
industrial applications. Water tube boilers of advanced design and large steam¬
raising capacity are produced by the industry for home power stations and for
export. Firms in the industry are members of the groups formed for the purpose
of building nuclear power stations, both in the United Kingdom and overseas.
In 1957, deliveries of shell boilers, used for steam raising and heating purposes
in factories and in buildings, were valued at £11 million, of which nearly £2
million worth was for export.
The total number of persons employed in the manufacture of boilers and
boilerhouse plant in 1957 was about 33,000. The value of the industry’s exports in
1957 was £16-4 million, including £7-9 million for water tube boilers.
Items of steam-raising plant accessories produced include plain and corrugated
boiler furnaces, forced draught boiler furnaces and grates, stokers, fuel economisers
and preheaters, superheaters and desuperheaters, pulverisers, coal and ash handling
plant, soot blower equipment, steam pipework, and feed water heaters. The value
of deliveries of these products in 1957 was about £18 million, of which some
16 per cent was for export.
Nuclear Power Station Plant
The design and construction of nuclear power stations is one of the outstanding
present-day enterprises of British industry. Five major groups of firms have been
formed for this purpose, consisting of leading firms in the heavy electrical engineer¬
ing, civil engineering, boiler, instrument, and associated industries. In addition to
the nuclear power stations being built for the United Kingdom electricity authori¬
ties, these groups are undertaking the first export orders for such stations, including
one to be built in Italy. Design teams from the companies concerned have been
trained by the United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority (UKAEA) in the design
of gas-cooled graphite-moderated reactors, and the Authority grants them non¬
exclusive manufacturing licences and keeps them informed of the results of
further research and development work. Industrial firms themselves are also
engaged on research into a range of problems relating to nuclear energy.
Other concerns have also joined together to carry out research into nuclear
developments and to supply nuclear power plant. Two have arrangements with
United States firms to supply ‘package’ type reactors designed to serve less
developed countries. Others, in collaboration with the UKAEA, are studying further
possible applications of nuclear power, for example marine propulsion. Companies
have also been established for the manufacture, machining and preparation of
graphite for use in reactors. The services of United Kingdom firms of consulting
engineers are being utilised for specification planning, inspection and advice.
The Nuclear Energy Trade Associations’ Conference (NETAC) was formed
towards the end of 1956 to establish a permanent means of liaison and to pool more
effectively the experience of nuclear development among the firms and trade
associations concerned.
Steelworks Plant
As a major steel-producing country, Britain has an expanding industry for the
manufacture of steelworks plant. Up to 1939, production fell considerably short
of internal requirements. The post-war modernisation and expansion of the United
Kingdom steel industry have led to the rapid development of the steelworks plant
industry, which today provides about nine-tenths of the requirements of the
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
316
home steel industry and can supply complete plant as efficient and economical in
operation as any in the world.
Some 40 firms produce equipment for making steel in all its stages. In 1945,
six of these firms, together capable of supplying the entire range of steel-making
plant, formed the Metallurgical Equipment Export Company Limited (MEECO)
to co-ordinate export operations and to facilitate the placing of foreign orders in
the United Kingdom for complete steelworks. This group of firms has carried out
a number of large contracts for equipping steelworks in Sweden, Norway, Spain
and France, and, in conjunction with other manufacturers, in India.
Deliveries of rolling mills and other specialised plant amounted, in 1957, to a
value of £22 million, of which nearly £7 million worth was for export.
Petroleum Equipment
Before the second world war, the production of specialised equipment for the
oil industry was on a small scale, but the rapid expansion in oil production and
refining throughout the world has given rise to a substantial export business in
British fittings and plant. In 1957, British firms received orders for oil equipment
and materials (excluding tankers) for the home and export market to the value of
about £134 million; these included orders for tubes, pipe-fittings and valves (£23
million), specialised drilling and production equipment (£19‘7 million), tools and
machinery (£11-3 million) and electrical equipment (£8-5 million). Britain ranks
second to the United States as a supplier of equipment for the petroleum industry.
Scientific, Surgical and Photographic Instruments
Scientific instruments have been made commercially in Britain for over three
centuries, early products being chiefly navigational and optical instruments. The
last twenty years have brought a large-scale expansion of capacity in every branch
of the industry to meet the needs of the defence services during the war and, later,
the expanding world demand for all types of instruments (optical, mechanical,
pneumatic, electrical, electronic and nucleonic), for both pure and applied science.
The sector which is expanding most rapidly is that making industrial instruments—
an essential element in the movement towards full automation in industry. British
scientific instrument manufacturers can supply all types of instrumentation for
research, and any form of control or automatic device.
The instruments industry, with its very wide range of products, employs about
94,000 workers, and the turnover in 1957 was about £140 million. The value of
exports in that year approached £40 million, and, in addition, considerable
quantities of instruments were exported as part of plant and equipment.
Clocks and Watches
Britain was at one time the world’s leading producer of clocks and watches, but,
by the end of the nineteenth century, production had virtually died out. The
present industry is largely a post-war development. It employs about 15,000 people,
the great majority skilled craftsmen, and many of the factories are located in the
Development Areas. In 1957, 9 million clocks, watches and time switches, including
2'5 million watches and 4 million mechanical alarm clocks, were produced, with a
total value of £11-5 million. Exports were valued at about £2 million.
ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING
The United Kingdom electrical engineering industry is engaged in the manu¬
facture and installation of a wide variety of electrical equipment, ranging from
giant generators to domestic appliances and the smallest components of radio sets.
INDUSTRY
317
The total value of its output has risen from about £155 million in 1938 to nearly
£1,300 million in 1957. It exports large quantities of power station equipment and
other electrical machinery and appliances to all parts of the world. In terms of
monetary value it is one of the two largest exporters of electrical goods in the world,
and sends overseas about a quarter of the value of its output, as compared with
less than one-eighth in the immediate pre-war period. The value of exports in 1957
reached the record level of £279 million, as compared with £272-5 million in 1956.
In the four years, 1954-57, the value of the industry’s exports approached £1,000
million, more than one-sixth going to European countries.
Altogether the industry employs a labour force of more than 720,000, including
205,000 engaged in the manufacture of electrical machinery, 134,000 in the pro¬
duction of radio and other electronic equipment and gramophones, and 49,000 in
wireless valves and electric lamps.
Heavy Electrical Plant
British scientists and engineers have been responsible for many of the basic
advances in the generation and transmission of electricity power. The experiments
of Michael Faraday pointed the way to the production of electricity as a source of
cheap and abundant power; Sir Charles Parsons produced and patented the first
turbo-dynamo, the forerunner of the giant turbo-generating sets of today. The
industry has provided the plant required for the large-scale post-war expansion
programme of the United Kingdom electricity authorities, and has built all types
of equipment for overseas countries, including the United States. In order to meet
the growing volume of orders, extensions to capacity have been carried out by the
principal manufacturers. Among the orders on hand are a 275,000 kilowatt (kW)
generating set for commissioning in 1962 and one of 550,000 kW for 1963. In i957>
steam turbo-alternators of 10,000 kW and over with a total capacity of 2-5 million
kW were delivered, including 0-83 million kW for export; it was also a record year
for deliveries of hydraulic turbines with a total capacity of over 800,000 b.h.p.,
five-sixths of which was for export. Exports in 1957 included £35’2 million worth
of generating sets, generators and motors and £31 million worth of transformers,
switchgear and other electrical plant.
Electronics
Production of electronic equipment is one of the most rapidly expanding of
Britain’s industries. United Kingdom scientists and inventors have made many
basic contributions to electronics—the thermionic valve, the development of
radar (a British firm has equipped one-third of the world’s ocean-going tonnage
with radar), the first public transmission television service, and the printed circuit
which has led to far-reaching changes in methods of production in the radio
industry. Since 1945, the industry has been doubling its volume of output every
five years, and its range of activities extends from consumer articles, such as tele¬
vision and radio sets, to complex industrial equipment including nucleonic control
and writing instruments and data processing machines.
About 200,000 people are employed in the industry, and the value of its output
was estimated at about £300 million in 1957. In that year, production included
1,750 million electronic components, 1-87 million television sets and 2-1 million
radio sets and radiograms.
Exports reached the record level of £43*6 million in i957> with exports of capital
equipment (for example, marine and air navigation aids) tending to expand faster
than consumer products. The value of exports of sound-reproducing equipment,
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
318
about £10 million in 1957, has increased by two-thirds since 1955. The largest
market is the United States.
Electric Wires and Gables
This industry is concerned with the manufacture of cables and wires (including
submarine cables) for the distribution of electric power, for the telephone and
telegraph network and for many other purposes.
In 1957, workers employed in the industry totalled 65,000. The value of deliveries
of insulated wire and cable, excluding winding wire, rose from £95 million in
1954 to £124 million in 1957, and the value of deliveries for export over the same
period increased by more than 50 per cent to over £36 million.
Domestic Electrical Appliances
There are some 200 firms in the United Kingdom manufacturing a wide range
of electrical appliances for use in the home. In 1957, deliveries included washing
machines (667,000, including 185,000 for export), vacuum cleaners (1,245,000,
including 254,000 for export), toasters (298,000, including 104,000 for export),
dry-shavers (1,484,000, including 473,000 for export), cookers (318,000, including
28,100 for export) and irons (2,424,000, including 672,000 for export). The annual
output is valued at approximately £70 million, of which about £20 million is
exported.
VEHICLES
Of the engineering and allied industries, the vehicles group (comprising motor
vehicles, cycles, aircraft and railway vehicles) makes the largest contribution to the
export trade (about £445 million in 1957). In 1957 it employed 1,215,000 people,
including 311,000 in the manufacture of motor vehicles and cycles, 270,000 in the
manufacture and repair of aircraft, and 170,000 in the manufacture and repair of
locomotives, railway carriages and wagons.
Motor Vehicles
In size and value the vehicles industries are headed by the motor vehicles in¬
dustry, which comprises the manufacture of cars, commercial vehicles and tractors
(see p. 312). The industry is located mainly in the Midlands and the London area,
but is represented in most regions; it consists of a relatively small number of
assembly firms—headed by the ‘Big Five’ (British Motor Corporation, Ford,
Rootes, Standard and Vauxhall)—backed by a large number of specialist component
manufacturers. It has been estimated that about 60 per cent of the ex-works value
of passenger cars consists of components purchased from the latter. The ‘Big Five’
are responsible for about 90 per cent of the output of complete vehicles; the
balance of the industry’s motor production is almost entirely specialist cars and
heavy commercial vehicles, some of which have a large market in overseas countries.
The industry has expanded considerably since the second world war, reaching
the record output of 898,000 cars and 340,000 commercial goods vehicles in 1955.
Production in 1957—861,000 cars, 279,000 goods vehicles and 9,500 public service
vehicles—was somewhat lower, but, in the first half of 1958, output of passenger
cars had reached the record annual rate of 1,100,000. Exports of passenger cars in
1957 were the highest so far reached, 426,000; those of commercial goods vehicles

of exports of passenger cars exceeded £158 million. The largest market for cars
was the United States, to which country 95,000 cars were shipped.
Research is carried out at Lindley, Warwickshire, by the Motor Industry
Research Association, an autonomous body founded in 1946 and partly financed
by the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research (DSIR), but mainly by
the industry itself. Individual firms also have their own research facilities, and some
work in this field is done by the Mechanical Engineering Research Laboratory of
the DSIR at East Kilbride, Scotland.
Some of the new assembly plants in Britain, electronically controlled and using
the minimum of labour, stand comparison with similar plants anywhere in the
world for efficiency and reliability. Leading motor manufacturers are undertaking
expansion plans, part of which were completed by 1957, costing about £15° million;
in addition, makers of components and accessories have large projects in hand.
The principal trade association in the industry is the Society of Motor Manu¬
facturers and Traders Limited (SMMT), founded in 1902, which holds a Motor
Show annually in London, and a Commercial Motor Exhibition every two years.
Motor Cycles and Pedal Cycles
In 1957, the United Kingdom’s output of motor cycles, including motorised
bicycles (mopeds) and scooters, totalled 175,000, of which 50,000 were for shipment
overseas, about one-quarter to the United States. The total value of United King¬
dom production, including parts and accessories, was about £25 million, and that
of exports about £6 million. Production of scooters and mopeds totalled about
50,000 in 1957 and is expected to increase rapidly over the next few years.
Production of pedal cycles is concentrated mainly in two groups of manufacturers.
In addition, there are several smaller companies, some of which specialise in
particular types such as racing cycles. Output in 1957 totalled 2,54^>000> which
some three-fifths were exported. The value of exports of pedal cycles, parts and
accessories in 1957 exceeded £23 million; the United States, Nigeria, and the
Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland were the largest overseas markets.
The British Cycle and Motor Cycle Industries Association Limited holds an
annual exhibition in London, usually in the autumn.
Aircraft
The development of the aircraft industry in the United Kingdom, as in other
countries, has been strongly influenced by defence requirements, and at the peak
of war-time activity it employed nearly 2 million people as compared with some
35,000 in 1935. Following the adjustments to peace-time conditions, the industry
has undergone a further period of marked expansion, with the numbers employed
increasing from 162,000 in 1951 t° 27O)000 in I957> but the numbers are likely to
fall to some extent in the next few years as a result of changes in defence policy.
The industry manufactures a wide range of civil and military aircraft, extending
from gas-turbine airliners to freighters and crop-spraying aircraft.
Britain’s achievements in developing aviation and the aircraft industry have
been numerous. The science of aerodynamics was founded by Sir George Cayley
in the early nineteenth century; more recently, Sir Frank Whittle developed the
gas-turbine engine aircraft, and its first applications to scheduled airline service
were the turbo-jet Comet and the turbo-prop Viscount, the latter the most successful
post-war civil aircraft now in service all over the world, nearly 400 having been
sold by the summer of 1958. The larger Britannia, which entered into scheduled
service in 1957, is the first gas-turbine airliner to be used on North Atlantic services
and has also been ordered by United States and Canadian airlines, it is the fastest
320
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
cruising civil transport aeroplane, and at the same time the most economical in
■operating costs yet in service in the Western world. Orders have also been placed
by British and foreign airlines for the Comet 4 and the Vanguard, which are
scheduled to enter into service in 1958 and i960. It is estimated that nearly half
the current world orders for gas-turbine aircraft have been placed with United
Kingdom firms. The British Overseas Airways Corporation (BOAC) has ordered
the Vickers VC. 10 and British European Airways (BEA) the de Havilland DH.121,
both expected to enter into service in the early 1960s. Britain is also the largest
producer in Europe of rotary wing aircraft, and more than 500 British helicopters
are in service in the world. The industry has been responsible for many advances
in military aviation, including the jet flap (for assisting landing and take-off within
a small space), the cartridge-operated ejector seat, and the first experimental
machines to be capable of vertical take-off from a normal horizontal position. It is
also engaged on the development of guided missiles, some of which have been
delivered to the Services.
The British aircraft industry makes an important and growing contribution to
•export earnings. The record 1957 total of £116-5 million included £40-6 million for
aero engines and £69-8 million for aircraft and parts. Exports in 1958 are likely to
exceed the 1957 total; in the first half of 1958 they were running at an annual rate
of over £150 million. In 1957, the largest markets for aircraft were India, Western
Germany, Sweden and the United States. Patent and royalty payments from abroad
are also important; for example, in 1956 they totalled £7 million. Licence agree¬
ments have been made for fifteen to twenty types of British aero engines to be
built abroad, and a number of foreign aircraft have been designed to use British
aero engines and equipment. In 1957, the industry received orders from abroad for
military aircraft worth about £100 million.
The representative body of the United Kingdom aircraft industry is the Society
of British Aircraft Constructors, founded in 1916. Its annual exhibition and flying
display at Farnborough is one of the most important events of its kind.
Besides extensive research work by the industry, research on a substantial scale
on problems of aircraft and their engines is carried out by the Ministry of Supply,
largely at the Royal Aircraft Establishment and the National Gas Turbine Estab¬
lishment, both at Farnborough. This work is done in collaboration with the industry
and results are made known to manufacturers, who are in close touch with the
Ministry’s establishments. In addition, the National Physical Laboratory under¬
takes research on aerodynamics.
Railway Vehicles
Britain was the first country to build railways, and British engineers pioneered
railway development in most parts of the world.
Locomotive production in the United Kingdom is derived from two separate
sources. British Railways build and maintain locomotives and carriages and wagons,
exclusively for their own use, in their own workshops; private firms build loco¬
motives and carriages and wagons of all types for both home and export markets,
some for British Railways.
The industry is organised to meet the conditions resulting from the change-over
from steam to other forms of traction by most of the world’s railways. British
Railways, under their modernisation plans, have ordered nearly 400 main line diesel
locomotives, ranging from 800 to 3,300 h.p., from private firms.
In 1957, about 76,500 people were employed in making locomotives and 86,000
in making and repairing carriages and wagons. In the same year, only 79 steam
locomotives were made by the private firms, compared with 393 in 1954. Of the 793
INDUSTRY
321
diesel locomotives built in 1957 by private firms, 430 were for export. Ten per
cent of the 46,000 carriages and wagons built by private firms in 1957 were exported.
The total value of exports of railway vehicles in 1957 amounted to £42 million.

Notes on some of these industries are given below.
Cutlery and Flatware
At one time the production of cutlery and flatware was spread fairly widely
throughout England, but gradually it centred in the river valleys around Sheffield.
When steam replaced water as the motive power, the industry began to move in
towards the centre of Sheffield. The production units were very small and the
industry was built up on the high degree of skill of its craftsmen. T. he introduction
of modern machinery has largely replaced hand forging, and mass production
methods are now used by some firms in producing the cheaper range of products.
The highest quality wares, however, are still produced by skilled craftsmen.
Although in recent years there has been some increase in the size of the production
units, they remain mainly small, and, of the 400 establishments manufacturing
cutlery and flatware, some 250 still employ fewer than ten persons.
The annual output of the cutlery and flatware industry is now valued at about
£13 million, of which £5 million represents exports, mainly to Australia, the
United States and South Africa.
Hollow-ware
This industry is mainly located in the Midlands, although some production is
also carried out in Lancashire, Yorkshire, South Wales and London. Hollow-ware
production covers a wide range of goods and these are roughly divided into six
classes: wrought steel (including galvanised, enamelled and tinned), aluminium,
tinplate and terneplate, cast iron, copper, and other metals. There is, however, an
increasing development in the comparatively recent production of plastic hollow-
ware. There are some 250 establishments, of varying size, which are known to be
manufacturing domestic hollow-ware, e.g., saucepans and similar kitchen utensils.
The value of annual production approaches £20 million, of which about one-
fifth represents exports, mainly to Commonwealth countries overseas. Aluminium

BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
manufacturers comprise the largest single group, both in the value of total produc¬
tion and in exports.
Hand Tools
The manufacture of hand tools is one of the oldest industries of the United
Kingdom. From the time when prehistoric man first learned how to fashion tools
from iron, hand tools of an ever-increasing diversity and precision have been made
in Britain, and today over 400 different types—in many thousands of sizes and
patterns—are made in British factories.
There are, in the industry, about 300 establishments employing 10 or more
persons, and 450 smaller ones (the majority very small).
CHEMICALS
It is difficult to define the chemical industry since, with the increasing dependence
of industry generally on synthetic raw materials, its scope is continually widening.
But on the broadest definition the industry includes the manufacture of such
products as acids, alkalis, alcohols, industrial gases, explosives, fertilisers, dyestuffs,
soaps and detergents, petroleum chemicals, plastics materials, paints and pharma¬
ceuticals. Manufacturing these and other products, the chemical and allied trades
(other than mineral oil refining) employ some 400,000 people and contribute nearly
8 per cent of the total net output of all manufacturing industry. Exports of chemicals
are also substantial and have increased in value by nearly one-third, and in volume
by more than one-third, since 1954, amounting in 1957 to £267 million, or 8 per
cent of total United Kingdom exports. Capital investment in the industry totalled
nearly £700 million in the ten-year period 1948-57.
British pioneers made great contributions to the science of chemistry, as the
names of Robert Boyle, Joseph Priestley, Michael Faraday and John Dalton testify.
Contemporary British chemists who maintain the tradition include Sir Robert
Robinson (who has done outstanding work on vitamins and hormones), Dr. A. J. P
Martin and Dr. R. M. Synge (who were awarded the Nobel Prize in 1952 for their
work in developing chromatography, a method of separating chemical substances).
Professor Sir Cyril Hinshelwood (a joint-winner of the Nobel Prize in 1956 for his
work in the field of chemical kinetics, which also has practical applications in the
development of plastics), and Professor Sir Alexander Todd (awarded the Nobel
Prize in 1957 for his work on nucleotides).
The British chemical industry has expanded considerably during the present
century. More particularly, recent years have seen a rapid growth which has brought
the industry’s production up to nearly three times its pre-war level. The volume of
production nearly doubled between 1948 and 1957, and the number of employees
during that period rose by about one-fifth. This post-war expansion has been
most marked in two fields (apart from mineral oil refining)—production of plastics
materials generally, and the large-scale manufacture of a wide range of organic
chemicals from petroleum.
Heavy Chemicals and Dyestuffs
The heavy chemicals sector covers a wide range of acids, alkalis, alcohols,
industrial gases and other basic chemical substances, many of which are funda¬
mental to other branches of the chemical industry as well as to other industries.
One of the main products, sulphuric acid, is now manufactured to an increasing
extent from indigenous deposits of anhydrite (calcium sulphate) instead of from
INDUSTRY
323
imported sulphur or pyrites. Output of sulphuric acid in 1957, at 2-34 million tons,
was more than double the immediate pre-war figure.
Since the war, there has also been a greatly expanded production of raw materials
for the manufacture of synthetic detergents, while trichlorethylene has been in big
demand in the engineering trades for mechanical degreasing plants. Exports of
chemical elements and compounds, which in 1954, were valued at £50-6 million,
rose to £62-6 million in 1957; slightly more than half were inorganic products.
The largest markets are India and Australia followed by South Africa, Canada, the
United States and Western Germany. The dyestuffs industry also continues to add
to the already comprehensive range of its products, many of them developed from
pioneer British discoveries in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. Exports of
synthetic organic dyestuffs and pigments in 1957 totalled £11-3 million.
Petroleum Chemicals
The petroleum chemicals industry in Britain, based on the use of petroleum pro¬
ducts and refinery gases, is the largest in Europe. It provides raw materials for the
plastics, synthetic detergents, solvents, synthetic rubber and other branches of the
chemicals and associated industries. About £70 million was invested in plant and
fixed equipment for the industry in the post-war period to 1957, and almost as much
again is expected to be spent in the three years 60. The oil companies have a
large stake in the industry. Production totalled 274,000 tons in 1957, an increase of
some two-thirds since 1954. Plants under construction are designed to expand sub¬
stantially supplies of ethylene, styrene monomer, butadiene and other basic
materials.
Plastics
The first plastic, celluloid, originally known as Tarkesine’, was first produced in
Britain in 1865 by Alexander Parkes. Modern plastics originating in Britain include
‘Perspex’, polyethylene and silicones. (Silicones, which were discovered by Pro¬
fessor Kipping at Nottingham, were developed in the United States and have been
made in Britain since 1952.) Since 1939, there has been a very large increase in
the overall production of plastics materials. Expansion during the last few years
has been concentrated mainly on thermoplastic materials such as polyethylene (used
in cable coverings, packaging—notably for foodstuffs—and domestic mouldings),
polystyrene (a cheap non-inflammable material used for toys, light mouldings and,
more recently, for durable consumer goods), and polyvinyl chloride (known as
PVC, and made into industrial conveyor belting as well as a variety of other con¬
sumer goods such as raincoats and curtains). The first plastic-coated steel was
introduced in Britain in 1957.
In the decade 1948-57, net sales of plastics materials have multiplied more than
threefold to a total of 393,000 tons in 1957; compared with 1954, net sales have
increased by 44 per cent. The increase is most marked in the case of thermoplastic
materials, which in 1957 accounted for 223,000 tons, an increase of 72 per cent since
1954. Exports have also grown rapidly, and 106,000 tons, valued at £29-9 million,
were exported in 1957; an increase in value of 15 per cent over the previous year.
The industry is undertaking large extensions to its productive capacity and is also
spending considerable sums on development of improved materials.
Fertilisers
The production of fertilisers owes much to the pioneer work of the British
scientists, Sir John Lawes and Sir Joseph Gilbert, and the research now carried on
in the United Kingdom at Rothamsted, Hertfordshire, and at the Macaulay Insti-
324
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
tute, Aberdeen, is of world-wide importance. Output of nitrogenous fertilisers (in
terms of nitrogen content) in 1956-57 totalled 330,000 tons, nearly three times the
pre-war volume, and 345,000 tons of phosphatic fertilisers were produced (in terms
of phosphate content), more than twice the pre-war figure. Sales in the form of
compound fertilisers are increasing; production of these was 2-3 million tons (gross
weight) in 1956-57-
Exports of manufactured fertilisers, mainly in the form of ammonium sulphate,,
totalled £4*1 million in 1957, the principal markets being Ceylon and other Com¬
monwealth countries overseas.
Pesticides
Important British discoveries in recent years have led to major developments in
the production of selective weed-killers such as methyl chloro phenoxy acetic acid
(MCPA), and of insecticides based on benzenehexachloride (BHC). Overseas markets
take the major proportion of United Kingdom production of these and other well-
known pesticides such as DDT and systemic insecticides, and exports reached a
value of some £4-2 million in 1957. New products for plant protection, notably
new forms of synthetic hormones, are being developed.
Pharmaceuticals and Toilet Preparations
Many of the pharmaceutical products sold today have been introduced in the
past twenty years. These products include sulphonamides, antibiotics (e.g.,
penicillin, whose properties were first discovered by Sir Alexander Fleming in
1928), hormones, anti-malarial drugs (e.g., paludrine), liver extracts, anti¬
histamines and anti-tubercular drugs. Two British companies are making anti-polio¬
myelitis vaccines. Some £3 million a year is spent on research. About half of the
larger drug manufacturing firms in Britain are subsidiaries of overseas concerns.
Total exports of medicinal and pharmaceutical preparations and druggists’ wares
in 1957 reached the record level of £42-4 million.
The toilet preparations industry has shown a steady expansion since the war, and
exports were £28-7 million in value in 1957. Although many firms are subsidiaries of
American and French companies there are several wholly British firms whose
products have world-wide sales.
Paints
About 40,000 people are employed in the paint industry, which comprises some
600 establishments; about half the total production is accounted for by fewer than
40 establishments, each employing more than 200 persons.
In recent years the application of improved techniques has resulted in rapid
development, in particular the use of important new ranges of synthetic resins and
various types of titanium dioxide pigment. The value of direct exports of pigments
and paints rose by one-third between 1954 and 1957 to a total of £24-2 million, of
which nearly 10 per cent represented shipments to Canada, the largest single
market. One-third of the exports are in the form of ready-mixed paints, which
command a growing market overseas. The industry’s indirect contribution to
exports in the form of surface coatings for finished goods is also very considerable.
Isotopes and Radioactive Materials
Isotopes and radioactive materials, used in medicine, agriculture and industry,
are produced in the United Kingdom at the Atomic Energy Research Establishment
at Harwell and dispatched from there and from the Radiochemical Centre at
Amersham. Britain is the world’s largest exporter of these substances. In the year
INDUSTRY
325
ended 31st March, 1958, sales of isotopes were valued at about £650,000, some
60 per cent representing sales to overseas countries.
TEXTILES AND CLOTHING
The value of exports in the textiles and clothing group as a whole, including
manufactures of wool, cotton, linen, jute, silk, rayon and other man-made fibres,
lace, hosiery, woven apparel and carpets, amounted in 1957 t° about £381 million or
slightly over 11 per cent of total United Kingdom exports. Over 1-5 million people
were employed in these industries in 1957, including about 250,000 in the cotton
textile industry, 214,000 in the wool textile industry, 95,000 in rayon and other
man-made fibre production and weaving and in silk, 97,000 in textile finishing and
associated processes, 129,000 in hosiery and knitted goods, about 218,000 in other
textiles and over 500,000 in clothing (excluding footwear).
Cotton
Spinning and weaving of cotton for the making of fustian with a cotton weft and
linen warp began to assume importance in the United Kingdom in the sixteenth
century; but it was the invention of mechanical spinning and weaving in the second
half of the eighteenth century that led to cotton becoming Britain’s chief consumer
goods industry and cotton piece-goods its largest export during the nineteenth
century.
In the twentieth century, increasing foreign competition and the tendency of
many countries, notably India, to set up their own textile industry cut progressively
into British markets. During the second world war, numbers of mills were closed
and, though many were brought back into production in the early post-war years,
the industry has recently again been declining in size, and the labour force has
dropped to about 60 per cent of the 1937 level. It remains, however, one of Britain s
largest consumer goods industries, and plays an important part in the export trade.
Since the war a vigorous drive for quality and efficiency has been pressed forward
by the industry with support and assistance from the Government. Important in
this drive are the Cotton Board, a statutory body with the constitution and powers
of a Development Council, and the British Cotton Industry Research Association
(Shirley Institute), founded in 1919 f°r promoting scientific and technical research
in connection with cotton and its utilisation. The industry now uses a considerable
amount of man-made fibres as well as cotton.
Most of the industry is located in Lancashire, the north-east of the county being
mainly concerned with weaving and the south-east with spinning. Manchester is
the commercial centre. The Cotton Exchange, which deals in raw cotton, is situated
in Liverpool. _ . . ..
In 1957 there were about 150,000 persons employed in the spinning and doubling
section of the industry, and 106,000 in weaving. Two-thirds of the workers in the
industry are women. . 111
Production rose steadily from 194S until the end of i95L since when the level
of activity has been subject to marked fluctuations. The rising scale of duty-free
cloth imports is causing concern, but technical advances, notably the introduction
of new finishes for cotton goods with drip-dry, crease-resisting and other properties,
have helped to widen the industry’s markets. Production in 1957 was about 50 per
cent below the 1937 level, and consumption of raw cotton totalled some 339,000
tons as against about 639,000 tons in 1937. The United States in 1957 supplied
more than half Britain’s imports of raw cotton, and the second largest supplier
was the Sudan.
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
326
In 1957, the value of exports of yarn, thread and woven fabrics approached £90
million. About 456 million square yards of cotton fabrics valued at £60 million
were sent overseas, two-thirds to Commonwealth countries, the largest markets
being Australia, South Africa and New Zealand.
Wool
The United Kingdom wool textile industry, the largest in the world, is the most
ancient of Britain’s staple industries and has been an important source of wealth
since medieval times. There are two main branches—woollen and worsted. While
about 85 per cent of woollens and 95 per cent of worsteds are made in the West
Riding of Yorkshire, Scotland and the West of England have retained their impor¬
tance as specialised producers of high quality woollen cloth. The woollen side of
the industry is normally organised on a vertical basis, with each firm undertaking
the full process of manufacture from raw material to finished product, but for a
variety of reasons the worsted industry is organised horizontally—combing, spin¬
ning and weaving being done by separate firms. In recent years, however, there has
been a tendency in the worsted industry towards the formation of holding com¬
panies controlling a number of subsidiary combing, spinning and weaving firms,
all the worsted processes being carried out within the one organisation. Small firms,
employing fewer than 300 workers, predominate in the industry. Output reached a
post-war peak at the end of 1950, but this was followed by the recession of 1951-52,
which reached the lowest point in the middle of 1952. Production subsequently
recovered and output in some sections in 1957 exceeded the level of 1950. Towards
the end of 1957 a decline started, part of a world-wide decline in the wool textile
industry, and has continued into 1958.
Persons employed in the industry in 1957 numbered about 214,000, of whom
about 160,000 were directly engaged in production.
The United Kingdom’s annual consumption of wool is about 480 million lb.
(clean weight), equivalent to about 20 per cent of total world consumption (exclud¬
ing Eastern Europe and China). Blending with man-made fibres is being extended
rapidly and accounted for some 10 per cent of yarn consumption in 1957.
The wool industry remains one of Britain’s leading export industries, with about
one-quarter of its total output shipped abroad, despite the obstacles in the form of
widespread import restrictions which it has to face; the total value of exports of
wool tops, woollen and worsted yarns and woven fabrics in 1957 was about £140
million, of which over £30 million represented exports to the United States and
Canada. In addition, there were considerable exports of wool in other forms,
including carpets and clothing.
Research is carried on mainly by the Wool Industries Research Association,
which is financed partly by a statutory levy on the industry and partly by a grant
from the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research.
The National Wool Textile Corporation, which is financed by a statutory levy on
the industry, is responsible for assistance to exporters and for developing overseas
markets.
Man-made Fibres
Rayon is produced from cellulose, either in the form of woodpulp or cotton
Enters. Its early development took place to a large extent in Britain. Production is
spread throughout the Midlands and Lancashire, with outposts in other areas.
There are seven companies engaged in the production of rayon, four producing
only viscose, two producing only acetate, and one both viscose and acetate.
INDUSTRY 327
Technical problems are studied at the research station of the British Rayon
Research Association at Wythenshawe, Manchester.
Nylon is produced from a combination of chemical substances, most of which
are obtained from indigenous raw materials. It was introduced in the United States
in 1938 and came into use in Britain in the second world war for parachutes. It is
now used extensively for clothing fabrics and stockings and also has important
industrial uses, including the manufacture of tyre cords, ropes and conveyor belts.
Nylon is produced on a large scale at Pontypool, in South Wales, and at Doncaster,
in Yorkshire.
‘ Terylene’ polyester fibre, a product of research in the laboratories of the Calico
Printers’ Association, Manchester, is made on a large scale at Wilton, Yorkshire,
by Imperial Chemical Industries Ltd. Annual productive capacity is being in¬
creased from 22 to 30 million pounds weight by i959> and it is planned to construct
a new plant, also at Wilton, which will enable annual production to reach 50 million
pounds. A plant for the manufacture of ‘Terylene’ has been set up in Canada, and
the British patent holders have licensed its manufacture in other countries,
including France, the German Federal Republic, Italy, the Netherlands, and Japan.
‘Fibrolane’ is a British-made protein fibre, with wool-like properties, which is
available on a commercial scale; it is derived from casein. Other man-made fibres
at present produced in Britain include 'Courlene' (a polythene fibre), and ‘Alginate
(derived from seaweed).
‘Courtelle,) an acrylic fibre, is being produced on a small scale at Coventry, and
a full-scale plant is to start production at Grimsby, in Lincolnshire, early in 1959-
A plant to manufacture another acrylic fibre ‘ylcn'/an’ will begin operating at
Coleraine, in Northern Ireland, early in 1959 and is expected to reach full production
of 10 million lb. a year in i960.
Since the advent of rayon in its various forms and, more recently, of the new
man-made fibres, British textile manufacturers have been developing a number of
ways of blending these with natural fibres and with each other. By this means they
can produce economically fabrics and garments with attractive and useful new
combinations of texture, colour, and finish, and with moisture-absorbent, hard-
wearing, drip-dry and crease-resisting properties.
Other Textiles
Linen has been made in Britain for more than a thousand years and it is believed
that the art of linen weaving was already being practised during the seventh
century. Today it is an industry mainly of small firms, chiefly in Northern Ireland
(the greatest linen manufacturing region in the world), with most of the remainder
in Scotland. The principal raw material of the industry is flax, which is mainly
imported (the chief supplier is Belgium), but considerable quantities of man-made
fibres and cotton are also used, and a certain amount of soft hemp and jute, particu¬
larly in Scotland. Broadly speaking, the Northern Ireland industry concentrates on
the lighter types of fabrics, while in Scotland production is largely, but not
exclusively, of coarse linens and canvas. Technical problems are investigated by
the Research Institute of the Linen Industry Research Association, formed in i9I9-
Exports were valued at £i7‘4- million in i957> including £io'3 million worth of
linen fabrics, £2-5 million of flax linen yarns and £i*i million of damask table linen.
Jute is manufactured on a large scale in Dundee the centre of the world s
oldest jute industry. About 40 per cent of jute yam production is utilised in the
manufacture of carpets, cordage, ropes and other products. The balance is woven
Y

into fabrics for a wide range of uses, but principally for packaging material. About
20,000 workers are employed. Exports in 1957 totalled about £5 million.
Research facilities are concentrated at the laboratories of the British Jute Trade
Research Association. About £10 million has been spent on a post-war re-equipment
programme.
Silk exports were valued at about £1 million in 1957. Raw silk is supplied mainly
from Japan, China and Italy.
Clothing
The clothing industry in Britain, the largest in Europe, is one of the most
important employers of labour with more than 500,000 workers, three-quarters of
whom are women and girls. It had an annual output of about £530 million in
1956. Although the industry is highly mechanised—only in the women’s outerwear
section and in the quality fashion trade do tailors and dressmakers predominate—
the typical firm is small. Five-sixths of the concerns in the industry employ fewer
than 100 workers. The principal centres for manufacturing are London, Leeds and
Manchester. Many of the newest factories are located in Development Areas.

Notes on some of these industries are given below.
Bread and Flour Confectionery
The average weekly household consumption of bread per head of population in
Great Britain is just over 3 J pounds. In England and Wales particularly, the small
‘family’ type of baker, producing bread by hand or by semi-mechanical methods,
is still numerous, but there is an increasing trend towards large-scale production
in fully mechanised bakeries. The four largest bakeries account for about 50 per cent
of total production and specialise in the supply of sliced and wrapped bread. In the
smaller bakeries, numbering about 12,000, flour confectionery is usually allied to
bread production but there are many large specialist manufacturers, particularly of
slab cake.
INDUSTRY
329
Cocoa, Chocolate and Sugar Confectionery
The chocolate and sugar confectionery industry is composed of a small number
of very large manufacturers and many hundreds of medium-sized and smaller
manufacturers. The industry’s products are highly competitive and several are
heavily advertised. Over 95 per cent of the production of chocolate and sugar
confectionery is in the hands of about 300 firms, while the more specialist products
—cocoa powder, cocoa butter and chocolate covering—are manufactured by about
40 firms.
The main ingredients used by the industry are sugar, cocoa beans, glucose, milk,
nuts and fats. Production of chocolate and sugar confectionery for home and export
sale totalled about 655,000 tons in 1957. There are virtually no restrictions on
imports of chocolate and confectionery, but these totalled less than 10,000 tons in
1957. Consumption of chocolate and confectionery in the United Kingdom is far
higher than in any other country, being equivalent to nearly 8| oz. per head per
week in 1957, compared with 7 oz. per head before the war. In i955> the total value
of exports of chocolate, sugar confectionery and cocoa products reached a record
level of over £19 million. In 1957, exports of sugar confectionery rose further and
those of chocolate were fully maintained, but there was a fall in exports of other
cocoa products, giving a total value for all exports of confectionery of £18-4 million
(more than one-third going to dollar markets). Manufacturers’ total annual turn¬
over is well over £200 million.
Whisky
Scotch whisky, which was first distilled at least as long ago as the fifteenth
century, enjoys world-wide popularity. Modern whiskies are blends of twenty or
more different kinds, some made from malted barley, some from other grains.
Whisky requires several years to mature, and the 47'5 million proof gallons (a
record) produced in 1957 will not be on sale for some years. Whisky is one of the
United Kingdom’s largest dollar earners; more than half the annual exports, which
in 1957 attained the highest level so far recorded of £52-1 million, are shipped to the
United States. Other valuable markets are Canada and other Commonwealth
countries, and Venezuela.
Brewing and Malting
Brewing. There are some 420 separate breweries located throughout the United
Kingdom, of which the main centres are London, south Lancashire, Burton-on-
Trent (Staffordshire), Birmingham, and Edinburgh. In the main, brewers distribute
their beer for consumption within 30 miles of the brewery, but some of the largest
firms send their beer all over the country. Much of the beer is consumed in
draught, but in recent years the demand for bottled beer has increased and is now
probably as much as one-third of total consumption. Bottling is carried out by both
brewers and independent bottling establishments. The industry s raw materials are
malt (chiefly made from home-grown barley), sugar and hops. Consumption of beer
has declined appreciably from the exceptional levels of the immediate post-war
years; the drop has, however, been halted since ipS1* Canned beer is becoming
increasingly popular; output in 1957 was estimated at about 80 million cans. The
excise duty on beer accounts for about half the retail price. In the year ended 3
March, 1958, duty of £261 million was paid on 25-4 million bulk barrels. Since the
war the industry has maintained a sizable export trade, which in 1957 was valued at
£2-7 million.
Malting. There are in the United Kingdom several hundred malting units. Some
of these are operated by brewers who make all or part of their own malt. The
33°
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
remainder are operated by maltsters whose product is sold principally to brewers at
home and abroad, but some malt is supplied to distillers and vinegar brewers, and
also to the manufacturers of malt extract for use in the baking, confectionery and
textile industries. The popularity of British malt has been established with brewers
throughout the world, and in 1957 malt exports were valued at £1-7 million.
These malting units are mainly situated in the barley-growing areas which lie east
of a line drawn from Edinburgh, through Burton-on-Trent (Staffordshire), to Lyme
Regis (Dorset).
Malting usually takes place in the cooler months following the harvest, but with
the aid of air-conditioning plant and other modem developments some units can
operate throughout the year. Grain is the only raw material used by the industry—
chiefly home-grown barley especially grown for the purpose.
Tobacco
The United Kingdom tobacco industry manufactures almost all the cigarettes
and other tobacco goods sold in the country. In 1957, personal expenditure on these
goods amounted to nearly £980 million (of which over two-thirds was tax revenue)
and, in addition, exports worth over £22-3 million (some 90 per cent of which
were cigarettes) were shipped to a large number of overseas markets. The main
centres of production are in and around Bristol, Liverpool, London, Manchester,
Newcastle, Nottingham, Glasgow and Belfast.
The tobacco industry uses over 300 million lb. annually of raw tobacco, all of
which is imported. The main sources are the United States, Rhodesia, India and
Canada, in that order. Most of this tobacco goes to make cigarettes (nearly seven-
eighths) and pipe and cigarette tobaccos. There is also some production of cigars
and snuff; cigars, chiefly Cuban, Jamaican and Dutch, are also imported.

Notes on some of these industries are given below.
Brickmaking
Introduced by the Romans, brickmaking is one of Britain’s oldest industries,
and something like 2,000 different varieties of building bricks are produced in the
INDUSTRY
331
United Kingdom today. These are made in over 1,000 works which range from
small seasonal yards using traditional hand methods to highly mechanised plants,
some of which are among the largest and most efficient of their kind in the world.
The industry has made a vigorous recovery from the reduced activity enforced on
it during the war years, and its total output now exceeds 7,000 million bricks a year.
Refractories
Refractories are essential in the operation of blast furnaces, steel furnaces and
other metallic furnaces and are used extensively in many other industries, including
non-ferrous metals, ceramics, glassware and chemicals, in nuclear energy and jet
propulsion. The chief raw materials required for their manufacture are indigenous
except for magnesite (which is obtained partly from overseas and partly from
production of sea-water magnesia) and chrome ore.
The chief centres of the industry are in the Midlands, west Yorkshire, north¬
east England, Scotland, and Wales. Production has averaged about 2 million tons
a year since 1948, mainly for home use. Exports of refractory construction materials
in 1957 were valued at about £4-3 million, as compared with £2-8 million in 1955.
Domestic Pottery
The domestic pottery industry is one of the oldest craft industries in Britain;
the making of domestic pottery dates back to before the Roman occupation. The
chief raw materials, china clay, ball clay and china stone, come from Devon,
Cornwall and Dorset, where known deposits of high quality are expected to last for
at least 100 years.
The Stoke-on-Trent area in Staffordshire, comprising the six towns of Stoke,
Burslem, Tunstall, Hanley, Fenton and Longton, is the centre of the industry and
contributes between 75 and 80 per cent of total production. Other important
factories are at Worcester, Derby, Bristol and Poole. The industry employs about
35,000 workers, of whom more than half are engaged in the production of table
and ornamental ware.
Of the £29 million worth of pottery produced in 1957, nearly £13 million worth
was for export. About three-quarters of bone china exports go to Canada and the
United States, and the largest markets for decorated earthenware are Canada,
Australia and the United States.
The modern industry benefits from a tradition of good design and craftsmanship
(made world-famous by a long line of great British potters) which, with the
excellent technical qualities of its products, is the basis of the large overseas and
domestic demand for its products. Among the famous makes of British pottery are:
Wedgwood, Spode, Royal Worcester, Royal Doulton and Royal Crown Derby.
Glass
Britain has a large and efficient glass industry, the third largest in the world,
with a wide diversity of products. The section of the industry devoted to the
manufacture of plate and sheet glass in their various forms is organised for quantity
production, and the development of modern methods has enabled the industry to
cater for an increasing range of requirements. Glass can now be supplied in sheets
of great size and can be made almost unbreakable. Its use for internal decoration
and as a finish for internal and external walls has greatly increased in recent years.
Large quantities of safety glass are produced for the motor industry.
Rapid technical progress has led to the large-scale production of tubular glass,
optical glass and also glass insulators for use in electricity transmission. Glass
fibres, used for insulating purposes and as reinforcement for plastics, are thought
332
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
to offer great scope for further development. The advance of the industry is shown
by the increase in exports of all glassware (including plate and sheet glass) from a
negligible level in 1938 to £16-3 million in 1957; this total included £9 million
worth of plate and sheet glass.
A traditional product is hand-made lead-crystal glassware of very high quality;
a high proportion of output is exported, mostly to North America, Australia, South
Africa and New Zealand.
Collective research is undertaken by the British Glass Industry Research Asso¬
ciation, and much research work is also carried on by the Department of Glass
Technology at Sheffield University, the first of its kind in the world.
Cement
The cement industry of the United Kingdom is chiefly concerned with the
manufacture of Portland Cement. Invented by Joseph Aspdin and patented in 1824,
this material and the methods of its production have been the subject of continuous
technical improvement and intensive research. The capacity of the industry has
increased substantially since the war to meet the growing demands of the building
industry. Annual output, which reached 7*7 million tons in 1938, had risen to
12-8 million tons by 1956, falling back to n-8 million tons in 1957, valued at more
than £70 million. One group of companies is responsible for about two-thirds of
total output. In 1957, 1-33 million tons (valued at £7-4 million) were exported,
compared with a peak total of 2-06 million tons in 1952.
Jewellery, Gold and Silver Ware
The making of jewellery, gold and silver ware is an industry in which British
craftsmen are heirs to a great tradition. The quality of the metal in gold and silver
wares made or sold in the United Kingdom is guaranteed by a ‘hall-mark’. The
law requires that gold and silver plate shall not be sold until it has been hall-marked
at one of the Assay Offices in London, Birmingham, Chester, Sheffield, Edinburgh
and Glasgow.
The importance of maintaining definite standards of fineness for wares of gold
and silver has always been recognised, and the Goldsmiths’ Company in London has
carried out the assay and hall-marking of such wares since 1327 when Edward III
gave the Company its first charter.
Toys
The toy industry in Britain, now thought to be the largest in Europe, has
expanded greatly in the last ten years. There are over 300 manufacturers, mostly
small in size, in the industry, with a total annual output of almost £36 million, of
which nearly a quarter is exported. Current trends are towards increased production
of small-scale precision models of equipment and vehicles and a greater use of
plastic materials.
Leather
Leather tanning is one of Britain’s oldest industries. Tanneries are situated in
most parts of Britain, but there are important concentrations in Lancashire, York¬
shire, the North Midlands and the London area. Many different types of leather
are produced, ranging from the heavy types produced for industrial uses, such as
machinery belting, to sole leather and high quality decorative leather, used for high
fashion footwear and fancy leather goods.
In 1957, about 34,000 persons were employed in the leather tanning and dressing
industry, and 23,500 in the leather goods industries. The United Kingdom is the
INDUSTRY
333
world’s leading leather exporter, with exports valued in 1957 at £14-9 million, of
which £4-5 million worth went to North America and £2-i million to Western
Germany. Research into tanning processes and the improvement in the quality of
finished leather is undertaken by the Leather Manufacturers’ Research Association.
Leather Footwear
The British footwear industry is among the most important in the world, and
factories are located throughout the United Kingdom. Some areas concentrate on
production of particular types, e.g., the Rossendale Valley region of Lancashire for
slippers, Bristol for heavy industrial footwear for miners and agricultural workers,
Northampton for men’s and youths’ footwear, and Leicester for women’s and girls’
shoes. There are about 1,000 firms in the leather footwear industry, and nearly
half the total output comes from firms with fewer than 200 employees. The British
Boot, Shoe and Allied Trades Research Association enjoys a world-wide reputation
in all matters connected with shoemaking.
About 119,000 persons are employed in the manufacture of leather footwear, and
output of boots and shoes, mainly of leather, in 1957 totalled some 143 million pairs.
The United Kingdom is the world’s largest exporter of leather footwear, and in
1957, exports of footwear, mainly of leather, reached a record level of £11 -2 million,
an increase of nearly 8 per cent over 1956. The United States took about one-sixth
of footwear exports (except rubber footwear) in 1957*
Paper and Board
The manufacture of paper in Great Britain was not firmly established until 1678,
but records show that some paper was produced as far back as the year 1492.
Today, many different materials are used in the manufacture of paper and board,
the most important being woodpulp, esparto grass, straw, waste of hemp, flax and
jute, rags and waste paper; the consumption of these materials now totals some
3-8 million tons a year, of which nearly two-thirds comes from abroad. The balance
consists mainly of waste paper recovered from domestic sources.
Total production in 1957 of all types of paper and board (including newsprint)
amounted to 3 -4 million tons—the highest ever reached—compared with a pre-war
figure of 2-6 million tons. Of this, newsprint accounted for 653,000 tons as against
800,000 tons pre-war. Exports for the same period amounted to 234,000 tons,
valued at £27 million, including 122,000 tons of newsprint, valued at £7-5 million.
The bulk of the export trade is to sterling area countries, mainly Australia, South
Africa, New Zealand, India and the Irish Republic.
During the second world war many paper-making machines were lost through
enemy action, but the installation of new machinery and plant resulted in the rapid
recovery of the industry. Today, the industry comprises some 200 mills producing
almost every type of paper and board, including the world’s largest paper machine,
producing a web of newsprint 302 inches wide. There are also many firms engaged
in the conversion of paper and board for various purposes. In addition, the industry
has considerable interests abroad, with pulp and paper producing mills in the
United States, Canada and other parts of the Commonwealth, and in the Scandi¬
navian countries.
Printing and Publishing
Printing is essentially an industry of small enterprises. At least two-thirds of the
firms have fewer than 25 employees. The main sections of the industry are concen¬
trated in the larger towns, notably London, although firms engaged in more general
printing are also located in smaller centres. The shortage of skilled workers has
334
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
led firms to introduce the latest developments in high-speed printing equipment,
including electronic engraving machines and advanced processes of photographic
reproduction.
In 1957, total sales of books amounted to about £60 million. Exports reached
the record level of over £22 million. Australia and the United States are the most
important overseas markets.
Rubber
The United Kingdom rubber manufacturing industry is the oldest in the world,
dating from 1819 when Hancock, the inventor of the first method of processing
raw rubber on a commercial scale, set up a factory in London. He afterwards
collaborated with Macintosh, the inventor of water-proof garments, and it was
another Scotsman, Dunlop, who in 1888 devised the pneumatic tyre as it is now
used. At the present day, tyres and tubes represent more than half the total output
of the industry. More recently, British firms have pioneered cellular rubber and
latex foam products, and they also make a great variety of other rubber manu¬
factures, such as rubber footwear, belting, cables, hose and thread.
The industry is second in size only to that of the United States and uses 11 per
cent of the world’s total consumption of natural and synthetic rubber. There are
some 800 firms located throughout the country and, in 1957, their consumption of
rubber totalled 239,000 tons. Exports of manufactured goods in the same year
were valued at £42 million, two-thirds in the form of tyres and tubes. This figure
does not take into account the large indirect exports on motor vehicles.
About one-quarter of the industry’s raw material needs consists of synthetic
rubber, which until recently was available only from the dollar area, but is now
being produced in Britain. Some small plants came into operation in 1956 and 1957,
and in 1958 the International Synthetic Rubber Company’s plant at Pawley, near
Southampton, started production. Annual productive capacity amounts to 50,000
tons of styrene-butadiene rubber.
Although the industry is highly mechanised there is still room for craftsmanship
as in the building of a tyre, where perfect quality depends on the skill of the
individual. To maintain the technical superiority of the industry, advanced experi¬
mental work is carried out at the Shrewsbury laboratories of the Research
Association of British Rubber Manufacturers.
X. TRANSPORT AND
COMMUNICATIONS
SHIPPING
About 18 per cent of the world’s shipping tonnage of 100 gross tons and over is
registered in the United Kingdom, which has the largest merchant marine in active
employment. A greater tonnage—26 million—is registered in the United States but
over half of this is in the Reserve Fleet. United Kingdom ships are estimated to
carry nearly one-quarter of the world’s international sea-borne traffic in passengers
and goods, and ply regularly on the routes linking the countries of the Common¬
wealth and also to most of the main ports throughout the world. The amount
of the United Kingdom’s own sea-borne trade carried in British ships at the
present time is not known exactly, but it seems likely that about 60 per cent
of its imports and 75 per cent of its exports, by value, are carried in British
registered ships. The United Kingdom balance of payments figures show that
shipping provides one of the biggest net contributions to the balance of pay¬
ments; in the year ended December 1957 it was £115 million. This figure does not,
however, represent the actual net overseas earnings of United Kingdom shipping
since it excludes tanker earnings and includes some of the disbursements of foreign
ships in United Kingdom ports and the payments for the use of foreign ships.
The last survey, made in 1952, of the total net overseas earnings by all types of
United Kingdom shipping gave a figure of £221 million.
THE MERCHANT FLEET
At 30th June, 1957, a total of 19-9 million gross tons of merchant shipping
(steam and motor vessels of 100 gross tons and over) was registered in the United
Kingdom. In 1939 the tonnage was 17-9 million and in 1930 was at its highest
level of 20-3 million.
Notable trends in the composition of the merchant fleet in recent years have been
the reduction of tramp tonnage, the growth of tanker tonnage, the increasing size
of tankers, and the commissioning of vessels specially built to carry ore, sugar and
other commodities in bulk. Including Admiralty and other tankers, the United
Kingdom accounts for over 5'5 million gross tons or nearly 19 per cent of the
world’s total tanker tonnage.
Propulsion
The amount of coal-fired tonnage has fallen in recent years to less than one
million gross tons. Oil has taken the place of coal in steamships, while steam has
continued to give place to the diesel engine, about 45 per cent of all tonnage being
diesel-driven in 1957. In recent years, experiments have been made in the use of
gas turbines in ships. In March I952> the first crossing of the Atlantic using this
form of propulsion was made by the tanker Auris, which was expected to put to sea
again towards the end of 1958 with new and improved gas turbines. The latest
development is the undertaking of research into the application of nuclear propulsion
to merchant ships, with Government sponsorship and with the co-operation of the
335
336
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
shipowning, shipbuilding and marine engineering industries; several large nuclear-
powered tankers are being planned by groups of private firms.
Age and Size
Some 23 per cent of the total gross tonnage is under 5 years old and a further
21 per cent is between 5 and 9 years old. Taking the tanker fleet separately, as
much as 35 per cent is under 5 years old and a further 23 per cent is from 5 to 9
years old. An analysis of the merchant fleet by size is given in Table 23.

The four ships of 30,000 gross tons and over are the Queen Elizabeth (83,673 g.t.),
the Queen Mary (81,237 g.t.), the Mauretania (35,673 g.t.), and the Caronia
(34»I73 g-t-) all operating on transatlantic passenger services. Three passenger liners
of over 30,000 g.t. were on order in June 1958. Two, the Canberra (45,000 g.t.)
and the Oriana (40,000 g.t.) are being built for the service from the United
Kingdom to Australia and across the Pacific to North America; the third, the
Windsor Castle (38,000 g.t.), is being built for the service between the United
Kingdom and South Africa.
Employment of Shipping
The 19-9 million gross tons of shipping on the United Kingdom register at June
1957 included 16-9 million gross tons of trading vessels owned and registered in the
United Kingdom1; the usual employment of this fleet has been analysed by the
1 The remaining 3 million gross tons included fishing vessels, tugs, river and estuary
craft, Admiralty vessels (mostly tankers) not usually engaged in the commercial carriage
of cargo, and 1 • 2 million gross tons of shipping registered in the United Kingdom but
owned in other Commonwealth countries; this last figure included nearly half a million
gross tons of tankers.
TRANSPORT AND COMMUNICATIONS
337
"United Kingdom Chamber of Shipping as follows: 2-6 million gross tons were
employed as ocean-going passenger-cargo liners; 6-2 million gross tons as ocean¬
going cargo liners; 2-5 million gross tons as ocean-going tramps; 4-4 million gross
tons as ocean-going tankers; and 1-2 million gross tons as coasting and home trade.
SHIPOWNERS
About half of British-owned shipping registered in the United Kingdom consists
of ocean-going passenger-cargo and cargo liners, mostly the latter. Practically all
these ships are owned by large liner companies or groups of liner companies whose
names are known throughout the world. Many of them operate wide networks of
scheduled freight and passenger services which, between them, cover every ocean.
The 2-5 million gross tons of ocean-going tramp ships are operated by a large
number of private owners, some of them having only a small number of ships and
some with only one ship.
About two-thirds of the total United Kingdom tanker fleet belongs to the oil
companies, although there are a few important independent United Kingdom
tanker-owning companies. A new type of specialised bulk carrier—the ore-carrier—
is now coming into use on a substantial scale; some of the ore-carriers are partly
owned by companies in the steel industry, but are managed and operated by
shipping companies.
Unlike ship-owning companies in many countries, the United Kingdom ship¬
owners receive no subsidies or direct financial assistance from the Government.
The Government has, however, recognised that the United Kingdom shipping
industry is faced with severe competition in a world market (especially from ships
sailing under ‘flags of convenience’ with small tax liabilities and with no obligation
to maintain proper standards of employment) and that the industry has found it
increasingly difficult to build up finance for the replacement of obsolete ships.
Under the Finance Act, 1956, the shipping industry was the only industry allowed
to retain the 20 per cent investment allowance in respect of taxation, and the
allowance was raised to 40 per cent in 1957 f°r capital expenditure on the construc¬
tion of new ships. In June 1958, it was announced that all Government restrictions
on the sources from which the shipping industry might raise capital within the
United Kingdom had been removed.
SHIPPING ORGANISATIONS
The main organisations concerned with the activities, interests and common
problems of the industry are as follows:
The Corporation of Lloyd's
This body, which was founded in the seventeenth century, is a society of under¬
writers whose main business is marine insurance.
Lloyd's Register of Shipping
Lloyd’s Register is an organisation, distinct from the Corporation, which surveys
and classifies ships with particular regard to their safety and operational efficiency.
It will accept responsibility for surveying and giving technical advice on vessels of
all flags from the initial stages of building, at regular intervals during their service,
and after casualties. A satisfactory Lloyd’s classification is a guarantee to an under¬
writer that he may accept the risk of a vessel, and this forms a strong link between
the Register and the Corporation of Lloyd’s (see also p. 423)-
338
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Shipowners’ Organisations
The representative bodies speaking for shipowners generally (excluding, for the
most part, owners of fishing vessels) are the Chamber of Shipping and the Liverpool
Steamship Owners’ Association. The General Council of British Shipping co-ordinates,
the views of the shipping industry as a whole on all matters of major policy.
There are a number of local associations of shipowners centred around the main
port areas, for example, the Bristol Steamship Owners’ Association, the London
General Shipowners’ Society, and the North of England Shipowners’ Association.
Others represent companies specialising in a particular trade or type of cargo.
Employers’ Organisations
The Shipping Federation and the Employers’ Association of the Port of Liverpool
are the employers’ organisations concerned with labour relations and the regula¬
tion of employment throughout the Merchant Navy. They are responsible for the
administration of the Merchant Navy Established Service Scheme, under which
shipowners engaging crews for ships of 200 gross tons and above engage them
through the Merchant Navy Establishment Administration unless they are prepared
to offer two-year Company Service contracts. The Shipping Federation is also
responsible for the day-to-day operation of the National Sea Training Schools set
up for the purpose of training ratings for the deck and catering departments and
as firemen.
Seafarers’ Organisations
Shipmasters are represented by the Mercantile Marine Service Association; navi¬
gating officers, engineer officers, apprentices, cadets, pursers and ships’ surgeons by
the Merchant Navy and Airline Officers’ Association; and radio officers by the Radio
Officers’ Union. Some uncertificated engineer officers are represented by the
Amalgamated Engineering Union. The interests of the deck, engine-room and
catering ratings are represented by the National Union of Seamen.
The National Maritime Board
The National Maritime Board is composed of equal numbers of representatives
of the shipowners and seafarers and is responsible for all negotiations of wages and
conditions of service in the Merchant Navy, although, except by special arrange¬
ment, National Maritime Board Agreements do not apply to vessels under 200
gross tons, or to certain other ships, including tugs and salvage vessels. Detailed
working of the Board is carried on by a number of ‘panels’ representing the various
interests of those forming the seafarers’ part of the Board.
Conferences
British shipping companies operating liners have associated with each other and
with the companies of other countries operating on the same routes in a series of
‘conferences’ designed to secure standardisation and stability of rates, and to
maintain frequency and regularity of services. The essential principle of a confer¬
ence is the establishment of a common tariff of freight rates or passenger fares from
each port of departure. Each conference meets from time to time to review and
revise existing rates, or to compile new ones. Some of the conferences may be con¬
nected by rate agreements, or may have joined together to form wider groupings.
The Baltic Exchange
The Baltic Mercantile and Shipping Exchange, which originated in one of
London’s seventeenth-century coffee houses, is the world’s largest market for the
TRANSPORT AND COMMUNICATIONS
339
chartering of ships of all nationalities. Shipbrokers and merchants’ representatives
meet here to arrange the chartering of ships, or space in ships, for the carriage of all
kinds of goods to and from all parts of the world. Other classes of business trans¬
acted on the Baltic include the chartering of air transport (see p. 367) and the
purchase and sale of grain and oilseeds.
RELATIONS WITH THE GOVERNMENT
The Ministry of Transport and Civil Aviation is the Government Department
responsible for most matters connected with merchant shipping. Under the
Merchant Shipping Act of 1894 and subsequent legislation it administers many
regulations for marine safety and welfare, for instance: certifying the load-line (or
Plimsoll line) that ensures that a ship is not overloaded; ensuring that standards of
safety are observed in ship construction; ensuring the provision of adequate life¬
saving, fire-fighting and radio equipment; and dealing with the discipline, pro¬
fessional standards, health and accommodation of seamen. Most of the work which
these responsibilities entail is carried out by the Marine Survey and Mercantile
Marine Officers at the ports. There is also a Registrar-General of Shipping and
Seamen in whose office at Cardiff a complete record of all British ships and seamen
is kept. The Ministry is represented on the Merchant Navy Welfare Board (see
p. 341) and on the Merchant Navy Training Board (see p. 340). It fosters the
development and use of modern navigational aids.
The Ministry is responsible for transporting by sea the men and materials of the
armed forces and looks after ships that it owns or has chartered. It is also con¬
cerned with general shipping policy and the strategic implications of the Merchant
Navy. The Ministry maintains close liaison with the shipping industry on such
matters and on problems relating to imports and exports and special passenger
requirements.
Abroad, certain parts of the Merchant Shipping Acts, in particular those provi¬
sions dealing with the engagement and discharge of crews outside the United King¬
dom, are administered by H.M. Consuls and by officers of the Commonwealth and
Colonial Governments.
The United Kingdom is a party to the International Convention for the Preven¬
tion of the Pollution of the Sea by Oil which came into force on 26th July, 1958.
The nations which have ratified this convention agree to prohibit their national fleets
from discharging oil within 50 miles of any coast and also in extensive areas of the
Atlantic Ocean and the North Sea. British ships registered in the United Kingdom
were already prohibited from discharging oil within a wide zone of the sea around
the United Kingdom under the Oil in Navigable Waters Act, i955> which is
administered by the Ministry. The discharge of oil from any source into United
Kingdom territorial waters and harbours was first prohibited in 1922.
The United Kingdom is a member of the United Nations Intergovernmental
Maritime Consultative Organisation (IMCO), whose first assembly is to be held
in London in January 1959.
Lighthouses, Pilotage and Rescue
The Ministry of Transport and Civil Aviation administers the Coastguard Ser¬
vice. This is primarily a life-saving organisation which keeps watch at danger points
around the coast for vessels in distress and renders assistance either by means of
rocket life-saving apparatus or by informing other authorities who may be in a
position to give help. There is close liaison between the Coastguard Service and the
Royal National Lifeboat Institution. The latter maintains lifeboats around the
coast of the United Kingdom; it is supported entirely by voluntary subscriptions,
34°
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
and depends largely for its operation on voluntary workers. Lifeboats were launched
716 times in 1957, and rescued 609 people.
The general lighthouse authority for England and Wales, the Channel Islands
and Gibraltar is the Corporation of Trinity House, which received its first Royal
Charter in the sixteenth century and is administered by a Board of ten Elder
Brethren elected from the Royal Navy and the Merchant Navy. It is also the chief
pilotage authority in the United Kingdom, having the management of all matters
relating to pilots and pilotage in the London area, the English Channel and certain
other coastal districts of the United Kingdom. Lighthouses in Scotland and Ireland
are the responsibility respectively of the Commissioners of Northern Lighthouses
and the Commissioners of Irish Lights. The Ministry of Transport and Civil
Aviation also has certain responsibilities in connection with lighthouses and pilotage.
THE MERCHANT NAVY
Strength
The number of masters, officers and men serving in December 1957 in British
ships on articles of agreement opened or closed in the United Kingdom was about
152,000. In addition, there were about 49,000 seamen serving in United Kingdom
registered ships on articles opened or closed overseas.
Training
Nautical training in the United Kingdom has two distinct objectives, first to give
intending entrants into the Merchant Navy an introductory training before going
to sea—this is commonly known as ‘pre-sea training’—and secondly, to prepare
those who have already performed the requisite sea-service, qualifying them for
admission to the examinations, for the various statutory and other certificates
granted by the Ministry of Transport and Civil Aviation.
The Merchant Navy Training Board promotes the instruction and studies at sea
of apprentices and cadets who are preparing for their examinations for certificates
of competency as second mate.
The Ministry of Transport and Civil Aviation holds examinations for, and issues
certificates of competency to, ships’ officers as master, first mate and second mate
of foreign-going ships, or master and mate of home trade ships and as first class
engineer and second class engineer. Officers may not normally serve on board ships
in these grades unless they hold the appropriate, or a higher, certificate.
Pre-sea training is not compulsory for those who go to sea as apprentices or
cadets but most shipping companies will, in practice, accept only those who have
undergone such a course. There are a number of residential and non-residential
training establishments.
Sea-going engineer officers usually receive their basic training in engineering by
serving a suitable apprenticeship of not less than four years in engineering work¬
shops ashore, although part of this period may be spent at approved courses in
mechanical engineering. An alternative scheme of training has, however, recently
been introduced under which shipping companies themselves select apprentices
for a special course of training consisting of a two-year diploma course in a techni¬
cal college, followed by eighteen months’ training at sea and finally twelve months’
training in an engineering workshop ashore. Sea-going engineer officers are first
employed as junior engineers: they become eligible to take examinations for second
and first class certificates of competency after performing periods of qualifying sea
service.
TRANSPORT AND COMMUNICATIONS
341
Radio officers are required to hold certificates of proficiency in wireless tele¬
graphy issued by the Postmaster General on the results of an open examination.
All boys who wish to join the Merchant Navy as deck or junior catering ratings
must undergo a course of pre-sea training. The majority receive their training at
the National Sea Training Schools but courses are also provided by certain private
organisations and by a number of local education authorities.
A seaman may not be rated as A.B. (Able Seaman) in United Kingdom registered
ships unless he holds a certificate of competency as A.B., granted by the Ministry
of Transport and Civil Aviation, or an equivalent certificate. To obtain this certi¬
ficate a seaman must, among other qualifications, have served three years at sea on
deck, have attained a certificate of proficiency as lifeboatman and have passed a
qualifying examination.
Seamen qualify by seniority for promotion to the rating of petty officer. Service
as a deck rating qualifies for the purpose of admission to the examination for a
second mate’s certificate.
Conditions of Employment and Welfare
Wages and conditions of employment are negotiated by the National Maritime
Board (see p. 338). Minimum wages and holidays with pay are guaranteed for both
officers and ratings. Moreover, the Merchant Navy Established Service Scheme,
introduced by the Board in 1947, has removed a great deal of the uncertainty
formerly associated with a seafaring life. Officers and men can now take two-year
contracts, not only with individual shipping companies but with the industry as a
whole, and get special benefits, in addition to the normal unemployment insurance
benefit when they are ashore between voyages.
The Merchant Navy Welfare Board, on which are represented officers’ and
seamen’s unions and associations, shipowners, voluntary societies, the Ministries
of Transport and Civil Aviation, Labour and National Service, Pensions and
National Insurance, and the Colonial Office, has been responsible since 1948 for
the control and co-ordination of the welfare services for merchant seamen in the
United Kingdom and of British merchant seamen abroad.
PORTS
There are over 300 ports in the United Kingdom. The eleven largest are shown
in Table 24, which lists them in order of tonnage of shipping arriving and depart¬
ing and does not relate to the volume of cargo handled. Most ports, other than
those owned by the British Transport Commission, are represented on the Dock
and Harbour Authorities' Association, formed in 1917 to represent the common
interests of port authorities in their relations with Government, shipowners and
traders.
The Port of London, with 69 miles of waterway and over 4,000 acres of dock
estate, is the largest port in the Commonwealth, and with New York and Rotterdam
is one of the three largest ports in the world. Goods of every imaginable kind, from
meat to marble, from plywood to perfume, pass through the docks. Imports are
distributed all over the United Kingdom, though the port supplies, primarily.
Greater London and the Home Counties.
Liverpool—with Manchester, an inland city made into a port by the construction
of the Manchester Ship Canal—serves the industrial Midlands, Lancashire and
Yorkshire. Grain is prominent among the imports of Liverpool, which, including
Birkenhead on the opposite bank of the Mersey, is the second largest milling centre
in the world. Tobacco is another major import and is stored in what is probably the
342
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
world’s largest warehouse. Liverpool is also important for transatlantic passenger
traffic and short sea-route and coastwise trading. Manchester’s chief import is raw
cotton.

Southampton, largest of the Channel ports, is the chief port for ocean passenger
traffic. It owes its importance to its double tides and easy access from London.
A considerable volume of oil is now handled for the refinery at Fawley.
Newcastle upon Tyne and the other Tyne ports serve the industrial North-East
and comprise the most important coal-shipping and largest ship-repairing centre
in the country.
Hull, on the Humber estuary, serves particularly the industrial centres of York¬
shire and the Midlands. Middlesbrough imports iron ore for, and exports iron and
steel from, the local iron and steel industries.
Swansea has the largest trade of the group of ports serving South Wales. As
well as coal, Swansea exports the steel and tinplate manufactured in its immediate
neighbourhood, but its rapidly increasing importance derives largely from the oil
which it imports and exports for local refineries.
Bristol and Avonmouth serve the industrial Midlands as well as the highly
industrialised city of Bristol itself, and also have a large coastal trade.
Glasgow, the principal Scottish port, serves as an entrepot centre for the industrial
area of central Scotland.
Grangemouth, also in Scotland, handles oil to and from the local refinery, and
also imports timber, iron ore, cement, paper-making materials and general cargo.
Belfast is the principal port of Northern Ireland and handles the main Irish Sea
traffic.
TRANSPORT AND COMMUNICATIONS
343
Ownership
The ports, in some cases docks only, previously owned by the main-line railway
companies are now under national ownership and are administered by the British
Transport Commission (see pp. 345-8). The Commission owns some 30 per cent
of Britain’s dock accommodation with a total of over half a million feet of quays. A
few of the Commission’s ports are docks developed by former canal undertakings,
such as the Aire and Calder Navigation which developed Goole. The rest are those
formerly owned by the railways. In some cases—e.g., at Southampton and Middles¬
brough—the railways owned the main docks in ports where the statutory authority
was a harbour board. In other cases—e.g., at Grangemouth, Garston and Grimsby—
the port was largely developed by the railway company which was itself the statu¬
tory harbour authority. Some railway-owned ports were, and still are, mainly used
for the railways’ cross-channel services: Folkestone, Harwich, Newhaven, Fish¬
guard, Holyhead, and Heysham are in this category. Among other ports owned by
the Commission are Hull, Swansea, Newport, and Cardiff. The shipping arrivals
and departures at the Commission’s docks, harbours and wharves in 1957 totalled
over 102 million net tons, and the total cargo handled was about 64 million tons.
At the end of 1957 there were 20,000 people employed there.
Other ports are controlled by a public trust on which are represented users of the
port (such as shippers, importers and shipping companies) and other bodies such
as Government Departments and local authorities. Examples are London (con¬
trolled by the Port of London Authority), Liverpool (Mersey Docks and Harbour
Board), Belfast (Belfast Harbour Commissioners) and Glasgow (Clyde Navigation
Trust). The Port of London Authority has 28 members. Ten of the members are
nominated as follows: by the Admiralty (1), the Ministry of Transport and Civil
Aviation (2), the London County Council (4), the Corporation of the City of
London (2), and the Corporation of Trinity House (1). Eighteen of the members
represent various port users: shipowners (8), merchants (8), owners of river craft
(1), and public wharfingers (1). The Authority’s duties include the maintenance
of adequate river channels, the regulation of traffic, the provision and upkeep of
moorings and the licensing of wharves and structures in the area under its control.
A few ports—Bristol is the most important example—are owned by the town or
city council and controlled entirely by a committee of the council.
Finally, there are about 100 ports which are privately owned. Manchester is the
only major port so owned—by the Manchester Ship Canal Company—and here
the Manchester City Council exercises considerable control by appointing 11 of the
Company’s 21 directors.
The powers and responsibilities of the port authorities are, in the main, set down
in private Acts of Parliament which relate specifically to the ports concerned.
Labour
There are about 150,000 people employed in the operation of British ports. Just
under half of these are administrative, clerical and technical staff, and pilots, lighter¬
men and customs officials. Over half are the dock workers (formerly and still
popularly called ‘dockers’) who do the physical work of handling cargo.
Shipping arrivals and departures do not all conform to a regular schedule, with
the result that there is sometimes too much work for the dock workers available,
sometimes too little. Dock labour was therefore largely casual labour until 1941,
when war-time schemes were introduced to control the port registers of employers
and workers. The war-time schemes were superseded in 1947 by a permanent
scheme administered by the National Dock Labour Board. Workers on these registers
now receive a guaranteed minimum wage even when there is not enough work for
z
344
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
all of them. The Board consists of a chairman, vice-chairman, and eight members
appointed by the Minister of Labour and National Service, four to represent
employers and four to represent dock workers.
Tanker Terminals
Most of the oil tankers coming to the United Kingdom to discharge crude oil
are berthed at special tanker terminals situated near the oil refineries and owned
and operated by the oil companies. Existing tanker terminals are at Thameshaven,
Shellhaven, Coryton and the Isle of Grain, all in the Thames estuary; at Fawley
on Southampton Water; at Eastham and Stanlow in the Manchester Ship Canal
area; at Heysham in Morecambe Bay in Lancashire; and at Bowling on the river
Clyde and Ardrossan on the Firth of Clyde. A new berth, completed in 1958, at the
tanker terminal at Finnart, on the Firth of Clyde, can accommodate tankers of up
to 100,000 deadweight tons. The Finnart and Bowling terminals on the west coast
of Scotland are connected by pipeline to the oil refinery at Grangemouth on the
Firth of Forth, on the east coast of Scotland. There are other tanker berths in the
rivers Tyne, Tees and Humber on the east coast of England, and in several main
ports, such as Swansea.
Several new tanker terminals are either under construction or are planned,
including one at Hook in Southampton Water for tankers up to 60,000 deadweight
tons; one at Tranmere, in the river Mersey, for tankers up to 65,000 d.w.t.; and two
at Milford Haven, in south-west Wales for tankers up to 100,000 d.w.t. The capacity
of existing terminals in the Thames and at Southampton is also to be increased by
dredging. As some of the larger existing tanker terminals are unable to berth fully
laden oil tankers of more than 32,000 d.w.t., these new projects have assumed great
importance in meeting the increased size of tankers.
INLAND TRANSPORT
The dense passenger and freight traffic of Great Britain1 is carried mainly by road
and rail, although coastal shipping and, to a lesser extent, inland waterways play
an important part in carrying freight, particularly bulk cargoes. Passenger and
freight traffic on the domestic services of British airlines is steadily increasing.
There are in Great Britain some 19,000 route-miles of railways (51,100 track
miles) and nearly 200,000 miles of road, of which only about one-quarter may be
classed as main roads. The railway network was developed mainly in the nineteenth
century from 1840 onwards (and there are now more railways per square mile in
Britain than in any other country, except Belgium), while the building of new roads
and the widening and strengthening of old ones to accommodate the increasing
motor-vehicle traffic has been, and still is, a feature of the twentieth century.
In 1957, the number of passenger journeys made by public transport (road and
rail) in Great Britain was 16,380 million. In addition, in the summer of 1957, over
4 million motor cars and nearly i| million motor cycles were licensed for use on
the roads. The annual mileage of most of the cars is believed to be between five
and ten thousand. Journeys by public transport are mainly short and a great many
of them are to and from places of work. The resultant concentration of travel in the
morning and evening ‘rush hours’ constitutes a formidable problem in London and
other large centres of population.
A general picture of Great Britain’s domestic freight transport system is provided
by the figures in Table 25, produced as the result of a special inquiry into goods

TRANSPORT AND COMMUNICATIONS

transport by road made in 1952; they are only rough estimates, but no more
accurate or up-to-date figures for the system as a whole exist until the results of a
similar investigation, carried out in 1958, are available.

(b) The ‘inland equivalent’, that is the ton-mileage by inland transport that would result

In 1957, British Railways carried 20,878 million net ton-miles1 of freight (1,513
million net ton-miles less than in 1952) and there were 1,257,000 goods vehicles on
the roads (about a quarter of a million more than in 1952) so the share of freight
traffic carried by road has increased.
The State has for a long time exercised considerable control over public trans¬
port operators, and the scope and degree of regulation in the interest both of public
safety and of efficiency has increased steadily throughout the twentieth century.
THE BRITISH TRANSPORT COMMISSION
Today the British Transport Commission has an annual turnover of £700 million
and is the largest single employer of labour in the country, employing some 800,000
men and women. Its present role and structure are the result of a series of Transport
Acts passed since 1947.
The Transport Acts of 1947, 1953 and 1956
On 1st January, 1948, in accordance with the provisions of the Transport Act
of 1947, most of Great Britain’s2 inland transport system passed into public
ownership. On that date, the railways, all railway-owned steamships, docks, hotel
and road transport interests, most of the country’s canals (including all those owned
by the railways) and the whole of London’s passenger transport system came under
the control of the British Transport Commission, a newly created public authority,
which was given the duty of providing an efficient, adequate, economical and
properly integrated system of public inland transport and port facilities for
1 Net ton-miles are calculated by multiplying the tonnage carried by the actual distance
it was carried.

(Northern Ireland), 1948 (see p. 357)-

passengers and goods. In addition, the Commission was to arrange for the gradual
acquisition of privately owned long-distance road haulage firms. Road passenger
transport outside London was not taken over, but the Commission was given power
to prepare area schemes for co-ordinating passenger services by road and rail,
including power to acquire road passenger undertakings for this purpose. A con¬
siderable amount of road haulage, several waterways and many docks were left
outside the Commission’s scope.
The Conservative Government which took office in 1951 announced a new policy
for the operation of public transport, including decentralisation of the railway
administration, greater freedom to adopt normal commercial practice (particularly
in charging), the partial return of long-distance road haulage to private enterprise,
and the revocation of the Commission’s power to make schemes for the co-ordina¬
tion of road and rail passenger services. The policy was put into effect by the
Transport Act of 1953, and the actual reorganisation of the British Transport
Commission was completed by 1st January, 1955. A further Act, the Transport
(Disposal of Road Haulage Property) Act, 1956, brought to an end the denationali¬
sation of road haulage.
Today the British Transport Commission resembles in organisation, purpose
and status a large-scale commercial corporation. It is in keen competition with
public and private transport by road, sea and air.
Present Organisation
Under the provisions of the 1947 Act, the British Transport Commission is
responsible to the Minister of Transport and Civil Aviation who, in turn, is respon¬
sible to Parliament. The Minister appoints the members of the Commission (with
the maximum membership of 14 members and a chairman) and is empowered to
give general directions to the Commission in the national interest and to approve
the general outline of programmes of major development and of training, education
and research.
The Commission itself is a policy-making and not a managing body. It works
through six policy-making Committees, each dealing with one particular subject
in relation to all the Commission’s activities, and through Sub-Commissions which
are not policy-making but each of which takes a special interest on behalf of the
Commission in the activities of one of the ‘Divisions’ (see below) and serves as a
clear and easy channel of approach to the Commission. These Committees and
Sub-Commissions are composed of members of the Commission.
There are seven Divisions to carry on various activities of the Commission’s
undertaking: British Railways, British Road Services, Tilling (bus) Group, Scottish
Omnibus Group, British Transport Docks, British Transport Waterways, British
Transport Hotels and Catering Services. The management of British Railways is
in the hands of six Area Boards (the areas corresponding with the former regions),
which leave day-to-day management to the General Managers of the areas. Im¬
portant matters affecting general policy are reserved to the Commission and are
dealt with by the British Railways Division and the Railways Sub-Commission.
Road passenger transport and the underground railways in the London area are
operated by the London Transport Executive, which was established as an agent
of the British Transport Commission by the Transport Act, 1947.
Since September 1956, the business of British Road Services has been conducted
through five limited companies with some 16,000 vehicles altogether. The shares
of all these companies are owned by the Commission although two companies may
still be disposed of as going concerns. British Road Services’ Board of Management
controls the operating companies through their Boards of Directors.
TRANSPORT AND COMMUNICATIONS
347
Consultation with coastal shipping operators is provided by the Coastal Shipping
Advisory Committee, which was set up under the 1947 Act to consider, and from
time to time to report to the Minister on, all matters jointly affecting the interests
of the British Transport Commission and those of coastal shipping. The 1953 Act
extended the scope of the Committee’s work to include road haulage. The members
of this committee are appointed by the Minister from the Commission and from
among representatives of coastal shipping after consultation with interests con¬
cerned ; it is intended to arrange for road haulage interests to be represented on the
committee. The Commission also consults with the operators of coastal liners on
questions of rates and charges at the Coasting Liner Conference.
Finance
An annual report and statement of accounts is submitted to the Minister who
lays it before Parliament. The Commission reported in 1956 that it had earned a
working surplus in every year since it came into being in 1948, but in several of those
years the surplus earned was insufficient to meet the central charges of the Com¬
mission, which include central administrative expenses and interest on stock. The
Commission is permitted to balance its accounts ‘taking one year with another ,
but at the end of 1954 it had an accumulated deficit of £39 million. By the end of
1956 the deficit had increased to over £120 million, and by the end of 1957 to £I88
million. The Commission is confident that the various corrective measures that it has
in hand, particularly projects that will be completed early in the railway modernisa¬
tion programme, will bring its financial position into balance by 1961 or 1962.
Meanwhile, in order to place the organisation on a sound financial basis during the
critical years of reconstruction, the Government, under the Transport (Railway
Finances) Act, 1957, is making special advances to the Commission up to £250
million to meet the annual revenue deficits for this limited period. The advances
made are liable to interest and will be repaid in instalments. The Commission’s
total borrowing powers are limited to £600 million.
Transport Tribunal
The Transport Tribunal, set up under the 1947 Act, has jurisdiction over the
charges schemes which govern the maximum charges which the British Transport
Commission may make on British Railways, on the road and rail services provided
by the London Transport Executive, at its docks, and by tolls for the use of inland
waterways. The Tribunal replaced the Railway Rates Tribunal and has also taken
over responsibilities from certain other statutory bodies. Appeals arising from
applications for road haulage (goods vehicles) licences are heard by the Tribunal
and it has other duties relating to harbours and canals.
Transport Users’ Consultative Committees
There are eleven Area Transport Users’ Consultative Committees and a Central
Transport Consultative Committee for Great Britain, which were set up under the
1947 Act, to give transport users an opportunity of putting forward criticisms and
constructive suggestions for improving transport services provided by the Com¬
mission. The members of these committees are appointed by the Minister, after
consultation with interests concerned, to represent commerce, industry, agricul¬
ture, labour, local authorities and the British Transport Commission itself. The
area committees in England report to the Central Committee, which reports to the
Commission and the Minister, who may give directions to the Commission upon
any matter dealt with by a recommendation of the Central Committee. Since i953>
the Scottish and Welsh Committees also report direct to the Minister. Matters
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
348
dealt with include the British Transport Commission’s proposals for closing branch
railway lines, withdrawing passenger train services, closing stations, and complaints
by the public of inadequacy of services or facilities.
. RAILWAYS
For a hundred years Great Britain has had a widespread railway network and,
despite the vast and rapid growth of road and air transport in recent times, the rail¬
ways remain a vital part of the country’s transport system. The passenger services
alone show how important a role the railways have to play in this system, particularly
in comparison with the role of railways in some other countries. For instance, the
services of British Railways’ Southern Region carry annually almost the same number
of passengers as all the Class I railways of the United States of America, although,
of course, the average length of journey is much less. The urban and suburban
passenger services for London, Glasgow, South Lancashire and Birmingham carry
about 1J million passengers a day, mainly to and from their work in brief rush hour
periods. These services account for about half the annual total of 1,100 million
passengers on British Railways. The railways are also indispensable to a great part
of the basic freight traffic. Every day British Railways haul a total of nearly 60
million ton-miles of freight and the flexibility of their operations enables them to
deal with sudden heavy movements of bulk freight such as coal, or crops at harvest
time. In 1957 British Railways carried a total of 274 million tons of freight.
Britain was the pioneer of railway development which was so essential to indus¬
trial and commercial expansion. Railroads were in use around pits and ironworks
by the end of the sixteenth century, but the trucks were mainly drawn by horses.
In the early nineteenth century, various British engineers showed how locomotives
could be used and George Stephenson was responsible for improved locomotive
design. In 1825, the Stockton to Darlington railway was opened as the first public
railroad on which locomotives were used. This was followed by the Liverpool and
Manchester railway of 1830 on which George Stephenson’s famous ‘Rocket’ loco¬
motive was employed. The great period of railway building was from 1840 to 1875,
with a short lull following the collapse of the speculative railway boom in 1846.
Government intervention began in 1846 with an Act of Parliament prescribing a
standard gauge of 4 feet 8| inches for all new lines except extensions of the Great
Western Railway, which then had a gauge of 7 feet; it was not completely converted
to the standard gauge until 1892. During the 1840s and 1850s some railway com¬
panies were amalgamated and arrangements were made between the others to facili¬
tate through traffic from one company’s system to that of another. The Railway and
Canal Traffic Act of 1854 obliged the companies to provide reasonable facilities and
to avoid undue preference between users. The Railway and Canal Traffic Act of
1888 drew up a standard freight classification and schedules of maximum freight
charges which came into operation in 1893 ; alterations in rates had to be approved
by a Railway and Canal Commission.
During the first world war the railways all came under centralised Government
direction through a Railway Executive Committee. This experience served to
emphasise the need for concentration and a comprehensive reorganisation of the
system. Accordingly, the Railways Act of 1921 amalgamated 123 companies into
four large groups: the London, Midland and Scottish, London and North Eastern,
Great Western, and Southern. The Railway Rates Tribunal, which was established
to take over the functions of the Railway and Canal Commission, was entrusted with
the duty of carrying out an annual review of standard rates and fares which were to
be adjusted with reference to the principle of maintaining to the companies a
standard net revenue equivalent to that of 1913. In the inter-war years, the railways
TRANSPORT AND COMMUNICATIONS
349
suffered both from the general industrial depression and from the growing compe¬
tition of road transport, and the standard net revenue was never earned. The rail¬
ways experienced sharp competition, partly because road transport often offered
cheaper and better facilities and partly because the statutory regulation of the rail¬
ways’ charging system led to the loss of some profitable traffics and the retention of
unprofitable ones. Proposals made by the railways in 1938 for relief from statutory
regulation of charges were overtaken by the outbreak of war in 1939 when the
railways again passed under the control of a Government Railway Executive Com¬
mittee. After the war came the Transport Act of 1947, bringing the railways unaer
public ownership and causing them to be operated as a single enterprise known as
British Railways with six Regional sub-divisions—London-Midland, Western,
Eastern, Southern, North Eastern, and Scottish. At first they were operated by a
Railway Executive, on behalf of the British Transport Commission, but by the
Transport Act of 1953 the Executive was abolished and a new organisation was
set up (see p. 346).

At the end of 1957, there were 370 railway refreshment rooms, of which 84 were
operated by tenants and 286 by British Transport Hotels and Catering Services,
which also operated 36 hotels. Two hotels were operated by tenants. Hotels and
catering services staff numbered 15,625.
Development of British Railways
During the first ten years of the British Transport Commission’s life, to the end
°f I957> capital expenditure on British Railways amounted to about £543 million.
Some of this was accounted for by renewals, including arrears inherited from the
past. For thirty years the railways had been unable, due to the difficulties of the
1930s, the strain of the war years and the post-war claims from other directions on
national resources, to undertake any large schemes of modernisation or, indeed, to
keep up an adequate programme of replacement. This past lack of investment is
now being remedied by a 15-year modernisation and re-equipment plan, announced
by the British Transport Commission in January 1955, which is designed to trans¬
form virtually all the services offered by British Railways. The original cost of the
plan was estimated at £1,200 million, but it has since been raised to £1,500 million.
The Commission expects that the result will ultimately be to improve the financial
position of the railways by at least £85 million a year by 1970. The programme is
being financed partly from internal sources and partly by the issue of Transport
Stock for which a Treasury guarantee is available.
Major features of the programme include re-modelling of passenger operations
to provide fast, clean, regular and frequent services (electric or diesel) in all the
great urban areas, to accelerate inter-city and main-line trains and to render services
on other routes reasonably economic. As regards freight services, operations are to
be completely re-cast to speed up movement, reduce costs, provide direct transit
for main streams of traffic and to attract to the railways a due proportion of the
full-load merchandise traffic which would otherwise be carried by road.
The plan heralds the end of steam traction and aims to carry out as much electri¬
fication as possible within the 15-year period. Electrification is going ahead much
faster than originally expected, chiefly due to the adoption of the 25kV 50 kilocycle
system which constitutes a revolutionary change. It has been decided to electrify,
during the plan period, two major trunk-routes—from London (King’s Cross) to
Leeds, and from London (Euston) to Birmingham, Liverpool and Manchester;
to extend electrification from London (Liverpool Street) as far as Ipswich and
Harwich; to complete the electrification of the Southern Region east of a line from
Portsmouth to Reading; and to carry out additional surburban electrification for
London and Glasgow. On the other main lines, diesel locomotives are being
introduced as rapidly as possible. Some 20 diesel main-line locomotives were
delivered in 1957 and over 130 more are expected to come into service during 1958;
about 2,500 such locomotives are to be in operation by the end of the plan period.
By end-1958, there were nearly 3,000 multi-unit diesel trains operating on branch
lines and stopping services.
A co-ordinated effort to improve the permanent way is being made in all regions.
Modern signalling equipment, which has already been installed at York, Cowlairs
(Glasgow) and St. Pancras (London), is now being provided at many other places
including Victoria (Manchester) and Newcastle. Continuous brakes are being fitted
to freight wagons which will make it possible greatly to increase the speed of the
freight trains. Big new marshalling yards are being constructed, for example, in
Fife to serve the new coalfields, in South Wales for the growing steel industry, and
in east London to cater for recent industrial development. New or modernised
freight depots are being built at Liverpool, Lincoln, Barking and Peterborough.
TRANSPORT AND COMMUNICATIONS
351
Passenger coaches are being improved both in engineering construction and in
internal fittings. In 1959, five diesel-electric de luxe trains will come into operation
on routes from London to Manchester, to Birmingham and Wolverhampton and
to Bristol. The plan has set aside some £55 million for modernising some of the
many passenger stations; there are 5,000 in England alone. Banbury, Barrow and
Plymouth are examples of passenger stations that are being rebuilt.
ROADS
The road system in Britain is complex and its growth has been, to a large extent,
haphazard. During the Roman occupation a military road system was constructed,
but for centuries after the Romans left Britain in a.d. 410, road works were carried
out on a purely local basis and with little regard to long distance traffic. During
the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries a system of road maintenance
through private enterprise in the form of turnpike trusts became widespread. The
maintenance of a length of road was placed in the hands of a trust, made up of
private individuals, empowered to levy tolls at the gates it erected at the limits of
its jurisdiction. The same period was also notable for the major improvements in
road construction carried out by Thomas Telford and John McAdam who laid the
foundations of modern road engineering practice. A period of intensive railway
development then intervened and the competition from the railways caused the
collapse of the turnpike trusts. Legislation passed in the latter half of the nine¬
teenth century vested the responsibility for roads with the county, rural district and
urban councils. Construction of new roads was confined almost entirely to the
expanding towns. The advent of the motor vehicle made it necessary for the
Government to set up a central road authority. Accordingly, the Road Board
was established by the Development and Road Improvement Funds Act of 1909.
In 1919, the Board’s responsibilities were taken over by the newly established
Ministry of Transport.
In 1957, Great Britain had 190,151 miles of public highway, over two miles for
every square mile of territory. There were 8,271 miles of trunk roads, 19,736 miles
of Class I roads, 17,605 miles of Class II roads, 48,849 miles of Class III roads,
and 95,690 miles of unclassified roads. Roads are classified according to their traffic
value, those of purely local traffic importance remaining unclassified. On maps and
signposts the trunk and Class I roads can mostly be identified by the letter ‘A’ in
front of a route number, and Class II roads by the letter ‘B\ Trunk roads are the
main arteries of national traffic and the whole cost of their upkeep is met from
Exchequer funds derived from annual grants voted by Parliament. The Minister
of Transport and Civil Aviation is the highway authority for trunk roads in England
and Wales and administers approved expenditure on these roads. For Class I, II
and III roads the Minister makes grants to cover 75, 60 and 50 per cent respectively
of approved expenditure. The highway authorities for these and for unclassified
roads are the local authorities—in most cases the councils of counties and county
boroughs. In Scotland, the Secretary of State has the same responsibilities for roads
as the Minister has in England and Wales.
Development
The heavy demands upon the national economy since the end of the second
world war have restricted expenditure on major improvements and new construc¬
tion. In the early post-war years, the bulk of expenditure on roads was devoted to
maintenance and repair, but since 1953 there has been an increased emphasis on
new works. In 1954-55, road schemes which would cost £19 million were author¬
ised. In 1955, an expanded programme of road construction was announced. Since
352
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
then, annual authorisations for new road works have been increasing rapidly.
In 1955-56, road schemes were authorised which will ultimately cost the Exchequer
£28 million; in 1956-57, new authorisations totalled £34 million; and in 1957-58,
they were an estimated £66 million. In July 1957, it was announced that road works
costing a total of £280 million would be authorised for the period 1958-59 to
1961-62; this is the largest programme of road construction undertaken in Britain.
All these figures include provision for road works in Scotland but not the comple¬
mentary expenditure by local authorities.
The Minister of Transport and Civil Aviation has explained the plan of campaign
for the road programme. First, to construct as quickly as possible the initial stage
of a national network of modern trunk routes; these will be through routes, in
many cases confined to motor traffic only. Secondly, to clear away the worst bottle¬
necks in urban areas and thus to give free outlets from the big cities and from
other main sources of traffic to the trunk routes. Thirdly, to press forward with the
maximum amount of smaller road works all over the country. The Minister has
also announced his intention to give priority as the programme develops to five
major routes: a trunk road from London to Newcastle, based on the Great North
Road; a motor road from London to Birmingham and Yorkshire; trunk roads
from London to the south-east, by-passing the Medway towns, and Maidstone
and Ashford; a road from the industrial Midlands to the South Wales ports; and
a road from London westwards to London Airport, the west of England and South
Wales. In Scotland, the programme includes the reconstruction of the Glasgow to
Stirling and Glasgow to Carlisle trunk roads.
Work is in progress on three of the five major routes, the motor road from
London to Birmingham which is Britain’s first full-length motorway, the Ross
Spur motorway which will form part of the link between the South Wales ports
and the industrial Midlands, and the Great North Road which is being modernised;
a start has also been made on the Maidstone by-pass on the London to Folkestone
trunk road. Two other shorter roads are also being built to motorway standards,
the Lancaster and the Preston by-passes; the latter was due to be completed before
the end of 1958. The £11 million Dartford-Purfleet road tunnel, under the river
Thames was begun in 1957 and will be ready for traffic by 1962.
A new road tunnel under the river Tyne, between Newcastle and the sea is to
be constructed at a cost of £13 million. In Scotland, the building of a new road
bridge across the Firth of Forth began in 1958, and a road tunnel under the river
Clyde, begun in 1957, is due to be completed by 1962 at a cost of £6-4 million.
ROAD TRANSPORT
In 1957, there were about 7^ million motor vehicles licensed to use Great Britain’s
roads. Of these, over 4 million were motor cars, nearly million were motor
cycles, 1 ^ million were goods vehicles and 99,000 were public road passenger
vehicles (i.e. buses, trams and taxicabs). The transport by road of both passengers
and goods has become of great importance in the national transport system and
has been the subject of much detailed legislation during the past thirty years.
The first world war greatly stimulated the development of motor vehicles.
Public road transport began to make itself felt as a serious competitor of the rail¬
ways and there was keen competition within the road transport industry itself.
The first step towards Government regulation of public road transport was the
passing of the London Traffic Act of 1924, which gave the Minister of Transport
power to control the number of buses and their journeys in London; this was
followed by the setting up of the London Passenger Transport Board in 1933 (see
p. 357). In 1928, a Royal Commission was appointed to examine as a whole
TRANSPORT AND COMMUNICATIONS
353
the problems that had arisen out of the growth of motor traffic. The recommenda¬
tions of this Commission led to the introduction of further legislation.
The Road Traffic Act, 1930, removed the old system of licensing public service
(i.e. passenger) vehicles by local authorities and set up instead Traffic Areas, of
which there are now eleven, covering the whole country and each under the control
of three Traffic Commissioners appointed by the Minister. The Commissioners
regulate, by means of a licensing system, all public road passenger transport
services, and sanction routes and time-tables in order to secure proper co-ordination
of services and to eliminate unnecessary competition; they also control fares.
Competing operators and local authorities are entitled to raise objections concerning
applications to the Commissioners for new licences or the renewal of existing
licences. This Act also laid down the maximum hours of work for the drivers of
public service and goods vehicles and made a number of provisions for road safety.
The Road and Rail Traffic Act, 1933, based upon the recommendations of the
Royal Commission and of an experts’ report (the Salter Report) of 1932, established
a system of licensing for road haulage vehicles, which is still in operation, designed
to restrict vehicle operations to approved needs and to eliminate wasteful competi¬
tion. A licence has to be secured from the Licensing Authority (who is, in fact,
the chairman of the appropriate body of Traffic Commissioners) before a goods
vehicle can be used on the road. There are three types of licence: the ‘A’ licence
for general public haulage; the ‘B’ licence for public haulage limited to certain
goods, or certain areas and covering also the carriage of the licensee’s own goods;
and the ‘C’ licence for the carriage by traders of their own goods alone. The
holders of ‘A’ and ‘B’ licences are bound by regulations concerning the fitness and
loading of vehicles, the keeping of records and the pay and hours of their employees.
Applications for ‘A’ and ‘B’ licences are examined by the Licensing Authorities to
see if they are necessary in view of existing transport services already available,
and competitors may raise objections. There is a right of appeal to the Transport
Tribunal (see p. 347) against the decision of the Licensing Authorities. The ‘C’
licence is granted on application, as of right, but the holder is bound to observe
certain conditions, to keep records and to observe statutory driving hours.
The Transport Act of 1947 established the British Transport Commission which
took over ‘A’ and ‘B’ hauliers predominantly engaged on long-distance haulage.
Vehicles operating under ‘C’ licences and those used for carrying certain specialised
traffic were not affected by the Act. After the change of Government in i95I> the
Transport Act of 1953 required the Commission to dispose of the bulk of its road
haulage undertaking. In 1956, this process was halted by the Transport (Disposal
of Road Haulage Property) Act, which enabled the Commission to retain under
its control more vehicles than were permitted under the 1953 Act. Altogether,
the Commission disposed of 19,000 vehicles. Since September 1956, British Road
Services have been conducting their business through the medium of five companies
which together own about 16,000 vehicles: British Road Services Ltd. (general
haulage); BRS (Bickfords) Ltd. (special traffic and some contracts); BRS (Con¬
tracts) Ltd.; BRS (Parcels) Ltd.; and BRS (Meat Haulage) Ltd. The shares of all
these companies are owned by the British Transport Commission; those of BRS
(Parcels) Ltd. and BRS (Meat Haulage) Ltd. are still subject to disposal at some
later date. All vehicles operated by the Commission are subject to the licensing
system.
Public Road Passenger Transport
Public road passenger transport in London is dealt with in the section on London
Transport (see pp. 356-7). Over the rest of the country there are over ninety separate
354
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
urban bus systems owned and operated by the local authorities. The largest of
these is in Glasgow, where 813 trams and 1,118 buses and trolleybuses carried some
530 million passengers in 1957-58. In Birmingham, the number of passengers
carried in 1957-58 was 462 million and in Manchester it was about 449 million.
The main country bus services are operated by some 50 local concerns, nearly
all of which belong to three main groups—British Electric Traction, Tilling, and
Scottish. Tilling and Scottish are owned by the British Transport Commission;
British Electric Traction is a private concern; the Commission has substantial
shareholdings in a number of companies in this group, but no controlling interest.
There are also nearly 100 operators of express long-distance day and night coach
services, many of which are also under the control of one of the three major groups.
In 1957, 4,800 million passenger journeys were made on the buses and coaches
operated by local authorities and 5,400 million passenger journeys on those
belonging to other operators; these figures exclude the operation of the London
Transport Executive (see p. 357).
Road Haulage Industry
At the end of 1957, 1,257,000 goods vehicles were authorised under carriers’
licences, consisting of 116,500 under ‘A’, or contract ‘A’, licences; 70,500 under
‘B’ licences; and 1,070,000 under ‘C’ licences. The number of road haulage vehicles
licensed has more than doubled since 1938, and the net ton-mileage performed by
road goods vehicles is almost as great as that of the railways. Many of the big
industrial centres and the major ports, particularly London, now rely to a great
extent on motor goods transport. The number of ‘C’ licence vehicles has increased
threefold since 1938. This class includes a large number of small vehicles used
locally in the delivery of groceries and other goods. Other vehicles in this class
are engaged in long-distance haulage of the traders’ own goods, particularly food,
special machinery and equipment, fragile goods, and milk, oil and chemicals in
special tanker lorries.
National Road Transport Federation
The National Road Transport Federation is the body which represents all
sections of private enterprise road transport. Its member organisations are the Road
Haulage Association, representing ‘A’ and ‘B’ licence holders, the Traders’ Road
Transport Association, representing ‘C’ licence holders, and the Passenger Vehicle
Operators’ Association, representing operators of public service vehicles, car hire
operators and proprietors of taxicabs.
Road Safety Measures
With 7J million motor vehicles on its roads, Britain has the highest density of
traffic in the world. This has brought about serious problems of road safety. In
I957> 5>55° people were killed on the roads and 268,308 injured. This compares with
7,343 persons killed and 231,603 injured in 1934 when there were only million
motor vehicles on the roads—a reflection of the extent to which the problem has
been alleviated by road safety measures introduced under the Road Traffic Acts of
1934 and 1956. Among these are a speed limit of 30 miles an hour in built up areas,
modified recently by the introduction of a 40-mile-an-hour limit on certain main
roads on the outskirts of London; a requirement that all new drivers must pass a
driving test, and the provision of a system of pedestrian crossings, including some
illuminated by flashing beacons and marked with conspicuous white stripes—hence
the name ‘zebra crossings’.
In addition, vigorous road safety campaigns are conducted by local authorities
with the aid of Government grants. The Royal Society for the Prevention of
TRANSPORT AND COMMUNICATIONS
355
Accidents, which acts as agent for the Government in this connection, assists and
co-ordinates these campaigns. The police and education authorities are all actively
at work in the cause of road safety. The standard of conduct for all road users
pedestrians and drivers—is set out in the Highway Code, the third edition of which
was published in May 1957. A failure to observe the provisions of this code does
not of itself render a person liable to criminal proceedings of any kind but it may
be taken into account in any such proceedings. All drivers of motor vehicles
including motor cycles, motor scooters and powered pedal cycles—have to pass a
driving test before being granted a substantive licence to drive; until they pass the
test they must obtain a ‘provisional’ licence which necessitates their displaying L
(Learner) plates and, in all cases of vehicles constructed to carry passengers, other
than pillion passengers, they must be accompanied by a qualified driver.
INLAND WATERWAYS
In 1761, James Brindley completed the Bridgewater Canal to take coal from the
collieries owned by the Duke of Bridgewater at Worsley to Manchester. This
marked the beginning of canal building in modern Britain which played an impor¬
tant part in promoting the industrial and commercial expansion of the late eighteenth
and early nineteenth centuries. Most of the present network except, notably, the
Manchester Ship Canal'which was built between 1888 and 1894—was completed
by 1840 when the development of railways brought to an end the golden age of
canals. As railway competition developed, many canal companies were reduced to
a precarious position, and, often at the instance of the companies, about one-third
of the canal mileage passed to the control of the railways. During the first world
war, Government control of railways included railway-owned canals. In I9i7> the
main canals not owned by the railway companies were placed under the control of
a Canal Control Committee of the Board of Trade, being returned to their owners
at the end of the war. Government control was again the rule in the second world
war and, in 1948, the canals passed direct from Government control to the British
Transport Commission.
The System
There are some 2,600 miles of navigable inland waterways in Great Britain,
nearly all of which belong to the British Transport Commission; although some
400 miles of canals are still in the hands of local authorities or private companies.
About 1,000 miles are narrow waterways which can generally be used only by
boats not exceeding 7 feet in width, capable of carrying a load varying from 25
to 30 tons. The remainder are broad waterways and canalised rivers which can be
used by craft of up to 400 tons capacity. The canals in Scotland are all broad
waterways.
The Transport Act of 1947 placed under the jurisdiction of the British Transport
Commission 2,170 miles of inland waterways, of which 280 miles have been closed
to navigation or abandoned, leaving some 1,890 miles still open, of which i,42°
miles are in commercial use. Since i955> the canals have been managed separately
by the Waterways Division of the Commission, known as British Waterways. For
administrative purposes the canals in England and Wales are grouped i^to four
divisions, based on the main navigable river estuaries, each group under a Divisional
Manager. In Scotland, the Caledonian Canal and the Crinan Canal each have a
separate manager, and the Forth and Clyde, Monkland and Union Canals are
grouped together under another manager.

BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
In 1957, total traffic on British Waterways amounted to 9-9 million tons, of
which 4-6 million tons were coal, 2 million tons liquids in bulk and 3-3 million tons,
general cargo. Some two-thirds of the total traffic is carried on 325 miles of the
broad waterways, which are mainly canalised rivers (see below).
Although British Waterways is the largest single operator, most of the traffic is
handled by independent carriers, or by traders in their own craft. The British
Transport Commission, at the end of 1957, owned 23 tugs and 1,200 carrying craft
with a carrying capacity of 47,700 tons, including 220 power-driven craft with a
carrying capacity of 9,600 tons.
Development
Since assuming control, the British Transport Commission has taken steps to
strengthen the commercial organisation so as to secure increased traffic. It has
improved dredging methods and equipment, brought better types of craft into
service, established a research organisation and undertaken various development
works. Following the report, made in 1955, of a specially appointed Board of Survey,,
a comprehensive five-year development plan wras begun in 1956. Under this plan,
£5-5 million is being invested in the improvement of navigation and the provision
of modern equipment on the seven major waterways that carry most of the traffic—
the Aire and Calder Navigation, the Sheffield and South Yorkshire Navigation, the
Trent Navigation, the river Lee, the river Severn, the river Weaver, and the Grand
Union Canal (in the stretch below Berkhamsted). In addition, since 1955, British
Waterways have spent over £500,000 in extending and improving warehousing and
terminal facilities, on the building of new traffic craft and the modernisation of
existing vessels. Annual maintenance expenditure on the other canals of commercial
importance has increased from £582,000 in 1954 to over £745,000 in 1957.
On 28th July, 1958, the report was published of the Committee of Inquiry into
Inland Waterways appointed by the Minister of Transport and Civil Aviation in
1956 to examine the future of the country’s system of inland waterways. The
Committee recommended that 1,300 miles of the British Transport Commission’s
inland waterways in England should be made an integrated and efficient system of
inland navigation. The Committee divided the system into two categories: 380 miles
of Class A waterways which currently earn a working surplus, and 930 miles of
Class B waterways which currently incur a deficit of £300,000 yearly. The
Committee considered that Class A waterways, most of which are benefiting from
the Commission’s £5-5 million improvement programme, will continue to pay their
way and recommended that any surplus should be devoted to their maintenance
and further improvement. As regards the Class B waterways which are mainly
narrow canals, the Committee recommended that they should be restored over
5 years (at an estimated cost of £3 -5 million); that insecurity should be removed by a
commitment to maintain the navigable system to prescribed standards for 25
years; and that a system of annual licence fees for each vessel should replace the
present system of tolls levied on goods carried. For Scotland, the Committee
recommended that the Caledonian and Crinan canals should be kept in being as
navigation canals and that the Crinan canal should be improved. Other recommen¬
dations concerned the use of the canals for water supply and recreational purposes,
and the future administration of the canals.
LONDON TRANSPORT
London is, with Tokyo and New York, one of the world’s three largest cities.
The area known as Greater London, within a radius of about 15 miles from Charing
TRANSPORT AND COMMUNICATIONS
357
Cross, in the centre of London, contains over 8 million people. The London Trans¬
port Executive1 operates and manages, on behalf of the British Transport Commis¬
sion, all bus, coach and underground railway services in the London area in
conjunction with British Railways which provide the main-line and surburban rail¬
way services. Some 6,000 taxicabs that ply for hire in the streets are privately
operated by companies or owner-drivers and are licensed annually by the Metro¬
politan Police. London Transport’s operations extend beyond Greater London to
cover an area of 2,000 square miles (known as the London Passenger Transport
Area) with a radius of about 25 miles from Charing Cross and with a population of
some 10 million. In 1957, 3,800 million passenger journeys were made on the
London Transport system.
London’s transport system, in its modern sense, began in 1829 when the first
omnibus, horse-drawn, appeared in the London streets. The first regular tram
service, also horse-drawn, began in 1870. In 1863, the first underground steam rail¬
way, the Metropolitan, was built by digging a great trench for the line and roofing
it over. In 1870, the world’s first tube railway, the Tower Subway, was constructed
under the river Thames; it was cable-operated and ran for only a few months. In
1890, the first electric tube railway in the world was opened, the City and South
London line, and this was followed in 1900 by the Central London Railway.
Gradually the whole underground system was electrified. Meanwhile, horse-drawn
buses and trams were being replaced by motor buses and electric trams.
Until 1933, there were many separate undertakings providing passenger transport
facilities in London, but in that year these were all vested in a single public corpora¬
tion, the London Passenger Transport Board. In 1948, with the establishment of
the British Transport Commission, the London Transport Executive took over
control.
London Transport’s railway network stretches 18 miles from north to south,
32 miles from east to west, and 49 miles from north-west to east. T. he total length
of the railway over which London Transport trains operate is 253 miles, of which
a third is underground, including the longest tube tunnel in the world, 174 miles
long. London Transport trains serve 277 stations.
Diesel buses and coaches travel over roads which have a total length of nearly
3,000 miles, and trolleybuses (which use electricity) over 250 miles of road.
To carry traffic over all this area, the London Transport Executive in December
1957 owned 4,000 railway cars, 7>742 buses and coaches, and 1,585 trolleybuses.
The total staff employed at the end of 1957 was 86,644, of whom n,772 were
women. .
The challenge to the efficiency of London transport presented by this vast traffic
is being met by a continuous process of development. Thus, since the end of the
war, all remaining trams have been replaced by buses, extensions to the under¬
ground railway have been built and more efficient light alloy trains are being
introduced. Current development plans include a new tube railway from the
north-east to the West End of London, and replacement of most of the remaining
trolleybuses by diesel buses.
PUBLIC TRANSPORT IN NORTHERN IRELAND
With the exception of passenger transport in the city of Belfast, which is provided
by the Corporation, public road passenger and freight transport and rail services
within Northern Ireland are provided by the Ulster Transport Authority, a public
body which was established under the Transport Act (Northern Ireland), 1948-
1 The London Transport Executive consists of a chairman and from four to eight
members.
358
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
The road passenger section of the Authority’s undertaking operates a wide
network of omnibus services and an extensive programme of coach tours. The
road freight section provides a comprehensive service for the carriage of merchandise
of all descriptions (including heavy indivisible loads and livestock) and can supply
vehicles under contract for the exclusive use of traders. A chain of hotels is also
owned by the Authority.
Since October 1958, when the Authority took over the Northern Ireland section
of the Great Northern Railway undertaking, the Authority has operated 336 route
miles of railway.
The following figures relate to the Authority’s undertaking during the year
ended 30th September, 1957; they do not cover the additional 169 route miles of
the Great Northern Railway system nor the traffic on that system.

of Class III roads and 7,865 miles of unclassified roads. The Ministry of Commerce
is responsible for the maintenance and improvement of the trunk roads and makes
grants from the Road Fund (which is derived from such sources as the proceeds of
taxation of mechanically propelled vehicles registered in Northern Ireland and from
driving licence fees) to help the local authorities who are responsible for the other
roads. During the four years ended 31st March, 1957, a total of £16-6 million was
spent on work on all types of roads in Northern Ireland.
CIVIL AVIATION
United Kingdom civil air services are provided by the two public corporations
British Overseas Airways Corporation (BOAC) and British European Airways
(BEA) and by some 20 independent air transport companies. Most of the regular
scheduled air services operated from the United Kingdom are reserved to BOAC
and BEA. The independent companies are permitted to operate certain scheduled
services as associates of the two Corporations, but by far the greater part of their
operations consists of charter work, particularly the carrying of troops. The Cor¬
porations may also undertake charter work as opportunity offers, though they do
not maintain aircraft specially for this purpose.
The development of United Kingdom civil air services since 1947 is shown in

(a) Figures for international services in these years include the operations of British
South American Airways, which was merged with BOAC in 1949.
Early Development
British airmen were among the first to carry mails (at the time of the Coronation
of H.M. King George V in 1911) and among the first to operate regular mail and
passenger services. The actual inauguration of British civil air transport came on
25th August, 1919, when a daily passenger service was opened between London
(Hounslow) and Paris (Le Bourget) by a company called Aircraft Transport and
Travel Limited. The year 1919 was also marked by notable pioneer flights including
the crossing of the Atlantic by John Alcock and Arthur Whitten Brown in June
(both were later knighted for their achievement) and the first flight between England
and Australia by Captain (later Sir) Ross Smith and his crew in November and
December.
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
360
In 1923, a Civil Air Transport Subsidies Committee recommended the merger
of the four existing small British companies into one organisation capable of
developing overseas routes. In April 1924, the merger took place and there came
into being Imperial Airways Limited, which received a Government grant of £1
million spread over the next ten years. As a substantial shareholder the Government
was represented on the Board of Directors.
Imperial Airways Limited proceeded to pioneer the commercial development of
intercontinental air routes, following up, in most cases, the exploratory work of the
Royal Air Force. Pioneering involved the organisation of ground services upon which
civil aviation could rely. The route to the Far East came first. In 1927 a link was estab¬
lished between Cairo and Basra and by 1929 there was a through service from
England to India. In 1931, the first service was established to Central Africa. The
first mail service between London and Australia was begun in December 1934,
followed by a passenger service in 1935.
In 1937, crossings of the Atlantic were made simultaneously by Imperial Airways
with the modified ‘Empire’ class flying-boat and by Pan American Airways. In 1939,
Imperial Airways operated an experimental transatlantic service for mail and Pan
American Airways operated one for passengers. The British Overseas Airways Cor¬
poration was established by the British Overseas Airways Act, 1939, and took over
the undertakings of Imperial Airways Limited and British Airways Limited in 1940.
During the second world war, the British Overseas Airways Corporation operated
essential overseas air services in support of the war effort. By the end of the war it
was carrying more than twice as many passengers as in 1939 and more than three
times as much freight. The routes, moreover, had efficient radio and radar systems
which had been installed for war purposes and which were adapted for civilian use.
There were also about 700 aerodromes in the United Kingdom, although most of
them, having been constructed for war purposes away from large towns, were un¬
suitably placed for civil use.
The one serious obstacle to a continued expansion of British civil air transport
after the war was the absence of any new British civil aircraft to take the place of
the pre-war types. The British aircraft industry throughout the war had concen¬
trated entirely on the production of fighters and bombers for the Allied Forces,
leaving the production of all transport aircraft to the Americans. Since the evolution
of a new airliner takes from five to ten years, there was an awkward gap in the natural
development of British civil air services which could be filled only by the use of
uneconomical converted military types, or the purchase of foreign aircraft. Both
these expedients were adopted, together with the use of the highly successful
interim short-range Viking aircraft, while the British aircraft industry concentrated
on the development of the turbo-prop Viscount and Britannia airliners that are now
in service, and the Comet turbo-jet airliner that was expected to return to regular
commercial service at the end of 1958.
The Role of the Government
Responsibility for the general development and supervision of United Kingdom
civil aviation rests with the Minister of Transport and Civil Aviation.1 The Civil
Aviation Act of 1949, which superseded both the Ministry of Civil Aviation Act,
I945> and the Civil Aviation Act, 1946, gives the Minister the duty of ‘organising,
1 Up to 1945, civil aviation was administered by the Department of Civil Aviation of
the Air Ministry. Between 1945 and 1953 the Ministry of Civil Aviation was the responsible
Government Department and, in October 1953, the Ministries of Civil Aviation and of
Transport were amalgamated. In the rest of this section, reference will usually be made
only to ‘the Minister’ or ‘the Ministry’.
TRANSPORT AND COMMUNICATIONS
361
carrying out and encouraging measures for the development of civil aviation, for
the designing, development and production of civil aircraft, for the promotion of
safety and efficiency in the use thereof, and for research into questions relating to
air navigation’. The supervision of design, development and production of civil
aircraft has been delegated to the Ministry of Supply, which is also responsible for
the provision of all Service aircraft and carries on an extensive programme of
research and development to meet civil and Service needs. The Minister of Trans¬
port and Civil Aviation is specifically debarred from ‘producing’ aircraft and any
dealings he may have in aircraft, engines and equipment are subject to Treasury
approval.
In the international sphere, the Minister is responsible for participation in the
work of the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) of the United
Nations and, with the Foreign Office and the Commonwealth Relations Office, for
dealings with other countries in civil aviation matters. He also advises the Colonial
Office on civil aviation matters.
The Government’s relations with the air corporations and with the independent
operators are described on pp. 362-3. There are also three special bodies that
advise the Minister in the exercise of certain of his responsibilities: the Air Trans¬
port Advisory Council, the Air Registration Board and the Air Safety Board.
The Air Transport Advisory Council. The Council was established by the Civil
Aviation Act of 1946 primarily to bring to the Minister’s notice important repre¬
sentations from the public concerning any inadequacy in the services provided by
the Corporations. The Minister has also given the Council the task of considering
and making recommendations to him on applications from independent companies
to operate scheduled services as associates of one of the Corporations. Since the
Government’s decision in 1952 to increase the opportunities available to inde¬
pendent operators, this has provided most of the Council’s work.
The Air Registration Board. The Board is an independent non-profit-making
limited company to which the Minister has delegated certain functions relating to
the design, construction and maintenance of civil aircraft, and which advises him
on airworthiness matters. It was set up in 1937 and consists of 18 members, of
whom 16 represent the interests concerned with civil aviation and two are appointed
by the Minister. The work of the Board includes the investigation by its surveyors
of aircraft and their associated equipment for the purpose of making recommenda¬
tions to the Minister with regard to the issue and renewal of Certificates of Air¬
worthiness. It also undertakes the technical examination of aircraft maintenance
engineers, flight engineers and commercial pilots in relation to the issue of
appropriate licences.
The Air Safety Board. The Board is a standing advisory body of experts respon¬
sible to the Minister for keeping under continuous review the needs of safety in
British civil aviation and for recommending measures calculated to promote safety
in respect both of the operation of British civil aircraft throughout the world and
of the efficiency of the system of ground facilities provided for all civil aircraft
operating over the United Kingdom. In exercising his responsibility for safety, the
Minister, advised by the Board, regulates the operation of aircraft, the conditions
under which passengers and cargo may be carried, the licensing of flight crews,
the effectiveness of air traffic control and of navigational aids (see pp. 368-9).
The Corporations: Powers and Constitutions
The British Overseas Airways Corporation (BOAC) was set up in 1939. The
Civil Aviation Act, 1946, created two additional public corporations: British
European Airways (BEA) to cover the United Kingdom and Europe, and British
BRITAIN! AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
South American Airways (BSAA) to operate to South America and the Caribbean.
In 1949, BSAA was merged with BOAC by the Air Corporations Act of that year.
The existing powers and constitutions of BOAC and BEA are laid down by the
Air Corporations Acts 1949 to 1956. Each Corporation consists of a chairman,
deputy-chairman and from 5 to 11 members, all of whom are appointed by the
Minister. In the case of BOAC the Minister may, if he wishes, appoint two deputy-
chairmen.
Statements of accounts in a form approved by the Minister and the Treasury
have to be prepared by the Corporations for each financial year. The auditors of the
accounts are appointed annually by the Minister. Each Corporation must
also make an annual report to the Minister, and the Minister must lay a copy of
this report and of the accounts before both Houses of Parliament. In addition, each
Corporation must submit before the beginning of every planning period (i.e. each
three-year period, beginning at 1st April, 1947) a programme of the services it
proposes to provide and of any other activities it proposes to engage in, as well as
an estimate of its receipts and expenditure on revenue and capital account during
the period.
Finance. Each Corporation may, with Treasury consent, borrow either by raising
temporary loans or by issuing stock. The Treasury may guarantee redemption or
repayment of, and payment of interest on, any stock issued and temporary loans
raised. In addition, the Finance Act, 1956, permitted the Corporations, until 31st
March, 1958, to raise money by means of interest-bearing redeemable loans from
the Exchequer and these powers were renewed until 31st August, 1959, under the
Finance Act, 1958. Under the Air Corporations Act, 1956, the borrowing powers
of BOAC and BEA are limited to £160 million and £60 million respectively. This
Act also provides that BOAC may, with the consent of the Treasury, borrow from
the International Bank or the Export-Import Bank of Washington in order to buy
aircraft manufactured in the United States of America and spare parts and equip¬
ment for such aircraft. Provision was made in earlier Acts for Exchequer grants
up to a limit of £8 million a year (for both Corporations together) until April 1956,
so as to enable the Corporations to build up their organisation and services over a
period of years. (For 1946-47 and 1947-48 the maximum was £10 million each
year.) BOAC has operated without Exchequer grant since 1952-53 and BEA since
i955-56. The Corporations are not exempt from liability for any taxes or rates.
Ministerial Control. The Corporations conduct their own affairs as commercial
businesses. The Minister can give general directions on matters affecting the
national interest but in practice this power is rarely, if ever, used, since it has been
found much more suitable to proceed by means of close consultation and discussion
with the Corporations. In fact, the Minister has maintained closer control over
them than has been the case for the other nationalised industries. During the
Exchequer grant period (1946-56) the Minister had to decide in consultation with
the Treasury the grants which, within the ceiling of £8 million, should be given to
each Corporation in any particular year. This necessitated examination of the
Corporations’ programmes of air services and financial estimates. The Minister also
keeps in touch with the Corporations regarding plans for new aircraft and
new routes since he has to negotiate the necessary rights with foreign governments.
He also provides most of the aerodromes from which the Corporations operate
and the navigational aids and communications necessary to the conduct of their
flights. Contact between the Corporations and the Ministry consists mainly of
daily informal exchanges of information between their staffs.
Labour Relations. Each Corporation must, unless it is satisfied that adequate
TRANSPORT AND COMMUNICATIONS
363
machinery already exists, consult with any organisation which it considers appro¬
priate with a view to establishing machinery for settling terms and conditions of
employment and for discussing matters affecting the safety, health and welfare of
its employees and other matters of interest to both parties, including efficiency in
operating the Corporation’s services. In 1946, the National Joint Council for Civil
Air Transport was set up as the body through which terms and conditions of service
between the Corporations and the 18 trade unions representing the employees are
negotiated. A number of the independent air transport companies have since
become members of the Council.
Government Policy for Independent Airline Companies
The policy of the Government is to achieve a fair and reasonable balance between
the Air Corporations and the independent operators. Charter work has been the main
province of the independent companies, but, since 1948, they have been permitted
to operate scheduled services under associate agreements with the Corporations.
At first, these agreements were mostly of short duration and limited to comparatively
few internal and European routes that the Corporations did not intend to operate.
In 1952, however, the Government introduced a new air services policy designed
to combine public and private enterprise in the best interests of British civil
aviation. It aimed to help forward the sound development of civil aviation, to
reduce the cost to the taxpayer and to give greater opportunities to private enter¬
prise without impairing the competitive strength of Britain’s international services
and without undermining the existing international networks of BOAC and BEA.
Independent companies seeking to operate scheduled services as associates of one
of the Corporations must apply to the Air Transport Advisory Council which, under
its terms of reference received from the Minister in July 1952, must reserve to the
Corporations the right to provide both first and second (or tourist) class services
on their existing international networks. Independent companies and the Corpora¬
tions alike, however, are eligible to apply for the right to develop new routes not so
reserved and new types of scheduled services. In particular, the new policy allowed
for the development of a less costly class of service than the normal scheduled
services which would be of such a nature as to generate a new class of passenger
traffic without material diversion of traffic from existing services. The air services
that the independent companies have developed during the years since 1952 are
described on pp. 366-7.
The Air Transport Advisory Council considers applications in the light of its
terms of reference and, after hearing evidence from interested parties, makes recom¬
mendations to the Minister. Approval of the regular scheduled services (but not the
seasonal scheduled services) of independent companies operating as associates of
the Corporations is now normally given for seven years with extension to ten years
in special circumstances, for example, where the purchase of new aircraft is involved.
In this way, it is intended to give independent companies sufficient long-term
security to justify capital outlay and expansion.
Operations
The latest available information about the services, fleets and results of the two
Corporations, and the activities of the independent companies are summarised
below.
British Overseas Airways Corporation
The British Overseas Airways Corporation (BOAC) operates scheduled services
to the Middle and Far East and to Australia, with terminals at Sydney, Tokyo,
Hong Kong, Singapore, Karachi, Bahrain, and Aden; to Africa with terminals at
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
364
Johannesburg, Nairobi, and Accra/Lagos; and to North America and the Caribbean
with terminals at New York, Chicago, San Francisco, Montreal, Jamaica and
Trinidad. The service to Trinidad was due to be extended to Caracas and Bogota,
in South America, in the autumn of 1958. There are regional services between New
York and Bermuda, Nassau and Jamaica; these services operate as extensions of the
London-New York route. The routes to Central and South Africa are operated in
pool-partnership with Central African Airways and South African Airways.
Services to West Africa and East Africa are similarly operated in pool-partnership
with Ghana Airways, the West African Airways Corporation (Nigeria) Ltd.,
and the East African Airways Corporation, respectively. Services to Sydney
via the Middle and Far East continue to be operated in pool-partnership with
Qantas Empire Airways of Australia. Qantas carries on the service from Australia
by operating services across the Pacific, the United States and the Atlantic to
the United Kingdom, thus providing a Commonwealth round-the-world air service;
the sector between San Francisco and London is, at present, operated in pool-
partnership with BOAC. Tasman Empire Airways, jointly owned by the Australian
and New Zealand Governments, operates services between Australia and New
Zealand and from New Zealand to Fiji and other islands of the South Pacific.
This network of services is supplemented by the activities of subsidiary and
associated enterprises overseas in which BOAC participates financially or with
which it has technical or management agreements.
The airlines in which BOAC has a controlling financial interest include Aden
Airways Ltd., operating in the southern Red Sea area; Bahamas Airways Ltd.,
providing services between the islands of the Bahamas and to Florida (USA);
British West Indian Airways Ltd., which provides services throughout the Caribbean
area; and Gulf Aviation Company Bahrain Ltd., which operates in the Persian Gulf
area. Companies with which BOAC is associated either financially or through
advisory and other agreements include Middle East Airlines Company, which
operates services from the Lebanon through the Middle East and to Europe; Ghana
Airways, the West African Airways Corporation {Nigeria) Ltd., and the East African
Airways Corporation, serving West and East Africa; Malayan Airways Ltd., which
operates services in the Federation of Malaya, Singapore, North Borneo, Brunei and
Sarawak; Hong Kong Airways; Cyprus Airways Ltd.; Turkish Airlines; Iraqi Airways;
Kuwait Airways; and Arab Airways {Jerusalem), which provides services for Jordan.1
BOAC, like BEA, is also associated with International Aeradio Ltd. (see p. 369).
To implement its policy of extending the benefits of air travel to a wider public
by charging lower fares, BOAC has introduced tourist services on many routes;
in 1957-58 tourist passengers accounted for 60-4 per cent of those who travelled on
the Corporation’s services. In April 1958, BOAC, in common with other airlines,
introduced ‘economy’ class fares, which are 20 per cent below the existing tourist
rates, on its North Atlantic services.
On all its services, BOAC carried, in the calendar year 1957, 459,091 passengers,
8,986 tons of freight and 4,335 tons of mail. The figures in 1948 were 115,675 pas¬
sengers, 2,447 tons of freight and 2,088 tons of mail.
BOAC’s fleet in May 1958 consisted of: 15 medium-range Mark 102 Britannias;
12 long-range Mark 312 Britannias; 16 Argonauts; 6 Constellations; 16 Strato-
cruisers; and 10 DC.lCs. In May 1958, orders for the following British aircraft were
outstanding: 6 Mark 312 Britannias; 19 Mark 4 Comets; and 35 Vickers VC.ios.
In addition, orders had been placed in the United States of America for 15 Boeing
jet aircraft.
1 The information in this paragraph relates to the position at the end of July 1958.
TRANSPORT AND COMMUNICATIONS
365
The Britannia 102 was introduced on BOAC’s eastern hemisphere services
during 1957. On 19th December, 1957, BOAC’s first Britannia 312 inaugurated
the world’s first gas-turbine scheduled passenger transatlantic service from London
to New York.
The Mark 4 Comet turbo-jet airliners were expected to come into service on
BOAC’s North Atlantic route at the end of 1958 and on BOAC’s eastern hemisphere
services at the beginning of 1959. The Mark 1 Comet (with which the world’s
first scheduled jet air service was started on 2nd May, 1952) had been progressively
introduced into the Corporation’s fleet until April 1954 when, following accidents
involving total loss, Comets were withdrawn from service. Various modifications
and improvements in structural design have been incorporated in the Comet Mark 4.
In 1951-52, BO AC for the first time made a net profit of £275,000, after payment
of interest on capital and before crediting the Exchequer grant in that year of
£1 -5 million. Since 1952-53 it has operated without Exchequer grant. From i953~S4
to 1956-57 the annual profit varied from £1 million to £117,000. In 1957-58 it
suffered what is expected to be a temporary setback and showed a loss of £2-8
million. This loss is attributed mainly to a fall in revenue, due partly to the late
delivery of new aircraft and to the recession in North America and also to a level
of engineering costs higher than those of comparable foreign air lines.
From 1947-48 to 1957-58, the capacity on BOAC services increased from 89-5
million to 329-7 million capacity ton-miles, operating revenue increased from £14-6
million to £53 million, and operating costs were reduced from 57-7 pence per
capacity ton-mile to 38-7 pence.
British European Airways
British European Airways (BEA) is the seventh largest airline in the world judged
by the annual number of passengers carried: 2,751,721 in the calendar year 1957,
when it operated on its own behalf, in conjunction with its associated companies
and subsidiaries, a network of services covering 36,556 unduplicated route miles
serving 75 airports in the United Kingdom, Europe and North Africa, within a
periphery on which the farthest points to the north, south, west and east are
Bergen, Benghazi, Lisbon and Beirut. Its services within the United Kingdom
include a number which cannot be operated commercially with the equipment
now available, but which meet a vital social need. These include services to the
Highlands and Islands of Scotland, and winter services to the Isle of Man. Tourist
fares have been introduced on all BEA’s routes. BEA maintains a close working
relationship with BOAC, whose aircraft of necessity use a number of Euro¬
pean stopping points on their way east and south. BEA also co-operates with
other airlines in order to create ‘through travel’ facilities. In addition to 2,75I»72i
passengers, BEA carried 27,980 tons of freight and 7>S32 tons of mail in the year
1957. The figures in 1948 were 511,522 passengers, 2,610 tons of freight and
1,558 tons of mail.
A subsidiary of BEA, Gibraltar Airways Ltd., operates services between
Gibraltar and Tangier. BEA is associated financially with Aer Lingus, working
primarily between the Irish Republic and the United Kingdom; Aerolinee Italiane
Internazionali {Alitalia), which operates services within Europe and also to the
Sudan, East and South Africa, the Middle East and South America; Cyprus
Airways Ltd., on whose behalf BEA under a Charter agreement operates services
to Turkey, Greece, the Middle East and North Africa; and Malta Airways Com¬
pany Ltd. BEA is also associated with Societe Internationale de Telecommunications
Aeronautiques (SITA), a Belgian company which provides communications circuits
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
366
for subscribing operators; and, like BOAC, with International Aeradio Ltd. (see
p. 369).
BEA’s fleet in May 1958 comprised 25 Viscount 70is, 20 Viscount 802s, 12
Viscowtt 806s, 11 Elizabethans,1 38 Pionairs, 7 Pionair Leopard freighters, 2 Herons,
and 3 Rapides. Aircraft on order at that date consisted of: 6 Viscount 806s, 20
Vanguards and 6 Mark 4B Comets.
The Viscount V.701 ‘Discovery’ class was brought into regular scheduled service
on 18th April, 1953, on the routes to Istanbul and Cyprus, thus inaugurating the
world’s first commercial operations with propeller-turbine aircraft. A larger version
of the Viscount, the Viscount 802, was brought into service in February 1957
between London and Paris. By September 1958, practically all BEA’s international
services were being operated by Viscounts. In i960, BEA will be taking delivery of
the larger and more powerful turbo-propeller Vanguard. In the same year it will
also inaugurate its first turbo-jet service with the 500 m.p.h. Comet 4B which will
pave the way for the 600 m.p.h. DH.121 jet airliner, 24 of which have been ordered
by BEA for delivery between 1964 and 1966.
From 1950 to 1956, BEA operated various experimental scheduled services with
helicopters in order to obtain experience in the civil operation of helicopters which
can be used to assist the design and production of a commercial British helicopter
that can be operated economically and also to assist the development of navigational
aids and ground facilities. Two British helicopters are being developed—the
Westland Westminster and the Fairey Rotodyne vertical take-off airliner—which
may prove suitable for airline service within the next few years.
Over the period 1947-48 to 1957-58, BEA’s capacity increased from 22 million
to 160 million capacity ton-miles, operating revenue from £4 million to £28-3
million, and total costs were reduced from 83-6 pence per capacity ton-mile to 40-9
pence. BEA is faced with the problem of securing adequate revenue from short-haul
routes aggravated by a marked seasonal variation in its traffic.
In 1954-55, BEA achieved its first net profit of £63,000. In 1955-56 it earned a
net profit of £603,614, which was sufficient to wipe out its accumulated deficit and
leave a surplus of £64,528. In 1956-57, a year of political and economic difficulties,
BEA’s net profit was £216,770. In 1957-58, BEA achieved a record profit of just
over £1 million.
Independent Airline Companies
Because the Air Corporations were already operating services on all the major
international routes in 1952, most of the opportunities for the independent com¬
panies to undertake scheduled services have been in the operation of secondary
routes and the provision of special types of services. The secondary routes on which
the independent companies provide passenger services consist mainly of domestic
routes and routes from United Kingdom provincial centres to Europe, the Channel
Islands, Madeira and the Canary Islands. They also operate third-class services
(known as Colonial Coach Class services) to points in the Colonies, and tourist
class services to Ghana; these services are provided along routes already covered
by the scheduled services of BOAC but the independent operators’ services are
operated at a lower class as regards type of aircraft, passenger amenities and shorter
stage lengths. The special services include vehicle ferry services from the United
Kingdom to Europe, inclusive holiday tour services to Europe and to Africa, and
all-freight services, also to Europe and Africa.
^ BEA expected to have sold all the Elizabethans before the end of 1958, as these are
being replaced by Viscounts.
TRANSPORT AND COMMUNICATIONS
367
Passenger traffic on the independent companies’ scheduled services has risen
from 122,000 in 1952 to 760,815 in 1957. The number of cars carried on the vehicle
ferry services has risen from 6,797 in 1952 to 46,723 in 1957.
The greater part of the independent companies’ operations still consist of general
charter work, notably air trooping which accounts for about 60 per cent of the total
passenger miles flown by independent airlines on all operations, both scheduled
and charter. Other charter work includes the carrying of ships’ crews to and from
overseas ports; transporting the staff of public or private concerns operating over¬
seas; taking parties to football matches and race meetings in the British Isles;
carrying livestock, machinery, foodstuffs, flowers and other valuable, fragile or
perishable cargo. There are also several firms that specialise in non-transport aerial
activities, notably aerial survey and pest control.
The independent air transport operators have a total fleet of 81 four-engined,
212 twin-engined and 142 single-engined aircraft. The types include Viscounts,
Hermes, Yorks, Herons, Vikings, Dakotas, DC. 4s, Rapides, Bristol Freighters and
Solent flying boats. Most of the companies are members of the British Independent
Air Transport Association Ltd. The larger operators have subsidiary companies
abroad, and in some cases provide the management of small foreign airlines. Much
charter business is now arranged through the Air Section of the Baltic Exchange,
the London market for shipping space (see p. 338), where business from any part
of the world is handled between brokers representing, on the one side, the owners
of aircraft available for hire and, on the other, the prospective shippers of cargo or
organisers of passenger trips. Inquiries for the charter of aircraft were first received
on the Exchange as long ago as 1925, but it was not until 1947 that an Air Section
was formed. To assist the market, the Baltic Exchange set up an air freight advisory
committee but this was dissolved on 1st February, 1949, when the Airbrokers
Association was formed. Among other aims, the Association seeks to promote and
establish uniformity in transactions and usages in the airbroking trade, to establish
in London a world market for chartering aircraft to carry cargo and passengers, to
represent the interests of its members to Government Departments and other
bodies, and to provide commercial arbitration machinery for the assistance of its
members.
Aerodromes
The Minister is authorised to establish and maintain aerodromes for civil avia¬
tion; so may local authorities, subject to the Minister’s approval. All aerodromes
used for commercial operations are subject to the Minister s licensing, inspection
and regulation. The Minister is jointly responsible with the Minister of Health for
sanitary control at his aerodromes, and he assists the appropriate Departments in
the application of customs and immigration regulations.
There are approximately 100 civil aerodromes in the United Kingdom and, in
addition, about 70 Service aerodromes are available for civil use. Those under civil
control include 26 directly controlled by the Ministry, three in the Channel Islands
and one in the Isle of Man administered by the local island governments, and 25
aerodromes licensed for public use, of which 15 are owned by municipalities.
Customs facilities are provided at 13 of the Ministry’s aerodromes and at 9 others.
The main airports used by international scheduled services in i957—5^ were,
for European services: London, Renfrew, Birmingham (Elmdon) and Man¬
chester (Ringway);
for North Atlantic services: London, Prestwick, and Manchester (Ringway);
for Middle East, African and Far East services: London.
368
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Aircraft and passenger movements at the principal aerodromes continue to
increase. In 1957, all United Kingdom civil aerodromes handled 7 million pas¬
sengers. Of this total, London Airport dealt with 3-5 million. Outside the London
area, Manchester (Ringway) handled the largest number, 478,000; followed by
Glasgow (Renfrew), 436,500; Belfast (Nutt’s Corner), 284,100; Prestwick, 260,200;
and Isle of Man (Ronaldsway), 246,700. The number of movements of aircraft
engaged on commercial transport operations in 1957 was 328,700 for all United
Kingdom aerodromes.
Development
London Airport, already the largest and busiest airport in Western Europe,
will be strained to capacity within the next few years owing both to the in¬
creasing number of passengers and to the increased size of the new jet aircraft
that many international airlines will bring into service shortly. A special committee
appointed to consider the future of London Airport has proposed a development
plan that would involve an expenditure of £17 million. The Government has
accepted the committee’s recommendations as the framework of future development
at London Airport. Most of the European short-haul services are now handled at
the new passenger buildings in the central terminal area opened in April 1955.
Another passenger building, for the long-haul operators, at present handled at the
north terminal, is to be built in the central terminal where additional aircraft stands
are also being constructed. The new airport at Gatwick, 25 miles south of London,
which was opened by H.M. the Queen on 9th June, 1958, is being developed as
the second airport for London. Initially it will be used as the main bad weather
alternate to London Airport, and for services to the Channel Islands by BEA and
some of the independent operators; eventually many more European services will
operate from this airport. Built alongside the main London to Brighton railway,
it is the first airport in the world to contain road, rail and air transport in one unit.
Prestwick (near Ayr, in Scotland), the second international airport in the United
Kingdom, is to be developed so that it can accommodate the new large jet aircraft.
The runways at Ringway airport, near Manchester, have been lengthened and a new
terminal building is planned.
Air Traffic Control and Navigation Services
The Ministry of Transport and Civil Aviation is responsible for providing
efficient navigation and traffic control services for all civil aircraft flying over or
near the United Kingdom. Meteorological information is provided by the Air
Ministry. The Ministry of Transport and Civil Aviation’s Air Traffic Control
Service is responsible for the safe, orderly and expeditious movement of all civil
airliners flying into the United Kingdom along the corridors of controlled airspace
called airways. The Ministry introduced a system of airways covering the main
traffic routes and associated with controlled zones around the major airports in
I95°- During 1957 and 1958 a revised and extended airways system was brought
into use.
There are three main air traffic control centres, operated jointly by the Ministry’s
Air Traffic Control Service and by the Royal Air Force, at London Airport for
Southern England, at Preston for the North of England and Wales, and at Prestwick
for Scotland and the Atlantic. The Southern Air Traffic Control Centre, situated on
the boundary of London Airport, is one of the most advanced control centres in
the world.
In order to provide the means by which the Air Traffic Control system can accept
the increasingly heavy load of air traffic, the Ministry has provided a variety of
TRANSPORT AND COMMUNICATIONS
369
radar installations and equipment. The United Kingdom was the first country to
use radar for the control of civil air traffic. The radar approach system known as
Ground Controlled Approach (GCA) is now in use at all major airports in the
United Kingdom, in addition to the Instrument Landing System (ILS). A series of
long-range radar stations that is being set up will extend radar coverage very
widely.
The Ministry has provided a number of radio navigational aids, many of them
operating on very high frequency (VHF), to help aircraft to remain safely within
the controlled airspace and to make accurate estimates of their time of arrival. In
addition, the Ministry has supported the Decca Air and Marine Navigator System
now operating over a wide area of the United Kingdom and Northern Europe
which can be used, by arrangement with the Decca Company, by any aircraft fitted
with the appropriate receiving equipment.
Radio stations maintained by the Ministry provide air to ground communications
for the use of the Air Traffic Control Service. There is also a network of communi¬
cations between ground stations in the United Kingdom and between United
Kingdom and overseas ground stations.
On routes outside the United Kingdom, British airline operators rely upon
ground organisation provided by the countries over which they fly. In January
1947, the Airways Corporations took the initiative in forming a company, registered
in the United Kingdom, called International Aeradio Limited (IAL), for the purpose
of helping countries in need of assistance by providing radio communications, air
traffic control and navigational facilities for civil aviation. Airlines of other countries
have accepted invitations to become shareholders, and the membership is broadly
representative of international civil aviation. IAL operates by entering into con¬
tracts with Governments to provide whatever degree of assistance is required to
enable States or Administrations to fulfil the international obligations resting on
them under the Chicago Convention on Civil Aviation for the provision and
maintenance of ground facilities for civil aviation. In 1958, International Aeradio
Ltd. was operating, either directly or through subsidiary or associated companies,
in 27 countries. It has over 40 overseas stations all over the world as well as at
Yeadon (Yorkshire), Cranfield (Bedfordshire) and London in the United Kingdom.
In all overseas areas, IAL trains locally engaged staff up to the standards required
for the services it provides; this policy has been so successful that more than 80 per
cent of overseas staff are locally recruited.
THE POST OFFICE
The Post Office with its staff of some 371,000 is a Government Department.
It is also the oldest of Britain’s State undertakings. In 1657, under the Protectorate
of Cromwell, an Act of Parliament was passed which declared that ‘there shall be
one general post-office and one officer, styled the Postmaster General of England
and Comptroller of the Post Office’.1
The ministerial head of the Post Office is the Postmaster General who, with the
Assistant Postmaster General, is responsible to Parliament for his Department.
Under the Postmaster General, the permanent head of the Post Office is the
Director General, who is supported by three Deputy Directors General, one of
whom is the Comptroller and Accountant General, and an Engineer-in-Chief.
At the next level there are eight Directors responsible respectively for Postal
Services, Inland Telecommunications, Finance and Accounts, Radio Services,
1 Charles II declared all Cromwellian Acts null and void at the Restoration, but his
Parliament passed a similar Act in 1660.
37°
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Mechanisation and Buildings, External Telecommunications, Establishments and
Organisation, and Personnel. There is also a Public Relations Officer.
Six of the main divisions of work at Headquarters are carried down into the
organisation of three directorates—Scotland, Wales and the Border Counties, and
Northern Ireland—each under the control of a Director of the Post Office, and in
England, seven regions, each under the control of a Regional Director; London
is divided in two regions, one for postal services and one for telecommunications.
In the United Kingdom there are 470 head post offices and over 24,000 subordi¬
nate post offices, and at 3March, 1958, some 6,000 telephone exchanges.
The Post Office Headquarters is in St. Martin’s-le-Grand in the City of London.
The Postmaster General normally presides over meetings of the Post Office
Advisory Council, on which the principal users of the Post Office services are
represented. In addition, there are about 180 local Post Office Advisory Com¬
mittees, which represent various local interests; these committees are formed on
the initiative of, and are maintained by, the local interests, and are not organs of
the Post Office.
The staff at headquarters and in the directorates and regions is divided into two
main groups: general Civil Service grades (administrative, executive and clerical)
and special grades recruited directly by the Post Office for its engineering and
operational activities.
The work of the Post Office falls into two main categories: (1) direct services—
mail services, telecommunications, remittance and savings bank business; (2)
agency services—broadcasting services and business undertaken on behalf of other
Government Departments.
Post Office Finance
Although a Government Department, the Post Office is also a trading concern,
and is required to ensure that its income is sufficient to meet its expenditure, taking
one year with another. For most of Post Office history, any surplus of income over
expenditure has been handed over to the Exchequer. A different procedure was
set out in the Report on Post Office Development and Finance, 1955 {Cmd. 9576),
and became operative in the financial year 1956-57. The Post Office is now required
to contribute £5 million a year to the Exchequer—this being broadly the amount
which it would pay in general taxation but for its exemption. Any surplus or deficit
remaining after this contribution has been made is carried to a General Reserve
Account.
Mail Services
The development of postal communications in Britain can be traced from the
time when horsemen carried dispatches to the Tudor Court up to modern airmail
transport. There was a great expansion in the postal services in the eighteenth
century with the introduction of mail-coaches in 1784. In the first half of the
nineteenth century, the Post Office was quick to take advantage of Britain’s vigorous
period of engineering and railway development, and the first dispatch of mails by
train was made in 1830 between Liverpool and Manchester.
The heavy charges, based upon the actual distance a letter was carried, were
among the factors which inspired Rowland Hill in his great work of postal reform
that led to the establishment of a uniform postage rate. In 1840, a uniform inland
rate of postage of one penny per half-ounce payable in advance came into operation,
prepayment to be made by means of adhesive postage stamps. Since the business
world found cheap postage a boon and since it proved ultimately a great financial
uccess, it was imitated by almost every country in the world.
TRANSPORT AND COMMUNICATIONS
371
The inauguration of the penny post (the rate remained unchanged until 1918)1
was followed by a rapid extension of the scope of the postal services, beginning in
1841 with the introduction of the registered post to ensure additional safety for
valuable mail. In 1845, Rowland Hill became the permanent head (the Secretary)
of the Post Office, and it was during his term of office that the Post Office Savings
Bank was established in 1861 to meet the needs of the small investor. The money
order system, which had operated as a private venture from 1792 to 1838, was
supplemented in 1881 by the issue of postal orders for fixed amounts. Letterboxes
had been instituted in London in 1855 to facilitate the increased postal traffic, and
in 1883 the parcel post was introduced. By the end of the nineteenth century a
regular delivery of letters was assured to every house in Britain. During the
twentieth century the volume of mail has steadily increased. In the eighteen years
from 1938-39 to 1956-57, the parcel post increased from 185 million items a year
to 249 million, registered postal traffic from 62 million to 115 million and other
postal correspondence from 8,240 million to 9,700 million. Every day the Post Office
handles over 27 million letters and parcels. Each year the Post Office deals with an
ever-increasing volume of Christmas mail; during the Christmas-New Year season,
1957-58, more than 821 million letters and cards were posted.
The Post Office’s services have been developed to match the needs of the traffic.
Improvements include the provision of motor mail vans2 serving many districts,
postal-sorting carriages on the railways, special mail trains on certain routes and the
ingenious apparatus by which bags of mail are delivered and collected by trains
running at express speed. For quick transmission of mails within the central area
of London, the Post Office has for 30 years operated an automatically controlled
underground railway that runs for 6£ miles connecting Paddington in the west with
Whitechapel in the east and serving six intermediate stations; a seventh station is
under construction. The Post Office has set up a Mechanisation and Buildings
Department at Headquarters, particularly to speed the further mechanisation of the
postal services and to ensure that new buildings are designed to accommodate
mechanisation plant. Attention is being given to the use of electronics in handling
the mails.
The Post Office Research Station has developed a partly electronic letter-sorting
machine. Twenty prototype machines are being tested at busy centres, and at
Norwich all the sorting of small envelopes will be mechanised. A parcel-sorting
machine has been developed, and new parcel offices being erected in London, Leeds
and Manchester are designed to accommodate units. Field experiments are being
carried out with machines for separating letters and packets, and for ‘facing’ letters,
i.e. stacking them with all the stamps in the same corner. Experiments are being
undertaken with machines for selling postal orders. The main post offices are being
equipped with machines for issuing parcel post labels printed with the appropriate
value, and the date and name of the office, thus avoiding the use of stamps and
eliminating the operation of cancelling the stamps.
Two large electronic computers are to be provided to process pay data for Post
Office employees in the London area. A smaller computer will expedite the docu¬
mentation relating to engineering stores, and will facilitate the control of stock.
Airmail Services
Railways and motor vans as means of transport for mails are supplemented by
ships and aeroplanes. The figures for the year ended March 1957 show that total
1 The minimum postage rate for inland letters is now 3d. for one ounce.
2 In 1919, the Post Office inaugurated its own motor transport fleet with 48 vehicles;
this fleet now numbers over 37,000, of which about 14,000 are mail vans.
372
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
overseas correspondence amounted to 524 million items, 50 per cent of which
travelled by air. First-class mail to all European countries is sent by air or by surface
transport, whichever offers earlier delivery, without payment of any air surcharge.
The Post Office dispatches about 31 tons of letter mail a week to European destina¬
tions by this ‘all-up’ service, mainly in aircraft of British European Airways, whose
network of services enables many of the letters posted in London for Europe to be
delivered the following day. The air parcel service now operates to all countries in
Europe except Roumania, and about 7 tons of parcel mail are dispatched weekly
to Europe by air.
First-class mail and second-class mail are dispatched by air to countries outside
Europe upon payment of special airmail rates of postage. Air parcel services are
also available to over 150 countries outside Europe. Light-weight air letters costing
6d. each are popular, and 52 million were posted in the year ended March 1957.
Telegraphs
All private telegraph systems in Britain were transferred to the control of the
Postmaster General in 1870. Teleprinter-working for the transmission of inland
telegrams was introduced generally in 1928 and conversion to the present automatic
switching system was completed in mid-1954. It is now one of the most up-to-date
systems in the world and gives direct connection between any of the 500 larger
telegraph offices. The Post Office accepted 16-8 million inland telegrams in 1956-57,
and the average time between handing in an inland telegram and its receipt at the
delivery office was 17 minutes, compared with 48 minutes in 1946.
Telex
The Telex Service provides communication between subscribers with the speed
of the telephone and the authority of the printed word. The printed copy of the
message is produced on the teleprinters at both the sending and receiving sub¬
scribers’ installations. Calls may be made between telex subscribers in the United
Kingdom, and to subscribers in many countries overseas. At the end of March 1958
there were 4,300 inland subscribers; the number of subscribers is increasing
rapidly. The inland and overseas services are integrated, and British subscribers
have access to some 80,000 subscribers in other countries. The service is available
day and night except on a few routes outside Europe, and messages may be trans¬
mitted to a subscriber even though his teleprinter is unattended, and thus are
available for attention when his office reopens.
The United Kingdom is divided into 50 charging areas, each with its telex centre.
The call charges are based on the distance (measured in a straight line) between
the telex centres, the minimum charge being for a three-minute call. Calls are con¬
nected at telex exchanges, most of which are staffed by telegraphists; but in 1958
the first automatic telex exchanges were opened, and a completely automatic
service will be achieved by 1961, when subscribers will be able to dial all calls
within the United Kingdom, and many overseas calls, for themselves.
Inland and overseas telegrams may be sent to the Post Office by telex; no charge
is made for the calls, and the telegrams are charged for at normal rates. Arrange¬
ments can also be made for incoming telegrams to be received by telex.
Telephones
When the Post Office bought the property of the National Telephone Company
in 1912 it became the owner of almost the whole telephone service in the country.
Local authorities were permitted to operate their own telephone services, but only
in Hull has a municipal system survived the difficulties of efficient operation on a
small scale. Hull’s telephone service is now integrated with, but independent of.
TRANSPORT AND COMMUNICATIONS 373
the national system. Local telephone service in the Channel Islands is provided by
their Governments’ Telephone Departments.
At the end of March 1957, there were 6,000 telephone exchanges in the United
Kingdom. There were some 7>25 million telephones, including 70,000 telephone
call offices for public use. Four-fifths of the telephones are connected to automatic
exchanges. In January 1958, a scheme of simplified charges was introduced as a
first step towards the goal of a fully automatic telephone service. A system of national
telephone numbers is planned, which will make it possible to dial trunk calls.
Trunk dialling by subscribers was due to begin in Bristol by December 1958; by the
end of i960, about forty other towns will have similar equipment and, by 1970, it is
hoped that three-quarters of all trunk calls will be dialled by subscribers. The
introduction of the new system will constitute the most radical reform of the tele¬
phone service since the Post Office assumed national responsibility for it.
In two areas, special punched card equipment is now in use for the preparation
of subscribers’ telephone bills.
During the year ended 31st March, 1939, the total trunk calls amounted to 112
million; in the year ended 31st March, 1957, the Post Office handled a total of 321
million; of these, 77-5 million were at the cheap night rate, which was instituted in
1934 and extended on 1st July, 1958, to be available from 6 p.m. to 6 a.m., and on
Sundays from 2 p.m. The number of local calls handled during the year ended
31st March, 1957, was 3,743 million, an increase of 76 per cent compared with
the year 1938-39.
There are several specialised services available by telephone. Well over 90 per
cent of subscribers connected to automatic exchanges can use the 999 emergency
dialling service. Callers using this service are connected as quickly as possible to
the police, ambulance or fire brigade, and in certain coastal districts to lifeboat and
coastguard stations. The automatic time service enables callers in no cities and
towns to obtain the correct time by dialling the three-letter code TIM or a figure
code which connects to speaking clocks. A telephone weather forecast service is
available in eight cities. In 1958, a telephone information service for summer
visitors in London was introduced. Details are provided, in English, French and
German, of all important events being held in the capital on the day of the call.
Overseas Telecommunications
All the overseas telephone services from the United Kingdom have for a great
many years been developed and operated by the Post Office. The overseas telegraph
sendees, on the other hand, were shared until 1950 between the Post Office and
Cable and Wireless Ltd. This company, which was brought into public ownership
on 1 st January, 1947, had developed a large and valuable telegraph cable network
(some 150,000 nautical miles of submarine cable) of world-wide extent, and a large
number of radio circuits. Between 1947 and 1951 the Governments of the United
Kingdom, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, India, Ceylon and
Southern Rhodesia took over the operation of the overseas telegraph services in
their own countries; in Pakistan, the Government took over these services on 1st
July, 1957. Cable and Wireless Ltd. retained its cable network and continued to
operate its cable and wireless service in many Colonial and foreign territories. With
the acquisition of the Company’s United Kingdom services, the Post Office operates
all overseas telecommunications services from the United Kingdom, except for
those provided by foreign telegraph companies.
The overseas telegraph, telex and telephone services are operated, under the
general title of Post Office Cable and Wireless Services, through five London stations
having international circuits.

BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Telegraphs. Most of the telegraph services to European countries are worked from
the Central Telegraph Office in St. Martin’s-le-Grand, London, from which
there are direct circuits to most countries on the Continent. The services to
countries outside Europe, some services to Europe, and the picture telegraph
service, are operated from Electra House, Victoria Embankment, London. In
the year ended 31st March, 1957, the Post Office transmitted 12 million tele¬
grams to countries abroad and received a similar number.
Telex. The International Telex Exchange, in the Central Telegraph Office,
provides a teleprinter service to 34 countries abroad. In 1956-57, 1 -4 million
outgoing international calls were made.
Telephones. Telephone service to European countries is through the Continental
Exchange in London, from which some 612 direct telephone circuits radiate
to 20 continental countries. These circuits, over which calls can be connected
to almost every country in Europe, are also used to send and receive pictures,
and special circuits are used for broadcast transmissions. In 1956-57, over
2 million outgoing calls were made. Automatic dialling by operators to sub¬
scribers in certain European countries has been introduced on a small scale,
and will be developed progressively. Radio circuits which provide service with
most countries outside Europe and with many of the larger liners at sea are
connected through the International Exchange (also in London).
On 25th September, 1956, the first transatlantic telephone cable—also the first
long-distance submarine telephone system in the world—was inaugurated. The
cable was designed to provide 29 telephone circuits with the United States of
America, and six to Canada, but subsequently it proved possible to accommodate
two additional telephone circuits, making 30 with the United States and seven with
Canada. Still further increase in capacity has since been obtained by splitting
certain of the channels into two. Eight circuits are used to provide direct telephone
communication between the United States and seven continental countries. In
addition to the telephone circuits, the cable carries 22 telegraph channels to
Canada, thereby supplementing the existing telegraph cables and improving
communications with Australia and New Zealand via Canada. The system
provides a secure service that is dependable day and night and quite free from
uncertainties, distortions and fadeouts that affect the transatlantic radiotelephone
circuits. The whole project was undertaken jointly by the United Kingdom
Post Office, the American Telephone and Telegraph Company and the Cana¬
dian Overseas Telecommunication Corporation, which jointly maintain it.
Before the cable was used, the weekly averages of radio calls between London and
Canada and between London and the United States were 530 and 2,320, respec¬
tively. At the end of the first year of the new cable’s service, traffic had risen to
weekly averages of 1,600 and 4,300.
In April 1957, officials of the Governments of Canada and of the United King¬
dom, representatives of Cable and Wireless Ltd. and the Canadian Overseas
Telecommunication Corporation discussed plans for another transatlantic telephone
cable with 60 two-way circuits. This will be laid by the Post Office cable ship
H.M.T.S. Monarch, and should be completed by 1961. It will be owned by Cable
and Wireless Ltd. and the Canadian Overseas Telecommunication Corporation.
A new Anglo-Belgian telephone cable was laid in March 1958. The first telephone
cable between the United Kingdom and Sweden is to be laid in i960; the cost is
to be shared equally between the United Kingdom Post Office and the Swedish
Telecommunications Board. Further extensions of the Commonwealth and other
overseas telecommunication services are in progress.
TRANSPORT AND COMMUNICATIONS
375
The United Kingdom is a member of the International Telecommunication
Union, which is the co-ordinating body for telecommunications throughout the
world, and has its headquarters at Geneva.
Ship-to-Shore Radio Communications
In addition to the radio stations for overseas telecommunications, the Post Office
has 12 coast radio stations in the United Kingdom. These stations provide for
radiotelegraph and radiotelephone communications with ships at sea at ranges of
up to some 300 miles. The long-distance radiotelegraph station at Burnham-on-Sea
communicates with ships in all parts of the world.
These coast stations play an important part in the services concerned with safety
of life at sea. They keep continuous watch on the international radiotelegraph and
radiotelephone frequencies for distress calls from ships or aircraft and take immediate
action to obtain assistance for any vessel in distress. During 1957, the stations
handled 212 urgent and SOS calls from ships and aircraft.
In addition to the services for safety of life at sea, the stations exchange radio-
telegrams with ships, connect radiotelephone calls between telephone subscribers
ashore and suitably equipped ships, broadcast navigational warnings and weather
bulletins, and operate direction-finding services for ships.
The stations also operate a free medical advice service whereby the Master of a
ship of any nationality may obtain advice on the treatment to be given in cases of
sickness or injury aboard ship. During 1957, the stations dealt with 368 medical
messages in this service.
The Post Office Counter: Agency and Direct Services
At the post office counter the citizen can draw his pension (an agency service
which started fifty years ago in 1909) and his family allowance, buy a licence
for his gun, dog, sound radio or television receiving set, renew his car licence
and buy National Insurance stamps. In most of these and many similar trans¬
actions the Post Office is an agent for other Government Departments or local
authorities. Largely as a result of the extension of social legislation and the
widening scope of the social services, the volume of work measured on a time
basis at post office counters has increased greatly compared with the total for
1938-39. In the 18 years to 1956-57 the value of transactions with the public
increased from just over £1,000 million to £5>o85 million. In 1956-57, the Post
Office paid out 48 million postal drafts in payment of benefits under the National
Insurance Scheme.
Counter sales include also an increasing volume of direct Post Office business:
during the year ended 31st March, 1957, about 631 million postal orders were
issued by post offices. The work of the Post Office Savings Bank is described in
Chapter XII (Finance) on pp. 417-8.

XI. LABOUR
MANPOWER
The total working population of Great Britain at end-June 1958 was just over
24 million, some 48 per cent of the total population, and included about 73 per cent
of persons of normal working age (15 years to 59 years for women, 15 years to 64
years for men). In fact, about 96 per cent of British men of working age are today
in or seeking gainful work. The remaining 4 per cent consist mainly of those con¬
tinuing their education, of the severely disabled and of some persons of private
means. The proportion of women of working age in or seeking gainful work is
much lower, about 49 per cent, as many housewives have no wish to take employ¬
ment outside the home, or if they have, are prevented by household duties from
doing so. Besides those of normal working age, there are more than a million older
men and women still at work. The great majority of the working population work
for a wage or salary, but between 1^ and if million are employers or self-employed.
The situation in Northern Ireland is markedly different, but as Northern Ireland
has under 3 per cent of the United Kingdom population, the figures for Great
Britain are broadly representative of the position in the United Kingdom as a
whole.
The make-up of the working population has been affected during the century by
decreases in both birth and death rates, the result of which has been that the pro¬
portion of both the total population and the working population over the age of
35 has increased considerably. Changes in social habits have also had their effect.
The minimum working age has been raised to 15 years. The proportion of those
over the normal working age who are occupied has declined (though the great
increase in the number of older persons has meant that the actual number who are
working has increased). The proportion of men aged 20 to 64 who are at work has
remained high and fairly uniform. Among women, on the other hand, there has
been a steady increase during the century in the proportions employed in the age
groups 15 to 59, but this has been offset by the raising of the minimum working age
and by a decrease in the proportion of women employed above the age of 59. There
has been a considerable increase in the employment of married women during this
century, most noticeably in the last twenty years.
The proportion of women at work is generally higher for single than for married
women of the same age and for younger as compared with older women of the same
marital status. Thus in 1951 only 16 per cent of married women aged 55 to 59 were
at work compared with 37 per cent of married women aged 20 to 24. About one-half
of the female labour force is under 35 years of age, though an increasing number of
middle-aged women have recently been taking work, including part-time work.
The total working population (including men and women in the armed forces)
rose considerably during the second world war when housewives, including mothers
of young children, manned war factories at great personal inconvenience, while men
served in the armed forces. From the end of the war until mid-1947 the size of the
working population declined as women left industry. At the same time the expan¬
sion of the population of working age, a feature of the British economy for two
centuries, slowed down, largely as a result of the low birth rates of the 1930s, and
in the case of women it actually halted. Further, the raising of the school-leaving
376
LABOUR
377
age in 1947 removed the 14 age group from the working population. However, after
remaining fairly steady from mid-1948 to mid-1949, the total working population
has been rising slowly, apart from seasonal fluctuations and from checks which
occurred in 1952 and in 1957-58. Owing to the high birth rate in the years 1944-49,
a fairly rapid increase in the population of working age, and therefore in the
working population, is expected in the next five years.
The broad changes in the manpower position in Great Britain between mid-1948
and mid-1958 are shown in Table 27. Figures for mid-1958 are provisional.

{a) The total working population represents the estimated total number of persons aged
15 and over who work for pay or gain, or register themselves as available for such work.
The total comprises the armed forces, men and women on release leave not yet in employ¬
ment, all persons—employers and workers on their own account as well as employees—in
civil employment (including persons temporarily laid off but still on the employers’ pay¬
rolls) and wholly unemployed persons registered for employment. Part-time workers are
counted as full units. Owing to the small numbers now involved (6,000 at end-June 1958),
men and women on release leave are not shown separately in the lower half of the rI able.
(b) The unemployment figures are end-month estimates.
(c) The figures for the ‘temporarily stopped’ have been excluded from the computation
of the total working population, as they are already included in civil employment.
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
378
Deployment of Labour
Nearly 44 per cent of those in civil employment are employed in the mining and
manufacturing industries and only about 4J per cent in agriculture and fisheries,
even at the height of summer. Over half of those in manufacturing are in the
metals, engineering, vehicles and chemicals groups of industries, in which the total
labour force has approximately doubled in the last 20 years.
Most industries employ women as well as men, but there are jobs, such as under¬
ground work in coal mines, which are forbidden to women. The industrial groups
in which women are chiefly employed are in the metal-using industries, in the
manufacture of textiles and clothing, in the food, drink and tobacco industries,
and in the distributive trades and professional and miscellaneous services.
An analysis of the total number in civil employment by broad industrial groups is
given in Table 28. Figures for mid-1958 are provisional.

The figures in Table 28 include those engaged on administrative and clerical
work, so that the numbers engaged on productive processes are smaller than those
given for the industries as a whole. The 1951 Censuses of Population showed that
less than a third of men at work and less than a quarter of women at work were
employed in manual occupations in mining or manufacturing industry. On the other
hand, there were in Great Britain at the time of the 1951 Censuses of Population
LABOUR
379
over 1,400,000 women clerical workers (including typists), over 800,000 in retail
trade, over one million women domestic workers or charwomen (including those in
hotels, institutions and offices), 500,000 women in various other forms of personal
service (including catering), nearly a quarter of a million nurses, and 220,000
women teachers.
Considerable changes in the distribution of persons between various industries
and occupations have taken place during the twentieth century. Some short-term
changes were brought about by the two world wars and by the severe trade recession
and unemployment of the inter-war years, but the following appear to be the main
long-term trends:
1. A continuance at a decreasing rate of the decline in agricultural employment
which was rapid at the end of the nineteenth century.
2. A general increase in administrative and clerical employment, including
public administration, and a very large increase in the employment of
women in clerical work, including typing.
3. A decline in employment in certain large old-established industries, notably
coalmining and cotton textiles.
4. A very large increase in employment in the metals, engineering and vehicles
group of industries and the chemicals group of industries. Employment in
these industries approximately doubled between 1931 and 1951. Expansion
has been most marked in those sections of the industries making relatively
new types of products, e.g., cars, aircraft, electrical and electronic apparatus
and plastics. The rate of increase in certain branches of these industries was
accelerated during both world wars.
5. A decline in indoor private domestic service in which the number of women
employed has fallen by about a million since 1900.
6. A considerable increase in the numbers employed in the distributive trades.
This trend was reversed during both world wars—e.g., the number in the
distributive trades fell by 930,000 during the last war, and although increas¬
ing is still below the 1939 level—but appears to be fairly continuous in time
of peace.
Unemployment and Labour Demand
Unemployment in all areas has been very much less than in the period between
the two world wars, when the general rate ranged between 9 and 22 per cent. The
improvement is due not only to changes in the general economic situation but to
specific measures taken by the Government to develop and diversify industry in
those areas scheduled as Development Areas (see pp. 241-2). Since the second
world war, unemployment has usually ranged between one and two per cent,
except during January and February 1947 when, because coal supplies failed, the
unemployment rate reached a temporary peak of over 11 per cent (although the
average rate for the year was about 2Jr per cent), and during the textile slump in
the second quarter of 1952 when it was 2-3 per cent. The diagram on p. 380 shows
the annual unemployment rates from 1922 to 1957-
Unemployment has been mainly short-term. Long-term unemployment has
tended to be concentrated among older persons in particular occupations, and in
certain localities (largely, but not entirely, in the Development Areas).
Since the second world war, the number of vacancies on the registers of employ¬
ment exchanges, in Great Britain as a whole, has usually been greater than the
number of unemployed, and the demand for certain types of skilled tradesmen has
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
380
far exceeded the supply. The expansion and technological advance of Britain’s
industry has also increased the need for more scientists, engineers and technicians.
Facilities for scientific and technical education are accordingly being expanded
(see pp. 160-3 and 194-5).
Towards the end of 1957, however, partly because of Government measures
designed to combat inflation and to reduce capital expenditure, there was a
slackening in the general demand for labour, and shortages of skilled engineering
workers became less pronounced. This situation persisted during the first half of
1958. In consequence, the general unemployment rate rose from 1-5 per cent in mid-
December 1957 to 2-x per cent in mid-May 1958, but fell again, largely because of
seasonal influences, to 1-9 per cent in July. The proportion of employees who had
been out of work for over 6 months rose from 0-3 to 0-4 per cent during the same
period. The increase of unemployment has been unevenly distributed, being
relatively severe in Northern Ireland, northern and western Scotland, north-west
and south-west Wales, most of Cornwall and certain other areas (mainly coastal) in
England. To help alleviate the situation in these areas the Distribution of Industry
(Industrial Finance) Act, 1958, was passed and received Royal Assent on 23rd July.
This Act empowers the Treasury to give financial assistance to industrial under¬
takings, both inside and outside the Development Areas, in districts where there is
a high rate of unemployment.

Northern Ireland
The total working population of Northern Ireland—including employers and
self-employed, but excluding certain unpaid helpers—is about 570,000, about 40
per cent of the whole population. The Government of Northern Ireland does not
at present publish up-to-date monthly estimates of total working population, but,
at end-May 1957, the number of male employees was 299,000 and of female
employees 177,000. The largest industries are agriculture and textiles. Although
the 1957 Census of Employment in agriculture totalled nearly 142,000, most of the
LABOUR
381
agricultural work in Northern Ireland is done by small farmers and their families
without hired help and the number of employees in the industry is only about
20,000. The textile industry, traditionally concerned with linen, now employs
about 65,000 people and makes extensive use of man-made fibres as well as natural
fibres.
The unemployment rate in Northern Ireland has remained higher than in
England, Wales or Scotland. It is currently about 10 per cent of the insured
employees and, since 1945, has rarely fallen below 6 per cent. The Ministry of
Commerce of the Northern Ireland Government has wide powers (similar to those
of the Board of Trade in Development Areas in Great Britain) to assist the develop¬
ment and diversification of industry. It is using these powers vigorously in an
attempt to improve the situation (see p. 242).
GOVERNMENT EMPLOYMENT AND TRAINING SERVICES
The provision of employment services in Great Britain has been one of the prin¬
cipal functions of the Ministry of Labour and National Service since its inception in
1916. Northern Ireland has its own legislation in these matters which embodies the
main principles of the corresponding legislation in Great Britain, but owing to the
much smaller area of administration and the less favourable employment situation,
the facilities available are not so comprehensive in their scope as is the case in Great
Britain, and administrative arrangements are in some respects on different lines.
The responsible Department is the Ministry of Labour and National Insurance.
The following account, therefore, of services in Great Britain applies in general
to Northern Ireland except where otherwise stated. The scope of the services in
Great Britain has gradually been extended to include the provision of advice on
employment and, in suitable cases, of vocational training. The Employment and
Training Act, 1948, provided a permanent legislative basis for these wider services.
The main services are provided through the country-wide network of some 900
local Employment and Branch Employment Offices, which act as Employment
Exchanges. Local Employment Committees, composed of representatives of em¬
ployers, workers and other local interests, are attached to most Employment Ex¬
changes as advisory bodies to secure for the Department the full benefit of local
knowledge and the close co-operation of employers and workers. There are
additional services intended to meet the needs of men and women who are qualified,
or who are likely to qualify, for professional, administrative, managerial, senior
executive and higher technical and scientific posts at home and overseas. These are
operated in Great Britain as follows:
1. The Technical and Scientific Register, kept centrally in London, which
deals with qualified scientists, engineers, architects and surveyors.
2. Regional Nursing Appointments Offices (11) and Nursing Appointments
Offices (over 160), which deal with recruitment for training and employ¬
ment in nursing, midwifery, radiography, physiotherapy, occupational
therapy and medical laboratory technical work.
3. The Professional and Executive Register held at certain of the larger
Employment Exchanges of the Ministry of Labour and National Service.
At these Exchanges a service is maintained for all other persons qualified
for professional and senior executive posts; ex-regular officers of the armed
forces; and young men and women suitable for training for management
in industry and commerce. Information about this service can be obtained
from any local office of the Ministry.
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
382
General Services for Adults
All the offices referred to overleaf accept on their registers both employed and
unemployed persons seeking employment. Their primary function is to introduce
suitable persons seeking employment to employers requiring employees, thus pro¬
viding an efficient service to employers and job-seekers and meeting the needs of
the national economy.
The Employment Exchanges holding the Professional and Executive Register
are also ready to give information about the professions and allied occupations to
young men and women aged 18 years and over who have not already established
themselves in a profession or in the business world, and to older people who wish
to change their careers. Information about this service can also be obtained from
any local office of the Ministry.
The reduction in the armed forces as a result of the Government’s plans for the
reorganisation of defence has made necessary a special service to help the many
regular officers and other ranks returning to civilian life. A Regular Forces Resettle¬
ment Service, assisted by an Advisory Board representative of employers and trade
unions, was started within the Ministry of Labour and National Service in 1957.
A special responsibility of the local employment offices is recruitment under the
Vocational Training Schemes. Two of these schemes—that for the disabled and
that for men and women who need this kind of help if they are to obtain suitable
employment after a period of voluntary service in the regular armed forces—are
directed to the resettlement of the individual and cover a comprehensive range of
skilled trades from agriculture to watch and clock repair, from radio and television
servicing to clerical work. Unemployed men and women are also recruited for
many of these trades in some circumstances. The third Vocational Training
Scheme is directed to the filling of urgent vacancies in industries which are im¬
portant to the national economy and which at the same time suffer from shortages
of skilled labour. Any suitable man or woman without an employable skill may be
recruited under this scheme, which comprises about 20 courses including
engineering and draughtsmanship.
Training under all these schemes is given mainly at Government Training
Centres, of which there are 14 in different parts of Great Britain and, for some
trades, in technical colleges or in an employer’s establishment. Courses vary in
length according to the occupation; most last for six months. Maintenance allow¬
ances are paid during training, and men and women with dependants receive higher
rates. These maintenance allowances are higher than the rate for unemployment
benefit. During the period from the beginning of the post-war training scheme on
July, 1945, 9th June, 1958, the number of trainees placed in employment
was over 137,000.
Tiaining schemes for particular groups of crafts have been drawn up in consulta¬
tion with representatives of employers and workers, who have agreed that trainees
should be accepted in industry for work which makes full use of the knowledge
acquired during the course. In trades where it is usual for the employee to provide
his own tools he is given these free on taking up a job in his training trade. The job
itself is found whenever possible by the Employment Exchange (local office).
The Ministry of Labour and National Service provides a service to industry
through its scheme of Training Within Industry for Supervisors. The four pro¬
grammes which comprise the TWI scheme are: Job Relations, the fostering of
good working relationships; Job Instruction, the technique of instructing or
directing staff; Job Methods, the steps taken in planning the best way of doing a
job; and Job Safety, which seeks to arouse safety consciousness and to train
supervisors to detect dangers and deal with them.
LABOUR
383
The Ministry employs a small staff of TWI officers, whose work is mainly
directed to the training of firms’ TWI instructors, who then train the supervisors in
their own organisations by the group discussion method. The Ministry is prepared
to extend a measure of these services to overseas branches of British firms. It is
prepared also to train suitable persons to develop the scheme in their own terri¬
tories. The arrangements may be made by the Government of the country
concerned or (where appropriate) by the International Labour Organisation.
In addition, the Ministry’s Technical Staff College at Letchworth, Hertfordshire,
provides two-week courses in teaching methods for persons responsible for the
training of apprentices and other workers. These courses have been made available
to all firms and to overseas countries for the training of suitable persons to under¬
take craft instruction in their own territories.
In recent years it has been the Government’s policy, with the support of
the representatives of employers’ and workpeople’s organisations, to promote the
employment of older men and women. The National Advisory Committee on
the Employment of Older Men and Women, appointed in 1952 by the Minister
of Labour and National Service to advise and assist him in carrying out this policy,
presented two Reports; the first in October 1953 (Cmd. 8963) and the second in
December 1955 {Cmd. 9628).
The first Report recommended that the following general principles should
govern employers’ engagement and retirement policy: (1) that the test for engage¬
ment should be capacity and not age; and (2) that all who can give effective service
should have the opportunity, without regard to age, to continue in work if they so
wish. It also made recommendations for overcoming some of the difficulties that
might prevent these principles from being applied.
These recommendations were accepted by representatives of employers, work¬
people and the nationalised industries on the National Joint Advisory Council (see
p. 392), and have been put into practice by the Government and many leading
employers. Since the Report was published, evidence has shown a steady increase
in the willingness of employers generally to consider older workers for jobs on their
merits, and to retain the services of older employees if they wish to remain and
can continue to work effectively.
The second Report reviewed the progress made since the first Report and dis¬
cussed future developments. The Committee recommended that in bringing this
Report to the notice of employers and workers the Minister should emphasise the
need for firms to examine the age-structure of their establishments, and for
industries to promote research into aspects of the employment of older workers.
Services for Foreigners
Foreigners are admitted to the United Kingdom to take up employment with a
particular employer, provided they are in possession of a permit issued to the
prospective employer by the Ministry of Labour and National Service (the Ministry
of Labour and National Insurance for Northern Ireland if the proposed employ¬
ment is in Northern Ireland). Employment is limited to a maximum of one year in
the first instance but may be extended on application by the employer. A foreigner
already in the United Kingdom, for example as a visitor, may not enter employ¬
ment unless official approval has previously been obtained by his prospective
employer. Approval is subject to the same conditions and requirements as are
applied to the grant of permits to foreigners while still abroad.
The general conditions which must be satisfied before a permit is granted are:
that the proposed employment of a foreigner is reasonable and necessary in the
circumstances; that adequate efforts have been made by the employer to find suitable
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
384
labour from among British subjects (or foreigners long resident in the United
Kingdom); and that the wages and conditions of employment proposed for the
foreigner are not less favourable than those commonly accorded to British employees
for similar work in the district concerned.
In considering applications for permits, various other factors must be considered
according to the nature of the proposed employment. Special arrangements have
been applied to the admission of foreigners for nursing, teaching, various forms of
entertainment, and in particular industries. Permits for unskilled workers in indus¬
try are granted only where there is a general shortage of labour. To encourage
visits and exchanges of young workers between Britain and other countries,
applications from prospective employers for permits for student employees are
granted freely under properly sponsored arrangements, organised mostly through
unofficial channels.
A foreigner who has been allowed to take employment under a permit, or by
official approval when already resident in the United Kingdom, may not change
his employment, unless his prospective employer has obtained prior approval from
the Ministry to employ the foreigner. From 40,000 to 50,000 permits are issued
each year to bring in individual foreigners to work in Britain. Of these, approxi¬
mately one-half are for domestic workers in hospitals, schools, other institutions
and private households, and one-eighth for student employees.
The permit system applies to individual foreigners. In addition, after the second
world war, far greater numbers were admitted under various schemes organised by
the Ministry of Labour and National Service, notably the resettlement of members
of the Polish Forces who felt themselves unable to return to post-war Poland, and
the recruitment of European Volunteer Workers from the Displaced Persons’
camps in Germany, Austria and Denmark.
More recently, the United Kingdom Government has admitted nearly 22,000
Hungarian refugees who fled from their country following the uprising in October
1956. Over 14,000 of them have remained in the United Kingdom.
It must be stressed that these controls over entry and employment apply only to
citizens of foreign countries. Persons from Commonwealth countries and territories
overseas (who are British subjects) and citizens of the Irish Republic may enter
the United Kingdom at will and are free to seek any employment. As there are no
controls, there are no current records of the numbers now resident or in employ¬
ment, but at the time of the April 1951 Census there were, in the United Kingdom,
nearly 600,000 persons born in the Irish Republic and nearly 400,000 bom in
Commonwealth countries overseas. Since then, the numbers of the latter have
certainly increased, partly as the result of a flow of immigrants from the West
Indies, West Africa, India and Pakistan, who are now thought to number nearly
200,000.
Youth Employment Service
The Ministry of Labour and National Service is also responsible in Great Britain
for two specialised employment services: the Youth Employment Service and the
Disablement Resettlement Service.
The purpose of the Youth Employment Service is to help young people leaving
school and young workers under 18 years of age at the start of their working life.
The service is under the general direction of the Central Youth Employment
Executive, staffed by officers of the Ministry of Labour and National Service, the
Ministry of Education and the Scottish Education Department. This joint executive
is appointed by the Minister of Labour and National Service, who is responsible to
Parliament for the Youth Employment Service as a whole. The Minister has
LABOUR
385
appointed a National Youth Employment Council and separate Advisory Com¬
mittees for Scotland and for Wales to advise him on questions relating to the
service.
Locally the service is operated in most areas through Youth Employment Offices
established by local education authorities (in Scotland by education authorities)
in accordance with the schemes submitted by them to the Minister of Labour and
National Service and approved by him. In those areas where such schemes are not
in operation, the service is operated by the local office of the Ministry of Labour
and National Service.
The main functions of the service are to collect and disseminate information on
careers, provide talks in schools, give vocational guidance, help to find suitable
employment and keep contact with young workers to assist them in settling down.
A further function is to assist employers in filling their vacancies for young people.
Local Youth Employment Committees, made up of teachers, employers, workers
and other appropriate interests, assist the service in an advisory capacity.
In Northern Ireland, the Youth Employment Service is operated by the Ministry
of Labour and National Insurance; in addition, local education authorities in some
areas provide a Vocational Guidance Service. In these areas, there is close liaison
between the Ministry and the authorities.
Disablement Resettlement Service
The Disabled Persons (Employment) Act, 1944, on which all the Ministry’s work
for disabled persons is based, declares that its purpose is ‘to make further and better
provision for enabling persons handicapped by disablement to secure employment
or work on their own account’, and the Disablement Resettlement Service is
designed to help disabled persons to get and keep suitable work. The service is
available to all persons over school-leaving age who are substantially handicapped
as a result of injury, disease or congenital deformity.
The Ministry of Labour and National Service is responsible for the administra¬
tion of the service. At each of its local offices a Disablement Resettlement Officer,
working under the direction of the Manager and in co-operation with other officers,
has the special duty of advising and assisting disabled persons in obtaining suitable
employment. This officer is in touch with all the hospitals in his area and visits any
patient who wishes to discuss the question of future employment. His work involves
close co-operation with doctors, local authorities and voluntary welfare agencies.
The help given by the service falls under four main headings:
1. Vocational Guidance. This is given at local offices by Disablement Resettle¬
ment Officers in consultation, as necessary, with the local Disablement Advisory
Committees, Hospital Resettlement Clinics and Medical Interviewing Committees,
and also by vocational psychologists in the Industrial Rehabilitation Units (see
paragraph 3).
2. Placing in Ordinary Competitive Employment. On the basis of a disabled
person’s qualifications and aptitudes and with medical guidance, the Disablement
Resettlement Officer endeavours to find the work most suited to each person, either
immediately, or after a course of industrial rehabilitation or vocational training. To
a limited extent this is facilitated by the main provision of the Disabled Persons
Employment Act, 1944, namely, that all employers of 20 or more persons are
required to employ a quota (at present 3 Per cent for all industries except fisheries)
of registered disabled persons. Registration is voluntary. The number of disabled
persons registered at April 1958 was 737>°43- At the same date 52,061 registered
disabled were unemployed, 48,236 being considered capable of ordinary
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
386
employment. This latter figure is estimated as about per cent of the total
number of registered disabled persons. Persons so severely disabled as to be classed
as incapable of ordinary employment are to an increasing extent being found work
in unsubsidised competitive undertakings by careful selective placement.
3. Industrial Rehabilitation and Vocational Training. Industrial rehabilitation is
provided at residential and non-residential units run by the Ministry of Labour and
National Service where physical and mental toning-up is given and, for those who
need it, vocational guidance as to the best kind of employment to take up.1
There are vocational training facilities for the disabled at Government Training
Centres, educational institutions and employers’ establishments. For the more
seriously disabled there are special residential training colleges run by voluntary
organisations with the financial assistance and technical help of the Ministry of
Labour and National Service. There are also arrangements for the training of
special categories of disabled persons such as the blind.
4. Sheltered Employment. Remploy Ltd., a non-profit-making public company,
with no share capital, was established in Great Britain in accordance with the pro¬
visions of the Disabled Persons (Employment) Act, 1944. Its objects are to provide
training and employment facilities for registered disabled persons who are unlikely
to obtain work except under special conditions. Its powers are wide enough to cover
the provision of special factories and workshops, hostel accommodation and facilities
for home workers. The directors are appointed by the Minister of Labour and
National Service; funds for capital development and to meet operational costs are
provided by loans and grants under the Ministry of Labour Vote. At the end of
I957> Remploy Ltd. operated 90 factories and employed 6,300 severely disabled
men and women, including approximately 120 homeworkers.
Facilities for the employment of blind persons are provided by local authorities
directly or through voluntary bodies, with the financial assistance of the Ministry
of Labour and National Service. At end-December 1957 there were 68 workshops
for the blind in which there were 263 blind persons in training and 3,777 in employ¬
ment. The Ministry also helped to finance the provision of training or employment
for 787 severely disabled sighted persons in 42 workshops provided by 35 voluntary
undertakings or local authorities. Some 1,200 blind persons were also working at
home under homeworkers’ schemes.
TERMS OF EMPLOYMENT AND WORKING CONDITIONS
At the beginning of the nineteenth century industrial workers lacked legitimate
means of defending their standards of living or of ameliorating their working condi¬
tions. The traditional methods of fixing wages had become obsolete, trade unions
were regarded as criminal conspiracies, and there was no protective legislation
setting minimum standards of safety, health and welfare in places of work.
The first attempt at protective legislation was the Health and Morals of Appren¬
tices Act, 1802, but the first effective Factory Act was that of 1833 which created an
inspectorate employed and paid by the central Government to enforce its provisions.
Since that date, legislation extending, strengthening, adapting and consolidating the
statutory protection for employees has been passed at an accelerating rate. The
progress in standards has owed much to the recommendations of strengthened
inspectorates, much to the example of progressive employers and much to the
persistent pressure of trade unions and disinterested reformers.
1 For an account of medical rehabilitation of the disabled, see p. 145.
LABOUR
387
Trade unions ceased to be actionable conspiracies in 1824 but their status as legal
entities was not properly established until 1871. This latter step had been made
acceptable to public opinion by the leaders of certain craft unions, who had aban¬
doned the revolutionary and financially unsound policies of earlier trade unions to
pursue a limited practical objective, i.e. the improvement of their members’ wages
and conditions through skilful and honest negotiation from positions of financial
strength.
After 1880 the organisation of unskilled workers became more extensive and
effective and the whole tone of trade unionism became more militant and political.
As many employers were still hostile to trade unionism and were unwilling to
negotiate with trade unions or to recognise agreements made on an industry-wide
basis, many of the first 30 years of the twentieth century were marked by widespread
and prolonged strikes. Since 1932, however, the strike rate (in terms of man-days
lost) has, in most years, been very much lower, and arrangements for the negotiation
of terms of service and the peaceful settlement of disputes have become general and
are on the whole satisfactory.
Today, minimum standards have been established by statute or collective agree¬
ment for both the terms and conditions of employment and the working conditions
of the substantial majority of British workers. The settlement of terms and condi¬
tions of employment, however, involves principles, methods and machinery quite
different from those for the determination of working conditions. Terms and
conditions of employment of the majority of workers are usually settled by collective
agreements between employers’ associations and trade unions, and the fixing by
statute of minimum wages is confined to those trades or industries where the
organisation of employers or workers or both is inadequate to negotiate collective
agreements and to ensure their observance.
Standards for working conditions, on the other hand, are laid down by statute,
e.g., the Factories Acts, 1937 and 1948, and it is the duty of Government inspectors
and local authority inspectors to enforce their provisions. The various Acts of
Parliament and statutory regulations made thereunder prescribe standards of safety,
health and welfare for a large proportion of workers, and regulate the hours of work
for women and young persons. Health, safety or welfare requirements, additional to
these statutory requirements, have, in some cases, been the subject of collective
agreement.
Many employers provide working conditions superior to those prescribed by
statute or agreement, and various Government Departments and voluntary bodies
advise and assist in improving these standards.
LABOUR RELATIONS
The structure of labour relations in Britain is established mainly on a voluntary
basis, and rests on the organisation of employers and workers into employers’
associations and trade unions. These organisations1 discuss and negotiate terms and
conditions of employment and other matters affecting the workpeople at their work.
In some industries these negotiations are conducted simply by ad hoc meetings,
which are held when necessary; in others, voluntary joint machinery has been
established on a permanent basis. Normally these arrangements for collective
bargaining suffice to settle all questions which are raised, but provision is often made
for matters not so settled to be referred for settlement to independent arbitration.
1 The few monopolist employers—the central Government and the public corporations
operating the nationalised industries—and some other employers negotiate directly with
the trade unions representing their different types of employees.
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
388
In certain trades where wages cannot be effectively controlled by voluntary
agreement owing to the inadequate organisation of employers or workers, provision
has also been made by the State for statutory regulation under the Wages Councils
Acts, 1945 to 1948, the Catering Wages Act, 1943, the Agricultural Wages Act,
1948, and the Agricultural Wages (Scotland) Act, 1949.
Employers’ Organisations
Many employers in Great Britain are members of employers’ associations, some
of which have their origins in the nineteenth century. They are generally organised
on an ‘industry basis’, some being purely local in character and dealing with a
section of an industry only, while others have a national scope and concern them¬
selves with the whole of an industry. In some cases the local associations are
organised into district or national federations.
The central organ of employers’ associations is the British Employers’ Confedera¬
tion, to which the majority of employers’ associations and federations in the princi¬
pal industries are affiliated. It deals with matters affecting the interests of organised
employers in their relations with their workpeople, and is recognised by the
Government as the channel of consultation between Government Departments
and representatives of private employers as a whole on all such matters.
The Confederation acts for its member organisations in an advisory and con¬
sultative capacity, providing them with information and statistics, ascertaining and
acting upon their collective views and representing these nationally to the Govern¬
ment and the public, and internationally to such bodies as the International Labour
Organisation.
While the main function of employers’ organisations consists in the safeguarding
of the interests of their members, a number consider that this purpose can be
furthered by the provision of advice and assistance to member firms and by such
special services as the organisation of general training courses and special courses
on, for example, work study and its application. Where employers’ organisations
do not themselves provide such services they make arrangements for putting their
members in touch with the appropriate specialist agency.
Trade Unions
In nearly all industries and occupations some workers—and in some industries
nearly all workers—are organised into trade unions. These have grown up gradually
and independently over a great many years, and consequently their form and
organisation vary considerably. Trade unions started more than two hundred years
ago among the skilled craftsmen and spread later to the general labouring and
unskilled classes. More recently trade unionism has increased among clerical,
supervisory, technical and administrative workers. A number of associations of
professional workers, formed primarily for the preservation and improvement of
professional standards, have also come to exercise many of the functions of trade
unions, including bargaining about salary and fee scales, and are legally trade unions.
The qualification for membership of some unions is occupational, e.g., they may
recruit clerks or fitters wherever employed, while in others the qualification is
industrial, i.e. they seek to recruit all persons in an industry, whatever their occu¬
pation. In a number of unions recruitment is based on a combination of these
principles. A few large unions recruit members in a number of different occupations
and industries.
At the end of 1957 the total membership of British trade unions was about
9,700,000. There were 647 separate trade unions, but about two-thirds of all trade
unionists were in the 17 largest unions.
LABOUR
389
The basic unit of organisation in most British trade unions is the local branch or
lodge. Every member of the union belongs to a branch or lodge. He may attend its
meetings, put forward suggestions about terms and conditions of employment,
discuss the work and policy of the union, and take part in the election of branch
officers. The branch takes action on certain matters considered purely or mainly of
local interest but refers wider issues to the union’s national or regional bodies.
Many unions also have shop stewards or other representatives at the place of
work to enrol members and collect dues, to report any encroachment on agreed
or customary conditions of work and in some cases to act as representatives of
members at their place of work for the settlement of grievances.
In most large unions the central organisation is along the following lines. Elected
officials, including a General Secretary assisted by clerical and specialist staff, are
in charge of the work of the head office and are responsible to a National Executive
Council or Committee which may be part-time or full-time, and which is usually
elected by, and responsible to, annual or biennial conferences of delegates from the
branches.
Executive committees or councils play an important part in the government of
the unions; between conferences they are the highest authorities and carry out
policy decisions made by delegates.
Most unions also have some kind of regional, district or area organisation, while
in large unions there is usually also a system of regional, district or area committees
or councils.
Trade unions may affiliate to one or more federations or confederations whose
main purpose in most cases is to represent all or most of the trade unions in an
industry in negotiation with employers. The scope and authority of these federa¬
tions and confederations vary greatly in different circumstances.
Nearly all trade unions of any size and importance are affiliated to the Trades
Union Congress (TUC), the national centre of the British trade union movement.
The main exceptions are the National and Local Government Officers Association
(NALGO), the National Union of Teachers (NUT), and certain Civil Service
staff associations, all of them professional or quasi-professional bodies. The objects
of the TUC are to promote the interests of all its affiliated organisations and generally
to improve the economic and social conditions of the workers. Its membership com¬
prises 185 organisations, of which about a dozen are federations of some 150 separate
unions; approximately 350 unions in all are affiliated directly or indirectly. These
represent nearly 8|- million workpeople. The TUC deals with all general questions
which concern trade unions both nationally and internationally and gives assistance
on questions relating to particular trades or industries at the request of the trade
union concerned. The congress of delegates, which constitutes the 1 UC proper,,
meets for a week every year to discuss matters of general interest to trade unionists
and to employees generally.
It elects annually a General Council which represents it during the remaining
51 weeks of the year. The General Council is responsible for carrying out Congress
decisions, for watching economic and social developments, and for providing
educational and advisory services. It is also empowered in certain circumstances to
mediate in inter-union disputes.
Both the TUC and a number of affiliated trade unions have in recent years paid
increasing attention to the education of their members, not only in general economic
questions and trade union practice, but also in production and management subjects,
including work study and costing. The educational work of the TUC is being con¬
siderably expanded. Its new headquarters, Congress House, in London, includes a
training college, which aims each year to give some 800 trade unionists courses
390
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
lasting one or two weeks on general trade union subjects, on production and
management techniques, on industrial finance, on industrial relations and on social
insurance.
The TUC also organises week-end schools and summer schools. These are open
to members of any affiliated union, usually by nomination from the union. A num¬
ber of the larger unions hold similar courses. In addition, arrangements are made
for union officials to attend courses on production and management at technical
colleges. Some unions also make use of industrial consultants for this purpose.
The TUC is recognised by the Government as the channel of consultation
between the Government Departments and representatives of organised workers
on matters affecting the interests of employees generally.
There is also a separate Scottish Trades Union Congress, to which trade unions
may affiliate in respect of their membership in Scotland.
The TUC is a non-political body, but individual trade unions can, by a ballot
vote of members, decide to set up a political fund, financed by a separate levy,
which any member can refuse to pay without loss of his normal trade union rights
and benefits. About 80 trade union organisations, including most of the largest
trade unions, have such a fund and, in every case but one, it is used to support the
Labour Party.
Branches of various trade unions in a locality generally affiliate to a local
trades council, which acts as a forum for the discussion of matters of common
interest and as local agent of the TUC, by which it is registered each year. There
are more than 500 trades councils in England and Wales alone, grouped together
in 22 federations.
Voluntary Joint Negotiating Machinery
At National Level. While in some industries all matters affecting terms and
conditions of employment are discussed on an ad hoc basis between the employers’
organisations and the trade unions concerned, in other industries there are standard
procedures for dealing with such matters by joint discussion at a national level. In
many industries there are, for this purpose, bodies composed of representatives of
both sides of the industry with, in some cases, an independent chairman. Some are
known as Joint Industrial Councils, of which there are over 130. The functions of
these bodies vary considerably, some being simply negotiating bodies, while others
deal with a wide range of subjects affecting the interests of the industry concerned.
Provision is sometimes made in the constitution of such bodies that, where it is
not found possible to reach agreed terms of settlement in a particular dispute, the
matter should be referred to some form of conciliation or arbitration by independent
persons, including the methods provided under the Conciliation Act, 1896, or the
Industrial Courts Act, 1919.
At District and Factory Level. Similar arrangements exist at district and factory
level in many industries, where matters are discussed either between the appropriate
representatives of the two sides on an ad hoc basis, or through regular machinery
provided by District Joint Industrial Councils or similar bodies and Works
Councils. Such bodies discuss how agreements reached at a national level may
be applied to their district or factory, but as a rule have no power to alter the terms
of such national agreements. They also discuss new problems which may arise, and
if no solution can be found at factory or district level the matter may be referred to
the national body.
Statutory Wage-Regulating Machinery
In certain industries in which, owing to the lack of organisation among employers
and workers, voluntary negotiating arrangements do not exist for the effective
LABOUR
391
settlement of terms and conditions of employment or are inadequate to secure their
observance by voluntary methods throughout the industry, statutory bodies known
as Wages Councils and Agricultural Wages Boards have been set up. These are
composed of equal numbers of representatives of employers and workers in the
respective industries, with the addition of certain independent members. Wages
Councils are empowered to submit proposals for the fixing of minimum remunera¬
tion and of holidays with pay to the Minister of Labour and National Service, who is
then required by the Acts concerned to make Orders giving statutory force to such
proposals, subject only to his right to return them to the Board or Council for
further consideration.
Orders relative to employment in agriculture are made by the appropriate Agricul¬
tural Wages Board (England and Wales or Scotland). Such Orders are effective only
in the County Agricultural Wages Committee area in respect of which they have
been made, but there is a national minimum enforceable in England and Wales
and also one for Scotland.
State Provision for Conciliation, Arbitration and Investigation
Matters which prove difficult to settle by negotiation are sometimes referred by
agreement to independent conciliators or arbitrators, and one way in which the
parties can find such persons is by invoking the help of the Minister of Labour and
National Service. Under authority derived from the Conciliation Act, 1896, and
the Industrial Courts Act, 1919, the Minister has certain powers to assist industry
to settle disputes which it is not found possible to resolve through an industry’s own
machinery and procedure. These powers are all intended to supplement and not to
supersede the industry’s own machinery.
To assist conciliation in industry, a staff of conciliation officers forms part of the
Ministry of Labour and National Service. The duties of these officers are to keep
in touch with the course of relations between employers and workers at national,
district, and, in some cases, factory level, and to assist them, if requested, to settle
their problems by joint discussion and negotiation.
Disputes which cannot be settled in this way may, at the request of both parties,
be referred to voluntary arbitration, either by a single arbitrator, or an ad hoc
Board of Arbitration, or by the Industrial Court, a permanent tribunal established
under the Industrial Courts Act. The Court normally consists of three members
the president, one member representing employers and one representing work¬
people. At present, provision is also made by an Order under emergency legislation
for disputes and ‘issues’1 about terms and conditions of employment to be reported
to the Minister in certain circumstances by one of the parties, and to be referred,
if all other means of settlement have been exhausted, to an Industrial Disputes
Tribunal, whose award can be legally enforced. This tribunal consists of a chairman
and two other independent members appointed by the Minister of Labour and
National Service, together with one member representing employers and one
representing workpeople. These representatives are drawn from panels appointed
by the Minister after consultation with the British Employers’ Confederation and
the Trades Union Congress respectively.
The Minister is also empowered to appoint a Court of Inquiry or Committee of
Investigation into a dispute, whether existing or apprehended. These proceduies
are primarily means of informing public opinion of the facts of a dispute and not
1 A dispute is a disagreement about a proposal to change agreed or recognised teims of
employment or conditions of labour. An issue arises from an allegation that a particular
employer or group of workers is failing to observe the agreed or recognised terms and
conditions of the trade or industry.
2C
392
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
means of arbitration. The report of a Court of Inquiry has to be laid before Parlia¬
ment. Although the recommendations contained in the reports of such bodies are
not binding on the parties, they usually provide the basis of a settlement of the
difference.
The machinery for negotiation and conciliation of disputes has reduced the need
for direct industrial action, i.e. strikes and lock-outs. Time lost by stoppages of work
caused by industrial disputes has been substantially less in the last twenty-five
years than formerly. Even though two strikes involving exceptionally large numbers
of workers made the loss of time in 1957 greater than in any year since 1926, and the
time lost through strikes in the first half of 1958 was also exceptionally high, the
average time lost per year since 1932 is only 2i million man-days or about
a tenth of a day per worker per year compared with an average of 21 million
man-days in the 23 years 1910-32. The reduction has been in the size and duration
of strikes and not in their number.
Liaison between the Government and Industry
The Government is in contact with representatives of employers and workers at
all levels on matters affecting their common interests. At local and district level the
conciliation officers of the Ministry of Labour and National Service keep in touch
with the representatives of both sides of industry, while, at national level, officers
of the Department attend the meetings of many Joint Industrial Councils as liaison
officers. Standing arrangements also exist for consultation between the Government,
the British Employers’ Confederation and the Trades Union Congress through the
National Joint Advisory Council, which was set up in 1939 to advise the Government
on matters in which employers and workers have a common interest. It meets
quarterly under the chairmanship of the Minister of Labour and National Service.
Its membership consists of representatives of the British Employers’ Confederation
and the Trades Union Congress, together with representatives of the managements
of nationalised industries. Among the subjects which it has considered in recent
years are the machinery for settling industrial disputes, joint consultation in
industry, industrial training and recruitment, double-day-shift working, and the
economic situation with special reference to production, wages and prices.
Joint Consultation in Industry at Factory Level
In addition to the arrangements already described, the purpose of which is
mainly but not exclusively for discussion and settlement of terms and conditions of
employment, there are, in many industries, national agreements which recommend
the establishment, in firms of sufficient size, of machinery for joint consultation
between management and workers on problems of common interest. This generally
takes the form of a Works Council. In some industries the constitution and func¬
tions of Works Councils are laid down in the agreement, but in others these details
have been left to be decided by the individual firms. Even where no national
agreement on the subject has been reached, the practice of joint consultation in the
factory is becoming increasingly widespread.
The range of subjects which Works Councils can fruitfully discuss is wide and
includes hours of wrork (within the framework of agreements), safety, health, effi¬
ciency of production, absenteeism, labour turnover, training, education, recreation
and employees’ services generally. It is the general practice, however, to exclude
all questions relating to wages and conditions of employment, and other matters
covered by negotiation between organisations of employers and workers. It is the
policy of the Government to foster the development of voluntary joint consultation
throughout the industry, not only because of its effect on production but also as
LABOUR
393
a most important means of maintaining good relationships between management
and employees.
At individual factory level, Personnel Management Advisers of the Ministry of
Labour and National Service are often approached by firms seeking advice on the
establishment of Works Councils or on ways in which their activities can be made
more efifective.
Labour Relations of Public Authorities
While labour relations in Government service and in the nationalised industries
are, in general, organised on the same principles as in private industry, there are
some special features.
Non-industrial employees in central Government service, where salaries and
conditions of service are under the direct control of the Treasury, are permitted and
encouraged to join the appropriate Civil Service staff associations (trade unions)
and there is a highly developed system of negotiation and joint consultation by
means of the National and Departmental Whitley Councils (see p. 66), corre¬
sponding to the Joint Industrial Councils in industry. The two sides of the National
Whitley Council are parties to a Civil Service Arbitration Agreement which, sub¬
ject to certain limitations, provides that if there is failure to reach agreement by
negotiation a Department or Association may report the dispute to the Minister
of Labour and National Service for reference to the Civil Service Arbitration
Tribunal. The Tribunal is an independent one appointed by the Minister by virtue
of his powers under the Industrial Courts Act, 1919. Industrial employees of the
central Government, however, are organised by trades and not by Departments;
negotiations regarding their wages and conditions of employment take place on
Trade Joint Councils and Departmental Joint Councils.
In local government services there are separate National Whitley Councils for
the main grades of employees (e.g., manual, clerical and technical employees, and
road-menders, see p. 73) which deal with wages and conditions 01 service as well
as other matters. There are corresponding Regional and District Councils.
In the nationalised industries, the main corporations, though not subject to
detailed governmental control, have a statutory duty to establish satisfactory
arrangements for collective bargaining in their industries and for joint consultation
with their employees; but in carrying out these duties they are free to choose the
arrangements that suit them. In nearly every case a complex system which already
existed before nationalisation has been taken over and modified. The arrangements,
therefore, as in industry generally, vary substantially. The main difference from
private industry is that the corporations are not members of employers associa¬
tions. In some industries they are sole or main employers, but even where part of
the industry is in private hands, as for example in air or road transport, the corpora¬
tions are separately and directly represented on wage-negotiating bodies.
Northern Ireland
The system of labour relations in Northern Ireland is based on the same prin¬
ciples as that of Great Britain and, in these matters, the Minister of Labour and
National Insurance has powers and duties broadly similar to those of the Minister
of Labour and National Service in Great Britain. About 90 per cent of trade
unionists in Northern Ireland are members of trade unions whose headquarters
are in Great Britain.
WORKING CONDITIONS: THE LEGISLATIVE BACKGROUND
Employers have a duty at common law to take reasonable care of their employees
and provide a safe system of working, while employees have a duty of care to each
394
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
other. In addition, minimum required standards of safety, health and welfare are
laid down in a number of statutes.
The principal Acts involving enforcement of standards of safety, health or welfare
are: the Public Health Acts; the Employment of Women, Young Persons and
Children Act, 1920; the Children and Young Persons Act, 1933; the Employment
of Women and Young Persons Act, 1936; the Young Persons (Employment) Act,
1938; the Factories Acts, 1937 and 1948; the Mines and Quarries Act, 1954; the
Shops Act, 1950; and the Agriculture (Safety, Health and Welfare Provisions) Act,
1956. There are a number of other Acts dealing with particular requirements or
particular occupations.
Powers of Local Authorities
Local authorities, under the Public Health Acts, have power to regulate the
provision of suitable sanitary accommodation in houses and at places of work and
to treat workplaces which are dirty or badly ventilated or overcrowded as nuisances
whose abatement can be enforced. They have also wide powers under the Children
and Young Persons Act, 1933, as modified by the Education Act, 1944, to regulate
hours and conditions of employment of children in their areas within the limits laid
down by national legislation. Apart from this, national legislation forbids the em¬
ployment of children under 13 years of age, and forbids the employment of children
between the ages of 13 and 15 during school hours, or before 6 a.m. or after 8 p.m. on
any day, or for more than two hours on schooldays or on Sundays. The employment
of children in any industrial undertaking before they reach the age of 15 is prohibited.
Shops
The Shops Act, 1950, requires local authorities to ensure that shops in their area
observe the requirements of the Act with regard to closing hours and the working
conditions of employees, which include special requirements about the hours of
work of young persons. In general, shops must be closed on weekdays by 8 p.m.
(9 p.m. on one late day) except on the early closing day when they must be closed
by 1 p.m. With certain exceptions, shops must be closed on Sundays. The hours of
work of employees under 16 years of age are restricted to 44 a week, and those of
employees between 16 and 18 years of age to 48 a week, with limited provision for
overtime. All shop assistants must be given a half-holiday (half a day) every week
and, in addition, every Sunday off or another day off instead. Local authorities also
have powers to ensure reasonable minimum standards of ventilation, temperature,
lighting, sanitary accommodation and washing facilities in shops.
Industrial Premises
About a quarter of a million industrial premises (factories, shipyards, docks and
warehouses) and over 25,000 building and civil engineering sites come under the
Factories Acts, 1937 and 1948, which are administered by the Ministry of Labour
and National Service and enforced by H.M. Inspectorate of Factories, which forms
part of the Ministry. Any person intending to use premises as a factory has to notify
the Inspector of Factories of his intention not less than one month before he begins
to occupy them.
Under the Acts, every accident causing three days’ incapacity or more must be
reported to H.M. Inspectors of Factories; provision is also made for compulsory
notification and investigation of certain industrial poisonings and diseases, and, in
addition, a number of general and specific requirements for safety, health and
welfare are laid down.
Safety requirements include provisions concerning the fencing of prime movers,
transmission machinery and dangerous parts of other machinery; the sale, hire or use
LABOUR
395
of power-driven machinery without effective guards of certain parts; the cleaning of
machinery in motion; the training and supervision of young persons employed at
certain machines; the examination of hoists and lifting equipment, steam boilers
and steam and air receivers; the construction of floors; precautions against falls,
against gassing, and against explosions of inflammable dust or gas; means of escape
in case of fire; the protection of the eyes; the handling of dangerous substances;
and the lifting of heavy weights.
There are also general requirements with regard to health, including cleanliness
of workrooms, the provision and maintenance of proper accommodation and venti¬
lation and of suitable temperatures and lighting, the avoidance of over-crowding
and the provision of sanitary accommodation; and with regard to welfare, including
the provision of washing facilities, lockers or other accommodation for outdoor
clothing, drinking water, first aid and adequate seating arrangements.
All young persons under 18 years of age must, on entry to employment in
factories, at docks, or on building operations, be medically examined by doctors
appointed by the Chief Inspector of Factories and known as Appointed Factory
Doctors (see p. 402), and they must be re-examined annually until they reach the
age of 18. The hours permitted to be worked by women and young persons between
the ages of 16 and 18 are limited to 48 in a week and 9 in a day, although some over¬
time is allowed (up to six hours a week but not more than xoo hours a year nor
in more than 25 weeks in a year). Young persons under 16 years of age are limited
to 44 hours a week. Adequate intervals for meals must be arranged for women and
young persons and the employment of women and girls at night is, in general,
prohibited. Women and young persons are also prohibited from working in certain
specified processes concerned with lead compounds.
These requirements for safety, health and welfare are supplemented or modified
by regulations providing for safeguards against special risks to health or safety. The
regulations cover particular industries, processes, and types of machinery, and they
include provision for the compulsory periodic medical examination of workers in
certain specified industrial processes.
Mines and Quarries
The safety, health and welfare of workers in mines and quarries are the subject
of comprehensive legislation. Protective legislation in mines began with an Act of
1842, which forbade the employment of women underground; successive measures
laid down detailed requirements for the safe conduct of operations and dealt with
such matters as ventilation, dust suppression, support of workings, the safe use of
electricity, rescue and first aid. The latest stage was reached when the Mines and
Quarries Act was passed in 1954. This Act established the basic modern principles
of safety, health and welfare, leaving the details to be dealt with in statutory
regulations; it both consolidates the previous law and brings it up to date. Apart
from technical matters, it also covers such subjects as the general responsibilities of
owners and managements, the appointment and duties of officials, training, welfare,
the powers of official inspectors, statutory qualifications of managers and under¬
managers, employment of women and young persons, and inspections on behalf
of workmen.
The Ministry of Power is generally responsible for the administration of these
enactments, while the Mines and Quarries Inspectorate, which is part of that
Ministry, is directly responsible for their enforcement.
Agriculture
In agriculture, special attention has been paid to the protection of workers against
risks of poisoning, due to the use of toxic chemicals, and the Agriculture (Poisonous
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
396
Substances) Act, 1952, imposed necessary safeguards. The Agriculture (Safety,
Health and Welfare Provisions) Act, 1956, provides for securing the safety, health
and welfare of persons employed in agriculture by means of regulations made by
the ministers concerned with agriculture in Great Britain.
Transport
The general safety legislation covering the main forms of transport protects
transport workers as well as members of the public against accidents involving
moving vehicles.
The Minister of Transport and Civil Aviation is responsible for the administra¬
tion of the Merchant Shipping Acts, which cover in great detail the question of
marine safety, including navigational procedures, the strength and design of hulls,
the safety of machinery, the safety and design of living quarters, life-saving
appliances, measures for protection against fire, and the carriage of special cargoes
and dangerous goods.
Air safety regulations and orders provide for the registration of aircraft and for the
issue of certificates of airworthiness and of competency certificates for aircrew,
lay down standards for safety equipment and for safety procedures during take-off,
flight and landing, and prescribe maintenance schedules for public transport aircraft.
The Minister delegates most of his powers in respect of air safety to an Air
Registration Board (see p. 361).
Fhe Minister of Transport and Civil Aviation exercises technical supervision of
the safety aspects of railway construction and operation through an inspectorate,
whose main functions are statutory approval of new works on railways carrying
passenger traffic; accident investigation, including the holding of formal inquiries;
and technical advice to the Minister on general railway matters.
In the interests of road safety, the hours of driving and the rest periods of drivers
of buses and goods vehicles are regulated by the Road Traffic Acts.
In addition to general safety legislation, there are certain statutory provisions
concerned entirely, or mainly, with the safety, health and welfare of employees, for
example, railway employees are protected by the Railway Employment (Prevention
of Accidents) Act, 1900, and the Statutory Rules and Orders made under it, which
sanction the appointment of Railway Employment Inspectors to inquire into the
more serious accidents to railway employees and enable the Ministry of Transport
and Civil Aviation to require the use of safe plant and appliances, to forbid what is
unsafe, and to make rules for safe railway operation. Similarly, the far-reaching
and detailed requirements of the Merchant Shipping Acts and the regulations
made thereunder include specific provisions for the protection of merchant seamen
covering such matters as the engagement and discharge of seamen, limitations on
the employment of young persons at sea, standards of crew accommodation, scales
of provisions, medicines and medical stores, and the care and repatriation of
seamen left behind at ports abroad.
Employment of Young Persons
The Young Persons (Employment) Act, 1938, imposes restrictions on the hours
of work of young persons (48 a week under 18 years and 44 a week under 16 years)
in certain occupations not covered by the Factories Acts, 1937 and 1948, the Mines
and Quarries Act, 1954, or the Shops Act, 1950.
Northern Ireland
The safety, health and welfare of employees in Northern Ireland have been the
subject of legislation which, with certain exceptions, is similar to that in Great
Britain and is embodied in separate statutes to meet the special requirements of
LABOUR
397
Northern Ireland. Provision for the safety, health and welfare of workers in
factories, workshops, ship and building yards and certain other working premises
is embodied in the Factories Acts (Northern Ireland), 1939 and 1949. The Minister
of Labour and National Insurance is responsible for the administration of these
Acts and for their enforcement by a factory inspectorate, which forms part of his
Department.
WORKING CONDITIONS IN PRACTICE
Earnings
Minimum or standard time rates for most British manual workers, as determined
by agreements or wages orders, vary between 3s. and 4s. id. an hour for men
and between 2s. and 2s. nd. for women. Actual earnings are usually higher.
Higher rates are sometimes paid, and piece rates, shift rates and overtime rates
raise the level of average earnings. The Ministry of Labour and National Service
conducts a six-monthly survey of earnings and hours of work of manual workers in
manufacturing industries and in some of the principal non-manufacturing industries
in Great Britain. The survey made in October 1957 covered just under 7 million
workers and showed the average hourly earnings in all the industries covered to
be as follows:
Men 21 years and over . . . . . . . . 5s. 2-6d.
Youths and boys under 21 years . . . . . . 2s. 5-2d.
Women 18 years and over . . . . . . . . 3s. l-7d.
Girls under 18 years .. . . . . . • • • 2s. 0-3d.
All workers .. . . .. . • • • • • 4s. 6-9d.
Average weekly earnings were:
Men . . . . . . . • • • • • • • 251s. 7d.
Youths .. . . .. . • • • • • • • 108s. 4d.
Women .. . . . . • • • • • • • ■ 129s. 6d.
Girls .. . . .. • ■ • • • • • • 85s. 2d.
All workers . . .. . ■ • • • • • • 212s. 5d.
The principal industries not covered by this survey of earnings were agriculture,
where the average weekly earnings for regular adult male workers were 184s. lod.
in the half year April 1957 to September 1957; coalmining, where according to
information collected by the National Coal Board, the average weekly cash earnings
for men were 326s. 4d., plus 16s. 4d. in kind, in October 1957 J railway services,
in which average weekly earnings in March 1957 (including those of non-manual
workers but excluding those of higher paid salaried staff), were 229s. sd. for men
and 137s. for women; and dock labour, in which average weekly earnings of dock
workers employed by the National Dock Labour Board for October to December
1957 were 279s. sd.
Since 1947, average weekly wage rates have increased by about 75 per cent and
average weekly earnings have doubled. Must of the increase in wage rates has been
offset by a rise in the cost of living. The trends of manual workers’ earnings, wage
rates and retail prices since 1947 are shown in the diagram on p. 398-
The difference between men’s and women’s earnings in industry is due mainly
to the fact that women are for the most part engaged on different tasks from men
and are paid less than men on the grounds that these tasks are unskilled or semi¬
skilled. In the relatively few instances in the field of manual employment where
men and women are employed on the same work, collective agreements frequently
provide for equal remuneration.
398
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
There are no similarly detailed and comprehensive figures for the rates of pay
and earnings of non-manual workers, as these are often based on individual con¬
tracts, except in the public service, teaching and retail distribution. The rather
limited evidence suggests that the majority of male non-manual workers—the
clerks and shop-assistants have average earnings little different in range from
those of manual workers, but the earnings of women in these occupations are some¬
what higher than in manual occupations. The pay of shop-assistants is on scales
prescribing weekly minima from about £6 15s. to £9 3s. for men and £4 16s. 6d.
to £6 12s. 6d. for women. The Office Management Association makes periodical
surveys of clerical salaries. The latest survey, of 1st March, 1958, which covers
968 establishments, employing 89,977 clerks, shows that the average weekly
salaries for young inexperienced clerks ranged mainly from 71s. 4d. to 101s. gd. for
youths and from 6is. 6d. to 88s. 6d. for girls, while average salaries for adult male
clerks ranged from £9 4s. 8d. for the lowest grade of skill and responsibility to
£IS I4S- 5d. the highest. Corresponding women’s salaries were 25-30 per cent less.
The starting salaries in many professional and technical careers are often in the
range of £350 to £500 a year; such posts offer increments and opportunities for
promotion, but as recently as 1954-55 only about o-8 per cent of all employees
were earning over £2,000 a year, only about 0-3 per cent over £3,000 and less than
o-i per cent over £6,000. Additional information about the spread of incomes in
different occupations is available from unofficial sources; for example, the national
sample surveys of personal incomes and savings made in the spring of 1952 by
H. F. Lydalland in the spring of 1954 by T.P. Hall. Table 29 is based on their surveys.

BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Most of the senior posts in business, the professions and the Civil Service are in
the range of £ 1,000 to £5,000 a year. The posts with salaries of £5,000 to £10,000
a year include those of Cabinet Ministers, chairmen and some other members of
the boards of nationalised industries, judges of the High Court and Court of Appeal,
and Lords of Appeal, the Permanent Secretaries to certain Government Depart¬
ments, the clerks of the largest municipal authorities, a few persons outstanding in
their professions and the top-management of large businesses. A few persons in
business draw still higher salaries.
Women have the same right of entry as men to nearly all public offices, admini¬
strative posts and professions. They are paid the same salary for doing the same
work in medicine, dentistry, physiotherapy, radiography, university teaching,
journalism, broadcasting and architecture, and as Ministers of the Crown, Members
of Parliament, salaried magistrates and solicitors, pharmacists working in hospitals,
and administrative, professional and technical workers in local government. Women
in independent professions are not expected to charge lower fees than men. In
most other occupations, however, a woman in Britain doing the same job as a man
is at present paid less for doing it, although the position is changing. The Govern¬
ment has stated that it accepts the principle of equal pay, and steps are being taken
to put it into effect by stages in the public services. In January 1955, the Chancellor
of the Exchequer announced Government acceptance of a scheme for progressive
increases in the salary scales of non-industrial women civil servants to make these
identical with men’s scales by 1961; in April 1955, the Minister of Education
announced approval of similar proposals by the Burnham Committee (the advisory
body concerned with teachers’ salaries) for equal pay for women teachers; and in
the same month it was decided that equal pay for all women in administrative
departments of local authorities should also be introduced by stages. Since then
similar proposals have been agreed for certain other salaried workers, including
the staffs of the National Health Service and of the electricity and gas authorities
and of the British Transport Commission. Women’s salaries outside the public
service are beginning to be similarly adjusted.
Hours of Work
While, as already stated, the hours of work of women and young persons between
the ages of 16 and 18 in industrial and certain other occupations are limited by law
to 48 a week and those of young persons under 16 to 44 a week, normal hours of
work for all ages and sexes are usually shorter. Agreed weekly hours mainly vary
between 42 and 46, averaging between 44 and 45, and may be worked as either a
five-day or a five-and-a-half-day week according to the industry and the rule of the
particular establishment. Hours actually worked are somewhat longer owing to
overtime working. The survey conducted by the Ministry of Labour and National
Service in October 1957 into earnings and hours of manual workers showed that
average weekly hours actually worked were as follows:
• • •. .. .. 48-2 hours
44-5 hours
41- 2 hours
42- 1 hours
46-4 hours
Holidays with Pay
With a few exceptions, manual workers (including shop assistants) in industries
covered by agreements or statutory Orders are entitled to paid holidays of twelve

days or two weeks. Moreover, payment is made for bank or statutory public holidays,
which are as follows: in addition to Good Friday and Christmas Day, there are
Bank Holidays in England, Wales, and the Channel Islands on Easter Monday,
Whit-Monday, the first Monday in August and the first weekday after Christmas
(Boxing Day), and in Scotland on New Year’s Day, the first Monday in May, and
the first Monday in August. Northern Ireland observes all the English holidays
and, in addition, has a Bank Holiday on St. Patrick’s Day, 17th March, and a
statutory public holiday on 12th July (commemorating the Battle of the Boyne,
1690), Easter Tuesday is also a customary holiday for industry and trade. Many
agreements provide that payment should also be made for specially proclaimed
holidays.
Safety
Safety depends in practice at least as much on the education and voluntary efforts
of the employers and of the workers as upon safety regulations. There are over a
quarter of a million workplaces in Great Britain subject to the Factories Acts. The
total strength of the Factory Inspectorate including medical and other specialists
was 383 before decisions to strengthen it, and in particular to triple its chemical
and engineering staff, were reached in the autumn of 1956. When the decisions
have been fully implemented, its strength will be about 440. In June 1958 there
were 1,710 mines (including 821 main coal mines) and 4,750 quarries, including
300 opencast coal sites; the total strength of the mines and quarries inspectorate
was 146. Except in coal mines, prevention of accidents by frequent inspection is
impracticable. The concern of both trade unions and employers’ associations with
safety helps to maintain safety standards, and the requirements about accident
notification (see p. 394) help inspectors to take up the means of prevention with
employers, machinery manufacturers and interested organisations. But the volun¬
tary co-operation of managements and employees in individual workplaces is
obviously essential to the safety drive. The Accident Prevention Movement, a
voluntary educational campaign, is strongly supported by the Factory and Mines
and Quarries Inspectorates. Inspectors inquire into safety aspects of machine
design and specification, circulate expert advice by personal exhortation, lectures
and literature, and encourage the appointment of Safety Officers and the forma¬
tion of Works Safety Committees. An Industrial Health and Safety Centre in
London is maintained by the Ministry of Labour and National Service. The
Industrial Safety Training Centre in Birmingham is a voluntary organisation for
education and training in practical safety methods. The Royal Society for the Pre¬
vention of Accidents helps the Accident Prevention Movement by providing pub¬
licity and by organising conferences and courses for Safety Officers. The British
Colour Council has evolved a code of safety colours.
Organisations in industry are now concerning themselves to an increasing extent
with the promotion of safety at work and the provision of information and advisory
services to their members. They participate also in Joint Standing and Advisory
Committees established by the Chief Inspector of Factories. Representatives of
the Trades Union Congress, the British Employers’ Confederation, the nationalised
industries and the Ministry of Labour and National Service meet on the Industrial
Safety Sub-Committee of the National Joint Advisory Council.
Both transport operators and the Ministry of Transport and Civil Aviation give
high priority to safety measures affecting crews and passengers. Every endeavour
is made to counter the higher risks resulting from rising traffic densities, by
improvement in the design of vehicles, transport plant and equipment, by traffic
regulation and control of standards of maintenance and by the training of crews in
402
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
competency and safety awareness. The detailed regulations and instructions issued
by the Ministry and its agents form the basis of elaborate safety procedures laid
down by the operators themselves and by the makers of vehicles, equipment and
works. The radio industry and the transport services co-operate in the development
and application of radar systems and other safety devices (see pp. 368-9).
Fatal and serious industrial accidents have tended to diminish during the
twentieth century. They rose somewhat in factories during the early years of the
second world war. Since then, however, there has been a further decline, though
accidents sufficiently serious to cause at least three days’ absence still happen to
three per cent of male factory employees every year and one per cent of female
factory employees. Most of these accidents are due to quite ordinary causes—
the handling of goods, the use of hand-tools, or falls—and only a sixth are caused
by power-driven machinery. Fatal accidents reported in 1957 in factories and other
places of employment subject to the Factories Acts numbered 650. Fatal accidents
in mines and quarries numbered 441. The total of fatal industrial accidents in
factories, mines and quarries and railways, and on trading and fishing vessels
numbered 1,415.
Health and Welfare
Employers frequently achieve health and welfare standards considerably higher
than those prescribed by law. They are helped to do this by the inspectorates, by
Government Departments and agencies, by employers’ associations and trade
unions and by expert voluntary bodies.
An increasing number of firms in Britain provide a whole-time or part-time
doctor, an industrial nurse, and a canteen with hot meals, pay part or all of the
cost of clubs and sports grounds, operate retirement and sickness insurance schemes
supplementing the State insurance schemes, and afford training and educational
facilities. Some have their own rehabilitation centres or support convalescent
homes.
Periodic medical examinations are compulsory in factories for all young
workers under 18 years of age and for adults in certain dangerous occupations where
such examinations are of preventive value. These are carried out by some 2,000
Appointed Factory Doctors, most of whom are engaged on a part-time basis.
In addition, a number of employers maintain medical services for their employees,
and it is estimated that there are altogether about 4,000 doctors, including over
400 full-time doctors and several thousand nurses and assistant nurses, in the
industrial health services. Increasing numbers of doctors and nurses are taking up
this work, which aims to provide an occupational health service of a specialised
preventive character which does not duplicate the personal services already pro¬
vided by the National Health Service.
The big employers, including the State and the boards of nationalised industries,
have naturally taken the lead in this expansion, and a number of smaller factories
are also covered, either because of special risks or because of their progressive
outlook. There are, however, difficult problems to be solved in connection with
the further development of industrial health services, and in 1955 the Minister of
Labour and National Service appointed a Standing Industrial Health Advisory
Committee, of which he is the chairman, to advise him on this subject. The
membership of this committee includes persons nominated by the British
Employers’ Confederation, the Trades Union Congress, the nationalised industries,
the British Medical Association, the Royal College of Nursing and other organisa¬
tions and bodies closely concerned with the promotion of industrial health. This
committee has given considerable attention to the need for further work to determine
LABOUR
4°3
more precisely the situation concerning industrial health services. With its
advice two pilot surveys have been undertaken, one of a particular locality and one
of a particular industry, for the purpose of obtaining detailed factual information
on the situation. It is expected that their results will make a most valuable
contribution and will point the way to further progress.
Prompt and effective action in the field of industrial health depends, among
other things, on adequate and properly co-ordinated arrangements for investigation
and research. Field investigations are carried out by H.M. Factory Inspectorate of
the Ministry of Labour and National Service which has specialised medical and
technical branches. Research facilities are provided by Government agencies such
as the Medical Research Council, the Department of Scientific and Industrial
Research, and the Government Chemist; by the faculties of industrial health and
social medicine of the universities; and by the research departments of various
industries and large industrial concerns. Co-ordination is provided by a number
of general and special committees.
Welfare standards vary considerably from one factory to another. Between a
third and a half of the factory workers of the country are employed by small firms
employing fewer than 250 workers, many of which, largely for economic reasons,
have not raised their standard of welfare as much as the larger firms.
The amenities provided by large factories depend partly on the employees’ needs
and desires. The requirements of a factory where the work is light, and many
employees are women or young persons, are different from those of an iron foundry
or steelworks, where much of the work is arduous, and is undertaken by men.
Progressive firms are careful to find out what their employees want, and welfare
policy is often decided in consultation with the workers, whether through regular
consultative machinery or by other means.
During and since the second world war the provision of meals for workers at
their place of work has become usual in large undertakings and quite common in
smaller ones. At the end of 1957 over 19,000 industrial premises were providing
their workers with canteen facilities. There were also some 1,000 colliery canteens
providing meals for about 98 per cent of coalminers. Any surplus earned by can¬
teens is used to improve the canteen or to finance some other welfare services.
Losses are borne by the firms.
Human Relations in Industry
In recent years there has been a marked increase of interest in ‘human
relations’ in industry, i.e. relations between management and their workers as
individuals, as distinct from relations between organisations of employers and
organisations of workers. This has led to more widespread attention being given
to all aspects of personnel management and to the establishment of more personnel
departments. Practically every large industrial firm and many small ones now have
a personnel department staffed by one or more specialist officers. While the form of
organisation of personnel departments varies, the personnel officer is generally
responsible for advising all levels of management on every aspect of labour
relations. This officer also has particular duties with regard to recruitment,
selection, education and training, transfer of labour, the application of wage
agreements, the promotion of joint consultation and the supervision of working
conditions and employee services.
Since the end of the second world war, there has been an intensification of the
educational and training activities arranged by industry. Short-term training is
almost entirely the responsibility of individual firms, but in over 100 sections of
industry and commerce, employers and trade unions have agreed national or
404
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
regional schemes of apprenticeship and other long-term training. Further expansion
and improvement of training facilities have been urged in the report of a sub¬
committee of the National Joint Advisory Council. This report, published in
February 1958 under the title Training for Skill, stressed that the increase in the
number of young people leaving school in the next few years afforded a great
opportunity to increase the supply of skilled workers and technicians, and proposed
that a council should be formed by industry to follow up its various recommendations.
This led to the establishment, in July 1958, of the Industrial Training Council,
composed of representatives of the British Employers’ Confederation, the Trades
Union Congress and the nationalised industries.
Both voluntary and official organisations have been concerned with the promo¬
tion of better human relationships in industry. The voluntary organisations include
bodies which deal with management problems and provide a service to subscribing
firms, professional associations linking individuals who have a common interest in
particular functions of management and administration, and bodies which provide
specialist services usually on a fee-paying basis.
In I945> the Ministry of Labour and National Service established a Personnel
Management Advisory Service which has done much to promote good personnel
management and to assist firms by discussing problems of personnel policy. The
service is staffed by a team of experienced Personnel Officers recruited from
industry.
The Government has sought to extend by research the available knowledge of
the factors influencing human relations in industry and human efficiency. Research
units of the Medical Research Council (MRC) have worked on these problems
for many years. In 1948} the Advisory Council on Scientific Policy set up a com¬
mittee on industrial productivity, one of whose panels was a human relations panel
responsible for two major research projects on the problems of joint consultation.
In March 1953, the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research (DSIR)
and the Medical Research Council set up two committees concerned with research
on the human factor in industry, the Committee on Human Relations in Industry
and the Committee on Individual Efficiency in Industry. Finance for the research
piojects approved by these committees was derived partly from the Exchequer and
partly from the counterpart funds of United States Conditional Aid to the United
Kingdom.
The Committee on Pluman Relations approved a number of projects for research
into such questions as factors influencing the effectiveness of incentive payment
schemes, factors facilitating and restricting the introduction of new techniques and
methods in industry, characteristics of management organisation affecting produc¬
tivity, industrial education, training and promotion, and the problems of the
effective employment in industry of special groups such as older persons and
married women.
The Committee on Individual Efficiency concerned itself with research into such
matters as the influence of equipment design and working tools on operator
efficiency, factors affecting the efficient utilisation of industrial engineering tech¬
niques, and training methods in industry.
T he results of this work are now appearing. The committees have been dis¬
banded, but the DSIR has appointed a new Committee on Human Sciences, while
units of the MRC are continuing research into cognate problems.
XII. FINANCE
PUBLIC FINANCE
Public finance is concerned with the way public authorities (i.e. the central
Government and local authorities) finance their activities—how their expenditure
is decided upon and how their revenue is obtained.
Money administered by public authorities1 can be roughly divided into two
categories:
1. The funds of the central Government, raised mainly by taxation, but also
in part by borrowing, and paid into and out of the Exchequer2 in accordance
with the proposals of the Government, as approved by Parliament (princi¬
pally the House of Commons).
There are also funds administered for special purposes by central Govern¬
ment Departments and wholly or partially maintained by receipts which
do not come from the Exchequer. The only important one is the National
Insurance Fund, administered by the Minister of Pensions and National
Insurance, used for the payment of benefits under the National Insurance
Scheme.
2. The funds of local authorities, obtained partly from rates (local taxes on
dwelling houses and other real estate) and income from property and trading
receipts, partly from grants and loans from the Exchequer, and partly from
loans raised in the open market.
The following broad account of Government finance will be concerned mainly
with the Exchequer and only incidentally with local government3 and other public
funds.
Financial control, as exercised by the House of Commons, is based on law,
parliamentary rights and custom.
As the power of Parliament grew in late medieval and Tudor times, the principle
that taxation by the Crown required parliamentary consent was gradually evolved.
The principle was established, at the end of the constitutional struggles of the
Stuart period, by the Bill of Rights, 1689.
In medieval, Tudor and Stuart times, it is broadly true to say that once the King
was granted the right to raise a given sum by taxation, he was free to spend it as he
chose. In the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, the House of Commons gradually
developed the modern system of controlling expenditure through the device of
Appropriation, which was embodied in its final form in the Exchequer and Audit
Departments Act, 1866.
From the very early days of Parliament it had been established that such financial
control as Parliament possessed should be exercised by the House of Commons.
This control became effective, as regards taxation, in the seventeenth century, but
1 For an account of public finance in Northern Ireland and its relationship to that of the
United Kingdom, see pp. 415-6.
2 The term ‘Exchequer’ took its name from the ‘chess-board’, or table with chequered
cloth, round which the King’s financial officials sat for accounting purposes in the twelfth
century.
3 For further information on local government finance, see pp. 73—5-
405
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
406
as regards expenditure it was not effective until the nineteenth century. The con¬
trolling power of the House of Commons is acknowledged today in the Speech from
the Throne at the opening of a new session of Parliament, which is addressed to
both Houses but contains a special paragraph addressed to the Commons alone.
The Commons have traditionally claimed that the Lords have no power to
modify financial provisions, though they may reject such provisions; thus, to mini¬
mise the chance of rejection, the practice was started in 1861 of embodying the main
financial provisions for the ensuing year in a single Bill. Since the passing of the
Parliament Act, 1911, however, the assent of the House of Lords is no longer needed
for a Bill certified by the Speaker to be a Money Bill (see pp. 34 and 35-6).
Today, the authority of the House of Commons has to be obtained for all expen¬
diture by the central Government itself and for the raising of revenue by taxation
or borrowing. All Government revenue is paid into the Government account with
the Bank of England—known as the Exchequer Account or the Consolidated Fund.
With certain exceptions (the main one, as previously stated, being National In¬
surance benefits), all payments by the Government come out of this account.
The following sections outline the machinery by which expenditure and revenue
are authorised and controlled, the purposes on which public money is spent and the
sources from which revenue is obtained.
ESTIMATES AND EXPENDITURE
Classification of Expenditure
Central Government expenditure falls into two main groups:
1. Expenditure which is specifically authorised by Act of Parliament without
limitation to any particular year. This expenditure includes the interest,
sinking fund and cost of management of the National Debt, the financial
provision made for members of the Royal Family, and salaries and pensions
of judges and certain high officers whose independence of the Government
is thought to be better guaranteed by permanent grant than by annual vote.
These Consolidated Fund Services represent a permanent charge on the
Consolidated Fund.
2. All other Government expenditure, which is authorised from year to year
and which includes all expenditure on defence, on the social services and on
the general administration of the country. These are called Supply Services
because the House of Commons, when voting money, is granting to the
Crown ‘such aids or supplies as are required to satisfy . . . the pecuniary
necessities of the Government’. It should be noted that some of this expen¬
diture may also depend on legislation, such as the National Health Sendee
Acts, relating to a specific object of expenditure.
Authorisation of Expenditure
The Estimates for these Supply Services are considered by the House of Com¬
mons in Committee of Supply (that is, in Committee of the whole House with the
Chairman of Committees, instead of the Speaker, in the Chair). The Committee
usually discusses public policy relevant to the Estimates, though any Estimate could
be examined in detail if members wished and if time allowed (see also p. 37).
Estimates for Supply Services in the financial year beginning on 1st April are
submitted to the Treasury by each Department in the preceding November and
December. Estimated expenditure is grouped under main headings called ‘Votes’
which are further broken down into subheads and items. If the House of Commons
approves the Estimates, the sums asked for are voted and later confirmed in the

Appropriation Act; this Act appropriates the money to specific Votes. Inside each
Vote, a ‘virement’, the spending of money on one subhead instead of on another,
is permissible so far as Parliament is concerned, but only with Treasury consent.
Departments are free to distribute expenditure within subheads as they please
subject to Treasury approval of the type of expenditure involved.
An excess of expenditure, or a new service not covered by the Vote, or a virement
of a magnitude or character which the Treasury considers should be brought to
the attention of Parliament, requires a Supplementary Estimate. The Treasury
exercises the same power of scrutiny over this as over the ordinary Estimates.
Scrutiny of Expenditure
Control of expenditure is maintained by the Treasury, by the Comptroller and
Auditor General, by the Select Committee on Public Accounts of the House of
Commons and by the Select Committee on Estimates.
The Treasury
The power of the Treasury to control expenditure derives from the responsibility
of the Chancellor of the Exchequer for the financial policy of the Government.
A central function of the Treasury is to present the Civil Estimates to the House
of Commons. In considering the Estimates submitted by Departments, the Treasury
has to weigh the advantages of administrative proposals against the monetary and
economic cost, taking into account current Government policy, to decide the rela¬
tive merits of expenditure proposed by different Departments and to eliminate any
overlapping, uneconomic or wasteful expenditure where this has escaped the net of
departmental financial control. Quite apart from the scrutiny of Estimates, through¬
out the year the Treasury keeps a close control over such matters as rates of pay
and the aggregate size of the staff in all Government Departments, in addition to
exercising a general supervision over all departmental expenditure. The Treasury
also lays down general rules of financial and accounting procedure for Departments
and prescribes the principles on which departmental contracts shall be made and
the limits within which losses may be written off.
The Comptroller and Auditor General
Control over issues of money to Departments and the audit of accounts is
exercised by the Comptroller and Auditor General, who holds a permanent appoint¬
ment as an officer of Parliament. Since 1866 he has had two functions: as Comp¬
troller of the Exchequer he controls entries and issues of public money to and from
the Exchequer Account; and as Auditor General he audits departmental accounts
and submits the Appropriation Accounts to Parliament. His statutory function is
to ensure that all expenditure is properly incurred, e.g., that no payments are made
which go beyond any relevant statutory authority, and that Treasury sanction has
been obtained wherever necessary. In addition, however, he has been encouraged
by successive Committees on Public Accounts (see the next paragraph) to examine
departmental expenditure with a view to drawing attention to any cases of apparent
waste or extravagance.
The Select Committee on Public Accounts
The accounts of each Department and the reports of the Comptroller and Auditor
General thereon are considered by the Select Committee on Public Accounts (PAC).
This was set up in 1861, by Mr. Gladstone, for the purpose of ensuring that expen¬
diture was properly incurred in accordance with the Estimates and with any relevant
Acts of Parliament, but it has since developed much wider powers. Nowadays
it may consider whether full value has been obtained for the sums spent by
2D
4°8
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Departments and it examines cases in which the administration appears to have been
faulty or negligent. The Committee has therefore become a powerful instrument
for the exposure of waste and inefficiency. It embodies its findings in Reports which
may be discussed in the House of Commons. Its recommendations are considered
by the Treasury in consultation with Departments and put into effect, so far as
they are accepted, according to Treasury instructions. If the recommendations are
not acceptable, a reasoned reply has to be submitted to the Committee, which may
either accept the objections or return to the charge in subsequent Reports.
Select Committee on Estimates
This Committee was originally set up in 1912 but was re-formed in 1929 with
wider terms of reference. Under these terms it has been re-appointed annually
except during the war years. The Committee’s functions are to examine the Esti¬
mates, to suggest the form in which they should be presented, and to report whether
there are any economies which could be made without altering the policy implied
in the Estimates. It is customary for the Committee to select each year a few aspects
of Government-voted services for review. In practice, the Estimates for the current
year are not affected, but the Committee’s recommendations may reinforce
Treasury control and influence the nature of expenditure in succeeding years.
THE BUDGET
‘Budget’ is an old word meaning a bag containing papers or accounts. The use
of the word in public finance originated in the expression ‘The Chancellor of the
Exchequer opened his Budget’, which was applied in Parliament to the annual
speech of the Chancellor of the Exchequer explaining his proposals for balancing
revenue and expenditure.
The Budget speech is the main occasion of the year for reviewing the financial
state of the nation, and its formal basis is the Chancellor’s proposals for raising
money by taxation. By the time the Budget is introduced (usually in April) the
Estimates of expenditure under various headings will have been presented to Parlia¬
ment and published, and the expected total of Government expenditure for the
year will be known. The Chancellor estimates the yield of the revenue on the basis
of existing taxation and proposes such changes in taxation as will provide whatever
surplus or deficit he considers desirable on economic grounds. These proposals are
later embodied in detail in a Finance Bill. The gap between the Budget Statement
and the Royal Assent to the Finance Bill (usually given in July) is covered by the
Provisional Collection of Taxes Act, 1913, whereby changes in income tax and
Customs and Excise duties have immediate statutory effect if adopted by Resolution
of the House of Commons.
The Budget speech also gives figures relating to certain payments of a capital
nature for which the Government has statutory power to borrow and which are
therefore excluded from the Budget expenditure met from revenue. These items
and others are set out in the part of the Budget which lies ‘below the line’.1
Budget Policy
The original purpose of the Budget was purely financial—to provide money for
Government expenditure. From an early stage, however, it was appreciated that
taxation would affect the distribution of income and property and the level of
1 Items ‘below the line’ are: (1) receipts applicable by statute to debt interest which
would otherwise be paid out of revenue; (2) receipts applicable to debt redemption; and
(3) payments for which the Treasury has power to borrow.
FINANCE
409
expenditure on particular goods and services. At a later period it was realised that
taxation also affected the nation’s total expenditure and therefore the general level
of economic activity. Since the second world war, Budgets have been consciously
designed in greater or lesser degree to bring the total demand for goods and services
into balance with the supplies which could be made available.
Direct taxation on income and property affects the distribution of wealth because
the rates vary according to the size of income and property, the proportion of a
high income taken in tax being much greater than the proportion of a small one;
at the same time, the services provided by the Government (whether in cash or
kind) are generally available to all, irrespective of wealth, but in some cases they are
specially designed to benefit people with lower incomes. Indirect, or outlay taxes
(see pp. 411-2) do not affect the distribution of income; their main purpose
has always been the raising of revenue, but by discouraging or encouraging
consumption of particular goods they can be used to influence the allocation of
resources and the pattern of trade.
The Budget affects the general level of expenditure and, therefore, the total
demand for goods and services, in the following way: if there is an increase in
Government expenditure without an increase in taxation then total demand for
goods and services will tend to rise; the same thing will happen if there is a decrease
in taxation without a decrease in Government spending. In this way the Budget
can be used to counter unemployment. On the other hand, if there is an increase
in taxation without an increase in Government expenditure or a decrease in Govern¬
ment expenditure without a decrease in taxation then the total demand for goods
and services will tend to fall. In this way the Budget can be used to counter inflation.
For some years after the war, budgetary policy was mainly designed to avoid
inflation by holding down consumer demand for goods and services so that it would
not hamper exports, investment or (since 1950) the defence programme. The
Budgets of 1951 and 1952 aimed also to hold down investment in the interests again
of exports and defence. By 1953, as total demand had fallen while productive
capacity had increased, some unused resources became available; in consequence,
there was a reduction of taxation in the 1953 Budget, which aimed particularly
at encouraging higher investment and production. These aims were continued
in the 1954 Budget, when, however, changes in taxation were much smaller than in
1953. The Budget of April 1955, which gave further tax reliefs, was followed in
October by a Supplementary Budget which had the purpose of reinforcing measures,
including a tighter credit policy, instituted earlier in the year with the object of
curtailing excessive internal demand and of strengthening the balance of payments
position. The Budget of April 1956 was designed to continue the drive against
over-spending and to provide new inducements to savers. During 1956 and 1957,
as a result of budgetary and other measures, inflationary pressure was reduced and
the balance of payments improved; consequently, in the Budget of 1957, it was
possible to make some reductions in the burden of taxation. The Budget of April
1958, which included some further taxation concessions—mainly in purchase tax
and profits tax—was intended to consolidate the country’s improved economic
position and to prepare for future expansion.
Sources of Revenue
Money to meet ‘Ordinary’ (mainly current) Budget expenditure of the central
Government is in normal years derived from taxation. Taxes can be divided into
two groups, direct and indirect, which correspond roughly to the duties collected
by the Board of Inland Revenue and by the Customs and Excise Department. The
most important Inland Revenue duties—income tax (including surtax), profits tax
4io
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
and estate duty (death duty)—are levied directly on the income or property of those
who, in general, have to bear them. Income tax on individual (though not on cor¬
porate) incomes and estate duty are progressive taxes, that is, larger incomes and
estates bear a proportionately higher rate of tax. Stamp duties, although not a
direct tax, are also collected by the Board of Inland Revenue. Taxes on motor
vehicles are collected by the principal local taxation authorities, which are the
county or county borough councils in England and Wales and the corresponding
councils in Scotland; the proceeds are paid by the local authorities to the Exchequer.
Income Tax, Surtax, and Profits Tax
Income tax is imposed at a standard rate for the year of assessment beginning
on 6th April. For 1958-59 the standard rate is 8s. 6d. in the fi. The tax imposed on
an individual is graduated by means of personal allowances and reliefs, by reduced
rates of tax on the first sections of taxable income,1 and by the surtax.2 In the case of
a married couple the incomes of husband and wife are aggregated and are treated as
one income, but a higher personal allowance is given than for a single person.
Examples of the amounts of income tax paid yearly by people with different
incomes and family responsibilities are shown in Table 30.
Most wages and salary earners pay their income tax under a PAYE (‘Pay-as-you-
earn’) Scheme, under which tax is deducted at source, thus enabling them to keep
up to date in tax payments.
Companies are liable at the standard rate of tax on their total income irrespective
of its amount; they are also subject to profits tax which, as from 1st April, 1958,
was levied at the rate of 10 per cent.
Certain relief from income tax and profits tax may be given to specified overseas
trade corporations; broadly speaking, these are companies which, though managed
and controlled in the United Kingdom, carry on all their trading activities overseas.
In general, income arising from sources within the United Kingdom is subject
to United Kingdom income tax, even though the person entitled to the income is
not resident in the United Kingdom, except in the case of certain Government
securities. Where the income arises from sources outside the United Kingdom,
tax is not chargeable unless the owner becomes chargeable as a resident. The
United Kingdom has entered into agreements with many countries providing
for relief from double taxation; where such agreements are not in force, the United
Kingdom allows unilateral relief.3
Estate Duty
Estate duty is chargeable on the value of property (whether legally settled or not)

1 The balance of income remaining after deduction of the personal allowances and
reliefs is taxable income. The first three sections of taxable income are charged at reduced
rates of income tax, and only the remainder is charged at the standard rate. For 1958-59
the reduced rates are: 2s. 3d. in the £ on the first £60; 4s. gd. in the £ on the next £150;
and 6s. gd. in the £ on the following £150.
2 The surtax, which is essentially an income tax at higher rates, is charged on personal
incomes exceeding £2,000 a year after deducting certain personal allowances in excess of
the single person’s basic allowance. It is imposed at rates which increase progressively
until (for 1958-59) on all income above £15,000 a year, income tax and surtax combined
amount to 18s. 6d. in the £.

deceased within five years of his death (one year in the case of a gift for public or
charitable purposes). Estates with a net capital value of £3,000 or less are exempt
from duty, but on estates of a higher value there is a progressive duty ranging from
1 per cent to 80 per cent.

(a) Age Relief. Where the taxpayer (or his wife) is 65 or over and his total income does not
exceed £800, age relief is given; this reduces the tax payable to that chargeable on the
earned income scale. Where the total income exceeds £800, marginal relief is given so that
the full tax on the investment income scale is not payable until marginal relief runs out.
(b) Age Exemption. Where the taxpayer is 65 or over and his total income does not exceed
£275, no tax is payable. Where the total income slightly exceeds £275, marginal rehet is
given so that the full tax is not payable until marginal relief runs out.

not exceed £440, no tax is payable. Where the total income slightly exceeds £44°> marginal
relief is given so that the full tax is not payable until marginal relief runs out.
Indirect Taxes
Most indirect or outlay taxes are customs and excise duties and are levied on
commodities or services. They are called indirect because the importer, manufac¬
turer, wholesaler, or provider of commodities or services pays them first and then
passes them on to the individual consumer in the form of higher retail prices.
Customs duties are levied on imported goods, and excise duties on goods pro¬
duced, and services provided, at home. The purchase tax, which is also collected
by the Customs and Excise Department, applies equally, and at the same rate, to
home-produced and to imported goods.
412
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
The system of customs duties is twofold in its purpose: it has the function of
providing a measure of protection for British industries or preference for products
imported from Commonwealth countries overseas and it has also the function, in
association with the excise system, of providing revenue.
The principal revenue duties collected by the Customs and Excise Department
are those on tobacco, alcoholic drinks, hydrocarbon oil (mainly petrol), entertain¬
ments (cinemas), betting, matches and sugar. The protective customs duties cover
a wider field, but their contribution to the yield of indirect taxation is relatively small.
Purchase tax is charged on a wide range of goods, nearly all of them consumer
goods, at rates varying from 5 per cent to 60 per cent of the wholesale value
Articles subject to revenue duties of the Customs and Excise Department are in
general exempt from this tax; other goods free of purchase tax include food, fuel,
books and newspapers, young children’s clothing and footwear, certain non-pro¬
prietary drugs and medicines, some household appliances and some textile articles.
THE EXCHEQUER ACCOUNTS, 1958-59
In the Budget of April 1958, total current expenditure for the financial year
ending 31st March, 1959, was estimated to reach £5,075 million, while the estimate
tor total current revenue (after allowing for taxation changes) was £5,439 million,
making a surplus of £364 million. These figures exclude self-balancing revenue and
expenditure (post office trading), for which the estimate was £368 million. ‘Below
the line’ total payments were estimated at £923 million, while total receipts were
estimated at £323 million leaving a deficit, to be borrowed or met from the surplus
on current account, of £600 million.
Table 31 shows the Budget estimates for 1958-59 in comparison with the out-turn
(Exchequer receipts and issues) for the previous year. The diagram on p. 414
illustrates the pattern of Government estimates of revenue and expenditure on
current account in 1958-59.
CAPITAL PAYMENTS AND RECEIPTS
i
In the last few years the main items of capital expenditure dealt with in the part of
the Budget statement which lies ‘below the line’ have been loans to local authorities
for housing and other investment; funds to meet capital expenditure by the Post
Office; war damage payments; working capital for the National Coal Board; and
loans to other nationalised industries. Capital receipts have come mainly from the
repayment of these loans. If, on balance, there is a deficit, it is met from the pro¬
ceeds of Government borrowing or from the surplus, if any, in ‘Ordinary’ revenue
and expenditure, i.e. ‘above the line’, while if there is a surplus it goes to reduce
the National Debt.
Since the war, new lending by the Government has exceeded loan repayment as,
in the main, repayments are spread over a long term. From 1945 to the end of 1952
local authorities relied on the Exchequer for virtually all their loans. As from
1st January, 1953, they were given permission to borrow on the open market In
his Budget Statement of October 1955, the Chancellor of the Exchequer announced
that local authorities had been asked to exercise restraint in their expenditure.
The volume of Government lending to them was restricted and the Public
Works Loan Board (see p. 75) put all applicants on inquiry as to their ability
to raise the finance on their own credit either in the stock market or in the mortgage
market. Any advances granted were at a rate of interest reflecting not Government
ere it, but the credit of local authorities of good standing in the market for loans
of comparable periods.

The National Debt
So far, borrowing on a large scale has been undertaken only to finance deficits
during or immediately after a war. The National Debt rose from £651 million in
1914 to £7,435 million at the end of the first world war, and from £7,131 million
in 1939 to £23,637 million in 1946. On the 31st March, 1958, the total National
Debt was £27,231 million, of which £2,163 million was repayable in currencies
other than sterling, mainly to the United States and Canadian Governments. Of
the £25,068 million of internal debt, about £5,194 million was short-term debt,
mainly in the form of 91-day bills on the Treasury, while the long-term loans
included a variety of stocks, bonds, loans, and certificates carrying fixed rates of
interest (ranging from 2J to 5^ per cent) and with fixed or indeterminate dates of
repayment.
PUBLIC FINANCE IN NORTHERN IRELAND
The general system of public finance in Northern Ireland is, in its main features,
similar to that operating in Great Britain, under which public revenues, with a few
minor exceptions, are paid into the Exchequer, from which no money can be with¬
drawn except on the authority of Parliament. That authority, as in Great Britain, is
expressed in the case of Consolidated Fund charges in permanent legislative form,
and in the case of Supply Services by annual Appropriation Acts based on estimates
prepared by Departments and sanctioned by the Ministry of Finance.
The major portion of the taxation in Northern Ireland, comprising customs and
excise duties, purchase tax, income tax, surtax, and profits tax, is levied and
collected by the United Kingdom Government and the proceeds are paid in the
first instance into the United Kingdom Exchequer. From this portion, known as
‘Reserved’ Revenue, there is deducted and retained by the United Kingdom Treas¬
ury, under the Government of Ireland Act, 1920, the sum contributed by Northern
Ireland towards Imperial Services (called the ‘Imperial Contribution’), the cost of
the administration of the Supreme Court, the Post Office, and other Reserved Ser¬
vices, and the cost of collecting Reserved Revenue. The balance, termed the ‘Resi¬
duary Share of Reserved Taxes’, is paid over to the Exchequer of Northern Ireland
and joins with the proceeds of taxes levied and collected by the Government of
Northern Ireland, called ‘Transferred’ Revenue, and with other non-tax receipts
of a miscellaneous nature to form the public income. The items of Transferred
Tax Revenue are estate duties, stamp duties, bookmakers’ licence duties, entertain¬
ments duty (cinemas), excise licence duties and motor vehicle duties.
A Joint Exchequer Board, representative of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,
constituted in accordance with the Government of Ireland Act, 1920, determines
the amount of Reserved Revenue and the cost of Reserved Services attributable to
Northern Ireland for each year, the amount of the Imperial Contribution and such
other questions affecting the financial relations of the two Governments as may be
referred to it.
In the Northern Ireland Budget for 1958-59 (year ending 31st March), total
revenues were forecast at £103-5 million and expenditure at £94-4 million. After
allowing for a small Budget surplus of £37,480, the Imperial Contribution was
provisionally estimated at £9 million.
The Public Debt of Northern Ireland, totalling £52 million at 31st March, 1958,
is fully covered by repayable advances and investments held by the Ministry of
Finance.
416
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Outside the Exchequer system in Northern Ireland, various funds have been
established, in addition to statutory Reserve and Sinking Funds, for specific pur¬
poses. In general, these funds follow the United Kingdom pattern, the principal
being those relating to National Insurance and Government loans. The latter con¬
stitutes a pool of capital funds available for local and public authority borrowings;
at 31st March, 1958, a sum of approximately £73 million was outstanding against
such authorities.
BANKING AND PRIVATE FINANCE
The British banking system is long established and well integrated. It consists of
a Central Bank; of commercial banks which carry on the usual main banking
services; of the United Kingdom offices of various banks whose main business is in
other countries; and of various specialised banks and similar financial institutions.
The Bank of England
The Bank of England is the Central Bank and its principal business is to act as
banker to the Government and to the other banks, as the agent of the Government
for important financial operations and as the central note-issuing authority; it also
maintains relations with central banks overseas. It was established in 1694 by Act
of Parliament as a corporate body, and its entire capital stock was acquired by the
Government under the Bank of England Act, 1946.
As the central bank, the Bank of England acts in conjunction with other banks
and financial institutions in co-ordinating the application of the Government’s
monetary policy. One of the main instruments for this purpose is the Bank Rate1—
the minimum rate at which the Bank of England will discount approved bills of
exchange.
As banker to the Government, the Bank of England holds the main Government
accounts and it acts as the Government’s agent for the issue and registration of
Government loans. It also operates, for the Treasury, the administration of ex¬
change control which has been in force since 1939.
The commercial banks maintain large balances with the Bank of England and
these balances form part of the banks’ cash reserves.
The Bank of England has the sole right in England and Wales of issuing bank
notes. Notes thus issued need a 100 per cent cover in gold and securities, the part
covered by the latter being the ‘Fiduciary Issue’, the level of which is subject to
parliamentary control. In practice very little gold is now held by the Issue Depart¬
ment of the Bank of England, the bulk of the United Kingdom gold (and foreign
exchange) reserves being in a separate account, known as the Exchange Equalisa¬
tion Account, originally established in 1932, for the purpose of checking undue
fluctuation in the exchange value of sterling. The provision of coin for circulation
is the responsibility of a Government Department, the Royal Mint.
The Commercial Banks
The banks handling the major part of the domestic banking business in the
United Kingdom are, in the main, limited liability companies which are subject to
the ordinary law relating to such companies.
1 The Bank Rate was reduced, on 20th March, 1958, from 7 per cent to 6 per cent;
on 22nd May, 1958, to 5^ per cent; on 19th June, 1958, to 5 per cent; and on 14th August,
1958, to 44 per cent.
FINANCE 417
Some of the main distinguishing features of the United Kingdom commercial
banks are:
1. A relatively small number of banks control a large number of branches.
United Kingdom banking members of the British Bankers’ Association
number 29 (including 11 London clearing banks, 6 banks in Scotland and
3 in Northern Ireland); these banks control nearly 12,500 branches and have
total assets of over £8,000 million.
2. The volume of cheques handled is very large and, in spite of a stamp duty
of 2d. on each cheque, many payments—and even relatively small payments
—are made by cheque. The average daily value of cheques, drafts, bills and
bankers’ effects cleared in 1957 through the London and Provincial Clearing
Houses was £562 million; and many cheques do not, for various reasons,
pass through Clearing Houses.
3. It is the practice of the chief United Kingdom banks to maintain a ratio of
about 8 per cent between cash reserves and total deposits (of which about
two-thirds are repayable on demand, the remainder being deposits at
interest and subject to notice).
On an average, in 1957, about 35 per cent of the banks’ deposits were
covered by cash and short-term securities, while longer-term securities
amounted to about 31 per cent and advances to customers to about 30 per
cent of total deposits. In financing industry, British banks usually provide
only short-term advances. In July 1958, however, English clearing banks,
for the first time, acquired holdings in hire-purchase finance companies.
4. Certain banks in Scotland and Northern Ireland have retained limited rights
to issue notes; these issues must, apart from an amount for each bank which
is specified by legislation, be fully covered by Bank of England notes and
by coin.
United Kingdom Offices of Banks Operating Mainly Overseas
The importance of London as a financial and trading centre and as the largest
city of the British Commonwealth has encouraged many banks whose main business
is in other Commonwealth countries and foreign countries to maintain London
offices1; in some cases, indeed, the institutions concerned are United Kingdom
companies and the London office is the head office. These London offices form part
of the complex structure engaged in the financing of trade not only between the
United Kingdom and other countries but also in goods which are shipped direct
between other countries.
Savings Banks and the National Savings Movement
The function of Trustee and Post Office Savings Banks is to provide facilities for
the investment of voluntary savings and particularly of the small savings of persons
with low incomes. Both these types of banks were well established during the
nineteenth century. The growth of their business was, however, encouraged in the
first world war when the War Savings Committee was set up under Government
auspices to promote an official savings drive. A new type of long-term security for
the small investor was inaugurated at that time. This was the National Savings
Certificate, with interest payable only on encashment, but free of income tax. From
this war-time drive originated the present National Savings Movement devoted to
Twenty-eight overseas banks are members of the British Bankers’ Association.
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
418
the encouragement of the widespread investment of savings in Trustee Savings
Banks and the Post Office Savings Bank and in National Savings Certificates and
Defence Bonds. The policy of the movement is determined by the National Savings
Committee for England and Wales and similar committees for Scotland and
Northern Ireland.1 The committees are bodies of independent persons representing
regional savings organisations and various national institutions connected with
such matters as finance, industry and education. They are assisted by a salaried
staff of civil servants. Voluntary local savings committees, often assisted or pro¬
moted by local authorities, co-ordinate the work of voluntary local savings groups.
In 1956, the Government introduced an additional type of savings security—
Premium Savings Bonds, issued in £1 units—which, after an initial period of six
months and thereafter monthly, give investors a chance to win prizes ranging from
£25 to £1,000 instead of receiving interest.
Trustee Savings Banks are managed by boards of honorary trustees and managers,
and most of the funds deposited with them are ordinary deposits which are with¬
drawable on demand or at short notice. These deposits are invested with the
National Debt Commissioners, and the Government is responsible to the trustees
for the repayment of the money so invested, with accrued interest, as and when
required. In certain circumstances, Trustee Savings Banks also accept deposits of
UP to £2,000 for special investment. These deposits, which may receive a slightly
higher rate of interest than ordinary deposits, are invested under the supervision
of the National Debt Commissioners, but the Government is not responsible to
the trustees for the repayment of these investments. In August 1958, there were
about 1,330 Trustee Offices controlled by 84 independent banks.
The Post Office Savings Bank is the largest organisation of its kind in the world.
It has over 22 million active accounts; in April 1958, total balances, which
carry a Government guarantee, amounted to £1,682 million, about £73 per deposi¬
tor. Through a centralised system of accounting, a depositor can pay in money or
make a withdrawal at any one of some 20,000 post offices throughout the country.
To ensure that Savings Banks are used primarily by the small investor there is a
limit of £500 on the amount which may be deposited by any individual in one year,
and of £3,000 on the total balance which may be held by one individual in the
ordinary departments of Trustee Savings Banks and in the Post Office Savings
Bank. The maximum amount of National Savings Certificates which may be held
by any one person is £750 worth of the current (tenth) issue, in addition to holdings
of previous issues, and £500 worth of Premium Savings Bonds. The limit on
individual holdings of the current issue of Defence Bonds (5 per cent) is £2,000;
this is in addition to holdings of previous issues.
Co-operative Banks
The Co-operative Wholesale Society formed a deposit and loan department
about the year 1870, and the right of a co-operative society to engage in banking
was legally defined in the Industrial and Provident Societies Act of 1876. The
primary purpose of the Co-operative Wholesale Society Bank was to serve the
co-operative movement, whose financial centre it has become, but the bank has
also come to include among its clients trade unions and other mutual societies, local
authorities and individual depositors.
1 The Northern Ireland Ministry of Finance is responsible for the administration of
Ulster Savings, but the furtherance and organisation of the savings movement in Northern
Ireland is the concern of a central voluntary committee, which is assisted by county and
local committees and district groups, all of a voluntary nature.
FINANCE
419
OTHER FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS
It has been the policy of the commercial banks to leave the provision of many
special financial facilities to other financial institutions. These facilities, which are
supplementary to the credit facilities of the banking system, are mainly provided
through the Discount Market, Finance Corporations, the Stock Exchange, Invest¬
ment Trusts, Building Societies and the Insurance Market. New capital issues,
•except for relatively small amounts, are controlled by the Treasury with the advice
•of the Capital Issues Committee (see pp. 421-2).
The firms engaged in such activities are in the main highly specialised, e.g.,
discount houses, stockbrokers, insurers, insurance underwriters and brokers.
Another type of financial institution, the merchant bank, has been of great impor¬
tance in the finance of trade and commodity dealings and in the flotation of major
issues of bonds, particularly for overseas concerns and governments.
The merchant banks helped to give London an international reputation as the
main world centre for short-term and long-term borrowing. Long-term loans for
•development purposes floated on the London market earned for Britain a con¬
tinuing flow of interest and attracted a steady flow of orders for British goods and
products. This increasing trade and also a large proportion of trade between foreign
countries was usually financed by bills of exchange, which were accepted as payable
at maturity by the merchant banks (also known as accepting houses) and were
traded on the discount market, thus providing an easy method of transferring debts
and claims.
The Discount Market
The main business of the Discount Market consists of trading in and holding
commercial bills of exchange, United Kingdom Government Treasury bills and
■other short-term securities.
If the various firms which compose the Discount Market have insufficient
funds of their own to finance the bills and securities which they wish to hold,
they obtain loans from the banks and, to a lesser extent, deposits from the public.
In the main these loans and deposits may be called in at any time.
The commercial banks do not, in the ordinary way, buy Treasury bills at the
weekly tenders except on behalf of customers, but purchase, from the Discount
Market, bills which have been taken up by the Market and held until they become
•of a currency required by the banks.
If the banks call in loans which they have made to the Discount Market and the
latter is unable to cover its needs elsewhere, it will be forced to borrow from the
Bank of England. It is not the practice of the commercial banks themselves to
obtain direct loans from the Bank of England to augment their cash resources if
the need arises.
Finance Corporations
Two corporations, the Finance Corporation for Industry Limited and the
Industrial and Commercial Finance Corporation Limited, were set up in 1945 to
assist in dealing with the problems of post-war reconstruction and development.
Although the Government displayed considerable interest in their formation, the
Corporations themselves are ordinary limited companies with no official repre¬
sentation on their boards and having no recourse to public funds. Another finance
corporation, the Commonwealth Development Finance Company Limited, was
established in 1953 to assist development projects in the Commonwealth. Among
other financial corporations of note are the Ship Mortgage Finance Company
420
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Limited, the Agricultural Mortgage Corporation Limited, the Scottish Agricultural
Securities Corporation Limited, Air Finance Limited, the National Film Finance
Corporation and the Estate Duties Investment Trust Limited.
Finance Corporation for Industry Limited
The FCI was formed to assist in the provision of capital (in amounts of £200,000
and upwards) for the re-equipment and development of major industries with a
view to promoting efficiency and thereby assisting in the maintenance and increase
of employment.
The Corporation has an authorised and issued capital of £25 million and may
borrow up to four times this amount, making a possible total of resources of £125
million. The share capital is held as follows: 40 per cent by insurance companies,
30 per cent by trust companies and 30 per cent by the Bank of England. As at
the 31st March, 1958, the capital had been paid up to the extent of 2 per cent
(£500,000); the liability of the shareholders in respect of the uncalled capital repre¬
sents security to the banks that provide the funds out of which the Corporation
makes its advances.
The enterprises assisted by the FCI are concerned with a variety of products,
e.g., steel, oil, chemicals, shipping, diesel engines, and electrical components.
Industrial and Commercial Finance Corporation Limited
The ICFC has a smaller issued capital than that of the FCI and has as its main
object the provision of credit and finance by means of loan capital and share
capital for industrial and commercial concerns in Great Britain, particularly in
cases where the existing facilities provided by banking institutions and the Stock
Exchange are not readily or easily available.
The authorised and issued share capital of the Corporation is £15 million which
is paid up as required. In addition, the Corporation can borrow up to a further
£30. million in the form of loan capital, and can thus have a maximum of £45
million available. Although the Bank of England has a token participation, the
principal shareholders are the London Clearing Banks and the Scottish Banks in
proportion to their size; the loan capital is provided by all the shareholders in the
same ratio as their shareholdings.
The Corporation s function is to provide finance in sums ranging between
£5,000 and £200,000 for small and medium-sized concerns. It has over 600
customers and has established branches in Birmingham, Leeds, Leicester,
Manchester and Edinburgh.
Commonwealth Development Finance Company Limited
This Company was established early in 1953. It originated from the Conference
of Commonwealth Prime Ministers in December 1952 and its purpose is to finance
non-governmental development schemes in the British Commonwealth. The
authorised and issued capital of this company is £15 million, which is held by
the Bank of England and by 91 industrial, mining, shipping and banking companies
and firms, £4-2 million of the capital has been paid up. The Company is empowered
to borrow up to twice its issued capital. At the end of March 1958, the Company
had entered into commitments totalling £14-6 million.
Ship Mortgage Finance Company Limited
This Company was formed in 1951, the capital being subscribed by the ship¬
building industry, insurance companies and other financial institutions. Its main
object is to assist in financing shipbuilding in the United Kingdom. In special cases,
loans in respect of existing ships built in the United Kingdom may be considered.
FINANCE
421
Agricultural Mortgage Corporation Limited
The primary function of this Corporation, which was established in 1928, is to
grant long-term loans against first mortgages on agricultural lands and buildings
in England and Wales. The share capital was subscribed by the Bank of England
and other banks, but the funds are mainly derived from public issues of debentures,
of which about £27 million is outstanding.
The Scottish Agricultural Securities Corporation Limited
This Corporation was established in 1933 under the provisions of the Agricultural
Credits (Scotland) Act, 1929. Its share capital is subscribed by four Scottish banks.
It fulfils broadly similar functions in Scotland to those of the Agricultural Mortgage
Corporation in England.
Air Finance Limited
This Company was formed by a group of bankers and the Finance Corporation
for Industry in 1953 for the purpose of financing aircraft exports. Its initial
resources were £11 million (for an account of the aircraft industry, see pp. 319-20).
National Film Finance Corporation
The Corporation is a statutory body established under the Cinematograph Film
Production (Special Loans) Act, 1949. Its function is to make loans to film pro¬
ducers and distributors in order to help to finance the production of films (see also
p. 221).
Estate Duties Investment Trust Limited
The Trust was established in 1953 to assist small family businesses to find the
finance to meet estate duties.
The Stock Exchanges
Although there are several Stock Exchanges in the United Kingdom, the London
Stock Exchange is by far the most important.
The Stock Exchanges provide a means by which a holder of quoted stocks or
shares (all important securities are quoted) can, if he wishes, find a buyer for his
securities; they are also a most important element in the raising of new capital by
Government and commercial borrowers.
The Stock Exchanges do not fix dealing prices; the terms on which bargains are
made between members reflect the interaction of supply of and demand for the
securities concerned.
All the Stock Exchanges operate under strict rules of conduct which they formu¬
late themselves.
The Capital Issues Committee
Since 1932 there has been control to a greater or lesser degree over capital issues
in the United Kingdom. The 1932 controls, and such modifications as were made
up to 1939, were without a statutory basis but resulted from public requests by the
Chancellor which the various markets observed. At the outbreak of war in 1939 the
Foreign Transactions (Advisory) Committee, which had been set up in 1936 to
advise the Treasury on issues involving remittances to countries outside the Com¬
monwealth, was renamed the Capital Issues Committee and was given the wider
task of advising the Treasury on the administration of the statutory control of
capital issues (and analogous transactions) for which provision was made in
Regulation 6 of the Defence (Finance) Regulations, 1939.
422
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
The end of the war in 1945 saw the retention of the Capital Issues Committee
with its primary function unchanged; permanent provision for capital issues control
was made the following year with the passing of the Borrowing (Control and
Guarantees) Act, 1946.
The Committee is entirely independent; it consists of seven men of experience
in commerce, industry or finance, who consider applications to raise loans or issue
capital (except those which do not involve more than ^so^oo1 in any one year for
the borrower concerned, or which, for certain other reasons, may be exempt) and
tender their advice to the Treasury upon them.
In 1957. applications to the Committee amounted to £1,703 million, of which
£333'9 million (ig-6 per cent) was refused. The amount allowed, £1,369-1 million,
comprised £895 • 1 million of new money and £474 million of other money, including
scrip issues and conversions.
Investment Trusts
Investment trusts cater for the investor who does not wish or has not sufficient
resources to hold a large number of investments in his own name but who desires
to have an interest in several securities as a means of spreading his risk.
The ordinary type of investment trust is a public company, limited in liability
and registered under the Companies Acts; investment trusts in this form have been
established in the United Kingdom for about a century. They invest their share
and their loan capital over a range of securities, the precise choice depending in
part on the objects of the particular company concerned.
Since 1931 there have also been ‘unit trusts’ in the United Kingdom; a trust of
this type is normally limited by its trust deed to a specified range of securities. The
original conception of the unit trust was that securities could be grouped in fixed
proportions to form units, and these units could be divided into sub-units which
could be sold to the public. In practice, while retaining this unit basis of investment,
many unit trusts have considerable flexibility in their choice of the underlying
securities.
The Insurance Market
The institutions providing insurance services fall into two main groups: the
insurance companies and Lloyd’s. Additional life assurance facilities are also pro¬
vided in the United Kingdom by certain Friendly Societies.
Insurance Companies
There are about 30° British insurance companies, the large companies of inter¬
national repute accounting with their subsidiaries for about a third of this total.
In addition, nearly 100 overseas companies carry on business (and even more com¬
panies are represented) in the United Kingdom, thus emphasising the international
nature of the market. The natural centre of the market is in London, but some of
the large companies have their administrative headquarters elsewhere.
In 1956, the premium income of British insurance companies amounted to about
£1,210 million. The three non-life branches—fire, accident and marine—together
accounted for some £718 million. ‘Ordinary branch’ life assurance accounted for
£357 million and the balance of £135 million was represented by ‘industrial’ life
assurance (i.e. a system of assurance in which the contributions are collected by
house-to-house visits at intervals of less than two months).
•m Britain, between March 1956 and July 1958, this figure was £10,000. In
-Northern Ireland, where applications are dealt with by the Northern Ireland Ministry of
h inance, the figure has remained unchanged at £50,000.

FINANCE
423
The total assets of British insurance companies at the end of 1956 are estimated to
have been about £5,207 million. This included £1,216 million invested in British
Government and British Government guaranteed securities, £1,017 million invested
in debenture and loan stocks and preference and guaranteed stocks and shares,
£827 million in ordinary stocks and shares, £131 million in municipal and public
boards’ securities, and £594 million in mortgages.
Lloyd’s
Lloyd’s is an incorporated society of underwriters in London. Although in its
earlier history the activities of Lloyd’s were confined to the conduct of marine
insurance business, during the last sixty years there has also been built up at
Lloyd’s a very considerable world-wide market for the transaction of other classes
of insurance business, except life assurance of which the amount transacted at
Lloyd’s is negligible. In addition to its insurance activities, Lloyd’s maintains a
world-wide organisation for the collection and diffusion of shipping intelligence
(see p. 337).
The name ‘Lloyd’s’ is derived from Edward Lloyd’s coffee house, established
in the seventeenth century, where merchants with maritime and other interests
gathered to transact business. By the middle of the eighteenth century, Lloyd’s
coffee house had become the principal centre of underwriting business and of
intelligence about shipping movements. In 1871 Lloyd’s was incorporated by Act
of Parliament.
The conduct of insurance business and the affairs of the Society of Lloyd’s in
its corporate capacity are administered by the Committee of Lloyd’s.
The interests of a holder of a Lloyd’s policy are safeguarded in the following
ways: (1) every Lloyd’s underwriter is liable for his underwriting debts to the full
extent of his means and is required to lodge security by way of a deposit with the
Committee of Lloyd’s; (2) the whole of the premiums received by an underwriter
must be placed in a trust fund to be used exclusively for the payment of his under¬
writing liabilities and expenses, and only ascertained profits can be released to the
underwriter and then only with the consent of the trustees; and (3) every under¬
writer must submit his accounts to an annual audit.
The usual practice of underwriters today is to form themselves into groups
known as syndicates which generally specialise in particular branches of insurance.
The underwriters forming the syndicate appoint an agent who is empowered to
accept risks on their behalf and to control all matters concerned with the syndicate’s
business. If the insurance is for a relatively large amount, several syndicates may
participate, but each underwriter is individually liable only for the proportion of
the risk accepted on his behalf.
Underwriters may not accept business directly from the public, but must trans¬
act through Lloyd’s brokers (see below) in London, who must be connected with
Lloyd’s, either as members or subscribers.
The total premium income of Lloyd’s underwriters in 1956 after deduction of
brokerages, commissions, returns and reinsurance premiums was about £244
million, of which some £108 million was in respect of marine, aviation and transit
insurance.
Insurance Brokers
The insurance market is completed by the insurance brokers, acting on behalf of
the insured, who are an essential part of the Lloyd’s market and a valuable part of
the company market. Many brokers specialise in reinsurance business, acting as
intermediaries in the exchange of contracts between companies, both British and
overseas, and often acting as London representatives of the latter.
2E
424 BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
International Insurance Services
Over two-thirds of the fire, accident and marine insurance business comes from
abroad, partly by direct placing in London and partly from branches and agencies
established in over 100 countries. The basic principle of this international business
is that resources capable of meeting any potential loss are instantly available for use
in any part of the world.
Behind this large and international volume of business stand the assets of the
companies (aggregating over £5,200 million) in addition to substantial reserves of
uncalled capital and the whole of the deposits, underwriting trust funds and per¬
sonal fortunes of Lloyd’s underwriters.
Building Societies
The principal function of building societies is to supply long-term loans on the
security of private dwelling houses purchased for owner occupation, though loans
are occasionally made on the security of commercial and industrial premises and
farms. The funds of building societies are derived mainly from the general public
who invest in shares or deposits. The amount of share capital is not fixed but may
be regulated in accordance with the amount of mortgage business; shares are not
dealt with on the Stock Exchange but may be withdrawn in cash if notice is given.
The rapid expansion of building society activity in the twentieth century has been
accompanied by a concentration of most of the business in the hands of a few very
large societies. At the end of 1957, 755 societies were in operation, with total assets
°f £2,408 million. The amount advanced on mortgage in 1957 was £371 million.
XIII. TRADE
Although relatively small in area and accounting for only 2 per cent of the world’s
population, the United Kingdom conducts 10 per cent of international trade. It
has acquired this position as a consequence of several factors. It was one of the
earliest countries to remove legal and fiscal restrictions on the internal movement
of persons and goods, and the first to develop adequate facilities for the movement
of large quantities of goods by mechanical transport (canals, roads, railways and
steamships). With its resources of coal and iron, and its succession of mechanical
inventions, Britain was also the first country to industrialise on a large scale and to
produce a wide variety of consumer goods in large quantities. In addition, Britain
evolved, over a long period of years, the specialised financial services needed to
facilitate the maximum volume of trade.
This chapter outlines some of the main features of Britain’s external trade,
balance of external payments and internal trade. Some account of external trade
and payments is essential to an understanding of Britain’s economy but only a
brief treatment of trade policy and commercial relations has seemed appropriate
in a Handbook devoted to the United Kingdom, its people and internal institutions.
EXTERNAL TRADE
In the nineteenth century Britain attained a pre-eminent position in international
trade. At the end of the century Britain’s share of exports of manufactures entering
into world trade was about 33 per cent. Its share of world imports was somewhat
larger than that of world exports, as imports into Britain were paid for not only by
exports of goods but by interest on overseas investments, receipts from shipping
and a variety of financial services. Even before 1914, however, this supremacy was
being increasingly challenged by other nations, including Germany and the United
States, and although Britain’s imports and exports increased in absolute terms over
the years, its share of the world total tended to decline. By 1937, Britain’s
share in world exports of manufactures, measured by value, had fallen to 22 per
cent compared with 24 per cent in 1929 and 30 per cent in 1914. In the years
immediately following the second world war, Britain’s share rose again, and in
1950 was 25 per cent; but by 1957 it had declined once more, to about 18 per cent.
For over a century, Britain’s internal economy has been vitally dependent on
international trade. Britain relies upon imports for half its total consumption of
foodstuffs and nearly all the raw materials needed for its industries. Its exports,
chiefly manufactured goods, absorb between a fifth and a sixth of the gross national
product.
In 1957, Britain was the world’s second largest exporter and importer. It is a
major supplier of machinery, ships, road and railway vehicles, aircraft, metal manu¬
factures, chemicals and textiles. Britain is also one of the world’s largest markets
for foodstuffs, metals, cotton, wool and petroleum.
PATTERN OF TRADE
Changes since 1938 in value, volume, composition and geographical distribution
of imports and exports are outlined in the following paragraphs.
425
426
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Value and Volume
Imports rose in value from £919 million in 1938 to £1,802 million in 1947 and
£4,076 million in 1957. The rise in value of exports was from £471 million in 1938
to £1,142 million in 1947 and £3,325 million in 1957.
Calculations of changes in trade volume (i.e. changes after eliminating variations
due to price movements) compared with pre-war cannot be made with precision as
the relative values of different types of goods on which the volume figures are based
have changed considerably since 1938. Broadly speaking, however, by 1947, the
volume of imports was a quarter less than before the war and exports had regained
their pre-war volume. It has been estimated that the volume of imports in 1957
was only just over the 1938 figure, while the 1957 volume of exports approached
a level twice that of 1938. Statistics showing the value and volume of imports and
exports in 1938 and in post-war years are set out in Table 32. The diagram on
p. 427 shows the changes in the volume of imports and exports from 1947 to 1957.

CHANGES IN THE index
Some indication of the increased importance of exports in the national economy
is shown by the rise in the proportion of total national income derived from export
earnings—from 10-3 per cent in 1938 to 12-2 per cent in 1947 and 18-3 per cent
in 1957. Over the same period, the rise in the proportion of expenditure on imports
to gross national expenditure was smaller—from 16-1 per cent in 1938 to 16-6 per
cent in 1947 and 18-8 per cent in 1957.
Commodity Composition
An analysis of the commodity composition of trade by value in the years 1938,
1948 and 1957 is shown in the diagram on p. 428.
The most notable change in the commodity composition of exports in the post¬
war years as compared with pre-war has been the much more prominent part played
by engineering products. In 1957, exports of engineering products comprised 40-8
per cent of United Kingdom exports by value as compared with 37-6 per cent in
1953 and 24-4 per cent in 1938. Metals have also provided an increasing contribu¬
tion. Although in the early post-war period as a result of growing demands of the
internal market, metals were relatively somewhat less important than pre-war, in¬
creased production raised their share in 1957 to 14-4 per cent, as compared with
13-2 per cent in 1953.
Textiles, once pre-eminent in the United Kingdom export trade, have declined
in relative importance over a long period and by 1957 their share had fallen to 9 per
cent as compared with 14 per cent in 1953, although their total value has been
maintained at about £350 million. The share of coal, another traditional export
before the war, has also diminished in importance. On the other hand, exports
of refined petroleum have expanded and, in 1957, accounted for 2-5 per cent of
United Kingdom exports.

(a) Excluding repayments of silver bullion to the United States Government.
Owing to the expansion of the output of domestic agriculture (by over one-half)
and of industry (by about 60 per cent) compared with 1938, Britain relies relatively
less than before the war on food imports, but needs a relatively larger supply of
imported raw materials for its industrial plants. Whereas 47 per cent of total imports
in 1938 consisted of food, beverages and tobacco, the proportion in 1948 was only
42 per cent, and in 1957, 37 per cent. On the other hand, the proportion for basic
materials rose from 26 per cent in 1938 to 31 per cent in 1948, but was reduced to
29 per cent in 1957. Imports of manufactures in 1957 represented 23 per cent of
total imports, a slightly higher proportion than in 1938. Imports of fuels rose from
5 per cent of the total in 1938 to 11 per cent in 1957, on account of increased con¬
sumption of petroleum products.

The main changes and other notable features shown in Table 35, which analyses
distribution by currency areas, are:
1. The proportion of imports drawn from the sterling area in 1957 was much
higher than before the war (38 per cent as against 31 per cent).
2. The proportion of imports from the dollar area (chiefly the United States
and Canada) after declining from 23 per cent in 1938 to 18 per cent in 1950
recovered to 24 per cent in 1957.
3. The dollar area has been taking an increasing proportion of exports in the
post-war years (17 per cent in 1957 as against 13 per cent in 1950 and 11 per
cent in 1938).
4. The United Kingdom’s trade with the member countries of the Organisation
for European Economic Co-operation (OEEC) and their dependencies
accounted for about a quarter of the total imports and exports, both in 1938
and in 1957.
5. Trade with ‘other non-sterling countries’ (including the Soviet bloc
countries and non-dollar Latin America) in 1957 formed an appreciably
lower proportion of the total than it did before the war.

TRADE

Re-Export Trade
Re-exports are goods which are exported (x) in the condition in which they are
imported or (2) after having undergone minor operations—e.g., simple blending,
husking, repacking—which leave them essentially unchanged. For some hundreds
of years Britain has been an important centre of re-export trade though, over the
past forty years, its importance relative to total United Kingdom export trade has
declined. The greater part of United Kingdom re-export trade has always been in
raw materials and foodstuffs, e.g., wool, rubber, tea, non-ferrous metals and fur-
skins. Traditionally, re-export commodities are imported from Commonwealth
countries and re-exported to countries in Europe.
In 1957 the total value of re-exports was £133 million, and the principal items
were: rubber, £18-5 million; fur-skins, £18-1 million; and raw wool, £16-1 million.
Tourist Trade
Since the second world war, the tourist industry has grown considerably in im¬
portance and is now one of Britain’s largest earners of foreign currency. Over the
period 1947-57, earnings from the foreign tourist trade amounted to the equivalent
of £854 million, in addition to £375 million earned by associated British shipping
and air services. In 1957, foreign exchange earnings from the tourist trade amounted
to £128 million, of which £43 million was in dollar currencies. United Kingdom
residents touring overseas spent £140 million in the same year.1
The total number of visitors to the United Kingdom in 1957 was 1,180,000,2 an
increase of 7 per cent compared with 1956, and well over twice the number of those
who came in 1937, the peak year before the war.
The British Travel and Holidays Association, which is a Government-sponsored
body, is concerned with the promotion of the tourist trade, particularly by means
of publicity overseas. The Association was formed in April 1950 by the merger of
the British Travel and Holidays Board and the Travel Association. Its work is
directed by a Board consisting of a chairman and 23 members. The President of
the Board of Trade appoints the chairman and eight members, the Council of the
Association elects seven members, the Scottish, Welsh, and Northern Ireland
Tourist Boards between them appoint four members and the Board itself has
power to co-opt four members to represent tourist interests not otherwise covered.
CONDUCT OF TRADE
It has been a major aim of successive United Kingdom Governments since the
second world war to work for the removal of restrictions on trade and payments,
to secure a reduction of impediments to exports and, when possible, to restore the
convertibility of sterling. To this end, Britain has taken a leading part in the setting
up of such organisations as the International Monetary Fund, the General Agree¬
ment on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), the Organisation for European Economic
Co-operation (OEEC) and the European Payments Union (EPU), and has played
a major part in these organisations’ activities, especially as regards the freeing of
trade from the restrictions which grew up in the war and post-war periods.
In addition to substantial reductions in tariffs on imported goods, carried out
through the GATT, the United Kingdom has greatly relaxed its quota restrictions
on imports and has modified its exchange restrictions on foreign currencies. By
1 For foreign currency allowances for United Kingdom tourists, see p. 436.
2 This total excludes tourists (other than aliens) from the Irish Republic and foreign
visitors in transit to other destinations.
434
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
April 1958, nearly all its imports from the sterling area, 94 per cent of those from
OEEC member countries and about two-thirds from dollar countries had been
freed from quantitative restrictions.
Tariff Policy
In the nineteenth century the United Kingdom became strongly attached to the
principles of free trade, and at the beginning of the twentieth century the only
customs duties were those imposed for revenue purposes on a small range of
products. After the first world war, certain key industries, notably optical and
scientific instruments and fine chemicals, were given protection for strategic reasons
under an Act passed in 1921. It was not until 1932, however, that any serious
departure was made from the principles of free trade. Under the Import Duties
Act of that year, the United Kingdom imposed a duty of 10 per cent ad valorem on
all imported goods except those on a Free List (mainly important raw materials
and foodstuffs) and set up machinery for the imposition of additional duties and
for additions to be made to the Free List where appropriate. This measure provided
a degree of protection for British industry and, at the same time, a basis for
negotiations with foreign countries already in possession of a tariff structure.
The principle of Imperial Preference had been introduced into the United
Kingdom customs tariffs in 1919 and, as a result of the Ottawa Conference in 1932,
agreements were concluded with independent Commonwealth countries providing
for reciprocal preferential tariff treatment over a wide range of Commonwealth
goods. The Import Duties Act had already permitted the duty-free entry of goods
from the United Kingdom dependencies.
A series of bilateral trade negotiations with other countries between 1932 and
1939 resulted in some modification in the level of protection and in the Common¬
wealth preferences which had been established. During the second world war,
because of Government purchase and import control, protection by the tariff was
of relatively minor importance, and it was only after the substantial relaxation of
quantitative import controls in 1949 that the tariff again became an effective
instrument of protection.
Since the war, the United Kingdom’s protective tariff has been considerably
modified as a result of a series of multilateral tariff negotiations held under the
auspices of the GATT, which permits the retention of existing tariff preferences,
but prohibits the creation of new preferences. The United Kingdom has, however,
obtained certain limited waivers from the GATT no-new-preference rule; these
permit, under certain conditions, increased tariff protection for United Kingdom
industries while preserving duty-free commitments for Commonwealth goods, and
allow increased preferences for the benefit of Colonial products whose disposal is
wholly or mainly dependent on the United Kingdom market. In the negotiations
under the GATT, United Kingdom customs duties have been reduced, or bound
against increase, on goods which account for about half of Britain’s normal imports
from other contracting countries, in return for concessions by those countries.
Margins of preference have thereby been reduced in some instances, but only in
return for compensating tariff concessions by other countries, and only after
consultation with all the Commonwealth countries concerned.
The United Kingdom Government in February 1957 put forward proposals
under which the six countries (France, Belgium, Luxembourg, the Netherlands,
Italy and the German Federal Republic) which in March 1957 signed the Treaty
establishing the European Economic Community, and other members of OEEC,
would be associated in a free trade area in Europe. Negotiating machinery for this
purpose has been set by OEEC, and, in October 1957, the Organisation made a
TRADE
435
unanimous declaration of intent to form such an area. Under the British proposals,
protective tariffs and other barriers to trade affecting industrial products would be
progressively reduced; agricultural products and foodstuffs would not be included,
but the United Kingdom has announced its readiness to enter into practical
arrangements designed to secure freer and fairer trade in agriculture.
The Customs Duties (Dumping and Subsidies) Act, 1957, empowers the Board
of Trade to impose duties on imported goods of any description which have been
dumped or subsidised.
The Import Duties Act, 1958, replaced the existing legislation relating to the
protective tariff (i.e. four main Acts and some 70 Finance Act provisions) and
brought it up to date in a single measure. The Act also provided for re-casting the
tariff into an internationally agreed form (the Brussels Nomenclature).
Private and State Trading
The export trade and virtually all the import trade of the United Kingdom are
conducted by private firms.
Methods of export trading vary considerably, according to the firm, the industry
the product and the market. A good deal of United Kingdom export trade, especi¬
ally of the smaller manufacturing firms, is conducted through export merchants in
the United Kingdom; many firms, however, sell to importers and consumers
abroad through their own agents or resident representatives in the countries con¬
cerned; in other cases, sales are made through a firm’s own branch office, dis¬
tributing organisation or subsidiary sales company established in overseas markets.
Similarly, in import trade, many large firms engaged in manufacture or domestic
trade buy directly from overseas suppliers, while smaller firms may find it more
convenient to buy through intermediaries such as import/export houses, com¬
mission agents, and the representatives of overseas firms.
In the immediate post-war years, nearly all the principal imported foods and
raw materials and some other goods were bought wholly or mainly on Government
account, and the Government was also the sole purchaser of nearly all domestically
produced food and certain raw materials such as flax and timber. In later years, and
particularly since 1951, private trading has been restored to each commodity. By
the beginning of 1958, overseas trading by Government-constituted monopolies
was confined to jute goods.
CONTROLS ON TRADE AND PAYMENTS
Concurrently with the process of reversion from public to private trading, import
licensing restrictions have been substantially eased, so that for nearly all basic
foodstuffs and raw materials no limit is now imposed on the quantity or value of
imports from any country; for balance of payments reasons, imports from certain
areas have not as yet shared fully in the relaxation of restrictions on manufactured
goods.
The principal quantitative controls still in operation on external trade are (1)
currency exchange control, and (2) import and export licensing.
Exchange Control
Exchange control, which includes inter alia control over the purchase and sale of
gold and foreign currencies, was introduced at the outbreak of war in September
1939. The legal basis was at first the Defence (Finance) Regulations issued under
the Emergency Powers (Defence) Acts, but in 1947 most of these temporary war¬
time powers were embodied in permanent legislation in the Exchange Control Act,
1947.
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
436
Exchange control does not affect transactions wholly within the sterling area. It
is imposed only on (1) transactions between residents within the sterling area and
residents outside, and (2) transactions conducted in sterling between persons resi¬
dent outside the sterling area. Although the main structure of exchange control has
continued intact since 1939, relaxations in its operation have been made in recent
years.
In March 1954, the facility which certain countries possessing transferable
accounts have enjoyed of settling current transactions between each other—as well
as with sterling area countries—in sterling was extended to virtually all non-dollar
countries. The facility now applies to capital as well as to current transactions.
There are restrictions on the amount of currency and notes that United Kingdom
tourists may take with them abroad. The position (in August 1958) was as follows:
for visits to non-sterling countries including the dollar area, United Kingdom
tourists are entitled to a basic foreign currency allowance of £100 per twelve-month
period, and the equivalent of this amount may be taken out of the country
in foreign currency notes together with not more than £10 in sterling notes.
These limits on the amount of currency notes that may be taken out also
apply to United Kingdom tourists visiting sterling area countries, but there are no
restrictions on the amount that may be taken to these countries in the form of
travellers’ cheques or letters of credit. Special arrangements apply to Norway,
Sweden, Denmark, Greenland, and the Faroe Islands: United Kingdom tourists
visiting these countries are allowed all reasonable amounts of currency. Special
allowances of currency are also made for visits overseas of United Kingdom
businessmen; these are made available through the commercial banks.
Restrictions on the amount of United Kingdom currency notes which may be
brought into Britain from abroad were lifted in February 1958.
In addition, exchange control applies to exports of goods to destinations outside
the sterling area, and, in general, these have to be paid for within six months in
an acceptable currency or by other approved methods.
Exchange control policy is the responsibility of the Treasury, but most of the
administration is in practice carried out by the Bank of England as agent of the
Treasury—and in turn the Bank of England has delegated to the commercial banks
a wide variety of powers to deal with applications.
Import and Export Control
The Import, Export and Customs Powers (Defence) Act, 1939, empowers the
Board of Trade to make Orders prohibiting or regulating the import or export of
goods. The powers of both import and export control derive from the same
legislation, but the purpose and mechanism are quite distinct.
Import Licensing
Although goods can be imported into the United Kingdom only under licences
issued by the Board of Trade, an importer does not have to apply for a licence
every time he wishes to import anything. A large number of goods can be imported
under the Open General Licence, which authorises any person in the United
Kingdom to import a wide range of specified commodities without any limits of
quantity or value, either from anywhere in the world or from specified countries
or groups of countries. Similarly, for a number of goods, individual traders are
granted Open Individual Licences, which allow them to import unlimited quantities
of the goods concerned from any country or from specified countries or groups of
countries.
TRADE
437
When an importer wishes to bring in goods not covered by the unrestrictive
Open Licensing arrangements, the Board of Trade decides whether he should be
granted a licence to import a limited value of the goods in accordance with one of
three basic methods of determining who should be allowed to import goods and in
what quantities. These methods are:
(1) ad hoc consideration of applications for licences;
(2) apportionment of quotas among importers; and
(3) apportionment of quotas among exporters to the United Kingdom by
arrangement with the Governments of the exporting countries concerned.
The choice of method depends on the circumstances of the particular trade under
consideration.
Import and exchange control are closely linked. All holders of import licences
and anybody who wishes to import goods admissible under the Open General
Licence are allowed the foreign exchange required to pay for their imports.
Export Controls
Except for the control necessary to establish that exports to destinations outside
the sterling area are paid for in the proper manner (see p. 436), United Kingdom
exports are, for the most part, not subject to any Government control or direction.
Such controls as are in operation are imposed for the following reasons:
(1) to control goods of strategic importance;
(2) to conserve or regulate the distribution of scarce materials;
(3) to assist exchange control operations in preventing exports of capital in the
form of valuable goods (e.g., diamonds);
(4) to control the re-export of a few materials purchased with dollars;
(5) to control the export of goods the prices of which have been subsidised for
consumption in the home market;
(6) to prevent the export of works of art of national importance; and
(7) to control the export of live horses and cattle on grounds of animal welfare.
The operation of export licensing control is such that goods are freely exportable
to all destinations unless there is a specific ban on their export without licence.
Normally, individual licences are required for specific consignments of goods sub¬
ject to export licensing control, but in a few cases Open General Licences are
issued. In other cases, bulk licences are issued to permit exports of specified
quantities of controlled goods within a given period.
In recent years, export controls have been greatly reduced, and now cover only
a small proportion of total shipments. The position is continually under review and
relaxations in control are made whenever circumstances permit. Following improve¬
ments in the supply position, the majority of goods now subject to control are of
strategic importance. Certain of these strategic goods may be exported without
licence to the Commonwealth, the Irish Republic and the United States of America,
but exports of such goods to other destinations are subject to export licensing
control.
GOVERNMENT ASSISTANCE TO OVERSEAS TRADE
The United Kingdom Government does not subsidise exports. Assistance is
given to manufacturers and merchants by advice and information and by the pro¬
vision of credit insurance facilities. In addition, the Government, in its general
economic policy, seeks to create conditions in which export trade can flourish.
This includes the use of fiscal, credit and other measures to maintain a stable

438
economy and to control excessive demand for goods and services by the home
market, and action through international negotiation to reduce barriers to the free
flow of trade and to move towards the freest possible system of trade and payments.
Information and Advice to Exporters
The United Kingdom Government provides a service of information and advice
to merchants and manufacturers in the export trade.1 The Government Department
most concerned is the Board of Trade, which calls upon the assistance of overseas
representatives. At each Embassy or Legation there is always an officer of high
rank, a Minister, Counsellor or First Secretary (Commercial), who specialises in
commercial matters. These officers direct the commercial activities of Consular
officers in their respective territories. At important centres in the Commonwealth
there are Trade Commissioners, who are directly responsible to the Board of
Trade.
Overseas officers regularly report on local economic and commercial conditions,
pay special attention to local demand for particular commodities, and generally
assist the exporter to overcome the difficulties he encounters in trade with the
country in question, particularly those arising out of governmental regulations.
These officers indicate potential demand for United Kingdom products, advise
about methods of trading with particular areas, and seek out and pass on all
opportunities for export business and inquiries for United Kingdom goods. Assis¬
tance is also given to United Kingdom exporters in finding agents and likely
importers. From the records the Department keeps in London, brought up to date
by reports from its overseas officers, it can provide information concerning any
country on:
(1) prospects for United Kingdom exports and requirements of particular
markets;
(2) governmental regulations affecting trade, including import restrictions and
tariffs and duties on particular commodities;
(3) methods of trading;
(4) goods most likely to sell;
(5) local tastes and preferences in design; and
(6) the probity and influence of firms with which an exporter contemplates
entering into business relations.
Export Credit Insurance
The Export Credits Guarantee Department, responsible directly to the President
of the Board of Trade, is run on commercial lines to provide insurance for United
Kingdom exporters and merchants against the main risks of financial loss incurred in
overseas trading. These facilities have been developed over a period of more than
thirty years, and the Department now underwrites some £500 million worth of
insurance a year for more than 4,000 policy holders. The Department is obliged to
conduct its business on a self-supporting basis, taking one year with another, and
cannot therefore be regarded in any way as a provider of subsidies to exporters.
The risks covered include insolvency or protracted default of the buyer, action
by the buyer’s Government which blocks or delays transfer of payment to the
United Kingdom, imposition of new import licensing restrictions in the buyer’s
country, war between the buyer’s country and the United Kingdom, cancellation

the Northern Ireland Development Council, and the National Industrial Development
Council of Wales and Monmouthshire, see pp. 242-3.

or non-renewal of a United Kingdom export licence, or ‘any other cause of loss
occurring outside the United Kingdom and not within the control of the exporter
or the buyer, and not normally insurable with commercial insurers’. Cover may
commence from the date of contract or (at lower premiums) from the date of
shipment.
There are three main types of export insurance policy:
1. Short-term policies normally covering goods sold on terms of up to six
months’ credit. The exporter insures the whole of his trade, or the whole of
his trade with an agreed group of markets, for the twelve months covered
by his policy. For certain engineering goods this type of cover is extended
to goods sold on maximum credit terms of up to three years. Cover is also
available for goods of foreign origin sold by a United Kingdom merchant
to third countries, provided this trade does not conflict with direct United
Kingdom exports.
2. Medium-term policies which cover capital and other goods sold on credit
terms exceeding three years. Specific policies are negotiated for each
individual contract.
3. Dollar market policies for North America and the Dollar Account countries
of Central and South America. The policies listed above cover risks affecting
payments under a contract of sale: the dollar market policies are designed
to reduce to manageable size the special risks of loss in breaking into these
markets. The exporter insures against a percentage of the loss which may
result if market surveys, advertising or sales promotion campaigns, or stock¬
holding, do not produce sufficient revenue to defray their cost. A similar but
more extensive form of insurance is provided by ‘Joint Venture’ policies.
In the case of all the Department’s policies, the exporter or merchant is required
to retain an interest in the debt or risk involved and, consequently, guarantees are
given up to a maximum of between 85 and 95 per cent. Premium rates are assessed
separately for each country, and vary according to the risks and the terms of
payment.
Trade Fairs
The discontinuance of the annual British Industries Fair after the 1957 display
held at Castle Bromwich, Birmingham, was the result of a decision to concentrate
efforts upon specialised fairs. An inquiry carried out by the Federation of British
Industries (FBI) in 1957 showed that the large majority of British trade associations
favoured the development of specialised fairs, concentrating on the products of a
particular industry or group of industries, rather than the general fair at which wide
ranges of products are exhibited.
In the United Kingdom about 60 specialised fairs are held every year. An
increasing number, at present about half the total, are international in character,
and the remainder are national (i.e. open only to firms showing United Kingdom
products). A list of the more important ones appears regularly in the Fairs Section
of the Board of Trade Journal. Some of the specialised fairs, such as the Motor Show,
the Mechanical Handling Exhibition and the Radio and Television Show, attract
large numbers of the public as well as many trade buyers from home and overseas,
and provide an important means of advertising and selling British goods.
United Kingdom manufactures are shown at most of the large international trade
fairs throughout the world. For example, the products of more than 587 United
Kingdom firms were exhibited at the 1957 Milan Fair and more than 300 at the 1957
Brussels Fair; the United Kingdom is always well represented at the Hanover
2F
440
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Fair. At the more important of these international trade fairs there is often an
official United Kingdom export promotion stand, where officials deal with trade
inquiries and assist British exhibitors, and an impression is given of some aspects of
British industry. In addition to these international events at which British goods
are shown, there are, from time to time, specially organised displays of British
products. A successful trade fair of this sort was organised in Zurich in 1953 by
the British Chamber of Commerce in Switzerland. Through a subsidiary
company, British Overseas Fairs Ltd., the Federation of British Industries has
organised British Trade Fairs in Baghdad in 1954, in Copenhagen in 1955, and
in Helsinki in 1957; and one is planned for 1959 in Lisbon. At the Brussels
Universal and International Exhibition, 1958, the FBI organised a highly
successful British Industries Pavilion. An increasing interest is also being shown
by United Kingdom manufacturers in the many important specialised inter¬
national fairs which are held in North America and Europe.
BRITAIN’S ROLE IN THE FINANCING OF INTERNATIONAL TRADE
By a process of evolution through the centuries, the United Kingdom has
developed an efficient and adaptable organisation of trade and financial services,
centred mostly on London, and capable of meeting the needs, not only of Britain
itself, but of the world in general. Britain’s supremacy in this respect derives from
a number of factors—historical, geographical and economic—as well as the techni¬
cal efficiency and low cost of its services. In the nineteenth century, the rapid
growth of British industry, commerce and shipping under the stimulus of the
industrial revolution made Britain the market as well as the workshop of the world.
It became the site for the chief world markets in raw materials (see below), freight,
insurance, and precious metals. At the same time, British capital was invested in
overseas countries to assist their development, increase their output and exports,
and provide markets for manufactured goods. London became the chief supplier
of capital for many Commonwealth and foreign governments and a centre for
entrepot trade proceeding to and from the growing industrial areas on the continent
of Europe and in North America. In course of time, the pound sterling and the
sterling bill of exchange developed into the principal form of money for transactions
between one country and another in all parts of the world.1
Side by side with these developments, a sound commercial banking system and
a flexible system of central bank control have been built up, while specialised
institutions such as discount houses, merchant banks, accepting houses, the Stock
Exchanges, investment trusts and finance corporations have evolved to satisfy
particular needs for short-term or long-term finance (see pp. 416-22). The facilities
provided by merchant banks and accepting houses, for example, have long been
used to finance shipments of goods not only to and from Britain, but also between
overseas countries themselves.
Commodity Markets
Britain is the traditional centre for marketing many of the world’s basic com¬
modities. Most of these markets were closed during the war but they were gradually
reopened and are rapidly regaining their previous position. Among the more
important are the Baltic Exchange (the market for shipping and air transport, grain,
seeds and vegetable oils), the London Commodity Exchange (cocoa, coffee, copra,
hides and skins, rubber and sugar), the London Wool Exchange, the London Metal
1 It has been estimated that sterling is used as the currency of account for about 40 per
cent of the world’s international transactions.
TRADE
441
Exchange, the Liverpool Cotton Exchange and the Liverpool Corn Exchange.
Apart from the import of goods for home consumption, many transactions are
arranged between buyers and sellers from other countries and the British com¬
modity exchanges are the most important centres for international dealings in a
wide range of products.
The Foreign Exchange Market
From the beginning of the war until December 1951, authorised spot transactions
in the more important foreign currencies by residents of the United Kingdom
were permitted only at official buying and selling rates, which were fixed at a
narrow margin either side of the respective parities for those currencies in terms of
sterling. Forward margins were also controlled. From 17th December, 1951, wider
spreads, between which spot exchange transactions could take place, were
introduced, and forward margins were entirely freed from control, making it
possible to reopen the Foreign Exchange Market on a restricted basis. Subsequently,
progressive relaxations in the regulations governing foreign exchange operations
have been introduced, particularly in the currencies of the members of the European
Payments Union, where a greater measure of transferability has permitted the
multilateral exchange arbitrage in the currencies of members.
The Market remains subject to United Kingdom Exchange Control regulations,
which continue to govern the purchase and sale of foreign currencies by residents
in the sterling area.
The London Gold Market
The London Gold Market, which had remained closed from the outbreak of war,
was reopened on a restricted basis in March 1954, under the general supervision of
the Bank of England. It has regained its pre-war position as the world’s leading
centre for dealings in gold.
Authorised dealers in gold are now free to deal with residents outside the sterling
area against payment in sterling convertible into dollars, but residents of the sterling
area have access to the Market only as sellers, except where permission is given for
the purchase of gold for essential industrial purposes and for the jewellery trade.
The Sterling System
As a result of Britain’s early lead in international trade and finance, several
countries tended not only to use sterling as their natural currency for international
transactions, but also to maintain central currency reserves in Britain. When
Britain abandoned the gold standard in 1931 these countries, which came to be
known as the ‘sterling bloc’ and later as the ‘sterling area’, did likewise, and pegged
their currency exchange rates to the pound sterling. In 1939, after the outbreak of
war, the pound sterling was no longer freely convertible into other currencies and
the sterling area became more formally defined as a currency area, for exchange
control purposes. Within the sterling area the United Kingdom imposes virtually
no restrictions on payments, whether in respect of current or of capital transactions.
All the Commonwealth countries (except Canada), together with Burma, Iceland,
Iraq, the Irish Republic, Jordan, Libya and the British Protected States in the
Persian Gulf are members of the sterling area. These countries contain one-quarter
of the world’s population and do one-quarter of the world’s trade. The main feature
of the sterling area is that the greater part of the overseas trade of member countries
is financed in sterling; they keep their foreign reserves largely in the form of
sterling and maintain a fixed relationship between their currencies and sterling.
Member countries for the most part sell their foreign currency earnings to the
442
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
United Kingdom Exchange Equalisation Account in exchange for sterling and can
purchase for sterling the foreign currency they require. They generally also sell
gold in the London Market for sterling, and United Kingdom purchases of gold
are also held in the Exchange Equalisation Account. Members have agreed to
exercise restraint in their demands for foreign currency, particularly dollars. South
Africa is in a special position as a large gold producer. Although South Africa used
to finance its net dollar requirements from the sale of its own gold, making available
most of the balance for the central reserves, it now sells most of its gold through
London, acquiring sterling with which it can, like other member countries, draw on
the central reserves for its dollar requirements.
All these currency arrangements are voluntary; there are no strict or centralised
rules of conduct, the Commonwealth member countries agreeing between them¬
selves at periodic conferences the broad policies to be followed for the strengthening
of the reserves.
THE BALANCE OF EXTERNAL PAYMENTS
The United Kingdom’s external payments position is affected by transactions
which fall into three main groups: (i) the United Kingdom balance on current
account; (2) the United Kingdom balance on long-term capital account; and (3)
the balance of the sterling area as a whole on current and capital account.
Balance of Payments on Current Account
The main factors entering into Britain’s balance of payments on current account
are the balance of visible trade payments (i.e. the difference between imports and
exports plus re-exports1), the balance of ‘invisible’ items (including earnings accru¬
ing from shipping, banking, insurance and other professional services, and invest¬
ment income, travel and migrants’ remittances) and the balance of Government
transactions (including overseas military expenditure and Defence Aid received
from the United States).
For over a hundred years the total value of goods imported into Britain each year
has exceeded the total value of goods exported from Britain. The gap, or ‘visible
trade deficit’, has, in pre-war years, been more than covered by net current receipts
from invisible transactions, leaving an overall credit balance which has been applied
to further long-term capital investment overseas.
The Burden of two World Wars
The balance of payments pattern described above was, however, upset in the first
'world war, when export earnings were sacrificed and overseas investments liqui¬
dated in the interests of the war effort. It was also seriously disturbed during the
nineteen-thirties, when the basic exporting industries were hard-hit by the world
economic crisis. A more fundamental disturbance occurred as a consequence of
the second world war.
The Post-war Balance of Payments Problem
The main balance of payments problem for Britain since the second world war
has been to earn enough abroad (1) to pay for half its food and nearly all the
materials needed for its factories2; (2) to provide a balance of payments surplus in
1 Owing to differences in methods of valuation, timing and coverage the estimates of the
value of imports and exports used in balance of payments calculations differ from those
used in the Trade and Navigation Returns which are set out in Table 32.
2 In addition, since the war, the United Kingdom Government has had to meet a heavy
overseas military expenditure. In 1957 this amounted to £160 million in foreign currencies.
TRADE
443
order to build up the gold and foreign exchange reserves needed in a world of
multilateral trading and convertible currencies, and to meet obligations overseas,
including foreign debt service and obligations voluntarily accepted in respect of
development in Commonwealth countries and elsewhere.
The resources available for export have been limited by the very high level of
defence expenditure and by the needs of internal investment.
In the early post-war years the challenge was met by rapid reconversion of pro¬
ductive capacity to the needs of peace, and the mounting of an export drive coupled
with severe restrictions on home consumption and imports. The task of transforming
the United Kingdom economy to meet the changed needs of the post-war world
was assisted by aid received from the United States and Canada in the form of
loans and grants and technical assistance (see pp. 447-8).
Between 1945 and 1951 the balance of payments on current account showed
considerable fluctuations due to a number of factors, including changes in the terms
of trade, the devaluation of the pound sterling in 1949 to protect the sterling area
reserves and the trade boom following the Korean war with its aftermath of high
import prices. In 1946 and 1947 there were large deficits, in 1948 and 1949 small
surpluses, and in 1950 a considerable surplus (£300 million) which was followed
in 1951 by a serious deficit (£403 million). From 1952 onwards, there have been
surpluses in each year except 1955 when there was a deficit of £69 million. The
diagram below illustrates the fluctuations in the balance of payments between
1947 and 1957.

The Balance of Payments of the Sterling Area
In assessing the gold and dollar reserve position of the United Kingdom it is
necessary to take into account not only the United Kingdom balance of payments
but also the balance of payments of the sterling area, of which Britain forms a part.
The reason for this is that the United Kingdom’s gold and dollar reserves serve
also the needs of most of the rest of the sterling area.
The main aspects of the sterling area’s balance of payments are current trans¬
actions, long-term capital movements, and other changes, mainly of a banking
nature, in the United Kingdom’s overseas monetary position.
Current Transactions. There is normally a triangular pattern of trade between the
United Kingdom, the rest of the sterling area and the rest of the world. While the
United Kingdom is usually in current deficit with the non-sterling world, the rest
of the sterling area is usually in current surplus; on the other hand, within the
sterling area, the position is reversed and the United Kingdom normally has a
current surplus with other sterling area countries. Over the period i953—57 the
United Kingdom’s current deficit with the non-sterling world was £457 million
but its surplus with the rest of the sterling area amounted to about £ 1,3°° million. No
comparable figures are available for the rest of the sterling area s current position
with the non-sterling world.
Long-term Capital Transactions. There is normally a large net movement of
capital from the United Kingdom to the rest of the sterling area. (It has been
unofficially estimated that about 70 per cent of the sterling Commonwealth’s capital
inflow since the war has come from the United Kingdom.) In 1953-57 it amounted
to about £1,000 million. This has been one of the most important factors in
BRITAIN! AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
446
maintaining the high level of the rest of the sterling area’s sterling balances. In the
same period there was a net movement of about £60 million from the United
Kingdom to the non-sterling world (after allowing for the United States Export-
Import Bank credit of £8g million to Britain in 1957).
Taking current and long-term capital account transactions together, the sterling
area as a whole between 1953-57 was £34° million in surplus with the non-sterling
world. This was made up of the United Kingdom’s overall deficit of £510 million
and the rest of the sterling area’s overall surplus (including gold sales in the United
Kingdom) of £850 million. In the same period the United Kingdom’s balance of
current and long-term capital transactions with the rest of the sterling area amounted
to a surplus of approximately £300 million.
The balance of payments on current transactions and on long-term capital account
are together reflected in changes in the United Kingdom’s monetary assets and
liabilities, i.e. in its position as an international banker. These changes fall under
three main headings: (1) changes in the sterling holdings of overseas countries
both in the sterling area and outside; (2) changes in the United Kingdom’s gold
and dollar reserves; and (3) miscellaneous capital movements, including movements
of short-term capital drawings from and repayments to the International Monetary
Fund, and changes in the United Kingdom debit balance in the European Payments
Union (EPU).
I957 the United Kingdom’s current trade and long-term investment account
showed a surplus of £48 million. But this reflected considerable changes in monetary
assets and liabilities. The sterling holdings of overseas countries fell by £154 million
(almost equivalent to the reduction in 1956), the gold and dollar reserves rose by
£50 million (in 1956 there was little change), and there was a net increase in other
liabilities of £ 156 million.
Table 39 shows the gold and dollar reserves at the end of each year from 1946 to
1957. At the end of August 1958, these reserves amounted to £1,103 million
( $3,089 million). Table 40 shows the amounts of sterling held by overseas countries
at various dates from 1954 to 1957.

External Financial Aid received by Britain
Britain’s difficulties in balancing its external accounts, particularly with the
dollar area, in the immediate post-war years, have been alleviated appreciably by
aid received from Canada and the United States.
In 1945, the United States extended to Britain a line of credit amounting to
$3>75° million, and a loan of $650 million (later adjusted to $622 million) in
settlement of Lend-Lease and reciprocal aid adjustments arising out of the war.
In 1946, Canada also extended a line of credit, amounting to SC. 1,250 million, of
which the United Kingdom drew SC. 1,185 million. The terms of settlement with
both countries provided for payment in 50 annual instalments, starting on 31st
December, 1951, with interest at the rate of 2 per cent a year. The original loan
agreements included provision for waiver of interest under certain circumstances.
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
448
In March 1957, these were replaced by new arrangements whereby the United
Kingdom Government could defer up to seven of the annuity payments of both
capital and interest if it judged postponement necessary, either because of inter¬
national exchange considerations or on account of the level of its gold and foreign
exchange reserves.
Between 1948 and 1951, Britain received in all $2,700 million in Marshall Aid
from the United States under the European Recovery Programme. Of this, $1,700
million was grant aid, some $620 million was ‘conditional’ aid (i.e. dollar aid on
condition that Britain provided corresponding sterling aid to other European
countries) and $337 million was a loan to be repaid with interest at 2j per cent.
By far the greater part of the Marshall Aid allocated to Britain was used to buy
essential food and raw materials. But technical assistance and help in promoting
intra-European trade co-operation were also provided.
Since 1951, the financial aid received by Britain from the United States has been
mostly under the provisions of the United States Mutual Defence Assistance Pro¬
gramme and Mutual Security Programme. Between 1952 and 1957, net receipts by
Britain amounted to $1,150 million, including a loan of $48 million repayable with
interest at 2i per cent. Mutual Defence Assistance allocations in 1950-51 totalled
$122 million, mainly for the purchase of machine tools. The Mutual Security
grants of $241 million in 1951-52 and $369 million in 1952-53 were used chiefly
to buy raw materials. After 1952, United States surplus agricultural commodities
(mainly cotton, fruit and tobacco) were made available to the United Kingdom for
payment in sterling; these funds were used by the United States to finance the
purchase of military equipment (notably aircraft) in the United Kingdom. In
1956, the United Kingdom ceased to be allocated any Mutual Security Aid; it
has, however, entered into small deals whereby purchases of fruit and tobacco
for sterling have financed the building of houses, both in the United Kingdom and
the West Indies, for use at nominal rents by the United States armed forces.
The Mutual Security Programme has also assisted Britain’s dollar balance of
payments by the system of ‘offshore procurement’, under which the United States
has placed contracts in Britain for military goods to be supplied to other NATO
countries.
United States Private Investment in Britain
Since the war, Britain’s dollar balance of payments has also derived considerable
benefit from the expansion of United States corporate investment in Britain and
the growth of licensing arrangements between United Kingdom and United States
companies.
It has been estimated1 that between 1950 and 1956 the total book value of United
States direct investments in Britain rose from $847 million to $1,600 million. The
1956 total included $279 million in petroleum refining and distribution and
$1,039 million in manufacturing industry (chiefly motor vehicles and equipment,
machinery, electrical appliances, chemicals, metals and food products). Much of
this investment is in expanding trades such as agricultural tractors, earth-moving
equipment and office machinery.
In general, this United States investment has enabled Britain to acquire some
new techniques and to make considerable savings in imports (particularly imports
from the dollar area) and at the same time to expand its exports of several important
products.

TRADE

North American investors are ensured of the right to repatriate their profits and
also—if they choose to sell out—to repatriate the proceeds of that sale, including
any capital gains that may have accrued.
United Kingdom Government Grants and Loans to Other Countries
In spite of its post-war economic difficulties, the United Kingdom has made
available to other countries considerable sums in grants and loans for relief,
rehabilitation and development. Between 1946 and 1957, the United Kingdom
Government paid out in this way more than £1,000 million.
Aid provided through United Kingdom Government channels between 1952 and
1957 has included the following: £3'7 million for technical aid under the Colombo
Plan for Co-operative Economic Development in South and South-East Asia;
£4 million for the United Nations expanded programme of technical assistance
(in addition to contributions to United Nations technical agencies); £73-1 million
for the Middle East and £14 million for Yugoslavia.
For Commonwealth development, Government finance is, in addition, provided
as follows:
1. The Colonial Development and Welfare Acts of 1945, 195° and 1955 pro¬
vided for the expenditure of £230 million over the period 1946-60 to
supplement local revenues and loan resources in United Kingdom depen¬
dencies for development and welfare purposes. Of this amount, a sum of
£120 million remains available for the five-year period 1955 to i960.
2. The Colonial Development Corporation, created in 1948, can borrow from
the United Kingdom Government up to £130 million for investment in
projects mainly of a commercial nature in the United Kingdom depen¬
dencies; about £81 million had been approved by the end of 1957, at
which time 76 projects were in operation.
3. A number of Colonial Governments also receive direct financial aid from
the United Kingdom Government for current purposes.
4. The United Kingdom Government decided to release just under £80
million from its sterling subscription to the International Bank for
Reconstruction and Development for use by the Bank for loans to Common¬
wealth countries of the sterling area over a period of years, which began
in 1953. The remaining £4 million of this sterling subscription, and also
the United Kingdom’s gold and dollar subscription to the International
Bank amounting to over £9 million, had previously been made available to
the Bank for use in loans not confined to Commonwealth countries. The
United Kingdom Government has also agreed that the International
Bank can re-lend sums repaid to the Bank on loans financed by these
contributions, thus providing a revolving fund at the disposal of the Bank.
5. Under special arrangements, a credit of £10 million was made available to
Pakistan in 1953 through the Export Credits Guarantee Department, and
a loan of £38-5 million was offered to India in September 1958.
United Kingdom Private Overseas Investment
With the progress of post-war recovery, Britain has been able to resume its role
as a provider of funds for investment in development overseas, particularly in the
Commonwealth. Thus, between the end of 1946 and the end of April 1958,
Commonwealth and Colonial Governments borrowed £292 million on the London
450
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
capital market (excluding sums set aside for local subscription). Of this total, £164
million was raised after the end of 1952, the Colonial territories borrowing £74
million and independent Commonwealth countries £90 million. These figures do
not include conversion issues and do not take account of redemptions of maturing
loans. The loans raised are for financing public capital works undertaken by the
Governments concerned or by the public authorities for whose capital needs they
may be wholly or partly responsible.
The general principles governing access to the London capital market by private
interests for investment overseas are, in broad terms, similar to those applied to
borrowing by Governments, i.e. applicants must show, in general, that directly or
indirectly the project will benefit the sterling area’s balance of payments. Amounts
of more than £50,000 require the consent of the United Kingdom Treasury, which
is guided in its decisions by the Capital Issues Committee (see pp. 421-2). In 1957,
the Committee approved applications for new capital issues for overseas to the
value of £97-8 million. Development in the sterling area Commonwealth is also
being assisted through the Commonwealth Development Finance Company Ltd.
(see p. 420) which, by 31st March, 1958, had invested or committed £14-6 million.
Private capital from Britain going directly into private overseas enterprises and
the reinvestment of profits from existing undertakings have always represented an
important element in Commonwealth development. Under the Finance Act, 1957,
overseas trade corporations (i.e. generally speaking, companies which, though
managed and controlled in the United Kingdom, carry on all their trading activities
overseas) are exempted from United Kingdom income tax and profits tax on their
trading profits earned overseas. It is not possible to measure the supply of invest¬
ment funds with any accuracy, since only those which involve raising new money
are subject to control. In the case of Canada—a dollar area country—where, as
with all non-sterling countries, United Kingdom investment requires Exchange
Control approval as well as Capital Issues consent where new borrowing is involved,
participation by United Kingdom investors in economic development has been
facilitated in various ways, and private investment in Canada was authorised to the
extent of £44 million in 1954, £32 million in 1955, and more than £30 million in
1956. In addition, the investment of smaller amounts in the United States and
other foreign countries was authorised.
Total Net Overseas Investment
Between 1946 and 1957, United Kingdom net long-term investment overseas has
amounted to approximately £1,700 million (including some £260 million in 1957).
The average overseas investment figure for 1954-57 represented nearly ij per
cent of United Kingdom national income, a higher proportion than that of any
other major country.
EXTERNAL TRADE
The internal trade of the United Kingdom can be divided into two broad
categories: trade in raw materials, capital goods and intermediate products (for
example, vehicle components) and trade in consumer goods, that is to say goods
for direct sale to the public. (The pattern of consumers’ expenditure is outlined in
Chapter VIII, The National Economy, see p. 234.)
The results of the Census of Distribution taken in 1951, relating to 1950 and
published between 1953 and 1955 (the Census of Distribution and Other Services,
1950) made it possible to obtain for the first time a fully documented account of the
structure of the distributive trades in Britain. The Census covered the numbers and
TRADE
451
types of establishments and organisations in the wholesale and retail trades in
Great Britain (but not in Northern Ireland), the numbers employed, wages and
salaries, sales and other information on both a national and an area basis, including
all towns with a population of more than 25,000. In the case of the wholesale trade,
the Census covered about 92 per cent of all establishments; the corresponding
proportion of retail trade outlets was 91 per cent, responsible for 95 per cent of
total turnover. The Census showed that, in the undertakings covered, a total of
nearly 3,800,000 people, including ‘working proprietors and unpaid family workers’,
were employed in the distributive trades in 1950. This total was made up of about
800,000 in wholesale establishments, 2,300,000 in retail establishments and 700,000
in services trades, such as catering and hairdressing.
WHOLESALE TRADE
On the basis of some pre-war researches,1 it would appear that about 17 per cent
of sales were made to consumers through producers’ own selling organisations,
including their own retail outlets and mail-order businesses, while more than 40 per
cent were accounted for by direct sales by producers to retailers; and it is estimated
that approximately a further 40 per cent of sales move through wholesale channels.
These channels are most in evidence in the distribution of textiles, agricultural
produce and foodstuffs. The 1950 Census returns showed that out of a total of some
55,700 wholesale establishments, there were about 7,000 in the clothing, footwear
and textile trades, 6,900 in the groceries, confectionery and drink trades and 6,900
in other food trades.
Methods of wholesale distribution vary according to the type of merchandise
handled. Fresh fish, for example, is auctioned at the ports to port wholesalers who
sell to inland wholesalers at the main distribution centres or, in some cases, direct
to retailers; fruit and vegetables, on the other hand, may be sold by growers to
commission agents who dispose of the produce either to wholesalers or direct to
retailers, or alternatively the grower may deal only with wholesale firms.
RETAIL TRADE
Types of Retail Shops
Retail shops in Britain may be classified under four heads: (1) independent retail
businesses consisting of one or more shops (such establishments account for
about one-half of the total retail turnover); (2) departmental stores with a number
of departments selling different types of goods (in some cases a firm may own
several departmental stores); (3) multiple shops (included within this category
are the variety chain stores, which handle a wide range of merchandise); and
(4) retail co-operative societies. In addition, there are a number of market and
street traders, but, according to the 195° Census of Distribution, the amount of
business done by these traders is usually very small; the turnover of each averaged
under £2,000 a year.
The Census provided extensive information on the structure of the retail trade
in Great Britain. There are a large number of small undertakings, including more
than 400,000 with working proprietors; 25O)000 retail outlets each had, in i95°>
an annual turnover of under £5,000. Out of a total of 53I>I43 establishments

some unofficial pioneer studies, for example, The Distribution of Consumer Goods, by
James B. Jefferys, published in 1950.

Present Trends in Retail Trade
In recent years multiple concerns and the retail co-operative societies have
succeeded in raising their sales relative to those of other groups. The indices of
weekly sales published monthly by the Board of Trade show that sales of multiple
TRADE
453
retailers and retail co-operatives rose by 73 per cent and 64 per cent, respectively,
between 1950 and 1957. The corresponding advance by independent retailers
amounted to 46 per cent and by general departmental stores to 27 per cent. Between
1956 and 1957 there was a 5 per cent increase in all retail sales, which is slightly
under the average annual rate of expansion since 1950. The growth in the value of
retail sales has been most marked in food shops, partly reflecting the higher than
average rise in food prices, and in sales of radio and electrical goods.
Self-Service Shops and Other Developments
The development of self-service in retail establishments since 1950 has probably
helped the multiple stores and the retail co-operatives to achieve a higher rate of
expansion in sales. Unofficial estimates give the number of self-service shops in
operation in the United Kingdom at the end of July 1958 as over 4,000, and new
self-service outlets are being established at the rate of 500 to 600 a year. About 60
per cent of these shops are thought to be owned by retail co-operative societies and
the majority of the remainder by multiple stores.
Supermarkets, which may be broadly defined as self-service shops with a selling
area of more than 2,500 square feet, have been introduced recently in the United
Kingdom, particularly by Co-operative Societies. Self-service shops as a whole have
been estimated to be responsible for 7 to 8 per cent of retail sales in the grocery trade,
but for other types of merchandise, the proportion is thought to be insignificant.
There has also been a large increase in the number of mobile shops serving out¬
lying housing estates and rural areas. About 8,000 are estimated to be in operation,
the majority selling groceries or other foodstuffs; several manufacturers specialise
in building fully equipped vehicles for this type of trading.
Mail Order Firms
Retail sales, amounting to over £150 million annually, are conducted through
mail order firms. The two largest enterprises are responsible for about half the
total turnover, the bulk of sales consisting of clothing, footwear and household
textiles. The smaller mail order businesses normally specialise in a single commodity,
notably in the sale by post of seeds, plants and small horticultural requisites.
Retail Co-operative Societies
The retail co-operative societies are voluntary non-profit-making organisations
engaged in the retail trade and controlled by their members who are also their
customers. An operating surplus is returned periodically, to members as a
dividend, and the amount distributed is proportionate to the value of the
member’s purchases over the period.
Retail co-operatives also sell to the general public, but membership is open to
anyone paying a small deposit on a minimum share, which entitles the member to
an equal voice with other members in determining the policy of the society. Invest¬
ment by individual members is limited to £5°° but the rules of some societies may
fix lower limits. Only a low rate of interest is paid on the shares.
At the end of 1956, there were 1,006 retail co-operative societies registered under
the Industrial and Provident Societies Act, but amalgamations are slowly diminish¬
ing the number of societies. More than a quarter of the total membership of the
co-operatives (11,856,000, an increase in the year of 297,000) was provided by the
eleven largest societies, each of which had a membership of more than 120,000.
One, the London Co-operative Society with about 1-3 million members, is the
largest retail co-operative in the world. Total sales of the retail co-operative societies
in 1956 reached £886 million, the largest having a turnover of more than £50 million.
454
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Retail co-operative societies are free to purchase where they wish or to produce
their own goods, but in order to secure the advantages of large-scale production
and distribution, they have collectively established wholesale and production
societies.1
In rQSSj an Independent Commission was set up by the Co-operative Union
to survey the whole field of co-operative production and marketing. In its report,
published in May 1958, the Commission stressed the rapid progress made by the
co-operative movement over the past fifty years, drew attention to certain short¬
comings, such as the failure to keep pace with the expansion of sales by multiple
stores, and made several recommendations for reorganisation. These included
proposals for the amalgamation of smaller retail co-operative societies, and for
the concentration of the productive effort of the wholesale co-operative societies
on a narrower range of goods.
Hire-Purchase Sales
The rapid growth of sales of household and durable consumer goods—such as
furniture, washing machines, refrigerators and cookers—has been greatly assisted
by the development of instalment purchasing. Hire-purchase finance is made
available by numerous finance companies, as well as by wholesalers and retailers.
Finance companies specialising in this form of credit derive their funds from
several sources, including their paid-up capital, debentures, loans from commercial
banks and deposits by the general public. At the end of 1957, finance houses
were carrying about £257 million of hire-purchase and other instalment debt,
the twelve largest houses accounting for about two-thirds of this total. In 1958,
certain commercial banks acquired holdings in the ordinary share capital of a
number of hire-purchase finance companies. In July 1954, the Government
removed controls over hire-purchase and credit sales. As part of the measures
taken by the Government to restrain credit, however, controls were re-imposed
in February 1955. These took the form of stipulating minimum initial
payments, varied according to the type of product, and maximum periods for
payments. Measures were also taken to limit severely the amount of new
capital which hire-purchase finance companies were permitted to raise, but in
July 1958 these restrictions were partially relaxed. Since October 1955, the
Board of Trade has compiled a series of monthly returns, on a sample basis,
relating to hire-purchase sales and these have been continued on a revised
basis since July 1957 to include other kinds of instalment credit. According
to these returns, about 44 per cent of the sales of furniture shops and shops selling
furnishings, and about 30 per cent of those of hardware goods shops during the
latter half of 1957 were hire-purchase or other instalment credit transactions. It
has been estimated that at the end of 1957 the total amount of instalment debt
was about £484 million.
Consumer Protection
Various legislative measures exist in the United Kingdom to protect the con¬
sumer against specific abuses. Independent organisations have also sought to
establish voluntary minimum standards of quality.
The Merchandise Marks Acts, 1887-1953, are designed to ensure that the
marking of goods is both accurate and honest. Weights and Measures legislation,
1 The two major wholesale societies are the Co-operative Wholesale Society Limited
and the Scottish Co-operative Wholesale Society Limited.
TRADE
455
one of the earliest forms of consumer protection, is strictly enforced by qualified
inspectors. In establishing standardisation of consumer goods, the British Standards
Institution (see p. 251) is providing valuable services and the Council of Industrial
Design (see p. 214) helps to foster improvements in the design of consumer goods.
Advice to the public on the quality and price of consumer goods and services is
provided through the British Standards Institution’s Consumer Advisory Council,
with a membership of over 35,000, and also by a private body, the Association for
Consumer Research Ltd., which has more than 70,000 members. Individual
trades and industries have also taken measures towards raising standards of quality.
The purity, hygiene and description of food are controlled by the Food and
Drugs Acts, 1955 and 1956 (see p. 140).

XIV. SOUND AND
TELEVISION BROADCASTING
Broadcasting of sound and of television in the United Kingdom is regulated
under powers conferred on the Postmaster General by the Wireless Telegraphy
Acts, 1949-1955, which prohibit the sending or receiving of radio communications,
except under licence. Users of sound and television receiving sets must obtain an
annual licence, which can be purchased from most post offices.
Sound broadcasting services are provided solely by the British Broadcasting
Corporation (BBC), which was established as a public corporation by Royal Charter
in 1927. Television services are provided by both the British Broadcasting Cor¬
poration and the Independent Television Authority (ITA), which was established
by the Television Act, 1954.
The number of receiving licences current in the United Kingdom at the end of
June 1958 was 14,658,381, of which 8,253,305 were for sound and television com¬
bined, and 6,405,076 (including 345,984 for sets fitted in cars) for sound only.
The former costs £3 annually, plus £1 excise duty, the latter £1. One licence
covers all receiving sets in a household, but a separate licence is required for sets
fitted in cars.
Broadcasting Authorities
When sound broadcasting began in the United Kingdom in 1922, it was decided
in Parliament that the Postmaster General should grant only one licence for that
purpose at any one time; and the first licence was granted exclusively to a limited
company (the British Broadcasting Company). The decision to grant only one
licence for broadcasting was maintained when the British Broadcasting Corporation
(BBC) was formed to take over the functions of the limited company in 1927; it was
reaffirmed when, in 1937, the BBC’s second Charter was granted, which covered the
sound services and the first high definition public television service in the world,
inaugurated by the BBC in 1936; and it was upheld throughout the second world
war and during the post-war period until 1952.
During the war, public service television broadcasting was suspended, and trans¬
missions were not resumed until 1946. After resumption, however, the television
service gained rapidly both in technical efficiency and in popularity; and between
1949 and 1952 (when the BBC’s Charter was again due to be renewed) the Govern¬
ment instituted a major review of sound and television broadcasting which aroused
great interest in Parliament, in the Press and among the public. After prolonged
parliamentary and general discussion (during the course of which the first non¬
exclusive broadcasting licence was granted to the BBC) it was decided by the
Government that the potential power of television was so great that it would be
undesirable to leave transmission services in this medium in the hands of a single
authority, however excellent. The Independent Television Authority was therefore
established in 1954 to provide services additional to those of the BBC for an initial
period of ten years; and independent television transmissions began in 1955—the
BBC’s monopoly in the provision of sound broadcasting services remaining
undisturbed.

SOUND AND TELEVISION BROADCASTING
457
Both the BBC and the ITA are independent authorities in so far as daily admini¬
stration and presentation of programmes are concerned. The Government, how¬
ever, retains ultimate control, and the Postmaster General, as the responsible
minister, is answerable to Parliament on broad questions of policy. The Postmaster
General may also issue directions to the Corporation and to the ITA on a number
of technical and other subjects; and he has power to prohibit the broadcasting of
any particular matter or class of matter, or to revoke their Licences at any time.
Both the BBC and the ITA are required to publish annual Reports and Accounts,
which are presented by the Postmaster General to Parliament.
The BBC and the ITA both consult with the Postmaster General as to the hours
of television broadcasting, and he has approved an arrangement which limits it to
a maximum of 50 hours a week with no more than eight hours on any one day,
although extensions are permitted for certain stated purposes, such as religious
broadcasts, ministerial and party political broadcasts, schools broadcasts, outside
broadcasts and Welsh language broadcasts. The authorities may broadcast television
programmes, within the prescribed maxima, during any periods best suited to the
needs of their audiences. The BBC broadcasts in all four of its domestic sound
services for some 18 hours out of the 24.
Organisation and Finance
The BBC operates under the provisions of two documents, each granted for
limited periods at the end of which they may be renewed or amended: the Charter,
which sets out the constitution, objects and internal organisation of the Corporation
and contains certain financial provisions; and the Licence and Agreement between
the Corporation and the Postmaster General, which deals with technical matters,
certain non-technical conditions such as the prohibition of commercial advertise¬
ments and sponsored programmes, and details of the financial arrangements in
force. The operations of the ITA are governed by the provisions of the Television
Act, 1954, which formulate its constitution, its functions, its purpose and the
framework of its finances; and by the Licence (which contains technical provisions)
issued to it by the Postmaster General in 1955.
The British Broadcasting Corporation
Under the current charter (which came into force in 1952 and expires in 1962)
the Corporation consists of nine governors (including a chairman, a vice-chairman
and separate national governors for Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland) each
appointed for a period of not more than five years by the Sovereign in Council.
As a corporate body, the governors are responsible for the conduct of the whole
broadcasting operation, including the content and presentation of the programmes
in sound and television, and the provision and working of the necessary installations
and equipment.
In the discharge of its responsibilities, the Corporation ensures that its services
are used, as stated in the preamble to the Charter, 'as a means of disseminating
information, education and entertainment’; it must pay heed to the requirements
of the Licence (e.g., it must allow the broadcasting of any announcement at the
request of a Government Department, and it must strictly exclude commercial
advertisements in any form from its programmes); and it must refrain from formu¬
lating or allowing the expression of editorial opinion, since to express such opinion
would be to depart from the rule of impartiality which the BBC is expected to
observe in current affairs and matters of public issue.
The governors are advised on all aspects of their work by a number of councils,
established in accordance with the terms of the Charter, e.g., the General
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
458
Advisory Council, which has been in existence, except for a break during the war
years, since 1934; the National Broadcasting Councils for Scotland and Wales,
which, under the chairmanship of the national governors for Scotland and Wales,
are responsible for the domestic sound services in those countries; and the Regional
Advisory Councils for the English regions and for Northern Ireland. There are
also a number of other councils and committees, not specifically required by the
Charter, but established by the BBC to advise on such matters as religious broad¬
casting, schools broadcasting, music and agriculture.
The chief executive officer of the BBC is the Director-General, who is appointed
by the governors at their discretion and with whom they discuss all major matters
of policy and finance. Under the Director-General are eight directors (the Chief
Assistant to the Director-General, and the Directors of Sound Broadcasting, Tele¬
vision Broadcasting, News and Current Affairs, External Broadcasting, Engineering,
Administration, and Staff Administration) who, between them, cover the whole
work of the Corporation, and who, with the Director-General, constitute the
Board of Management of the BBC. The number of staff employed in 1958 was
approximately 15,470.
The services of the BBC are financed from (1) an annual sum, voted by Parliament,
which is related to revenue derived from the sale by the Post Office of wireless
receiving licences; (2) an annual grant-in-aid, voted by Parliament, for the External
Services, i.e. the European Services, the Overseas Services, and the Monitoring
Service; and (3) profits from BBC publications, mainly the Radio Times, which has
a weekly sale of about 8 million copies and attracts a large advertising revenue. The
gross revenue from the sale of licences for the year ended 31st March, 1958,
amounted to £30,839,215, excluding the excise duty which is not regarded as part
of the income from licences and is not available to be spent on broadcasting.
Under the terms of an agreement with the Postmaster General, entered into in
1957, the Treasury retains 12^ per cent of the net revenue from the sale of licences,
i.e. the gross revenue less a sum deducted by the Post Office, equal to the actual
expenses it incurs in collecting the licence fees, investigating complaints of
interference and rendering other services, and the cost of administration. In
i957_58, the Post Office deducted £i,93i)3i3 from the gross revenue, the
Treasury retained £3,610,375 of the net revenue, and the Corporation received a
net income of £25,297,527- In the same period, the total net revenue from publi¬
cations was £706,956; and grant-in-aid receipts amounted to £6,054,000, including
£5,270,000 for broadcasting expenditure. Additional sums may be paid to the Cor¬
poration if, on application by the BBC to the Postmaster General, the Treasury
is satisfied that the income of the Corporation is insufficient for the adequate
conduct of home broadcasting during any portion of the term of the Licence.
The Independent Television Authority
The Independent Television Authority consists of a chairman, a deputy chairman
and eight ordinary members (three of whom have special responsibility for Scot¬
land, Wales and Monmouthshire, and Northern Ireland severally) appointed
by the Postmaster General. The Authority owns and operates the transmitting
stations, but the production studios and equipment are owned, and the actual
programmes are provided, by commercial programme companies under contract
to the Authority. These companies pay the Authority for the right to present
programmes, which may include advertisements. The Authority is, however,
required by the Television Act to satisfy itself that the programmes maintain
certain standards—e.g., it must ensure that they do not offend against good taste
or decency, that they are balanced in their subject matter, that they preserve
SOUND AND TELEVISION BROADCASTING
459
due impartiality in presenting matters of industrial or political controversy, and that
the news is reported accurately. The Authority therefore has controlling and
regulatory powers of a wide and important character in regard to programmes
and advertisements, as well as the task of choosing the programme contractors and
drawing up the contracts under which they are to operate.
In the discharge of its duties, the Authority is advised by three statutory
committees: the Advertising Advisory Committee, the Children’s Advisory
Committee, and the Central Religious Advisory Committee, which by arrangement
with the BBC acts as the statutory advisory body to the ITA on religious broad¬
casting. The ITA has also appointed a panel of five consultants to assist it in the
exercise of its day-to-day responsibilities for religious services and programmes.
There is also a Sports Advisory Committee, appointed by the ITA, to advise on
all matters concerned with the televising of sport.
The chief executive officer of the ITA is the Director-General. There is also a
Deputy Director-General, and a headquarters staff covering all technical, admini¬
strative, clerical, typing and office services, which numbered 79 in April 1958.
Staff has also been recruited for the transmitting stations and for regional offices,
bringing the total number of ITA staff to some 208. Nine programme companies
are under contract with the ITA: Associated-Rediffusion Limited; Associated
Television Limited; ABC Television Limited; Granada TV Network Limited;
Scottish Television Limited; Independent Television for South Wales and the
West of England Limited (T.W.W. Ltd.); Southern Television Limited; Tyne-Tees
Television Limited; and Anglia Television Company. A common news service is
provided by Independent Television News Limited. A Standing Consultative
Committee, composed of two representatives of the ITA and a representative of
each of the programme companies, provides consultative machinery between the
Authority and the companies on matters affecting the companies as a whole. There
is also an Independent Television Companies Association Limited, designed to
further the collective interests of the companies with such outside bodies as trade
unions and sporting organisations, and generally to ensure that they speak as
far as possible with one voice on public issues connected with television broad¬
casting policy.
The ITA receives no payments from licence revenue; its finance is drawn from
payments made to it by the programme companies which, in the year ended 31st
March, 1958, amounted to £2,284,086. In addition, advances (limited to £1 million
during the first year of the Authority’s existence and to a total of £2 million in all
during the first five years) may be made by the Postmaster General with the
consent of the Treasury for the purpose of paying initial expenses and for providing
the ITA with working capital. However, by the end of March 1958 (some two and
a half years after the inauguration of independent television) only £555>000 had
been loaned to the Authority under this head, and this amount is now in the process
of being repaid. There is also provision in the Television Act for an annual Ex¬
chequer grant, not exceeding £750,000, to be made to the Authority, but it has
not, in fact, been found necessary to pay this grant.
Sound Broadcasting
The BBC operates four domestic sound broadcasting services from 59 trans¬
mitting stations, and two main groups of external broadcasting services from 37
high power, high frequency transmitters in the United Kingdom and from two
(used for relay purposes) at Tebrau, near Singapore. Until recently, the domestic
sound services were broadcast solely on long and medium wavelengths, allocated
to the United Kingdom under the Copenhagen Agreement of 1948, which aimed
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
460
at minimising interference between the broadcasting stations of the participating
countries. However, the growth in the number of European broadcasting stations
after that date (there are now twice as many as in 1948) so diminished the effective¬
ness of the Agreement that, in 1955, the BBC began to establish a network of very
high frequency (VHF) transmitters. By 1958, fifteen permanent VHP transmitting
stations had been built and put into operation, and the VHF service is now available
to some 93 per cent of the population. The VHF stations broadcast the Home
Service appropriate to the region in which they are situated, as well as the Light
Programme, the Third Programme and Network Three, and for all these services
greatly improved reception is assured. Seven more such stations have been
approved by the Postmaster General.
There are 157 studios for the domestic sound programmes, of which 61 are in
London and 96 at various centres in the regional areas. The external services use
32 London studios. There are also semi-automatic studios which can be operated
in 14 different centres in the United Kingdom by a programme official without
the attendance of an engineer.
Domestic Services
The domestic sound services, which produce over 20,000 programme hours a
year, are designed to cater for the varying tastes of a diverse listening public. They
consist of the Home Service, the Light Programme, the Third Programme, and
Network Three.
The Home Service, which occupies some 18 hours a day, is planned to serve
the broad middle section of the community. It provides a wide range of musical
programmes (with particular emphasis on the great standard works of music)
and plays (including the classics and contemporary drama). The principal
news and information programmes, discussions on domestic and foreign
affairs, party political broadcasts, special programmes for children and
young people (e.g., Children’s Hour, and Broadcasts for Schools), religious
programmes, and ‘outside broadcasts’ (which take the listener to national
occasions and sporting events) are also produced on the Home Service. In
addition, the Home Service is the vehicle for regional broadcasting, which is
the generic term for programmes specially compiled for listeners in Scotland,
Northern Ireland, Wales, the north of England, the Midlands and the west of
England. All these services carry items from the basic Home Service, together
with programmes produced within the region; the Welsh Service also broad¬
casts a daily bilingual programme.
The Light Programme, which occupies some 18 hours a day, is intended for
those who wish to enjoy relaxation and distraction in the least demanding
form. Entertainment programmes are the main feature; they include light
music and dance music as well as variety programmes, short plays, program¬
mes for women and children (e.g., Woman’s Hour and ‘Listen with Mother’)
and regular news summaries and bulletins. There are also frequent ‘outside
broadcasts’ on the Light Programme, and commentaries on sport.
The Third Programme, which normally occupies three hours in the evening
(five on Saturdays and Sundays) is planned for minority audiences. The range,
style and presentation of its programmes, which include music, drama, talks
and features, are intended to satisfy listeners’ intellectual maturity and
cultural interests. The programme claims on the one hand to be contem¬
porary and forward-looking, and on the other to represent the artistic
SOUND AND TELEVISION BROADCASTING 461
achievements of the past; it has an international flavour in that many of
the plays presented are translations of European drama or are by American
authors, and many of the talks are about foreign political thought and cultural
activities in countries overseas.
Network Three, which occupies between one and two hours on weekday even¬
ings, provides programmes of specialised interest, mainly programmes of the
spoken word. It is intended as a means of meeting the practical needs (e.g., for
further education, learning a foreign language, or acquiring expert information
on various aspects of hobbies or work) of groups of people, which cannot
properly be met during the evening hours by the other services.
Each of the domestic sound services has its own characteristics, but the Home
Service and the Light Programme are planned together and are sometimes synchro¬
nised for a part of the day, while the Third Programme is co-ordinated with the
other two, so far as is practicable, to ensure the widest possible choice of pro¬
grammes for listeners.
External Services
The external broadcasting services of the BBC are intended to provide a link of
culture, information and entertainment between the peoples of the United Kingdom
and those in all other parts of the world; to present events of world-wide importance
with speed and accuracy; and generally to reflect British opinion and the British
way of life. These services are heard in English and in 40 other languages through¬
out the world for a total, between them, of about 81 hours a day, which is longer
than the output of all the BBC’s domestic sound and television services added
together, and involves the transmission of some 48,000 news bulletins and 50,000
talks (including press reviews) in the course of a year.
The services, under the Director of External Broadcasting, are divided into the
European Services and the Overseas Services, each in charge of a Controller.
Within these two groups are the regional divisions. Common to both groups is the
External Services News Department, which prepares all the news broadcasts for
overseas audiences.
The European Services broadcast over 200 programme hours a week and are
sub-divided into five regional groupings: French, South European (Spain,
Italy, Greece, Turkey), Central European (Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Poland),
East European (Soviet Union, Roumania, Bulgaria, Yugoslavia, Albania), and
German. There is also a Finnish Service; and an English Service is directed to
the whole of Europe. The material broadcast by the regional services is
mainly supplied by two central departments; the European Talks Department
and the European Production Department.
The Overseas Services, which are directed to countries outside Europe, broad¬
cast about 350 programme hours a week. They comprise the General Overseas
Service (started as the Empire Service in 1932) with its world-wide audience
of English-speaking listeners, and a number of regional services in English and
24 other languages. The General Overseas Service pays special attention to its
audiences in the Commonwealth, to British Forces and to British communities
overseas; it gives a complete programme service, including news bulletins,
talks, music, light entertainment, religious services and sport, for 21 hours
every day. The regional services include: the African, Caribbean, and Colonial
Services; the North American, the Pacific and the South African Services; the
Eastern Service for the Arab countries and for India, Pakistan, Ceylon, Israel
462
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
and Iran; the Far Eastern Service; the Latin American Service; and ‘London
Calling Asia’, a programme in English for English-speaking Asians.
T he external broadcasting services also include the Transcription Services, which
record each year over 700 BBC sound programmes and a similar number of tele¬
recordings and films made by the BBC television service, and distribute them to
broadcasting organisations in all parts of the world; the 'English by Radio' service,
which distributes English lessons with explanations in 32 languages and reaches an
audience of several millions by direct transmission from London and by recorded
broadcasts from local stations; and the Monitoring Service, which reports foreign
broadcasts from more than 40 countries in more than 30 languages and works under
a reciprocal agreement with its American counterpart as regards monitored material
from the Far East and other areas inaudible in the United Kingdom.
The selection of the countries to which the external broadcasting services are to
be directed, and the time on the air to be allotted to each, rests with the Government
Departments concerned with overseas relations. On appropriate occasions, these
Departments are consulted about the content of the programmes, for which the
BBC is generally responsible.
The BBC maintains offices for its representatives in New York, Paris, Ottawa,
Toronto, Sydney, New Delhi and Beirut, to encourage local interest in the BBC
and to provide the BBC with advice and help concerning programmes, whether for
home listeners about that area or for listeners in the area itself. The offices (which
are concerned with the whole field of sound radio and, where appropriate, tele¬
vision) are also responsible for promoting good relations with the local broadcasting
organisations, and for keeping the BBC informed about local broadcasting and
other developments of interest; in these matters, they work closely with the BBC’s
Overseas and Foreign Relations Department. Audience research is undertaken by
sampling surveys (carried out in five or six different countries each year), and by
listener panels, of which there are more than 20 in operation, covering all parts of
the world.
Television Broadcasting
In the BBC launched the world’s first public television service. By 1958,
this service was being transmitted from 20 stations and was available to over 98 per
cent of the population.
The BBC television service broadcasts a maximum of 50 hours of programmes
a week, with permitted extensions (averaging 10 hours) for outside and other
broadcasts of a special character. In the course of a year, the service broadcasts
more than 7,000 items on a national network, made up of studio productions,
outside broadcasts, films, and relays from the continent of Europe.
BBC studio productions come from the London Television Theatre at Shepherd’s
Bush; eight main London studios; and fully equipped regional studios at Man¬
chester, Birmingham, Cardiff, Glasgow, Bristol and Belfast. In addition, eight
small interview studios (used mainly for short insertions into the news) have been
established in London, Scotland, Wales, and in the north, midland and west of
England regions. The Television Film Department of the BBC is housed at the
Ealing film studios; and Television News and newsreel programmes originate from
a specially equipped studio at Alexandra Palace, London. The studios at the
Television Centre in London (which has been specifically designed for television
purposes) will start coming into use in 1961.
Outside broadcasting (which during the year i957—5^ transmitted nearly 1,000
programmes, providing about 18 per cent of the total BBC television output)
covers most parts of the United Kingdom with its mobile units, presenting
SOUND AND TELEVISION BROADCASTING 463
programmes both of national and of specifically regional interest, and also brings
scenes of events in Europe to viewers in the United Kingdom.
The first regular independent television (ITV) service was inaugurated in
September 1955, by a programme transmission from the ITA London station at
Beaulieu Heights, Croydon. By 1958, programmes were being transmitted for 50
hours a week, with permitted extensions averaging a further 10 hours a week, from
7 stations in all parts of Great Britain, and approximately three-quarters of the total
number of homes with television sets were able to receive ITV.
ITV programmes are produced at modern studio centres in London, Birming¬
ham, Manchester, Glasgow, Cardiff, Southampton and Newcastle. The establish¬
ment of these studios is the direct result of the ITA’s policy of encouraging the
development of regional television, and the programmes are either for local broad¬
casting or for transmission to one or more of the other regions through the link
system operated by the Authority, which, at the beginning of 1958, consisted of
959 miles of vision links, about 69 per cent of which were two-way circuits.
Generally speaking, both the BBC and the ITV services provide programmes
of music, drama, light entertainment, variety, and films. Broadcasts for schools are
produced on five days in the week both by the BBC and by Associated-Rediffusion
Ltd. under contract with the ITA. Religious broadcasting is also a feature of both
services, as are programmes on the arts, children’s and family programmes, inter¬
views with outstanding personalities, investigations into matters of public interest,
news reports covering international, national and local events, and outside broad¬
casts, mainly of sport.
Advertising is altogether excluded from the television programmes of the BBC,
as from their sound programmes. The ITA broadcasts advertisements (on which
the programme companies depend for their revenue) subject to the relevant pro¬
visions in the Television Act, namely, that there should be no sponsoring of
programmes by advertisers, that all advertisements should be clearly distinguishable
as such and recognisably separate from the rest of the programme, and that the
amount of time given to advertising should not be so great as to detract from the
value of the programmes as a medium of entertainment, instruction and informa¬
tion. The ITA has also agreed rules with the Postmaster General about certain
classes of broadcasts (including, in particular, religious services) in which advertise¬
ments may not be inserted and, on the advice of the Advertising Advisory Com¬
mittee, has drawn up certain ‘principles for television advertising’ with a view to
the exclusion of misleading advertisements from the programmes broadcast by the
Authority. The cost of inserting advertisements in the ITA service is borne by the
advertisers, who pay the programme companies for advertising time.
Wire Broadcasting
Wire broadcasting—a system whereby radio programmes are received at a central
point, whence they are distributed by wire to listeners and viewers began in the
United Kingdom in 1925 as a private venture and remains in the hands of private
enterprise. Wire broadcasting companies operate under licence from the Postmaster
General. They are not allowed to originate programmes of their own, and their
function is to distribute programmes from general broadcasting stations. A specified
minimum of their programme material must be taken from BBC sources. Sub¬
scribers to wire broadcasting services must have ordinary broadcast receiving
licences. At the beginning of 1958, there were 411 wire broadcasting services, of
which 105 gave television service and the remainder sound-only service. The
number of subscribers at that date was just over one million, including 108,019
who were receiving television services.
464 BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Audience Research
Audience research, as conducted by the BBC, is carried on by interviewing, each
day, some 4,000 people throughout the country (a sample or cross-section of the
public) to ascertain what programmes they have heard or viewed on the preceding
day, and by means of listening and viewing panels, the members of which are
volunteers, who are prepared to answer questions about the programmes they
normally hear or see. Trends in public taste, which cannot be discovered by an
examination of the results of interviews and of the reports of the panels, are the
concern of a special section of the BBC’s Audience Research Department, which
also carries out general surveys.
Audience research is carried out on behalf of independent television by two
independent research organisations: the A. C. Nielsen Co. Ltd., and Television
Audience Measurement Limited.
Scientific Research
Research into the technical problems of broadcasting is carried out by the
scientific and engineering staffs of the BBC, the Post Office and the radio industry
in order to improve the technical facilities of broadcasting and thus to increase
its efficiency.
Colour television has been, and still is, one of the main interests of the BBC
Research Department which, following some years of laboratory work, began a
series of experimental transmissions in colour from the London Television Station
in 1955; the latest six-months series of tests ended in April 1958. The results of these
transmissions have been communicated to the Television Advisory Committee
which the Postmaster General appointed to advise him, inter alia, on the whole
field of development of colour television.
The BBC has also been conducting experiments on a new system of recording
television pictures on magnetic tape. The equipment produced for this operation,
known as Vision Electronic Recording Apparatus (VERA), was publicly demon¬
strated in April 1958, and has since been installed in the Lime Grove studio centre,
where it is being given a thorough service trial.
Other subjects of research undertaken by the BBC have been: the improvement
of studio acoustics, microphones and loud speakers; the long-distance propagation
effect of high and low power transmissions; the development of a mobile unit—known
as the Roving Eye—for outside broadcasting, which contains television cameras and
all the equipment needed to operate them, together with VHP transmitters, and
which can be operated, if necessary, from a moving vehicle; and methods of increas¬
ing national coverage both in sound and television by such means as the sharing of
frequencies between stations in different parts of the United Kingdom, the
construction of transmitting aerials having special horizontal radiation patterns,
and the development of a ‘satellite’ transmitter of very low power for providing a
television service to small and isolated communities.
International Relations
The BBC is an active member and the ITA, together with the Independent
Television Programme Companies Association, is an associate member of the
European Broadcasting Union. The Union, which now has 27 active members
among the broadcasting organisations in the European zone (and 16 associate
members mostly from outside Europe, including the United States of America
and many of the nations of the Commonwealth) meets every year to exchange views
and information, and to study common problems in the programme, technical
SOUND AND TELEVISION BROADCASTING 465
and legal fields. It also maintains a Technical Monitoring Station, where frequency
measurements and other observations on broadcasting stations can be carried out.
Within the Commonwealth, the BBC is closely associated with the broadcasting
organisations of the other member countries and of the dependent territories. As
a result of a decision to achieve still closer co-operation taken at the third Common¬
wealth Broadcasting Conference in 1956, the BBC joined with the Australian Broad¬
casting Commission, the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, and the Rank Organi¬
sation in establishing the British Commonwealth International Newsfilm News
Agency Trust. This joint enterprise provides, through an associated non-profit-
making company (the British Commonwealth International Newsfilm News
Agency Limited), a reliable service of international news on film for subscribers
anywhere in the world who operate television services, produce cinematograph
newsreels or acquire newsfilm for any other purposes, including education.
The BBC also participates in the work of the International Telecommunication
Union (ITU)—the United Nations specialised agency responsible for the regulation
and control of all international telecommunication services (including sound and
television), for the allocation and registration of all radio frequencies, and (through
its International Radio Consultative Committee) for the promotion and co¬
ordination of the international study of technical radio problems. In addition, the
BBC has long-established relations with the United Nations Radio Division, with
the United Nations Educational and Scientific Organisation, and with the Council
of Europe.
Eurovision
As well as taking part in the exchange of sound radio programmes arranged
between the member countries of the European Broadcasting Union (EBU), the
BBC is a regular contributor to the network of European television (Eurovision).
This network now includes twelve Western European member countries; the
exchange of television programmes between them is arranged by the EBU, which
maintains an International Television Co-ordination Centre (Eurovision) in
Brussels. To facilitate programme exchanges on the Eurovision network a perma¬
nent television link, operating in either direction between London and the Conti¬
nent, is being constructed by the Post Office. The range of Eurovision is steadily
increasing as countries expand their networks and facilities, and new countries
participate.
XV. THE PRESS
The British Press caters for all political views, different levels of education and a
wide range of interests. It is free from Government censorship and interference.
The British public buys more newspapers per person than any other in the world.
It has been estimated (by UNESCO) that for every 1,000 inhabitants of the United
Kingdom 609 copies of daily papers are sold every day. Next comes Sweden with
506 per 1,000 inhabitants. Circulation figures of individual newspapers are propor¬
tionately high. The Sunday News of the World, which reached a circulation of over
8 million copies, and the average circulation of which has recently (January to end-
June 1958) been 6,767,348, holds the world’s record for the circulation of a news¬
paper1; and seven of the daily morning newspapers have circulations in the millions.
These high figures are largely explained by the fact that the London morning
papers have ‘national’ circulations, i.e. they are distributed throughout the British
Isles, being available on the day of publication everywhere except in a few outlying
islands.
Britain imports half its newsprint requirements, while the other half is made
from imported raw materials. A Government-controlled rationing scheme was in
operation from 1940 until the end of 1956, when the Newsprint Supply Company
took over responsibility for the distribution of supplies; from 1st January, 1959,
newspaper offices will have to make their own arrangements for the provision of
newsprint. The average size of London national morning papers, which was from
four to six pages during the second world war and the immediate post-war period,
is now from 10 to 20 pages.
Prices of daily newspapers vary from z jtd. (for the majority of papers) to 4d. (for
The Times).
According to The Newspaper Press Directory2 there are some 150 daily and Sun¬
day newspapers: 16 London mornings, 3 London evenings, 11 London Sundays;
19 mornings, 65 evenings and 3 Sundays in England outside London; 1 morning
and 3 evenings in Wales; 7 mornings, 8 evenings and 2 Sundays in Scotland; 3
mornings and 1 evening in Northern Ireland; 1 Isle of Man daily; and 1 morning
and 2 evenings in the Channel Islands.
There are some 1,300 weekly papers published in Greater London and almost
every sizable town in the rest of the country. These papers deal mainly with news
of interest to the region where they are sold. There are also the sporting papers,
papers in foreign languages for groups of nationals of other lands resident in Britain,
and religious papers.
In 1947, a Royal Commission on the Press was appointed to inquire into the
finance, control, management and ownership of the British Press. Its report was
issued in June 1949 [Cmd. 77°°) and has been recognised as a comprehensive and
authoritative analysis. Among other recommendations it suggested the establish¬
ment of a General Council of the Press and this was set up in 1953 (see p. 473).
The only higher circulation is that of the BBC’s weekly, Radio Times, the average
sale of which, for the same period, was 7>953>599 copies a week.
2 Changes in the number of newspapers occur constantly; figures are based on the 1958
edition of The Newspaper Press Directory, published early in 1958.

The Commission found that the British Press ‘is completely independent of
outside financial interests and that its policy is the policy of those that conduct it’;
there was evidence that the direct influence of advertisers on policy was ‘negligible’.
After studying management and ownership, the Commission concluded that ‘there
is nothing approaching monopoly in the Press as a whole, or ... in any class of
newspaper’.
Ownership
As Table 42 shows, several companies or groups own a number of newspapers.
The five largest press groups are: Associated Newspapers Limited, which, with
four London papers, owns through subsidiary companies linked under the manage¬
ment of Northcliffe Newspapers Group Limited a total of nine dailies and nine
weeklies in the provinces; Kemsley Newspapers Limited, which owns eleven dailies,
five weeklies, and four Sundays; Westminster Press Group, which controls nine
dailies and 38 weeklies; Provincial Newspapers Limited, which owns four dailies
and 20 weeklies; and the Harmsworth Group, which owns four dailies and ten
weeklies in the West country.
Groups also exist in the periodical press; among the best known are the Amalga¬
mated Press, which publishes some 50 general, women’s and children’s papers (the
affiliated Associated Uiffe Press has 39 trade, technical and specialised journals);
the George Newnes group, which publishes 57 journals (general, specialised, trade
THE PRESS
469
and technical); Odhams Press, Limited, which (in addition to two newspapers)
publishes about 19 periodicals, including some with very high circulations;
Hulton Press Limited, which publishes fewer titles but whose magazines have
very large circulations; and the Thomson-Leng group, the largest publishers
of magazines in Scotland (see p. 471).
Certain newspapers and periodicals are controlled by trustees whose aim is to
preserve the character and traditions of the paper and prevent control from falling
into unsuitable hands. Various forms of trust govern the direction of The Times,
Manchester Guardian, News Chronicle and Star, Observer, Economist, Spectator
and New Statesman.
The ‘National’ Press
Ten morning papers with headquarters in London, and one in Manchester,
are ‘national’ in the sense of circulating throughout the British Isles, and there are
11 ‘national’ Sunday papers (see Table 42). In addition, the leading Scottish papers
(see below) circulate widely, and certain specialised daily papers also have a circula¬
tion not limited by region, e.g., Lloyd's List and Shipping Gazette and Sporting
Life. The three London evening papers each have affiliations with one of the
national dailies, but they draw their readership very largely from people living
within fifty miles of London.
Provincial Newspapers
The provincial newspapers, numbering nearly a hundred morning or evening
dailies and Sunday papers and nearly 1,000 weeklies, provide the general and local
news expected by readers whose daily life and interests are known to, and shared
by, the newspaper staff. Some 60 provincial papers still in existence were founded
before 1800; the oldest being Berrow's Worcester Journal, dating back to 1709.
With a few exceptions (e.g., Yorkshire Post, Newcastle Journal, Northern Echo,
Sheffield Telegraph, Western Mail) they reflect no definite political tendency. The
total circulation of the dailies is estimated at about 9 million and of the weeklies
at about 12 million. Among the provincial dailies, the Newcastle Journal, the
Northern Echo and the Yorkshire Post have circulations of well over 100,000;
the Sheffield Telegraph, about 95,000; the Birmingham Post and the Liverpool
Daily Post, over 70,000; two provincial Sunday papers—the Sunday Sun
(Newcastle upon Tyne) owned by Kemsley Newspapers, and the Sunday Mercury,
owned by a subsidiary company of the Birmingham Post and Mail Limited each
have circulations of over 200,000; while, among evening papers, the Liverpool
Echo has a circulation of over 355,000 and the Manchester Evening News of over
330,000. The provincial newspaper, often read far more thoroughly than the
national daily, is a valuable medium for national and local advertising.
London suburban weeklies, of which there are about 90, are closer to the pro¬
vincial weeklies than to the national dailies in readership and appeal.
Ownership of the provincial Press is varied: it includes individual owners, two
or more partner proprietors, local printing and publishing firms, newspaper com¬
panies owning between one and half a dozen papers, or press groups controlling a
chain of newspapers in different parts of the country.
Scotland
Scotland has seven morning, eight evening and two Sunday newspapers. The
Glasgow Herald, founded in 1783, and The Scotsman, founded in 1817 and a
daily since 1855, published in Edinburgh, are among the organs influencing
serious opinion in Great Britain. The circulation of the former is 75>^S3 sod of the

BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
latter 58,550 (average figures January to end-June 1958). Other morning papers
are The Daily Record, The Bulletin (a picture paper), The Courier and Advertiser,
and The Press and Journal (and Scottish editions of the Daily Express and Daily
Mail). Glasgow, Edinburgh, Dundee and Aberdeen are the centres of publication.
Evening papers include the Edinburgh Evening News and Evening Dispatch, Glas¬
gow’s Evening Times and Evening Citizen, Dundee’s Evening Telegraph and Post,
Aberdeen’s Evening Express, and the Paisley Daily Express and the Greenock
Telegraph. The Sunday papers are the Sunday Mail, the Scottish Sunday Express,
and the Sunday Post.
Among the weekly papers are the Weekly Scotsman and The People’s Journal,
which also circulate outside Scotland; in all there are about 163 weekly papers
published in Scottish towns.
Northern Ireland
Northern Ireland has three morning papers and one evening paper, all printed
in Belfast: they are Belfast News-Letter, Northern Whig, Irish News and Belfast
Telegraph. There are 46 weekly newspapers in Northern Ireland, including one
published three times a week and one published twice a week. There is also a sporting
paper, Ireland’s Saturday Night, published each Saturday afternoon (Belfast). The
majority are published by individual companies and all the counties have good
coverage of local papers. There are no Sunday newspapers.
Wales
One daily morning newspaper, the Western Mail, a Kemsley newspaper, is
printed and published in Cardiff; it has a circulation of over 93,000, mainly in the
southern half of Wales. In North Wales, the Liverpool Daily Post gives wide cover¬
age to events in the area. Evening papers published in Wales are the South Wales
Echo, Cardiff, the South Wales Daily Argus, Newport, and the South Wales Evening
Post, Swansea. North Wales is served by the Liverpool Echo and the Liverpool
Evening Express and to a smaller extent by evening papers published in Manchester,
the Manchester Evening News and the Manchester Evening Chronicle.
Since October 1954, a special Welsh edition of the Empire News and Sunday
Chronicle has been printed in Cardiff. Other national Sunday papers carry columns
of news on Welsh affairs.
The weekly press includes 48 weekly papers in English, some of them carrying
articles in Welsh; nine bilingual papers; and twelve papers in Welsh, of which five
are denominational papers.
Channel Islands and Isle of Man
The Channel Islands have one morning paper (Guernsey Star), two evening
papers, one twice-weekly and two weeklies. The Isle of Man has one daily, a special
weekly edition of which is published on Saturday, and four other weeklies.
Periodicals
Weekly, monthly and quarterly journals cover an enormous field. Salient features
of the last twenty-five years have been the development of periodicals with a mass
appeal and the growth of the trade and technical Press. There are over 3,500 periodi¬
cal publications: general magazines with circulations ranging up to over a million;
women’s magazines, some of which have even larger circulations; numerous
publications for children; religious periodicals of various denominations; magazines
dealing with sports, hobbies, fiction and humour; periodicals specialising in various
subjects such as politics, finance and economics, science, the professions, and the
THE PRESS
471
arts; the large body of trade and technical publications, whose circulations are not
confined to the United Kingdom; and the journals of learned societies, trade unions,
business houses, regiments, universities, colleges, schools, and other associations.
Some popular periodicals, such as Reveille, Weekend, Tit-Bits, and John Bull
(which became John Bull and Illustrated in October 1958) have circulations (January
to June 1958) varying from over 2 million to over 900,000 copies. Six women’s
weeklies have circulations of over a million, Woman having nearly 3^ million buyers;
a monthly, Woman and Home, also sells over a million copies of each issue.
Of considerable influence, although their circulations are only in the tens of
thousands, are the weeklies dealing with political, social and economic affairs:
The Economist, which covers topics of the day from a far wider angle than its title
would indicate and is politically independent; The New Statesman, a review of
politics, literature and the arts with an independent socialist political tendency;
The Spectator, which covers much the same subjects and is non-party; Time and
Tide, which has a right-wing tendency; and Tribune, with a left-wing but strongly
anti-communist bias. Other papers whose circulations are in the tens of thousands
are the illustrated weeklies such as The Illustrated London News, The Sphere, The
Field, and Country Life, while Punch is the leading humour periodical. The reader-
ship of all these weeklies is greater than is apparent from their circulation figures,
since they are widely read in libraries, clubs and other institutions.
Monthly and quarterly journals, generally speaking, appeal to the more serious
type of reader, particularly the literary and political journals and those specialising
in international and Commonwealth affairs.
In addition to the circulation of periodicals published in England, Wales has had,
since 1957, its own farming weekly, the Welsh Farm News.
Four monthly illustrated periodicals are published in Scotland: Scottish Field,
Scotland's Magazine, the Scots Magazine (founded 1739) and Scotland', and two
weeklies devoted to farming interests, Farming News and the Scottish Farmer.
Among literary journals, probably the most famous is Blackwood’s, published in
Edinburgh. Popular magazines are numerous: the Thomson-Leng group of Dundee
alone distributes about 10 million copies of weeklies in the British Isles and abroad.
In Northern Ireland, weekly, monthly and quarterly publications cover farming,
the linen industry, building, motoring and politics.
News Agencies
There are three principal British news agencies:
Reuters Ltd., a world agency with some 40 offices abroad and correspondents in
almost all the world’s capitals, which distributes foreign and Commonwealth news
to British newspapers, and foreign and British news to over 3,000 papers outside
Britain. It is owned by the British Press (through the Press Association and the
Newspaper Proprietors’ Association) and two Commonwealth news agencies, the
Australian Associated Press and the New Zealand Press Association. All profits are
used to develop the service.
Press Association Ltd., which distributes home news. It is owned by British
provincial newspapers. All profits are used to develop the service.
Exchange Telegraph Company Ltd., a public company which distributes home
news to British papers and other subscribers.
Two other agencies supply a general service of overseas news:
Associated Press, which is a branch of the Associated Press of America.
British United Press, which is a Canadian subsidiary of the United Press
Association of America.

BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
There are also some 60 United Kingdom, Commonwealth and foreign agencies
and news services with offices in London, specialising in various aspects of
newspaper and periodical requirements.
Training for Journalism
Until recently, and this therefore applies to most newspapermen working today,
journalists were, broadly, of two classes: those who entered newspaper offices on
leaving school and worked their way up, learning by experience; and university
graduates who held some of the specialised posts, such as correspondents abroad
or on special subjects, leader-writers and editorial office staff. The second class has
always been comparatively small. The Kemsley Newspaper Group made provision
for combining instruction with the practice of journalism, and courses in journalism
were organised by the London Polytechnic, and by King’s College, London (until
the outbreak of war in 1939).
In 1952 an agreement was reached for a more comprehensive plan for the training
and education of junior journalists in newspaper offices. A National Council for
the Training of Journalists, on which are representatives of the principal press
organisations, administers the scheme, which is based on the voluntary co-operation
of newspaper offices. Examinations are taken at two levels, the lower being a general
proficiency test which may be taken only after three years of active journalism, the
higher, a diploma, which is awarded after further examination and submission of a
thesis.
Press Institutions
Both employers and employees in the industry are well organised. On the
employers’ side, the most important organisations are the Newspaper Proprietors’
Association, whose members are proprietors of London (national) daily and Sunday
newspapers; the Newspaper Society, whose members are proprietors of provincial
daily and weekly newspapers in England and Wales; the Scottish Daily Newspaper
Society; the Scottish Newspaper Proprietors’ Association; the Belfast Newspaper
Society; the Publishers’ Group, Irish Master Printers’ Association (Northern
Alliance), whose members are the proprietors of weekly newspapers in Northern Ire¬
land ; and the Periodical Proprietors’ Association, whose membership embraces the
independent publishers of trade and technical publications and general magazines.
On the employees’ side there are the Institute of Journalists (loj)—the National Asso¬
ciation of Journalists until 1889—incorporated by Royal Charter in 1890, and the
National Union of Journalists (NUJ), founded in 1907. The National Union of
Journalists has a membership of about 14,500 working journalists; editors who
have powers of dismissal are excluded from full membership but may be associate
members. The Institute of Journalists, which has a membership of some 2,700,
admits editors. Free-lance journalists (who are not on the staff of any one paper
or group of papers but send contributions to any journal) may belong to the NUJ
or loj. The aims of these organisations are the improvement of the economic status
of journalists, the promotion of their professional welfare, and the safeguarding of
the status of the Press and its editorial staffs.
The aims of the Guild of British Newspaper Editors are, inter alia, to sustain
the dignity of editorship, to raise and safeguard the professional status of editors,
to protect the rights and freedom of the Press, and to improve the education and
training of junior journalists: the Guild has over 300 members.
The Typographical Association, in the provinces, and the London Typographical
Society, in London, are the principal craft unions organising such workers as
compositors and machine minders. The National Union of Printing, Bookbinding
THE PRESS
473
and Paper Workers is principally concerned with the publishing and distribution
side, and the National Society of Operative Printers and Assistants (NATSOPA)
includes machine assistants, clerical workers and general assistants in printing
works. These unions cover the printing industry generally.
The General Council of the Press
Following the recommendations of the Royal Commission on the Press, a Press
Council representative of the various Press organisations was set up in 1953. Its
aims are:
to preserve the established freedom of the British Press;
to maintain the character of the British Press in accordance with the highest
professional and commercial standards;
to keep under review any developments likely to restrict the supply of informa¬
tion of public interest and importance;
to promote and encourage methods of recruitment, education and training of
journalists;
to promote a proper functional relation among all sections of the profession;
to promote technical and other research;
to study developments in the British Press which may tend towards greater
concentration or monopoly; and
to publish periodical reports recording its own work and reviewing from time
to time the various developments in the British Press and the factors
affecting them.
The Council consists of eight editorial representatives, four nominees of the
National Union of Journalists, three nominees of the Institute of Journalists, and
ten managerial representatives.
The Press and the Law
The Press in Britain has the same freedom as the individual to do and say what
it likes provided it does not transgress the law; and in general it enjoys very great
liberty of comment on matters of public interest. There are no special press laws
(other than those relating to such matters as the registration of newspapers), but
requirements which affect the Press occur in a variety of Acts of Parliament; for
example, the admission of the Press to meetings of local authorities is regulated by
the Local Government Acts, and restrictions on the reporting of domestic
proceedings and proceedings concerning juveniles are imposed by legislation
governing procedure in the law courts.
In particular, the Press must comply with the copyright laws and with the laws
against the publication of matters covered by the Official Secrets Acts, with the
laws of seditious libel, blasphemous and obscene libel, and defamation, with the
laws for the protection of children from publications which might do them moral
harm, and against fraudulent advertising, against breach of parliamentary privilege,
and against ‘contempt of court’—publication of anything affecting a case before
the courts which might tend to influence the result of the trial, or of comment on
court proceedings which might tend to prejudice their reputation for fairness.
Legal proceedings against the Press are infrequent; the majority of such actions
as do take place are brought by private individuals seeking to protect their own
interests, for example, against libel. In such cases, the editor, proprietor, publisher,
printer and distributor of the newspaper, as well as the author of the article, may
all be held responsible.
